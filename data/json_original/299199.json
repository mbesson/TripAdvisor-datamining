As a Platinuim Ambassdor i was upgraded to a junior suite which was very comfortable (great bed) but i must say the room was in need of being modernised as it is now a bit old fashioned but i beleive the hotel is working through a renovation programme at the moment.

While I have only stayed here once (and I came wanting to like the place) I have learnt enough to doubt whether I would consider returning. In principle there is quite a bit to like about this hotel. It is in a tasteful building with a pretty lobby (although not immediately at the vehicular entry to the hotel) and is attached to the charismatic Bugis Junction shopping centre (with classical Singaporean shopfronts in airconditioned comfort as well as an MRT station). Sadly the finishing touches are what are lacking. The rooms feel cramped and the views (even on high floors) feel industrial and constraining. Although there are Elemis toiletries in the bathrooms, and a pleasant fruit bowl is provided on arrival, the installations seem tired. Wait staff, although doing their job technically adequately, were tired and disinterested. Service in fact was often brusque. I was interrogated for sitting in the lobby without ordering a drink (I understand there must be problems with flow-over from the shopping centre, but I was reasonably well-dressed and the majority of tables were empty). After late check-out was granted I was called three times in the hour before the agreed time asking whether I was ready to check out yet. The check-in staff were unwelcoming and disconnected - and while I admit bias in that my Priority Club Gold status yielded absolutely no upgrades or concessions (which is their entitlement), my friend (who is Priority Club Platinum and a member of the Ambassador program as well) got an upgrade in name only (his room was exactly the same) and was denied access to the club lounge. If you can't please that kind of customer with what they would consider basics then you have got problems. All in all it certainly does not make a compelling argument to return. While it isn't a four star hotel, frankly in this price range it should be doing much better.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cProfessional Service with a smile\u201d", "Author": "Richard1242", "ReviewID": "UR128027798", "Content": "We stayed at the Intercontinental on the advice of our travel advisor in Penang ( thanks Gillian at Friendship Travel ) and what good advice.

The whole staff in the Club Lounge dedicated themselves to giving world class service,professionally but with a great smile. Nothing was too much trouble and each time you finished a drink the next one was at your elbow. Although we hadn't said anything the staff came out with a birthday cake for my wife and sang to her.

What really ruins the experience though is the whole massive palaver surrounding internet connectivity. It costs S$140 PER DAY for two people sharing a room to use the internet. I do realize this sounds insane, but unfortunately it's true. Rates clearly specify S$30.57 PER DEVICE per day (+ 17% service charges and taxes). Since 95% of people in 2012 traveling on business and staying in hotel chains like this have both laptop and smartphone, that's 4 devices per room or S$140 per day. Does anyone think this is a reasonable policy? Seriously? On top of the S$300 room rate? The backpacker's hostel across the street charges S$18 per night, and somehow they manage to provide free internet. The hotel bar claims free internet but when I sat down and ordered a beer, then got out my laptop, it didn't work. 2 managers, 3 IT guys, and 30 minutes later, it still didn't work. I went outside across the street to a dive bar with grease on the floor and cheap beer, and within 1 minute had a perfect, free connection. I could review the great location, the lovely showerhead and pressure, the nice lack of pretension, plentiful taxis, convenient MRT, and useful pool. I could, but I cannot. Because all I can remember of this visit really is the fact that for 4 full days I was out of touch with my business, and/or spent my mornings roaming the side streets, laptop in hand, looking for a wifi signal. We have just opened a business in Singapore, almost right across the street. We do and will have 3-4 people per month coming and staying 3-4 days per visit. I would give these 16 room nights every month to the Intercon. Would love to. But I can't. Why? Because our company can't afford S$2,240 per month in internet charges.

Bathroom had separate sinks, standing rain shower and bathtub. Room was not very spacious but everything is new and in working condition. We had 2 free pieces of laundry every day and forgot to retrieve a handkerchief from a pocket on our last day of stay and they did it for us fast and efficient and free of charge. Overall, very enjoyed the stay. Service was good. Breakfast at Olive Tree is commendable. Drinks at lobby lounge quite worth it too. Just a few points to note: 1-Ceiling in bathroom a bit low and there was a huge chandelier dangling from the ceiling. I always bang my hand against the chandelier. Perhaps changing that huge chandelier to something less space-consuming to make the whole bathroom look more spacious. 2-There's a lot of locals wandering and walking around the lobby. As the hotel is connected to the mall, a lot of shoppers step in for tea, food, washroom breaks etc. The lobby can get quite packed during the weekends and majority of them aren't guests. However, the hotel did a good job in keeping things organised. They had staff standing at the corridors guiding and offering to help (and I think perhaps also as a way to step up on security). Would have liked to see more security features since the lobby is too easily accessible by non-guests. 3-The shophouse room is rather unique but unfortunately a long walk from the elevators. We had to scale steps up and down and cross a corridor (that spans across the mall) which is a hassle everytime when we come back from shopping.

Also try to see Jurong Park, we went to Universal Studios (not a big deal, would probably skip that), you can see Universal Studios somewhere else besides Singapore. Check out the Marina Bar Sands hotel, okay so here is the deal on that. It costs money to go to the top floor to take pictures, ask if you can go to the lounge on the top floor for a drink. Then you don't have to pay, we actually went to the lounge, it was way too loud and busy, we took some pictures and then left. Best way to see it!!! Also check out the mall, especially the Louis Vitton store, that is just an experience itself!!!!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DUBLIN", "Title": "\u201cgreat location good service\u201d", "Author": "alzo", "ReviewID": "UR126397625", "Content": "my wife and i were in singapore for a cruise and were having a pre night stay ,the hotel has a certain old world charm and is located a very short distance from raffels hotel,located about 20 min walk is clarke quay which is worth a visit in the late evening very nice to walk around.

There was a lobby ambassador, Peter, who assisted us way beyond what we expected. When we asked him for some information about a certain location, he would go and googlemap our intended location. In fact, at some point, I dissappeared to the ladies room that when my husband wondered where I was, he was able to tell him where I headed to! The concierge was very helpful, giving us hints on the restaurants we wanted to go to. From the professional and friendly registration staff to the wait staff in the restaurant, they bent over backwards to make our stay memorable. The best congee I had, no disrespect to Anthony Bourdain, was not in any hawker's pavillion but in the InterCon restaurant. It was the right consistency and oh so comforting! Our room was very nice, clean, and we had a nice view. Singapore was celebrating a 12-day Chinese New Year that I was able to watch some fireworks from the window. Singapore is clean, nice, and its citizens are proud of their city state. I do not blame them! The InterContinental was centrally located and we took a taxi all over. We also used the on-off bus to tour the city state. We visited hawker's pavillions, as we saw in Anthony's show :), and my husband delighted on being able to eat most of the recommended food. We ate the famed chili crabe at the Jumbo restaurant and it was worth the travel! We also ate traditional Indian food at the Little India, restaurant called Banana Leaf.

But everything you expect from an InterContinental. Bit old fashioned, but extremely well kept with the fresh smell of wood polish throughout the place. If you know the InterContinental Grand Stanford Hong Kong, you will know what to expect. Larger rooms, but less cozy. As IC-Ambassador we were upgraded from the standard deluxe 38m2 to a 55m2 junior suite. The membership extra's make it a decent loyalty program. In Singapore you will find rooms which are much more hip or luxurious, but these IC rooms just seem to work by intuition. Great beds. And you're here for a good sleep aren't you. And there is a full ironing board in the room. When you arrive by MRT from the airport (it looks like a direct line, but you will have to make a platform change at the second station from the airport), you will find the signposting to the hotel not very clear. And it's not an easy walk through the mall with all that luggage. Next time we will take the taxi like we did on the way back. The location is not the best in town, but it's above the MRT and we did walk most of our destinations like Raffles City, Marina Square and Orchard Road. Two bus lines bring you straight back to the hotel from Orchard or again, take the taxi (SGD 4,00 from Raffles City, SGD 5,00 from Orchard and Sands, evening surcharges excluded). The pool is also not the best in town. But it's large and relaxing enough. No pool service, but pool towels and staff available on call. Good pool beds. The extremely high price for WIFI (over SGD 30,00 a day) is disappointing. Not even complementary for Ambassadors. It would be a reason to choose an other hotel. The hotel says it is concerned with mother nature. Why putting all those lights on after turndown service? Please stop this! At check-out our bill was not accurate. Causing some commotion. I had to prove the right room rate with a print out of my reservation. They missed my 50 USD food and beverage credit. Check your bill carefully. Breakfast is ok but expensive. Egg service is slow and they did forget my order twice and on both days we took breakfast at the hotel. If breakfast is not included, you might want to try the bakery at the National Library opposite the hotel where you can sit outside. The IC is a decent hotel to stay. No wows, just traditional good rooms and service. Hope they will give some more attention to details (like they do in Hong Kong) and I might give it a five star rating again.

To begin, I would like to echo the statements on here about the hotel being in a great location and the hard product (building / furnishings / fittings) of the property being of a high standard - this is very true. Unfortunately, my stay here was marred by 5 significant service failings. 1. Attempt to extort further payment at check-in On check-in, although holding a confirmed reservation and rate for 3 people in a room (the reservation conformation clearly stated this), we were advised that we would have to pay an extra fee ( from memory appox $150 over the duration of the stay) above and beyond the confirmed amount. The check in staff would not budge on this so I had to ask for the manager. The manager 'waived the charge' upon presentation of the e-mail stating 3 guests. During the second day of our stay, a tray of chocolates, a half bottle of wine and a apology letter were delivered to our room. I considered this adequate service recovery and the issue solved nor would have mentioned it again - BUT: 2 Attitude from Bellboys On checking out - as we were three, I asked the doorman to flag as a larger taxi - like a station wagon (to accommodate luggage). We had taken such a vehicle from the airport so were in full knowledge of their existence. As several of these cars came and went from the rank (with the doorman telling us 'this is not our car' & guests who arrived after us taking them, a small mini bus pulled up. After loading our luggage (3 or so doormen helped) I gave the apparent lead guy an adequate tip for their assistance ($5 each, $15 total). The doorman who closed the door of the van obviously didn't see this - as he stood waiting to close the door he had his hand out in expectation, when we did not give him money directly, he shot a filthy look and slammed the door shut. 3. Car booked (unasked) by Bellman at 5 times the cost of a taxi. At the completion of our journey (from the hotel to the cruise terminal - as somneone who is in singapore a couple of times a month, I know this to be appox a $11 to $15 fare) the driver demanded a $50 payment from us - apparently a standard flat fare for a mini-bus. We questioned the driver about this and he said that the hotel booked it and was in full knowledge of this flat fare - any issues we had, take it up with them. $39 is not a lot of money in any sense - but there is principle at play here. Unfortunately I question the commission taken by the doorman here. 4. Priority Cub Points not given automatically After our stay, weeks later it had not shown up on my PC rewards balance. It took an additional e-mail to PC rewards to have this adjusted. 5. No Reply to e-mail in relation to the above. Over 2 weeks ago I e-mailed customer care at both IHG and the hotel but as of today have had no response. In isolation, each of these issues would be small (or in the case of the check-in, recovered) - but as the sum of their parts they paint a bleak picture of the service standards at this property. On this stay, The Intercontinental Singapore has failed on multiple levels to live up to its service promise and reflected badly on the IHG Brand as a whole.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "HONG KONG", "Title": "\u201cUnbeatable service & location\u201d", "Author": "ggm_hk", "ReviewID": "UR123902255", "Content": "We chose the InterContinental Singapore for our getaway from Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year, as well as for our personal events.

Indeed, every staff at the club lounge offered us a heartwarming service in a professional way.

Thanks to their accurate tips and the hotel's location, we were able to get to those spots very easily. Wherever we go to, this hotel is super-conveniently situated in a core of this garden city. We appreciated its location literally every time we went out & came back. We also liked breakfast served in the club lounge. The stewed prunes seasoned with star anise were my favorite. We tried Olive Tree's buffet breakfast too, however, we still preferred a coziness in the club lounge.

Checked in at the club lounge, and was offered a room upgrade to newly renovated shophouse room at level 2 (same floor as the lounge). Viewed both rooms before deciding to decline the offer, as the room which I booked, although not renovated, was a 50+ sq m junior suite, on high floor in main wing, while the shophouse room was a mere 30+ sq m! How could this be an upgrade beats me. Roomwise, I was happy with the space, as there is a dining table and a sofa lounge. The view overlooked Parkview Square from afar, and the air-conditioned Bugis Junction Mall from below. No unpleasant odours from the somewhat tired looking carpets, and the shower and bath produced sufficient jets of water. There was nightly turn-down service, with bottled water placed at the bedside and slippers at the foot of the bed. It would be great if the hotel could place a piece of chocolate or a bookmark too (as in some other hotels like the Conrad). But nevertheless, the daily cleaning and turn-down service were consistent, except pen and note papers were not replenished after the 2nd day. I have misplaced them and was scrambling to find a pen to jot down some telephone numbers of restaurants. The staff at club lounge were very friendly and helpful. No amount of request was too much for them. On the 1st day, I merely said I like the pineapple tarts and almond cookies which I have sampled during teatime, and would like to purchase them if possible. When I next visited the lounge, the receptionist had already packed 2 jars of the tarts and cookies in a presentation box with the receipt from the Chinese restaurant - how's that for efficiency and thoughtfulness! Breakfast in my opinion is better at the club lounge than the Olive Tree Restaurant downstairs, even though the latter has variety. At the club lounge, Mr Amin the chef prepared eggs in whatever way we need, and is always cheerful and chatty, unlike the buffet breakfast downstairs. The bacon at the club is better and crispier than the ones downstairs too. Overall, this is an above average and decent hotel, with staff greeting you at the corridors and holding the lift for you. The concierge was also very helpful and thoughtful. There was a long queue of people waiting for taxis in the afternoon, and I had wanted to go to the airport. The concierge tried booking a taxi to no avail. When a taxi pulled in at the driveway for a passenger to alight, the concierge kindly allowed me to take the taxi first, beating the long line of queue.

The location is better that you realise. We explore Kampong Glam/ Arab st etc and it is a real gem- I have been telling everyone about this place. The food at the Bushra cafe was so good I am craving it. The little shops that have been created at the bottom have so much character and appeal ( for those who have been to Melbourne it's kinda like an Asian version) so charming and interesting- go there! We walked to Suntec city in less than 10mins. About 15 mins to Little india, really enjoyed that walk as it was very interesting- local businesses, eateries, shops, old buildings etc. 5 mins to Raffles- Robinson department store and Steve Madden, etc, lots of great shopping and a decent food hall up top. I also noticed a reflexology place there too.( that's the only thing I wish Bugis had) There is a market right across the road from the Intercontinental- a great place to pick up cheap bags/clothes/costume jewellery/gifts. And they sell fresh fruit and have juice shops- perfect for the hot day to drink, and so yummy! As you come out the other side of the market you are just a few meters away from the OG department store. Not as upmarket as Tangs, Metro, Robinsons, Taka, but a good mid priced shop- got some excellent priced shoes from there. BHG is the Department store that is next to the hotel and it is not too bad either. Along the lines of OG but a bit more up scale. The ones on Orchard are still my favourite. But as this hotel has an attached MRT it was never a problem. I have stayed on Orchard many times, but the Intercontinental location offers more variety. Took the new line to the Botanical gardens- very easy and enjoyed a wonderful 1/2 day there. The food junction at Bugis was excellent- discovered chicken wings cooked on an open charcoal grill- had to return to eat it again- a group of us want to try and re create it back home. You have to try! Chicken rice was very good, Chendol dessert was sooo cheap. We couldn't get over the prices- 2 kilo weight gain in 4 days!!!

I think some hotels dont quite get the idea of what Afternoon tea is really about and put all kinds of food out, so this was really welcome. The wine in the evening is also very good and generous given the cost of wine in Singapore. The hotel is joined onto a small shopping mall with excess to MRT.

I had telephoned ahead and booked a shophouse suite with a rollaway for our daughter directly with the hotel. Upon arrival we were shown to our suite but advised we were not able to have a rollaway in the room due to their recent refurbishment (and not having had their official launch of the new rooms) - they were concerned about rollaways knocking the freshly painted walls. We were shown to an alternative room which was larger but non-refurbished (very dated decor & tired furnishings). We were disappointed as we'd made the decision to stay at the intercon based on it being an upgraded room and because of our priority rewards platinum status. Upon advising of our disappointment we were advised to go out for a spot of shopping while they decided what they could do for us. We returned about 2 hours later to be told we were upgraded to an ambassador suite. Whilst the room still had dated decor the size of the suite made up for this fact. Our suite was on the top floor overlooking the national library. The ambassador suite included a master suite, additional powder room, living room, dining area and study/office nook. Hotel service was great, we found the club lounge to be wonderful and the cleanliness of the rooms was of a very high standard. The buffet breakfast downstairs is lovely and adequate. The location was interesting as it is an area we'd never stayed before - the bugis markets & bugis junction mall were worth a visit but nothing amazing. There's an abundance of shops around the area and The hotel is conveniently located metres from the MRT Bugis Station. We caught the MRT to Orchard Rd - it took a change of trains and about 10 minutes travel time but the kids enjoyed the experience. Overall, it's a quality hotel with good staff.

Huge flat screen \u00a0along with separate living room, foyer with wardrobe and safe along with double sink bathroom. Excellent water pressure. Soaking tub was large enough \u00a0 and walk in shower was capable of scalding hot shower with an overhead rain faucet as well as a normal hand spray on the side wall. Not the full on car wash service some places had but it was pretty good. Only one small shelf to put your stuff on if you are like me and don't want to put stuff on the floor.\u00a0 Plugs-not horrible, but ok. No outlets in the bathroom. One next to the bed on the nightstand and the other side was under the nightstand. One strip in the living room next to the desk and one in the LR under the window. A random single outlet was inside a wardrobe next to the safe. Overall ok and much better than some other hotels that left you with nothing for all your electronic stuff and hair care etc. For the ladies, it was not easy setting up shop for your beauty routine since the bathroom counter was so very limited. The only other mirror in the suite was on the back of a door inside a wardrobe. A simple fix for hotel mgmt is to add a mirror next to the desk so ladies can plug all their appliances in and have a chair and mirror to handle their prettiness. :) Room service was fast and pretty good. Not ridiculously overpriced. Room location on floor two was great since it was right down the hall from the club lounge and the access to breakfast and high tea. The service was excellent for us. I don't know why other reviewers chose to rate poorly, but they were all so super kind, always so genuine. A special note goes out to the club lounge attendant Lai Tiefang who went above and beyond for my hubby to find a restaurant amid a bunch of other issues we had. He really tried everything for us and it showed.\u00a0 One small note, internet is not free! It does not say anything on the web connect page like, you now accept this rate etc. etc. or say anything like the cost is X flat rate for 24 hrs. They tried to charge for every time you logged in. That could be 20 times in one day just for two people! Even ambassador didn't get us free internet like the other Interconti's. Christmas dinner at their hotel ended up being somewhat of a letdown. I guess we expected a bit more. Live and learn. The room was conveniently overlooking the Bugis mall... A weird and different experience, but was actually super convenient. Noise was not excessive and didn't stop us from sleeping at all hours.\u00a0 Hop on hop off tour bus was truly across the street and loved it. So easy.

However, Intercontinental Singapore fell short in many aspects and customer service is a grave concern. During my check in (supposingly to be treated better since I am a gold member using the Priority Club lane exclusively for Gold and Elite), I was dumbfounded by the question raised by the front liner 'You are visiting Singapore for Christmas? Why? There is nothing in Singapore...It is so crowded'. I was speechless and I thought I should head back home. My room wasn't ready (2pm) and was requested to return after 30 minutes. When I returned after 45 minutes, was told to wait again and return after 15 minutes. The front liner wasn't apologetic. I wasn't angry that the room is still not prepared but I hate broken promises. I hate promises which cannot be delivered. I came back 30 minutes later, she recognized me and instantly just hand over the room key card to me. No smile, no sorry, no explaination. Nothing. She didnt even explain to me where is the lift or how I should go to my room. She didnt even tell me what is my room number - I have to read myself. How can you beat that for poor customer service? On one morning, hung the 'please service my room' tag on the door when I left at 10.30 am and upon returning at 3.30pm. the housekeeping was in progress and requested to wait for 10 minutes. I would think this is highly inefficient. In general, do not expect warmess and friendliness from the staff - not from those manning the gym, doing housekeeping or the porter. Location wise, although a short distance from Orchard, the hotel is approximately 10 minutes walk from Bugis MRT station. The adjacent Bugis Junction (shopping mall) is convenient for shopping and food. The hotel, room and gym facilities are a bit dated and definitely a no match compared to the newer hotels in Singapore.

Located adjecent to one of the smaller shopping centers (Bugis Junction), it offers everything you need in walking distance: Small shops, restaurants, bars, food stalls - and if you want to walk 10 minutes or more you reach the big shopping malls at North Bridge Road. To the far end of Orchard Road one may want to take a cab or the MRT. It is locate din the \"real heart\" of the city, away from the touristic Orchard Road buzz. Rooms: The hotel has actually two different buildings, one is the so called \"Shop House\" which has rooms with a small balcony opening into the shopping plaza of Bugis, which is quite nice (no worries about the noise, it's closed after 10 pm).The building has just two floors and the rooms are ral \"old style\" with wooden floor, dark rose-wood furniture and wooden balkony doors and with old-fashion shutters. It has the charme of maybe 100 years back, but of course all the usual amnetoies and the bathrooms are state-of the art. But - one has to like it, it may not be everyone's taste. The other building is the 25 storey tower, which has the usual modern 5-start business rooms & suites. I sually take the Shop House room, which distinguishes this hotel from most of the other luxury brands in Singapore. Lobby: The lobby is a highlight, it opens towards a large coffee-shop area, where live \"lobby music\" is performed and which obviously serves as a meeting place for many business people in Singapore. Leave the lobby to the back-side and you ewnter the marke place of the Bugis junction shopping centre. It's really pleasant and relaxing. Service: I always received excellent service in this hotel, very knowledgeble concierge tips and, whenever possible, early check-in, even at 8 am in the morning. This is outstanding - in other hotels I had at times to wait till 3 pm before getting a room.

So I booked my stay immediately. We just came from Dubai and had a night flight. We so already arrived around 09:00 at the hotel. It was a not very expensive taxi ride but it took us about 25 minutes from Changi to the hotel. When the taxi stopped in front of the entrance, some staff members immediately helped us with our luggage and gave us a luggage tag. We proceeded to the Ambassador check in and checked in with Ms. Rafiqah. She was very friendly and of course also very helpful. We are Priority club platinum and ambassador member and so got a choice between our booked room now, or an upgraded Premier room, actually a Junior suite, in a few hours. We chose for the Premier room and decided to wait but we already checked in. Ms. Rafiqah suggested us to have breakfast in McDonalds or have breakfast in the hotel but it was off course not free of charge. We found it a bit strange in a 5 star hotel to recommend breakfast in a fast food chain restaurant. We did not have breakfast there but went to the concierge, Mr. Hock Kim. I asked him what we could do during 90 minutes because then, normally, our room would be ready. He looked a bit confused and was not so friendly in my eyes. After a while he recommended us to visit the Singapore Flyer, the big London Eye of Singapore. He explained us the way to there and gave us a map. We were tired and unfamiliar with Singapore and the immense pressure and heat there so it took us over 40 minutes by foot to get there. Once we got there we did a tour, which took about 30 minutes for one round. It was something nice to see once but it was air conditioned, very comfortable. We took a taxi back but he did not know where the Intercontinental was, probably for letting us pay extra but after 10 minutes we were back at the hotel and got our room keys from Ms. Rafiqah. She told us our luggage was already in our room. Our room was on the 10th floor, next to the elevators. Our room had a wide door. We had a small entrance in the room with some closets and on the right side was the bathroom. The bathroom had a bath, separate shower, toilet, sink and many toiletries. The shower was leaking some pressure and looked a bit old. Further in the room was a small living room area with couch and some seats. There was also a small table with some welcome gifts as ambassador member. We got three Fiji water bottles, some chocolates, some fruits and also some guides with explanations of typical Singapore fruit but not to forget, all served on very nice decorated plates. To the left was a very big King sized bed and a new LCD TV. Our room had a view on the next doors Bujis Mall. The air conditioning was working correctly and the temperature was good. The only bad thing is I think they dropped my camera bag on the floor a bit to hard because my screen protector was broken. There were many curtains and because we were tired we had a sleep. We forgot to set our alarm clocks and woke up in the evening. The ladies from housekeeping did their turndown service and opened our bed. We took a taxi and had diner in the city. Next morning we had breakfast in the Olive tree restaurant. Mr. Vincent showed us our table. The table was far from the buffet and next to a big closet. It is probably one of the worst tables and even though there were better tables available, he did not give them to us. He was not very friendly and did not offered us any drinks or asked us what we would like to drink. We asked a waiter for a Hot chocolate and received it. It was 50 percent foam and the rest was okay. The buffet is big and is half Chinese and half International. I ordered eggs with the chef, Mr. Wong. He put my egg in the pan for some seconds and I got it already back, still raw in the middle. It was disgusting. Fruits were not at all tasty but some were hood, others not. Service was to slow and not at all 5 star worthy. Juices were good but I personally did not like the Chinese dishes very much. We went to the concierge, this time Mr. Sidek. He was extremely friendly and very helpful too. We asked the what we could do and see that day in Singapore and he showed everything on a map and explained us how to get there. We walked through some shopping malls and passed the Theaters and walked over the bridge to see the typical Singapore dragon, the fountain of wealth, the Marina Bay Sky Park and the Art Science museum with an exhibition of the Titanic. We returned to the hotel and went to the fitness center. The center and machines are old but still working. The outdoor pool is nice and had a good temperature. Mr. Sidek, the concierge, printed some boarding passes for me and we asked him for an Italian restaurant and he suggested Garibaldi, a good restaurant close to the hotel. The hotel offers nowhere free Internet and in the room it is expensive. For free Internet we had to go to the Bujis mall next doors. The hotel has a direct connection to it but unfortunately it has not much nice stores. Next morning breakfast again and now Khoo gave us a very nice and central table. The hot chocolate that day was better but still 40 percent foam on it. I did not dare to take eggs but I was not very hungry. After breakfast I went to the concierge, Ms. Al Afrah Salleh and asked her what we could do, we had still two hours left and she send us to Little India. We there visited a huge store called Mustafa Center and walked in some streets around it. We walked back to the hotel and got a late check out till 16:00, we packed our stuff and checked out with Mr. Darren, he to was friendly. We left the hotel and took a taxi to Changi. The hotel has a good en central location in Singapore city, everything is doable by foot. The hotel is also connected with the Bujis shopping mall but bigger malls are located in 10-15 minutes walking.

The common areas are very attractive, set in a Malayan colonial style that features bright ceramics and dark wood. The atmosphere is relaxed and rejuvenating. The entrance lobby works as a meeting place, with ample space around the reception counters, while the inner lobby hosts the seating and drinking area. Special mention to the Mediterranean restaurant and the well-appointed patisserie. Service is friendly and efficient, if sometimes slow. Where the hotel fails, in my opinion, is in the rooms. For a start, they are quite small in comparison with other 5-star hotels in Singapore.

The rooms are immaculate and spacious. The water pressure in the bathroom is amazingly good, with lots of hot water. The location of the hotel is ideal for shopping, food and access to the MRT. It is attached to Bugis Junction Shopping Centre, which in turn is next to the Bugis MRT station. It is also across the road from the Bugis Markets. At the other end of the markets is a large hawker centre. We were spoilt for choice in terms of food, with not only the hawker centre, but also a food court and lots of little food shops in Bugis Junction, plus a supermarket in Bugis Junction for fruits and emergency supplies, and the markets sold trays of sliced fruit, snacks and drinks. What impressed us the most about the hotel, however, is the service. No waiting in lines to check in. No waiting for our luggage to be delivered to the room. And there is a button on the room phone labelled 'Instant Service', which is pretty much what it says. I was greeted by name over the phone and my requests were delivered in mere minutes. The hotel had a main pool, a spa pool and a baby pool, which our toddler loved. It is also much better value for money than many hotels along Orchard Rd.

Recently rennovated, this room was located on the corner of the building on the 2nd floor - same level as the club lounge. Since the room faced Victoria Street, my first thoughts were of road noise... and whilst there was a low hum, even during the busiest time of day - the room was sufficiently quiet. However, in the future I would suggest just one level higher would be even better. The shophouse King rooms are reasonable size, the double vanity is certainly a benefit for couples, the King bed functional and comfortable. The Pillow Menu will suit most people and for the technophiles, the Bose Wave Player, ipod connectivity and plenty of power points will be welcome. To use your ipod though, you'll still need to request the remote cable function from room service. I liked the layout of the room, the extra lighting and the old Singapore Shophouse feel. For larger rooms you can request the shophouse suites which add a living room area. All shophouse suites are located quite close to the club lounge. We also experienced a Standard Club King (19th Floor) due to a maintenance issue with our room which required us to be moved immediately and which was handled impeccably by the hotel staff and management. As this happenned on the last day of our stay our check-out was also extended which was very much appreciated. Standard rooms are quite bright and have different views and have standard (no double vanity) bathrooms, however these are certainly comfortable rooms and I would have no hesitation in recommending them as the lead in and particularly to upgrade from if you are an Ambassador member. For us, Intercontinentals are about the Club. The friendly staff, the personal service and greeting, the variation in food, the ambience and location, each Intercontinental Club can be the difference in a great or ordinary experience (in my opinion). This time, it seems like new staff are settling in although I do believe they were trying very hard and most of the time I found them pleasant and helpful. The lounge is well located, easily accessible and is tastefully furnished. What lets this club down based on other experiences is the variation of food. Maybe I am being overly picky but after Dubai and Hong Kong, afternoon tea really was a let down and evening pre dinner fare was only reasonable. That said, I will always recommend club access because it represents fantastic value. With a room service/hotel restaurant & Bar Soda (Coke) costing S$7.50, theres a saving right there!! And often the rooms are only S$30-$50 more a night. When you add food (Breakfast/Afternoon tea/pre dinner snacks), Internet, and drinks (sodas anyttime club is open) - quite simply - Club Rooms are the best option. The truth is, buying a drink at this hotel will hurt your pocket. 2 Bottles of Tiger Beer (local) and 1 Coffee cost S$39.00, 1 coke/soda costs S$7.50, a cocktail around S$13+ so enjoying several of these each night during happy hour in the club - the savings add up quickly. If youre not staying in club rooms, there is a 7-11 close by and the Bugis Mall connects directly to the Hotel providing shops, cinemas and MRT access. On the flip side, food costs in both restaurants and room service seemed quite reasonable and again there is huge range just outside the door. The question is would I go back?

Other recent reviews have discussed its great location, nice rooms, and comfortable beds, and I agree with those positive reviews. I would like to focus my review on the hotel's amazing service, and why I will now opt to stay in InterContinental hotels over other brands in my future travels. From the time I arrived until the time I checked out, the staff made me feel as though my satisfaction was the most important part of their job. I had access to the Club lounge, and the service staff in the Club remembered me every day and even remembered what drink I usually preferred and which newspaper I liked to read. I ordered room service two or three times, and room service was usually faster than the time estimated, and the food was always delivered with a smile. The real distinction in service actually came after I checked out of the hotel. I emerged from my taxi at the airport and suddenly realized that I had left cash in several currencies in my hotel room. The total amount of cash equaled several hundred U.S. dollars! Naturally, I thought of returning to the hotel to see if it was still there, but I then realized that I did not have time to do that and still make my flight. I called the hotel, and talked with Ms. Loy, a credit officer. She sent housekeeping into the room, and they found the file folder that I'd accidentally left containing the currencies. I offered her a reward if she could send it to me, but she refused to accept one, saying that this was part of her job. Rather than send the cash and coins to me, she converted the cash amounts to Singapore dollars, and even found people willing to buy the various coins! (There were also coins of different currencies.) She then credited the entire amount to my account! I was amazed with this level of service, as I had truly expected never to see that money again. (Even as I write this, I'm still shocked! And they would not accept a reward!) My experience has made an InterContinental customer out of me. Shortly after this trip, a friend of mine called asking about my hotel recommendations in another Asian city, and I unhesitatingly advised him to choose the InterContinental.

Most hotels in Singapore offer free local calls but not this one, as soon as you dial out, you are charged $4SD! Yep! and I was even calling a free call number! Taxi was very difficult to get during peak hours due to the conferences in the hotel, so it is much better to book a taxi just incase! (especially if you need to go to the airport by a certain time) Breakfast in the club floor had limited selection but still good. Go have breakfast at the Olive tree for a greater selection. Overall, ok stay, nothing to rave about. I wouldn't go back in a hurry as there are other as good quality hotels with better packages on offer in Singapore.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat friendly service but a little on the slow side\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie L", "ReviewID": "UR117776314", "Content": "Overall had a great stay in a premier room with club room access.

Club lounge benefits allows you to have breakfast in the hotel's Olive Tree restaurant but most of the food in the buffet is cold (eg. old pancakes/waffles etc) and staff in the restaurant are inefficient (I ordered a tea but they brought me a coffee) and the chef sprayed butter at me as I neared the pancake counter. The only complaint that I have is that we had to wait quite a long time to check in because the rooms were not ready yet even though it was 4pm. Staff in the club lounge were very polite and apologetic about this though. Also our room (number 301) was right opposite the gym so is a bit noisy because you can hear people going to and from the gym.

Arriving at InterContinental Singapore: InterContinental Singapore is (usually) a quick taxi ride from Singapore Airport. I arrived this time at around 11pm. Check-in was quick and my Ambassador status was recognised with an upgrade to a larger premium room that included a sofa and a small dining table. I was also given a welcome gift (a shawl). Some water, fruit and chocolates were waiting in the room. InterContinental Singapore itself: I've stayed many times at this hotel. It is stylish and comfortable with good attention to detail. Being directly connected to the Bugis shopping centre is very handy. Staff are usually very friendly and helpful. Rooms: The rooms are comfortable, modern, quiet (just a few elevator noises in the premium rooms) and very well equipped. A newspaper is delivered each morning. My L-shaped room had a good sized living area. Meals: I'm not a great fan of buffet restaurants but the Intercontinental Singapore's is one of the best I've tried. Dinner is a little more relaxed while breakfast can get crowded. Leaving InterContinental Singapore: Check-out was quick and simple. Within minutes I was in a taxi on my way to the airport.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cHotel offers great service and very helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Bill S", "ReviewID": "UR117433681", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel several times.

It is not as modern as say the Conrad rooms, but it is very classy and the location is top notch. It is located by Bugis Junction (you can get to the MRT without getting wet) and gives you access to the shopping in Bugis Mall, the Junction Market and the Luna centre a few minutes walk, five minutes more gives you City Hall area for the mall there. Food wise there are courts under Bugis Mall, stalls just beyond Bugis Junction and the strret directly across from the hotel (I think Lien Sieng) is nothing but interesting places to eat. Chijmes is 5 minutes away. Room wise the hotel rooms are good ,well laid out and equipped, but not the big TV screens you can get elsewhere. Wireless networking works well. Beds are big and comfortable, if a tad high. Twice I have used the exec lounge in the hote and it is classy - food range generally limited but drink is served quickly and with a smile, staff are top notch. It is laid out with Peranakan furniture, making it warm in feel. The main lobby of the hotel is similar and a treat to relax in. I have once had one of the Shophouse style rooms. I was surprised to find it facing the main road, so had to careful with my windows/shower etc, but it was definately nice otherwise, but dark. However it's the bell boys that make it for me. My luggage carries a tag for easy recognition at the airport - it's the colours and name of the soccer team I support.

The service was outstanding whether it was the front desk, the club, Olive Tree, bell boy, room service or room make up. Everyone was friendly and helpfuland very efficient. We arrived at 7am and were given a room ASAP. The next day we requested a room on a higher floor and this was provided without any fuss. The room service was the fastest I have ever experienced. It seemed I had no sooner put down the phone and my order arrived. For thr extra cost the cub was outstanding, the food, drinks and service was great even though the club was at times quite crowded. The one negative was the availablity of the computers in the Club room. As it was a short holiday I did not take my laptop and found that the club only had two computers available.

I like the colonial style and the overall look of the grand lobby where afternoon tea is served. My room was also of a colonial style. It was of a quite comfortable size for me, with a nice entry area. I had heard reports that rooms here were quite small. I did not think that was the case, but I paid for Club Floor access, so this may have had some bearing on the room size. The bathroom has both tub and walk in shower, which I prefer. Seating included two comfortable side chairs and plenty of table and desk space. The king bed was comfortable, with four big pillows. Amenities were plentiful, and replenished often. I also had two comp bottles of water everyday. I was advised to get more beverages from the Club Lounge rather than pay the mini bar prices. Internet required a wire connection, but was quite fast, and was included in the Club Lounge rate. Internet was wireless in the lounge, and several computers were available for free use by the guests. I paid the Club Lounge rate so that I was able to have free breakfast and evening cocktails and enough finger foods to make a meal (I don't like to eat a big meal in the evening). The lounge is on the 2nd floor, and away from lobby activity and noise. There are plenty of food items, hot and cold, so no reason to head out hungry in the morning. As my title suggests, I might want to consider staying along Orchard Road next time, although I was only strolling around this mall street once during my 3-day stay. The IC is actually connected to an interesting shopping complex with plenty of small shops and eateries. No need to wander very far to find plenty of interesting shopping. I found the hop on/hop off bus drop off location to be very handy to the hotel. Some of the more interesting museums were within easy walking distance, maybe 10-15 minutes. In that respect, the location of the hotel is just fine. Orchard Road would be a somewhat longer walk, which I did not make, opting instead to use the hop on/hop off buses.

The InterContinental (IC) is situated on Middle Road, in a great location between the Colonial Core and Little India, ideal for exploring the whole of the island. I had a booked a Club Room for 6 nights, for the very reasonable price of a little over \u00a3850. Upon pulling up at the entrance, the taxi door was immediately opened for us, our bags taken, and a sincere welcome to the IC was given. We had arrived at around 10am, and despite the official check-in time being 2pm, we were immediately escorted up to the Club Lounge (on the second floor) for our private check-in. The lounge has recently been relocated from the 10th floor (where our room was) to the 2nd floor, and as such is a brand new interior with views on one side of the quaint shopping area and on the other of the splendid lobby lounge, both a floor below. Our check-in was completed so smoothly and efficiently that we really didn't have to do anything but sign on the dotted line, and I was given a pashmina as the IC Ambassador present. (IC Ambassador is a paid-for membership scheme which gives various benefits at IC properties, including guaranteed complimentary room upgrades and complimentary Priority Club Gold membership.) We were offered breakfast in the lounge, but declined and opted to be escorted straight up to our room as we were feeling a little worse for wear after the long flight from London. Our room was beautifully appointed with great views across the Colonial Core as far as the Esplanade area and down onto the hotel swimming pool below. The large bathroom, entrance hall and bedroom was immaculately clean and had every amenity you'd want from a five star hotel, without going overboard. Because we required two beds and were already in the highest available category of room with two beds, the Ambassador room upgrade was not offered, but instead (upon enquiring) we did receive a sizeable discount on the final bill. The IC is an almost faultless hotel. From the delightfully courteous and professional staff (especially in the Club Lounge) to the beautiful interior design and ambiance, the IC is one of those hotels that makes you feel truly special, without being insincere. In-room dining was of an excellent quality, and the amenities of the Club Lounge were superb. From breakfast, through afternoon tea to evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, the standard never faltered. One minor criticism of the Club Lounge is that the internet on their PCs was painfully slow, although it may have been quicker when using the complimentary wifi service on one's own laptop. Our check-out was extended to 7pm, another benefit of Ambassador status.

Just one look at the hotel exterior and the spacious lobby, the friendly staff who welcome you and are at your beck and call, is just enough to make you feel at home. The breakfast area is huge and spaced out, a wide range of breads, hot and cold dishes, Indian and vegetarian dishes and freshly squeezed juices are real soothing to the eyes. The rooms are quite large, clean and adequately equipped with all that you need be it in the main room, the cupboard or the bathroom itself. The main attraction being, that is located bang in the middle of the shopping area, called the Bugis Junction, which snakes out and criss crosses inbetween the hotel. You will be spoiled silly with the many 'shop till you drop' options apart from the Junction i.e. Bugis Village, Bugis Street, Albert Square, Burlington Mall and the BHG Mall. As far as location is concerned, it is located about 10 minutes from the Mustafa Shopping Centre, Serangoon Road, Little India and if your local tongue desires, the Indian restaurants as well!

Charged for one extra adult but my 13 yr old was considered a child under their policy and no extra charge for him. I think the Club floor check in is not very good though. Although the whole purpose of whisking you up to the Club lounge for check in is to make you feel \"special\", when we got there, the guy was busy and I was left to stand at his desk and watch whilst he finished some paper work he was doing. No invitation to take a seat or \"can I offer you a drink and I will get back to you\". It was rather awkward and I stood there with my kids for about 5 minutes before he attended to us. And even then no apology. By then I just decided I might as well sit and sat myself down in front of him uninvited. A bit like waiting at the headmaster's office! When I gave my credit card for the guarantee, their machine would not accept my preferred card and I had to give my alternative card. Later I asked them to double check why the card was not accepted as my bank said there was no record of any attempt to use the card. They reluctantly did so and after a lot of to and fro they realised it was their machine that was at fault and not properly plugged in! Again no apology. Then I found out they had put my entire 6 days charge on hold on my other card so now that I wanted to use my preferred card, I had the full charge X 2 on hold. They said the first hold will reverse when I checked out and may take up to 2 weeks for that to happen! Essentially that means that cuts into my credit limit and fortunately that did not adversely impact me, but if my limit was smaller or if I am potentially going to incur further credit charges during my travel, I may find that I have max-ed out my cards! I insisted they reverse the hold on my card immediately and it was returned to my credit available after 4 days. The rooms themselves are spacious and beds comfortable but there are no black out curtains and with the Ilumo building across the road having flashing lights on its facade, my room at night somewhat resembled a night club! Only thing to do was to close my eyes. Fortunately I am not epileptic and not too good if you are recovering from jet lag! Local calls are charged at some ridiculous rate of 50 cents a minute and I had to call the lounge to find out the rates as it was not displayed in any of the room information. Food at the lounge (breakfast, afternnon tea and canapes) was above average and the staff friendly. Free flow of soft drinks, coffee, tea. Cannot comment on the alcohol as I did not drink there. Ambience in the lounge was also very pleasant. Two computers available with microphone and web cam for skype which I would say is something different from other hotels and very welcomed by us as we could skype home.

We were supposed to stay at Intercontinental Bali resort but at the last minute, our KLM flight to Bali was cancelled with no further notice of when we would be able to take off. This cancellation was due to a volcano eruption that left ashes around the Denpasar area which prevented planes from landing (at least from Singapore). We therefore decided to sleep at Intercontinental Singapore and hope they would be able to arrange something. Upon arrival, I was greeted with the usual courtesy of Intercontinental staff (very good) and proceeded to the check-in counter where I would explain the situation. The staff were absolutely fantastic! First, I was able to get a room at a much lower rate than the walk-in rate (I had no reservation). Second, the Singapore staff undertook all communications with the Bali people to make modifications to the reservations, without any penalties whatsoever. This shows great customer service from the Singapore staff. Thanks a lot guys! Being an ambassador member that systematically stays at Intercontinental on all my business trips, I have become used to this high level of service. But on the other hand, I chose to stay at Intercontinental because of that high level of service. To make a long story short, I needed to book new flights to Bali which changed our original and newly modified travel dates. Until the end of our stay in Singapore, the staff was instrumental in providing piece of mind to my family and I. Conversations were being held behind the scenes with hotels in other countries and the conclusion was always favorable. Again, great job! The hotel in itself is a very classy building that is right down town. It is linked to Bugis Junction shopping mall that offers a wide variety of options, although not the high end boutiques. Normal shopping if you want. Rooms are spacious enough and well appointed. We were upgraded to a Shop house room which offers a more \"old style\" decor. Not my cup of tea as I prefer more modern facilities but the hotel also has more recently furnished rooms.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was so high up so there was no noise from traffic. Being above Bugis Junction, and all the food outlets there, we did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on that. The room was spacious, a very comfortable bed, and exceptionally large en suite which we were very impressed with. I do take the point made in an earlier review, that you do have to watch you dont trip over a couple of door frames, however, a minor point. The shower was very hot, which I enjoy, and although we had an initial problem with hot water in the taps, it was soon remedied. The concierge service was excellent, extremely helpful, and when approaching them to ask about internet bookings of our onward flight, the concierge spent a fair amount of time helping me to prebook online, to the point of telephoning the airline in sydney to check the booking. The concierge booked us into Raffles for afternoon tea on the afternoon of our last day, and we had the use of the Health Suite to freshen up before leaving in the evening for our onward flight to Australia. All provided with as much help that we needed, and no fuss. A great plus. The only downside, and a small quible, was that there is a speaker system in the bathroom, wired to the television. On arrival, we had sound in the bathroom, and not on the television, and it took a while to sort it out. Methinks the chambermaid may have had her favourite music channel on whilst cleaning the ensuite. I would suggest that the hotel puts some sort of note in the room with directions of how to use the television, and remote controls.

Upon arrival at the hotel I was escorted to my room to complete check-in. I'd highly recommend this for a hassle-free arrival (at the time of my stay it was $150 SGD for a Mercedes E-Class). - The club suite was a good size, and well appointed - with separate lounge and dining area - and located on one of the highest floors of the hotel. - The Club InterContinental lounge was spacious and tastefully decorated with an old-world yet modern feel. - Excellent check-out service: request to leave luggage (as I was returning to the hotel 3 days later for another night's stay) was happily fulfilled. Upon indicating I was taking the MRT the bellman asked if I knew the way, to which I replied no, and was then escorted by him on the 5 minute walk. Cons: - As a hotel brand which aims to distinguish based on their exceptional level of concierge services, I was completely underwhelmed by my experience. With only one concierge on duty and already dealing with a guest, after a few minutes waiting I was briefly asked my enquiry (checking availability for an airport transfer), and asked to take a seat and the staff member would make a call upon dealing with the guest. It took another 10 minutes for them to complete dealing with one guest, and then proceeded to SMS with their phone and tidy their desk. It took my return to the desk and prompting for their to remember my enquiry - hardly a 5-star service. - Whilst the room was well appointed, a few aspects of it were showing small signs of wear - e.g. the bath was marked, white/cream doors had a slight unclean appearance/in-need-of-repainting including the entry door, brass handles worn. This is however a minor criticism. In summary, a very good hotel in a good location close to Bugis MRT - and, with one exception, a very high level of service. Postscript: My subsequent stay a week later was also good. However, I was less impressed by the Shophouse Room. As an Ambassador member this entitles a room upgrade - on the first occasion being from a Club Deluxe King to a Club Premier King, however on the second to a Shophouse Room. It was tastefully decorated with old-world charm however had a non-existent outlook (see photos). I personally do not believe it's worthy of being classed as a superior room merely due to its location in the hotel - given the size is comparable to the Deluxe room, and lacks a view/natural light.

We quite honestly could not fault this hotel, its staff or the service at all. In fact we have nothing but the highest of praise for our whole experience. We were made to feel very welcome and were completely looked after from our first contact with the staff upon booking our rooms. We all had the best night sleep we\u2019d had in a while, the beds and pillows were very comfortable \u2013 I wish we had the same at home!! The rooms were comfortable, big enough and very clean. The food was also great, breakfast had everything you could want! Room service was nice, and promptly delivered. The location was great also \u2013 nice and central for where we wanted to go the next day - the MRT is right there! All staff looked after us wonderfully and were very pleasant, courteous and professional throughout our whole stay, from the porter\u2019s who greeted us upon arrival and saw us off, the reception staff, the maids, the restaurant staff, the concierge and the man who greeted us and showed us the way to breakfast up to the management staff of the hotel! It was certainly service with a smile all round! Our children were also welcomed nicely. And, to absolutely top the whole experience off the management of the Intercontinental went out of their way to make our youngest son\u2019s birthday a day to remember. Our son turned 7 on the day we travelled to Singapore and stayed at the Intercontinental. The hotel knew this, and upon arrival he was treated to a lovely surprise \u2013 when we went up to our room, staff were in there with balloons and an absolutely delicious personalised birthday cake they had made especially for him, a birthday card and a wee gift of yummy biscuits and we all sang happy birthday to him. You couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face for the next couple of days \u2013 he felt very special!! It was a wonderful end to a busy day for us all!! We all loved our stay here, the kids talked about it for quite a while after. We all wanted to stay for longer, and wished we could have! Then we could have also used the facilities it offers, like the pool, gym and lounge areas.

And we were quite happy with it. The service was good and efficient. The rooms are more than satisfying in terms of size and comfort, even if on the old side. Last time we have been there, we have tried one the \u201cshophouse\u201d rooms. The room is bigger and some may appreciate that. But they are situated on the second or third floor of the \u201cBugis junction mall\u201d. Therefore the you cannot open the curtain, otherwise the office or shops or whatever is in the opposite building will see everything happening in your room. But, because of this, and the fact that the opposite building is quite near, it is very dark in the room. Ok, we do not spend much time in the room, but, at least , when I wake up, I like to have some daylight in my room. In addition, we found the room too cold and, because no sun ray can reach the room, it is almost impossible to warm up, even if you switch off the air-con. So last time I have decided that I will not take this kind of room anymore. Since several weeks, even months, each time I try to book a room, they first propose the shophouse room. I guess it is because, they have some difficulty to sell them that they offer now a better price for this kind of room whereas, several months ago they were more expensive. Anyway, since I certainly do not want to be in the \u201cshophouse\u201d part anymore, I realized that the prices they offered now for the \u201cdeluxe\u201d room is much higher than before. So I have began to compare with some other hotel like Hilton or Swissotel or Mandarin. And guess what, for at least the same level of service, you can find much better prices. And during the past few months the service in the Intercontinental has seen its quality of service has declined. I must add that their gym is quite small, even if the equipment are of good quality, there are not enough machine to satisfy you. Otherwise, the location is good, you are walking distance from Chinatown, Little India, Singapore Flyer and even Orchard road. It is on top of MRT.

Although the hotel is ideal for the business traveller, it was absolutely fine for us as a family. The hotel is elegant and professional and run with efficiency. We stayed in a standard room and with the cot in there was still plenty of space. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was also fine. All the staff are very attentive and greet you which is nice. I found Fahid and Robert (taxis) very friendly and helpful. Even the housekeeping/cleaning staff were very nice. Th location of the hotel is very good. You can access the Bugis junction and Bugis village shops/restaurants/cafes from one of the hotel exits which was great and there is a 7 eleven just outside the hotel. Also on many of the side streets outside the hotel are more eateries which many locals seem to use. We ate in one of these during our last evening. In terms of facilities, I'm not sure why Internet is not free or at least free for a few hours here. There is a good gym and I used the pool and took my son into the children's pool. Ideally, I would say that this pool suits kids from the age of 3/4 upwards and is simply a paddling pool, not a swimming pool. Kids are not allowed in the other pool, which is a swimming pool! The pool area does need modernising, but it is still fine and usable. We used the Club lounge for afternoon tea and breakfast and did not find this as child friendly (no high chairs) as the main restaurant and the choice/selection is poor for what you can get in the rest of the hotel (I didnt see the point of the expensive club lounge!). Breakfast was excellent in the main restaurant and they had a high chair for our son and it was very light and airy. In terms of baby friendly things to do in Singapore, I had 3 days and I took my son to the zoo which was superb. Great value for money and the best zoo I've been to in the world. It is located in the tropical rainforest. We took a boat trip at the zoo and if you have young children there is a kids play area/park there too. You have to pay for the rides and animal feeding. We also went to the Jurong Bird park which was also pleasant. There is a tram which goes through the treetops and its worth doing a ride on that. We found the underwaterworld/aquarium on Sentosa Island very disappointing. It's the smallest aquarium I've been to in the world!! We covered the aquarium in 10 minutes and it is not wheelchair/pushchair/stroller/pram friendly (in common with many parts of Singapore - if you are in a wheelchair dont come here!). A few times I had to carry my pram in one hand and baby in the other to go up and down stairs. Apart from sharks and some of the bigger fish I thought that Singapore zoo had just as much fish and water life. The only saving grace factor that the underwater world has are the pink dolphins and if you want to visit, time your visit with the dolphin shows otherwise you'll be disappointed.

The location of the hotel is fantastic as it is attached to the Bugis junction shopping mall and has acccess to Bugis MRT station. We booked a kingsize shophouse room and were allocated a room on level 3. The shophouse room cost more than some and we expected it to be a good standard. We found the room size to be adequate. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had great nights sleep. On the down side the Shophouse room was very noisy. Every morning there was drilling noise from 0900-1100 from the shopping centre. One night there was hammering and construction noise well after midnight. People noise is also very evident until about 2300 every night (there is a cafe/restaurant directly below rooms). On the first day we rang down to reception to express concern about the noise and asked whether they had a quieter room on a higher level. We were told that someone would ring back in 5 min. 40 min later we had not received a call so went down to reception to speak with them in person. We said that we were happy to pay to upgrade to another room. The woman at front reception was quite indifferent and offered a room on higher level which would have been equal to downgrade. Since we had prepaid for accomodation we decided that this was not an acceptable option and stayed where we were. We understand that the hotel has no control over upgrades/construction work carried out by the shopping centre but believe that guests should be informed that this can occur at any time. We dealt with Eugene at concierge almost every morning and he was very helpful in tips for getting around and restaurant recommendations!! We thought that he offered exceptional service as compared to front desk. We enjoyed buffet breakfast every morning and found the staff in restaurant very efficient.

The only downside to this hotel as with most buildings in Singapore is that the air conditioning is unpleasantly cold. A polar bear would feel at home in the room when we checked in. If this will be a problem for you too, ask for the air conditioning to be turned off before you check in. When you are there, leave a keycard in the slot just inside the door so that the air conditioning doesn't automatically reset itself and turn back on while you are out of the room. By doing this the temperature increased from 19 degrees when we checked in to a comfortable 23 degrees two days later.

You even get discounts from some stores at Bugis Junction if you are staying at the Intercon. Just present to them your hotel card key. We got an SGD$100 discount when we bought an Apple notebook. The room is very spacious considering Singapore is a small place with a very high standard of living. The twin beds are big. It can fit in two Asian-size adults in one bed. The bathroom has separate shower and bathtub. Nonetheless, we were greatly disappointed in two areas: 1. When we entered the room after we check-in, the whole room, including the bathroom smells of fresh cigarette smoke. We assumed that the guest before us smoke inside the bedroom and the bathroom even though it's a non-smoking room. Yes, we requested for a non-smoking room and we were indeed given one. However, it was like we were in a smoking room. Yes, we complained and requested if we can change our room but we were denied a change of room. They just sent someone to spray air freshener in our room. Sad to say, the freshener didn't work a bit. We were content to sleep with smoke scent in our room. We didn't make a big fuss of it since we were truly tired from our travel. Additionally, we even have to request for the bathrobes to be changed since they smell of cigarette smoke too (We have to use the bathrobe since our luggage was erroneously taken by another passenger, they were delivered to our room the next day). 2. The pillows stink. Maybe because of constant use by some guests with peculiar smell, their pillows emit a certain smell. Since we are not used to the smell, we had a hard time tolerating it. Yes, we left a note to the housekeeping for our pillow to be changed (since we have to hurry and go out to maximize our time in Singapore, hence no time to personally talk with the housekeeping about it), but guess they just changed the pillow case but not the pillow.

A quick lift ride to level 4 brought us to the pool which is very much worth a look as the gardeners have paid fastidious attention to maintaining the tropical plants that curb the crystal clear waters. We had breakfast included in our package and I was more than pleased that we took this option as the spread was not only spectacular but delicious. Again, the waiting staff were great. The lounge bar is a little pricier than an alcoholic beverage purchased in the hawker markets but well worth it to soak up the ambiance (not to mention the magnificent voice of Kathleen who tinkled the ivories on the grand piano in the evening). Directly attached to the hotel is the Bugis Junction shopping mall which is an air-conditioned pleasure. There are plenty of shops and stalls with many items at fair prices. On the second level is an eatery that closes at 2200h and has plenty of foods to choose from at very reasonable prices if you can not afford the luxury of eating at the hotel restaurant each night. On the other side of the Bugis Junction is the MRT rail system that will take you pretty much anywhere you wish to go in Singapore. We were able to shoot of to Orchard Road, China Town and many other destinations in under 20mins. If you are a tourist, ask in the MRT station about the tourist multi trip travel pass. My only (and very minor grumble) about the hotel is that there is no free WIFI and is fairly pricey if you opt to have it. This being said, we found that in the shopping mall area there was a store offering free access and, as such, we were able to get emails and gloat to friends on Facebook about our splendid holiday. Directly across the road from the hotel is the famous Bugis markets where there are many bargains to be had from souvenirs to fashion items (make sure you check the goods before you leave). The hotel is also just a short walk to Raffles, Arab Street, SimLim and other points of interest. I can not recommend the Intercontinental Singapore enough. When booking, enquire about late check out (1600h) but don\u2019t be concerned if you have a late evening flight as the hotel staff were more than happy to secure our luggage until our departure time. Please feel free to pop me an email if you have any questions about the hotel or things to do whilst in Singapore.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel Great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "topmark4", "ReviewID": "UR50535691", "Content": "My Wife and I have just stayed at the Intercontinental Singapore.

Exceptional service, and that \"welcome home\" greeting that we received every time we came through the front door, should have been enough to convince us to to stay here on our return, a week later. We left for Thailand after 3 days, and stayed at the Stamford Swissotel (see separate review), but our initial experience with the Intercontinental should have been sufficient to ensure our return visit. I'm sorry to say, I paid extra money to stay at a more \"as perceived\" upmarket hotel. Never again. The staff here are simply lovely people, every one of them. We received an upgrade for no apparent reason, other than the wife has a Priority Card, that she hasn't use for donkeys years, and we received the royal treatment from day one. I've tried previously to claim points on my Marriott/Sheraton/Hilton cards to no avail, but these guys are way ahead of them. They know who you are before you arrive, and treat you with the utmost respect when you get there. Rooms are spacious, staff are only too helpful with directions and advice as to how to get to wherever you want to go....and if you can't get it in the hotel, then they will point you in the right direction. The (air-conditioned) shopping mall/street adjacent to the hotel caters to every taste and whim...the downstairs lounge and Victoria Bar staff keep you well supplied with whatever you fancy after a warm days' shopping, and the front counter staff can arrange anything you desire at a moments notice. The APEC Forum was happening during our visit also, but staff were attentive to our needs as well as those more \"demanding\" guests. If you can consider that the staff managed to still keep an 11YO happy with the service-level and staff interaction despite the attendance of various members of the APEC Convention, then I think you can give this place a big tick....

The room wasn't the biggest at 38 SQMs, but the design made it feel very spacious, and the British colonial background made it feel traditional , but in a swanky way (pardon the oxymoron). The club lounge was quite spacious, compared to some other downtown intercontinental properties, but its more suited to dinning than lounging in my opinion, and the lack of power outlets could become problematic.

We are Ambassador Gold, so we were upgraded to a large junior suite. Upon arrival, our suite wasn't ready, but we were immediately ushered into another room to use (without a request). The entire registration process took place in the room, which I believe is reserved for Ambassador members, and is a lovely touch. We were presented with placemats and chopsticks as a gift. Additonally, fruit and water were available free of charge. Bath amenities were Elemis and include moisturizer, shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap and nothing else, which is surprising.

Our first couple of nights were blighted by flashing lights in our room from a message on the telephone & more annoyingly from the smoke detector above my head when laying in bed. We eventually found the hotel book hidden away at the back of the drawer & managed to get rid of the message. We reported the smoke alarm but told this was normal, we have been to many hotels & never had this before. Two white LED's flashing every five seconds & every couple of hours on full for about a minute. This is quite disconcerting when laying awake due to jet lag etc! We did get used to it in the end mainly because of sleeping better. I did think about trying to buy some black tape to cover them over!! That's the bad bit out of the way now for the many good points. On our arrival we explained that we would be going to another hotel at the end of our stay & it was no trouble to extend our checkout time to 14:00 at no extra cost. The staff were all very pleasant, probably the best out of the three hotels we stayed in. Breakfast was very good, no hassle to hurry up when we turned up towards the end of the serving one morning. Items were replenished constantly, tea & coffee brought promptly. For evening meals the hotel is adjoined to the Bugis Mall which provides many eating places both upstairs & in the basement. If you don't want to walk too far then we found the Japanese Coffee shop right opposite the hotel doors provided very good meals. They mix Japanese with western, I had chicken balls with pasta one evening which was very tasty. Should you wish to stretch your legs then the Foodcourt in Raffles City Mall (10 mins walk) is very good value for money. We had a three course meal for under S$10, which saves a lot of money over a two week period. Great atmosphere as many people use this on their way home from work, I couldn't quite bring myself to try the Pigs innards soup though!! We liked the Intercontinental, yes it could do with a coat of emulsion in various areas of the hotel but it is clean & tidy. The location is one of the best, great for Little India, Malay Quarters, City Hall, Museums, Marina & Orchard Road all within walking distance.

On arrival we were told that there are no interconnecting rooms for the Shophouse rooms so it was impossible to meet our request. The receptionist offered us to look at the standard room and the shophouse rooms to decided if we wanted to drop back. We were shown the two different rooms by a very friendly concierge who was more than happy to answer any of our questions. The Shophouse rooms were nice but looked tired and were some distance to walk from the lobby. The standard rooms were much nicer, had the same style of bathroom and high ceilings. The rooms we were given were at the front of the hotel and overlooked the swimming pool. Needless to say given that they were interconnecting and nicer we decided to go with them. The hotel gave us free internet in one room for the inconvenience and credited us the difference in the room prices to our account to use for breakfast for the four of us for three mornings. Eating at the hotel is what your would expect from a hotel of this standard with prices to match. We were caught out on the first evening with the buffet dinner as we didn't click that the price quoted did not include both the taxes. This is seen everywhere in Singapore as ++ after the price. There is a good shopping centre connected to the hotel which has a variety of takeaway and eat in restaurants. There is also a supermarket which is handy to buy basic items. Across the road, at the far end on the shopping centre is the Bugis Street markets which are known as the largest in Singapore. You will find lots of cheap clothing and all those 'tacky' and unique gifts to take home. The overall feeling that we had at the hotel was friendly and welcoming. You never passed a staff member without them saying hello and there was always someone there to serve you.

The ambience in the club lounge was very comfortable and relaxing with prompt, discreet and efficient staff. There were plenty of drinks and an appetising range of nibbles at afternoon tea and cocktails. We took our breakfast there on both mornings as it was included in our rate. We would like to have tried the main restaurant for breakfast as the dishes sounded delicious but the prices were rather scary even by Singapore standards. However, in the club lounge there was a surprisingly wide range of hot and cold foods that changed each day; something other club lounges could learn from and included soya milk and gluten-free cereal, which showed that some thought had gone into it and was a real bonus for me. So it was a pleasant and comfortable stay in a well-located, good hotel with friendly, polite and efficient staff but somehow it lacked sparkle.

There was no mention of this when booking the ticket - on Orbitz or on the Intercontinental website. Finally, the hotel staff dropped the deposit to 300 SGD and gave my parents their originally booked room (not the upgrade they had promised). After I called (from the US) and asked them about this confusion, they apologized and \"re-upgraded\" my parents to some business class thingy. Yeah, my 70 year-old retired parents were dying to use their new business meeting rooms!!

Oh, by the way, we are still trying to recover the 300 SGD security deposit that the hotel claims they've released (it's been a month since my parents' return). They're blaming my parents' bank.

I am a Platinum Ambassador member so chose the Intercontinental and booked a Club floor room.

Once there we were offered a drink and the checking \u2013 in process was a breeze, as we left the receptionist wished my wife and I a happy stay and a happy anniversary. In our room was a beautiful bouquet of flowers for my wife and the customary fruit and water for my Ambassador status. After a short while I received an apologetic phone call from the Club floor receptionist who had not offered us our Ambassador room upgrade entitlement. Our room was more than adequate and we had already started unpacking so I declined. However, I appreciated the honesty, many hotels, I\u2019m sure, would have let the opportunity go and not have made the offer. The hotel was immaculate, the Club floor was amongst the best I\u2019ve ever had access to, food was beautifully presented and the service was exemplary. The gym was very well equipped and spacious and the pool deck was clean with a pool you could actually swim in. Breakfast in the Club lounge was plentiful, of a very high quality and we were greeted each morning as guests and not numbers. In the evening we made use of the free cocktails and the food was so plentiful that we didn\u2019t need to go out for dinner. This is another huge plus as dining and drink can be very expensive in this city. As we hadn\u2019t visited Singapore previously we didn\u2019t know really what to expect or what was nearby. Within a few hundred yards we found Raffles Hotel and a short walk further brought us to the river and the Raffles landing point. The Merlion fountain is also very close by but a short cab ride is required to catch the monorail or cable car to Sentosa Island. Someone once described Singapore as a sterile Hong Kong, true it is immaculately manicured and well kept, but it has a distinct charm that cosmopolitan Hong Kong doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s compact and easily walkable, although the heat and humidity will restrict most to walk too far.

My overall experience was a little different. I used to stay at this property quite a lot, and always liked the Shophouse rooms in particular. I've considered over the years the property to often be overlooked when people have booked accomodation in Singapore and have, through this forum, recommended that people consider the Intercontinental. With a week to spend in Singapore, and some excellent web rates through Intercontinental Hotels it was time to retest my impressions of the property. The hotel makes a good first impression although as in the past the public room layout always seems a little odd to me. In the past I've noticed that I've used less of the hotel facilities (bars, eating places) than I do in other Singapore hotels (Oriental, Ritz Carlton, Regent, Fullerton) and I'd guess it's because they're rather less obvious and I'd argue rather undersold by the hotel. My original booking for a shophouse room was extended by one day on the day before my arrival. However when I arrived I was told that the Shophouse rooms, although some were available, were undergoing construction work and therefore would be noisy; I could have one - but I certainly wasn't encouraged to take one. Instead I was offered a move to a Deluxe room (that's a downgrade from the Shophouse) and instead was offered Club access for SGD 80 per day. I coughed and pointed out that this was not a very compelling deal. I'd asked about Club access when I'd made my original booking and had been quoted that rate; what was the offset for the downgrade? The price was lowered to SGD 50 a day, and quickly to SGD 40 a day. I agreed, although on reflection - and checking the room rates, this wasn't a great decision on my part. I see that other people recommend the upsell to the Club. I found the Club very busy and the afternoon tea having been seemingly descended on by locusts and little space even in the afternoon. I did speak to the Duty Manager and ask them how many upsells they'd made and he agreed that the Club was busy, but should improve during the week as the overall hotel occupancy was so low (around 25% he suggested). It did improve over the week a little, but on at least one morning I found myself waiting for a breakfast table and the Club was generally busy. It certainly did not feel exclusive. Personally I think that the hotel, in reaching for revenue is selling the Club access a little too widely and rather destroying the concept. Overall the hotel rooms are very pleasant, and the beds in particular excellent. It did seem that staffing was thin, and the room would often not be made up until mid afternoon, and did on more than one occassion need my prompting. Beyond the front desk staff the english language skills weren't strong (unusual in Singapore) which led to more than one protracted conversation with the laundry staff. My recollection of the hotel was of better service and staff; again I suspect that staffing levels may have been reduced given poor occupancy but that's just a guess. I found the front desk excellent, but had issues with the Concierge Desk. Again I had a conversation with the Duty Manager, and he clearly showed interest and did follow up. One benefit to the traveller of the Singapore economic issues is that taxis are more plentiful now and the hotel had a good supply on hand. Easy access to taxis is important and difficult at some other Singapore hotels (The Fullerton!). The location of the hotel is quite good and the MRT not too far, although it's a little longer walk than a first view of a map would suggest, and certainly better than many other hotels. Overall I still would recommend the hotel, although I did miss the Shophouse room and the extra space it provides over the Deluxe. In terms of standards against other major Singapore properties I'd suggrest it's near the top of the second tier (e.g. Hilton, Hyatt) but a long way short of the more upscale (and expensive) propoerties like the Oriental or the Ritz. If you can get a good deal here I'd book it, but I'd think carefully about that Club upgrade.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best business hotels in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Adesitraveller", "ReviewID": "UR30196596", "Content": "I travel to Singapore often and have stayed at the InterContinental several times.

So not that bad a location, if you don't mind the walking. Taxi fares are reasonable if you don't want to walk (and watch the weather as rain is common in the afternoon). I was upgraded to a shop house room. Whilst nice (with the historic touch), they are in dire need of a bit of TLC. Plaster and paintwork are showing a lack of attention, and not quite what I expect out of an InterContinental property. The shop house rooms are also a bit of a walk from the lobby, and parts of it are not wheelchair (or baby stroller) accessible, if that is a factor for you. Best to clarify when you check-in. The housekeeping staff are courteous (but for some reason very miserly with bathing soap - I had to ask on two occasions for bathing soap). The front door staff/porters are friendly and helpful. Some of the concierge and front desk staff are a bit indifferent. The Club Lounge is nice, and well laid out with a lot of Perankan woodwork furniture. Nice ambience. The lounge staff are a bit of a hit and miss. Some are very good, some have probably lost the plot on what their job is. The snacks area during the designated times are usually poorly looked after, so you may need to ask them to bring out more if the plates are empty (rather than the staff reacting themselves to empty plates). Bugis junction and Bugis street are right next door, as is a newly opened shopping centre (as of April 2009). Shopping and eating options in most directions.

I like the clean room, comfy bed and nice bathroom. Least thing that I like is that they had nowhere for me to plug anything in the bathroom, none which I though was odd. They had a weird plug for a shaver but none for hairdryer or hair flat iron. The power is 220V and I needed a converter to get all my electrical hair items to work. No laundry facilities in the hotel and the laundry service cost a fortune.

Big bathroom with shower and bath, excellent condition. No complimentary water but extensive choice of tea, coffee... you can safely drink tap water in Singapore. Perfect insonorisation, heard nothing of outside street and neighbouring rooms. Last but not least, amazing beds. Choice of pillows, great mattress and duvet.

Not too big to make you drowsy and not too small to make you wonder why you would pay 30$ for it. Furthermore, excellent quality. Otherwise there are a lot of options outside the hotel for breakfast. Used the Internet in the room and in the business center. Price for a 24h connection and business center quite steep, like in any corporate hotel. Also keep in mind that Singapore has a lot of wireless spots (mc donalds, starbucks, shopping malls, etc) if you don't want to stay trapped in your room with your laptop. Btw, this hotel isn't in the most reknowned part of Singapore, i.e. Orchard Rd the shopping strand, but might as well. Location is very convenient and there are two metro stations easily reached by foot (2 mins or one about 8 mins). Lots of things to see around Bugis. Just ask the concierge if you're a bit lost.

The backdoor of the hotel opens directly into the shopping arcade which means that even if it rains you can get food or do some shopping without getting wet. We had booked a standard room at the 7-day advance rate without breakfast. The difference between the room only and breakfast rate was nearly USD 100.00 so that we decided to get breakfast locally in the morning.

The package also includes free internet (via cable) in the room and wireless internet in the lounge. My favourite hotel in Singapore always used to be the Grand Hyatt Hotel, but I would certainly go back to the Intercontinental again.

Not only did I receive confirmation of my special needs, I also had a price that was better than offered on their own website (average SGD 205 per room per night including fantastic buffet breakfast and tax for all eight of us). Another example of service: my children had somehow broken a wheel on our suitcase. When their engineer couldn't fix it, they found someone in Singapore who could, and they had it fixed within four hours and for a reasonable charge. I also remember queuing to check out: the minute someone saw me waiting (even though I wasn't in a hurry) they immediately went behind the counter and dealt with my checking out. I really admire that focus on service.

To me the best part of the hotel is its location - 10 minutes to the National Museum and Arab Street area (a real quiet jewel in Singapore), less to Raffles, good shopping and food right there (with a Chinese and Indian temple close by for the culture hungry).

I've stayed in some of Singapore's top hotels, including Raffles, Ritz-Carlton, and Mandarin Oriental; and I was a bit concerned that the Intercon would suffer in comparison. Happily, it did not. The only minor sour note occured when I was checking in and I asked the clerk about the 4 p.m. late checkout (\"subject to availability\") mentioned as part of the weekend rate I'd booked. The clerk said there was nothing in the \"system\" about this, and a second staffer, who'd come to take me up to my room, reiterated the \"availability\" line (of which I was already aware) and said she'd let me know later. I politely but firmly asked her to check and let me know before heading up to my room, as my return flight was not until after midnight on my checkout day. She quickly confirmed the late checkout availability, and all went very well from that point on. Hotel: The Intercon is a 13-year-old midrise located in Bugis very near Raffles and a short walk or taxi ride to most of the city's attractions and interesting neighborhoods. All the public areas are attractive and spotless, and the hotel's decor is very smart if rather generic. The Intercon eschews the grandeur of the Ritz-Carlton and Oriental and is more reminiscent of the simple luxury of the Four Seasons. Room: I had a standard (\"Deluxe\") room on the 6th floor, and while I thought that that might be a bit lacking, I was again pleasantly surprised. While not huge, at about 35 sq. meters, my room was just right: very comfortable, spotless, and more understated luxury -- in short, the Intercontinental mien at its best. The large bathroom was done in marble, with a big, separate tub and walk-in shower. The room had a large, triple bay window; and the view of the surrouding buildings in Bugis was quite nice. The bed was very comfortable, as one expects in Intercons. The hotel had even provided a small bowl of complimentary fruit and a bottle of Evian. The only drawback to the room was the internet service: wired (no wifi, at least from the hotel) broadband with adequate speed but an annoying feature: having to reopen the startup pay-as-you-go page with each new session, even after paying for a 24-hour block of time. Nor was this cheap: SGD 30 (about US$ 21) for the 24 hours. But the Intercon's not alone in charging high ratees for internet access. I'm hopeful that five-star chains will follow the Peninsula's lead in providing complimentary internet service in all rooms. But this was a minor quibble, and overall, I was very satisfied with my \"basic\" Intercon room. My rate of SGD 220 included breakfast and the aforementioned late checkout, and it was actually cheaper than the cheapest room-only rate at the time I booked. Staff and service: With the small exception of my initial checkin query, all of the Intercon's staff were very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. The concierge recommended an excellent seafood-speciality Chinese restaurant (Jumbo) on the waterfront for chili crab; out of this world, and I highly recommend it. The staff at Olive Tree, where I took breakfast, were equally helpful; and the food there was excellent, with a wide choice of fresh western and Asian dishes. Bottom line: I'd recommend the Intercon to anyone visiting Singapore. It's a true five-star (maybe even plus) hotel that, at least at promotional or weekend rates, is a real value compared to more famous Singapore properties that may or may not warrant their higher prices. The Intercon feels smaller than it is (I think it has close to 500 rooms), and the staff make guests feel welcome and special.

For others, including us (husband, wife & our 18 month old son), this is a perfect choice. Why? Because it is affordable luxury at its best. Here is a sumary of our 4 night experience at the IC: Bookings: Got an excellent rate through Asia Best Hotel website. Reconfirmed the booking status with the hotel directly through e-mail. Since we had a child, couple of extra services were needed (especially for bottle sterlization). Hotel reply was positive. Made couple of routine requests to the hotel directly through e-mail. We were informed that at the time of check-in hotel staff will try to fullfill these requests. The hotel replied to our queries promptly, even though we did not book our room direclty with the them. Check-in & check-out: It was quite efficient. At check-in I was asked to produce the booking voucher sent to me by the Asia Best Hotel. All our requests were granted. Got a king bed at a higher floor. Even an early check-in was granted (we were there before 1 pm). Reception staff were friendly and smiling. Some of the hotel reviews mention a bad check-in experience. To avoid such an experience I have this habbit of exchanging some e-mails direclty with the hotel, even if I have used hotel\u2019s own website. It solves lots of problems. A bad experience can ruin the holidays. Check-out was even more smooth. Lift: Yes it is an issue. Hotel check-in staff don\u2019t drop any hint on how to us the elevators. Basically when in the lift look for a slot to insert your room key (it is located beneath the floor numbers). Take out the room key from the slot and press the floor button. This basically is a security feature to restrict the movement of Non-hotel guests . Hotel & Rooms: It is a lovely hotel. The aroma of Lemon Grass circulates in the main areas on the hotel. Rooms are impressive. Fairly large at 33 sqm. Nicely decorated. King size bed is very comfortable. Rooms are sound proof. Plasma or LCD TV is in the room. Airconditioing system is very good. Guests can increase or decrease the temperature settings to their comfort. Bathroom is luxurious with a sperate tub and a shower closet. Water pressure in the shower closet is nice. Breakfast: We had breakfast in the hotel only once. Why? Because we overslept the other days. In nutshell it was delicious and with plennty of options. Not to be missed. We did not have dinner or lunch at the hotel Staff: I think where this hotel falls short of Ritz & Four Seasons is the lack of personalized touch. But otherwise the staff was always helpful. They would sterlize the feeding bottles for our baby, however, they would not take down the complete instructions first. Twice we had to re-send the bottles back. Due to excesive shopping we needed a carton. Hotel arranged two within a few hours. Given the size our luggae, hotel also called a mini-van to take us to the airport. Taxi: At times there was a small queue at the hotel for Taxis. But the wait was tolerable. Never more than a few minutes. AT other places Taxi is an issue. We had to wait for 20 minutes at shopping malls for example. Easy way out is to call the cab. They charge a few dollars more. Location: As a tourist, I loved the location. Close to everything. There is a 24 hours small store across the hotel. Covered shoppoing mall adjacent to the hotel is very nice. The one across this mall is good as well. I would suggest to check out these two places before heading for the orchid road. For lunch try the resturant in the covered shoppng mall (I think it is call Terra). Excellent deal (Singapore $ 12).

I booked the hotel for three nights via the IC Hotel\u2019s website back in April 2007, with a room rate of approximately SGD 303.00 per night and including breakfast for up to two adults. Anyone who has travelled frequently will know that breakfast in a five star hotel can cost between \u00a315 and \u00a320 per person, so to have this included in the room charge seemed more than good value. Booking through the hotel\u2019s website meant that I had a confirmed reservation at an excellent price and I didn\u2019t have to pay for the room until I had completed my stay. After our stay I checked my credit card statement whilst continuing our travels and I was more than pleased to find that the total cost for my stay at the InterContinental was \u00a3332.24, equating to slightly over \u00a3110 per night for a wonderful room and a sumptuous breakfast. The hotel is ideally located and not too far from Raffles Hotel as well as a subway station. We each purchased a \u20183-Day Singapore Tourist Pass\u2019 that allows three days\u2019 free use on the metro system and is excellent value for money and allows visitors to take advantage of the excellent rail links and low-cost travel around Singapore. I have visited Singapore twice before and on both occasions have stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel and the only reason I didn\u2019t choose it this time around was because it was more costly than the InterContinental. However, we decided to visit it whilst we were there to see if it had changed - and unfortunately for my taste it had! The interior and layout had been changed to an ultra-modern style with extremely bright colours, which probably impresses guests staying there for the first time - but it is not to my taste. Therefore I\u2019m extremely pleased I chose the InterContinental and would most certainly recommend it to any first-time traveller to Singapore, I would also recommend it to any traveller returning to Singapore who has been disappointed with their accommodation on previous visits. I can not praise the hotel personnel highly enough as they are always friendly, professional and courteous in all their actions. At breakfast all of the staff in the restaurant was extremely attentive to the guest\u2019s requirements. You only needed to get up from your table for a short while to get something from the excellent buffet selection, and you would find that any dirty plates and cutlery would be removed and clean cutlery placed on the table, in addition to finding your napkin neatly folded again. One didn\u2019t need to look around for staff when a tea or coffee refill was required as someone was always at hand to offer a refill. The hotel rooms are well appointed and as I have already indicated the breakfast is a joy to feast on and there is a wide variety of food to cater for Europeans and Asians. I never took advantage of the swimming pool, however, I did walk around all the facilities with my wife and everything looked in pristine condition. I hope I have another opportunity to visit Singapore and the InterContinental Hotel will by first choice of hotel.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGood business hotel\u201d", "Author": "Multi-Plug", "ReviewID": "UR14079367", "Content": "Stayed here briefly during business trip.

I stayed in a five star hotel and no one mentioned my inappropriate dress' so maybe that was why this was so much of a shock when I hit Singapore and this particular hotel. and for fine tuning: if you are lucky enough to be in the club lounge, no problem with internet however if you are just a Priority Club member as I am (geez what does t h a t mean)?? I had the honour of paying 6 singapore dollars plus taxes for each FIFTEEN MINUTES of internet use in the hotel...again coming from Thailand in a five star where this was free I thought this was a little pricey! Finally, as a Priority Club member, I was honoured with a very nice pamphlet on the desk in my room showing all kinds of local exotic fruit....and I had two very hard non ripe PEARS offered as my welcome gift! So much for lichis, mangos and the like. This little detail I found very silly and just plain stupid for a five star hotel The worst was when I checked out and the front office staff did not even ask how my stay was, but when I kindly mentioned he just smirked. When I said this was peculiar for a four star hotel he said 'oh no we are five star' to which I responded that made it even worse! Drinks or service at poolside? Five star service, call on the phone and wait In room robes? Yes they are there if you dont mind em grey and wrinked Best things about this hotel: -The very nice concierge and the fact that I was able to have an early check in -Leaving knowing I paid absolutely nothing as I was able to use my free miles The worst: -The extreme snob attitude (dont stay here unless you are on business meeting your customers saddled in Gucci or Versace shoes) If you do get stuck -Enjoy the size proximity and cleanliness of the room (well other than the bandaid wraps I found on the floor) and Go to the toastbox (just next door) for breakfast and really good coffee! try raffles or the mandarin", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Inconsistent Service!\u201d", "Author": "VH-RMM", "ReviewID": "UR13668348", "Content": "We decided to stay at the InterContinental Singapore on our way to / from Bali in January and again in February 2008. My parents have stayed here before and as they reccommended the Intercon, we made our bookings. Making the Reservation should have given me some warning about the service. It took over 72 hours to get the confirmations, only after I had to email them and then call them directly in Singapore from work in Sydney - not a good start. Once I received the reservations, my parents booking details were not provided, so after more emails and another phone call, these were sent. However, the rate per night was the by far the best offered to me. And as it was my parents wedding anniversary during the return trip, chocolate strawberries and a half bottle of sparkling wine was offered to them and will be in their room as a surprise in their room - a nice touch. Service upon arrival was very efficent and courteous. We were met by a porter who promptly collected all of our luggage and then was met by the guest relations manager who escorted us to our rooms. Check in took place in the room and we were also were given complimentary 1400 check out. (My high floor preference and smoking room were not in my booking, even though I had an email to advise it was. I was advised that this would be corrected, and preferences were now noted) The Hotel itself was gorgeous, and as it has been built around the old Singapore Shophouses, the colonial theme with Asian touches were very evident. Off Reception is the beautiful Lounge - a lovely place the have a cheeky bevvie in elegant surroundings and the prices were not too expensive at all (compared to some Australian 5 star hotels). The deluxe room itself was spotless and nicely appointed, and a nice size - not too small. We especially liked the bathroom and the Elemis products provided, the shower, where you can adjust the water temprature was devine! A sojourn to the Pool area was nice - but no attendants were anywhere to be seen. A question posed to the Concierge in regards to where the good local restaurants were proved too difficult for him, and he advised us \"Two blocks that way\" and pointed his thumb in the direction he was talking about. And FYI - Bugis street is just around the corner along with Albert Mall and dozens of hawker stalls and local restaurants - with amazing prices! And awesome food! The hotel location is good, only 15 min cab ride from Changi Airport (SGD$25.00 including taxes - not bad at all) but only SGD$2.50 on the MRT from Changi Airport Terminal 3- bargain! The InterContinental is located at Bugis Junction - and the MRT station (Bugis Junction) is a 5 min walk away. So, transport is never far away. The next night we ate at the hotels signature Chinese restaurant - Man Fu Yuan - and they provided the best Chinese meal we've ever had. Black Chicken Soup followed by Peking Duck (the duck was gorgeous with just a wisp of duck fat) and then BBQ Suckling Pig - amazing. The service was OK, not bad but not what I was expecting from a restaurant of this calibre. A few drinks at the Lounge was a lovely way to round out the evening. Check out 2 days later was simple, and off to Bali we headed. Fast forward to 10 days later, and were at the Intercontinental again. What a contrast from the first stay. No porter met us, and we waited in the line at Reception for 10 mins, only to be met by a very unfriendly staff member, who advised me that my room preferences were not in the system and there was nothing she can do (after a 5 second check). After checking in, I happened to catch the eye of the duty manager, who advised we could be moved and our preferences were accommodated. My parents half bottle of sparkling wine was not in their room, and as this was already a pre - arranged surprise, I went to enquire at Reception if this is still OK to do. I was demanded to give the lady on duty to give a copy of the email for proof, and she photocopied it and advised \"we will fix it.\" By the way, the half bottle of sparkling wine turned out to be a full bottle of cheap Australian White Wine. Good for drain cleaner. The room service we soon ordered was fantastic and arrived very quickly - try the Club Sandwich or the Hainan Chicken Rice! Yum!!!!! (A little pricey, though!) Check out the next day was simple and straightforward, but again, the staff at Reception gave average service. No \"How was your stay or Would you stay with us again.\" Overall verdict - Nice hotel in a great location with great Food & Beverage outlets (desperately wanted to eat at Ko, the Japanese restaurant - will save that for next time), let down by the indifferent attitude of some of the front desk staff and restaurant staff. Very inconsistent service. Tip - 5 min walk around the corner is a traditional Singapore breakfast restaurant - Toast Box. They serve toast, traditional toast and Teh Terik (tea with condensed milk - fabulous!) and noodles and laksas.

I asked if we could possibly have a late check out due to a late night/early morning flight and she said we could only have this if we became an a Priority Club member (which we were) then she said no, you need to be an Ambassador and this would cost us so much per year. We declined this option. We were then advised we would have to pay an additional half day room rate to keep the room until 6pm (I had requested 8pm) which due to our late flight, we accepted but she would not budge on the 8pm despite our paying an additional half day rate. It was 7.50pm when we checked in and I mentioned we had just missed the cocktail hour in the club lounge and was there any chance of getting a drink but she said no the lounge had finished. No niceties here, so we gave up and were just glad to get rid of her. Not the best start. We wandered to the lounge after and the ladies in there were exceptionally friendly and advised us that breakfast served in the club lounge was not hot (just a few pieces of hot bacon only) and the remainder of it was just continental. The advice was to eat at the main hotel buffet restaurant which had a huge selection and was free to club room guests. We can recommend this to anyone who stays at the hotel as the choice is excellent, lots of cold meats/fruit/pastries/juice and also a hot selection of dim sum, noodles, rice, bacon, potatoes, fish, beef, omelettes made to order. Basically, you will not need lunch if you have a decent breakfast there. We had drinks in the lounge from 5-7.30pm which included sparkling wine and the usual spirits but I will say the selection of canapes was very poor - just a couple of items but mainly \"chips and dips\" with cookies available too. You can have tea/coffee/juice at any time of the day with cookies. The room itself overlooked the pool area at the front of the hotel and had a king bed, with workdesk, chairs, table and a flat screen TV. There wasn't really a vanity unit and the hairdryer was in a unit between the bedroom area, in a corridor by the wardrobe, making it difficult for 2 people to pass when the other was drying their hair. The bathroom was fine, with a single sink, separate shower, a large space age toilet and separate bath. The best thing about the hotel is that it adjoins a small shopping area at Bugis junction and is easily accessible to lots of places, including a short walk to Raffles Hotel and the Swissotel Stamford which was great as we dined at Equinox there (top floor restaurant) which had fantastic views of the quay area. It's a shame that the lady checking us was so indifferent to us at the beginning of our stay, it tainted our view of the hotel somewhat, but we did feel that tourists were more frowned upon in the club lounge than their business guests, despite having paid the same room rates. On the whole, the stay was okay but it's certainly not somewhere we would go back to again and I think next time, we'll try the Shangri La Valley Wing as we feel that the service levels for tourists will be better.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood, come back\u201d", "Author": "vixbkk", "ReviewID": "UR8705565", "Content": "Very Good hotel, Had high expectation but it exceeded.

Despite warnings from other fellow travellers, we booked the IC due to its reputation and our previous pleasant experience with IC in other cities. We booked in the last minute and took the only type of room that was available -- the club room (at SGD 350++). While our entire stay was overall pleasant, we felt the IC Singapore did not quite live up to its world-wide reputation. The exterior the hotel looked nice and gave an old colonial image. The lobby lounge where we had our breakfast everyday was grand and impressive looking. The daily breakfast was good with lots of selections. The Japanese restaurant was good although a bit pricy. We didn't use the pool as it looked so-so and always crowed. As to the other facilities, we were pretty surprised to find that there was only a sauna and a tiny jacuzzi, and no steam room. There was a small gym. Our room included free usage of the facilities but we didn't use any of them. As to our room, we have to say we were kind of disappointed when we saw our \"club room\" on the club floor. It was just an ordinary room, nothing special. There was some kind of smell in the room due to old age, and the walls were so thin we could hear the people next door getting up in the middle of the night using the bathroom and also in the morning taking a shower, along with their conversation. The exterior wall of the bathtub didn't close up properly and we could see the inside. We also had to call twice to request for our complimentary water bottles. The next day morning we went to the club lounge to have breakfast before heading out. It is always hot in Singapore so we were wearing shorts. We were refused entrance by a snobby employee who informed, loudly in front of other guests, \"I'm afraid there is a dress code in this lounge.\" We were not at any point informed of this and felt completely humiliated. We chose to have breakfast in the lobby lounge for the following mornings. After 3 nights in the smelly club room, we moved to an ordinary room on a regular floor (at SGD 220++), and were shocked to find that it looked exactly the same as the \"club room\" we previously stayed at!! Plus, it smelled much better. We should've moved earlier! We felt deceived. We couldn't understand why we paid SGD 130 more per night for the \"club room.\" The only difference we could come up with was that club room guests can go to the lobby lounge to have a drink every day. We are not sure this is worth an extra SGD 130 per day. Of all the five-stars hotels we stayed with around the world, the IC Singapore is probbaly the most unaccommodating and the most inflexible. There must be better hotels in the same price range. We stayed at Raffles the Plaza on our last trip and were quite satisfied.

We arrived at the hotel after 8pm at night. We had no problem with the check in (although it would have been nice to have been told whether or not breakfast was included and where it was). However it took over half an hour for our bags to be delivered up to our room, and only then because I rang up to remind them. We really wanted to get changed and have a shower, but instead we had to sit around waiting for our luggage to arrive. The next day we were out all morning. When we returned to the hotel at 1:30pm our room had still not been made up. We went back out again and returned at 4:30pm to find the maid only just starting to clean our room then.

This hotel was recommended by my husband; I've stayed in the Hilton, Sheraton, Swisshotel and numerous others in Singapore. What I liked about the IC (and particularly the shophouse room), was the feeling of something with a little bit of history, while not lacking in modernity. The lobby was a nice size - not overwhelming with high ceilings or overly crowded and busy. It felt welcoming. The shophouse room was comfortable with chairs, small table as well as desk and chair. The room is tastefully decorated according to the InterContinental standard. Flat screen TV makes the room feel airier. The bathroom amenities were nice; there is a bathtub and separate shower stall with glass door. Hot water was plentiful and the shower head worked great. Bathrobes are provided. The bed itself was very comfortable - not too hard and not too soft. The pillows were fluffy enough without giving me a neck ache. The only complaint is that the daily refreshing of the room was erratic. Upon arrival, fruit and mineral water were provided. The second day, nothing. But, provided again on the third and fourth day. Similar situation with the newspaper - first and second day, The Straits Times; third day, nothing, and I departed too early on the final day for paper delivery (they were just being delivered to the bellman as I was leaving). The odd thing about a wake up call is that you get one 5 minutes in advance from a machine; the second call (on time) is from a person. Bugis Junction is attached to the hotel. There is a largish Cold Storage supermarket (larger than some of the other locations in Singaporean malls); this one has a deli and hot foods to go. As Singapore is well connected by MRT throughout the shopping / hotel areas, this hotel is convenient to just about everything. Service is not as good as my #1 favorite, ICC BKK, but adequate. I didn't have time to check out the gym, as I took a couple of long walks to Chinatown to do some great shopping for souvenirs (probably a bit better than Orchard Road shopping due to the concentration and close proximity of all of the vendors).", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fife, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "lcd75", "ReviewID": "UR7595207", "Content": "Arrived morning time in Singapore but the staff were so friendly and had no bother checking us in early.

I did ask if there was any possibility that they would move us to a different room with at least a queen and I was told that they would look into it. The room was right at the far end of the hotel. It was quite run down and had sort off a musty smell. It was a spacious room and I could see it being nice 10 yrs ago. The bathroom was not well kept. The shower stall was horrific. There were mould caked in between the grout and the soap dish. Both of us slept on one twin bed for 4 nights. No one called about moving us to a different room. I am not a very demanding person and so I just let this slide. The last straw was when one of the managers left me a note while I was out requesting me to contact him. Apparently, I had stained one of their towels and they were going to charge me for it. Steve, I believe, even brought the towel to my room to show me the stain just in case I deny the atrocious act. It was a slight pink stain from my hair dye (manic panic). Not that I dyed my hair there, it happens when I wash my hair with hot water. I just can't believe the audacity of the staff. Not very 5 star I would say. I had no problems paying for the towel, I did not even argue with Steve about it, but my husband stepped in and ask them if they had tried washing it yet? It was a white towel and I believe you usually bleach them to keep them white? At this point Steve looked flustered. Why, it never occured to him to try that.. He quickly mentioned that they would try washing it and if the stain disappears I will not be charged. (S$50) Steve called around 10pm, cordially informing me that I will not be charged as the stain was removable, like as if he did me a great big favour.

Walking through the lobby indicated that porterage was often stretched .......... our experience particularly on checkout and later when returning to collect our luggage to go to the airport. A similar experience was found when we were seeking some pretty basic tourist information from the Concierge. One evening around 8:30pm we waited in the hotel taxi queue for about 45mins. Locals around us (and behind us in the queue) began making telephone bookings and were then leaving well before us. The porters did little to explain options or arrange an improved service .......... there are over 22,000 taxis in Singapore. For similar monies (slightly higher or lower) I suspect there may be some better options right now in Singapore", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location, Rooms, Meals and All Class\u201d", "Author": "Perthfamily", "ReviewID": "UR6621329", "Content": "The location of this hotel is perfect, as we love the Bugis area.

Overall, we rate it an exceptional facility. The team is extraordinary. The facilities are quite good, and the hotel is superbly situated in this wonderful city/state. Singapore is a shoppers haven. Mindful of this tradition, it is important that a visitor select a hotel that is situated conveniently to all major shopping areas -- the elite ones and those that cater to non-designer retailers. The Intercontinental Singapore suits all needs. It is walking distance to \"Arab Street,\" an area where vendors sell silk, wool and other fabrics by the meter. These merchants also peddle other clothing items and specialty pursuits. One also can walk to Little India, where many items are sold by local vendors and the food is exceptionally good and reasonable. A shopper also can walk down the street to the Raffles Hotel, and its continguous mall, for more upscale pursuits. Finally, an inexpensive cab ride will take you to retail heav\\en -- the Orchard Road and Scotts Road. We offer this observation at the outset because we noted the relatively remote location of other five-star hotels in Singapore. We also noted, by extreme contrast, the location of the Hyatt and the Marriott right in the middle of the heavy commercial foot and vehicular traffic. This hotel, and its location, offered a unique and convenient balance. We start with commentary about the positive aspects of this hotel. As noted by others, the breakfast buffet was exceptional. Freshly squeezed jiuces, wonderful breads and cereals, an array of fresh fruits, specially prepared items, and other nicely presented food items made for an outstanding experience. Everything was presented wonderfully. The staff -- the team -- was attentive, charming and committed to customer service. We especially liked Kelly, who was a charming, efficient and attentive waitress. The dining room was bright, clean and cheerful. It was neat, and inspired a sense that the team was dedicated to maintenance of a clean and healthy dining environment. The room was clean and well appointed. The best part was the predictable arrival of the housekeeper. She arrived to make the bed during the day and arranged it for the evening about the same time. Given recent experiences in the US, this is something that we should appreciate. After all, there is nothing worse than returning to a room only to discover that it has not been cleaned and made before mid-afternoon. We always found our room made and arranged when we returned during the afternoon. We also were able to predict the arrival of the housekeeper in the evening to turn the bed and otherwise arrange the setting. This may seem petty but it is a very nice feature in these times. The hotel staff -- the desk team, the concierage, the bar , the bell men, door persons were kind, attentive and determined to make your stay a fine experience. We cannot offer a single less-than-positive comment about them. Actually, they were at time quite entertaining. and attuned to your needs and preferences. The only negative comment I can offer is the price of the drinks at the hotel bar. They were twice the price of nearby facilities. Once I discovered this reality, I went elsewhere by foot or with dinner. Obviously, this is treated as a profit center. The hotel outdoor pool and fitness facilities are basic. Nothing exceptional here. They are available if you need them, but clearly no one associated with the hotel virews them as critical or esential features. The hotel offers spa and massage services. Take your time before making a commitment. There are plenty of spa and massage facilities thourghout Singapore that cost a fraction of the cost offered by the hotel team. Some are literally seconds away from the hotel property by foot. Singapore is a great city. It is extrremely clean and safe. Everything is convenient. The people -- the residents -- are delightful and friendly. Most things are reasonbably priced. Shopping is a cultural event. The zoo is a special event. If you stay at this hotel, take advantage of the package that includes the breakfast buffet. Walk down the street to Purvis Street -- minutes away -- for lunch or dinner at some nice (and clea) places. Survey the shops at the Raffles Hotel (an old guard British facility) for convenience. (The original Singapore Sling at the Long Bar is a tourist trap.) Do your real shiopping, however, on Orchard Road or Scotts Road. Be patient: survey first before you spend a dime. Be Job-like: bargain and br prepared to walk away in the local retail electronics and jewelry establishments. Outside the hotel, eat like a local. We found an Indian restaurant at the Albert Court Hotel (another old guard British spot) that served outstanding food for reasonable prices. Probe, explore and examine Little India, Chinatown, Arab Street and other ethnic retail areas for bargains and for good food. (The Apollo Banana Leaf restaurant is worth a visit -- once.) Don't worry about clothing in most of Singapore. Most upscale places permit entrance while casually dressed. Given the warm temperatures, this is quite understandable. Tailors are everywhere. We found a good one at 14 Scotts Road -- Intrend Fashions (Master Tailors). They promptly tailored our items from photographs we selected from magazines. The Takashimaya Mall belies Short Hills, The Somerset Collection and other upscale malls in the US. And, it is a short cab ride from the Intercontinental. It is worth a visit. In closing, I already plan to return to the Intercontinental Singapore. It truly is a world class hotel facility that serves the public through an experienced and focused team. We suggest that you go to this hotel once, and return often.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSpecial Trip\u201d", "Author": "Andrew_M_Charlton", "ReviewID": "UR6519907", "Content": "I returned for the second time to this great hotel, this time for my Mum's 60th Birthday trip.

I chose the hotel because it had an old-world charm to it. The check-in was smooth though mechanical. The front counter staff didn't seem to like to smile. I requested for a king, non-smoking deluxe room on a high floor and was allocated one on the 13th storey. The room was clean and adequately sized. The plus points of the room were: 1. The furniture and lamps had oriental designs which was unique compared to the standard chain-hotel rooms. 2. The LCD TV gave the room a modern look. I think the hotel upgraded the TVs recently. 3. The air-conditioning. Hotel Intercon is one of the few hotels that had a working thermostat which shows the desired and actual room temperatures. The most impressive item in the room is the toiletries. The hotel provides shower gel, soap, conditioner and shampoo supplied by L'OCCITANE en Provence, which provided a refreshing shower and bath. A peculiar point about the room: Most hotels have this energy saving gadget that requires guests to slot their key cards in to activate the room's power supply. Hotel Intercon has this plastic card that's permanently affixed to the gadget by a chain. The guest is requested to take the card out of the slot when leaving the room. I am not sure if the guests really do remember to remove the card, esp if the card is not their room key. The initiative to save energy might not be effective in this case. On the other hand, perhaps too many guests lock themselves out of the room when they leave their keycard in the energy saving gadget, which could be the reason for such an arrangement. The room service was prompt when I requested for an additional towel though I was amused to be given 6 new sets of towels when the room service staff turned up at my door. I tried the gym on the 3rd floor. It was adequately equipped and well serviced. The lockers in the gym's change rooms required guests to bring along their personal locks. The first time I used the gym, I forgot to bring a lock. The gym trainer suggested that I could leave my clothing at a corner of the gym and do my workout. I thought it was a weird suggestion but I did it anyways since I did not have any valuables with me. The gym had a jacuzzi. The jacuzzi was ok though a bit small. Could fit max 4 persons. The jacuzzi usage for males and females are split into different time periods i.e. at any one time, either males OR females are permited to use the jacuzzi, not both. For future guests, do check the timings for gents and ladies cause you won't want to be changed out to use the jacuzzi and realise that it's not the right time. The swimming pool on the 4th floor is equipped with a cold spa pool at the side. The lockers in the change room (a different room from the 3rd floor gym's) requires you to bring along a lock as well. Strangely, there was a sign in the change room indicating that locks were available upon request at the gym. Since I used the pool after the gym, I didn't bother to verify whether this was true. The bottomline is to make sure you bring along a lock before you use the change rooms. Food wise, breakfast is served at the Olive Tree. The breakfast buffet had a good spread of food. I liked the bacon, sausages, omelette and chocolate muffins. One problem that I had was with the signage that indicated the type of food at the buffet table. There were insufficient and confusing signages so one had to guess what was served. One sign read \"Peanut butter, butter, jam, ...\" and there were 6 saucers below the sign. You have to guess what's in each saucer and link it back to one of the items listed on the sign. Nevertheless, the breakfast was delicious so a room plus breakfast package at the hotel would be a good choice. Finally, the checkout was smooth. This time, a different front counter staff served me and was much more friendlier. She asked about my stay and recommended their restaurants for future patronage. Overall, my stay at the Hotel Intercon has achieved my objective to rejuvenate over the weekend. I would recommend it to tourists and locals alike.

We had booked via Intercon website which , as promised, had given best rate we could find. We arrived in Singapore and stayed with a friend for a couple of days and during this time we walked up to the Intercon one day and just decided to check we were booked in okay for our stay starting in a couple of days. The reception girl had one of those blank faces no matter what you said and how much you smiled and she appeared pretty young. She couldn't find our booking so went to another than another before finally finding it. We rang again on the morning of check in and found we were missing again. This time I decided to speak to reception on Club Incontinental floors where we were staying and I got a much smarter, older, more helpful staff member who said she would ring back. She did, problem solved, there had been a typo with our surname and a new system introduced at the same time so double trouble. There was even a letter apologising re any check in problems due to system change when we did get into our room on the day. Having said that, the rest of our stay was a dream come true. Every staff member always had a smile for us, the taxi doormen and door lady were always friendly, efficient and happy to offer advice on other matters as well as the helpful concierges near front desk. Club Incontinental lounge with great breakfast, all day coffee/tea and soft drinks and 5.30pm to 7.30pm free beer, wine, champagne and canapes was an absolute must, even if we were going out for dinner later.

The lounge bar is glorious with the exorbitant prices that, unfortunately, I expect from a five star hotel. We didn't have time for the pool but, it looked good from our bedroom. The location is perfect for Bugis Street and only a five minute walk to Raffles and Raffles City. The only two slight reservations are the charges for internet access S$0.25 per minute and the long wait for taxis in the early evening. The latter is a problem of the city, the former is just a con on the hotel's part. Many other locations offer this service for free so the Itercontinenral Group need to review their policies. We didn't let this dampen our stay and ww would gladly come again.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "theWill", "ReviewID": "UR5148287", "Content": "was there just recently and really enjoyed the ic singapore. it was in a great location and a nice walk to everything. the staff, namely the bell, could be a bit friendlier and the rooms could use a bit of an update but besides that it was a very nice hotel, especially the bathrooms!", "Date": "May 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire england", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience at the Intercontinental, full of character and luxury\u201d", "Author": "Dreaming_of_Elysium", "ReviewID": "UR5065162", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights on our outward journey to Austrailia and found it a delightfull place to stay. We arrived at about 9 am and were quickly checked in and shown to our room immediately with no extra charge (much appreciated after a 14 hour journey from England). The hotel feels very homely because the foyer is not huge and impersonal, and it never felt busy at any time during our stay. The staff were friendly and efficient and always had a smile and a hello for us. The feel of the hotel is old world charm with lots of wood , flowers and antiques, and felt luxourious without being intimidating or too glitzy. Our room on the 15th floor had a great view towards the Marina and over the roof tops of Raffles and was charming and well appointed, with really comfortable large twin beds with space in between and all around. The bathroom was marble with a great mirror and separate shower cubicle. Breakfast was very good in a light filled atriium , a lovely way to start the day. Pool area is a little small and is shaded by the building untill about 11.30am so no sunbathing in the morning which was a problem on the days we were there as it was only sunny until the daily heavy showers about 3pm. Only gripe... late checkout as promised in the luxury weekend deal we had was not , as we thought ,automatically included, we had to wait untill the day of departure to have it confirmed , and only got till 2pm when we begged ( Raffles plaza gave us till 3pm on an ordinary week nite without quibble or charge, immediately on check in). But all in a great comfortable hotel with the added attraction of a lively shopping area attached and colourfull Bugis St market just across the road for a less sanitised shoppping experience if you want it. Would stay again if I could get the same advance room rate, which was very cheap at \u00a372.00 a night booked direct through the Intercontinental web site.", "Date": "May 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cComfortable - good base\u201d", "Author": "RJK69", "ReviewID": "UR4989815", "Content": "Check-in handled well - allocated 5th floor rooms.

I had an early flight from Mumbai and I got to the hotel at 7:30 AM. I was expecting to use their left luggage service until I could check in, but they gave me a room that early, which was fantastic. They apologised because it had 2 single beds instead of one, but they were big enough. The room was spacious, clean and looked great, just like the hotel as a whole. Their gym is open 24 hours a day, which is something I've never seen anywhere else. As a footnote, I pre-paid the room, and discovered that for some reason they had charged 6 nights instead of one. But I told them and they immediately debited my card. I paid 95 Euro, which I think is a reasonable price for such a hotel. I really enjoyed my stay in Singapore, and I'll certainly return to this hotel as soon as I have a chance to come back to this beautiful city/country.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, UK", "Title": "\u201cdidnt stay\u201d", "Author": "RichardB100", "ReviewID": "UR4627146", "Content": "Booked a room wanted to check in at 9am and check out at 9pm the next.
