{"Reviews": [{"Content": "don't go there if you want some sleep I arrived pretty late at night at the hostal and the reception was still open. Although there were just 2 of us, we booked a triple room for 70 Euros a night (basin and shower in the room, shared toilet). Our room had a good size and was clean. BUT: there is one major problem: the doorbell. The hostal is diveded into 2 sections: 1, where the breakfast room is and another one were the reception is. I was in one of the rooms, were the reception was. As the reception is open all night long (which first was an advantage for us) and as they don't give out keys for the main door downstairs, everybody who is coming back late has to ring the door bell which is so loud, that you think it is in your room. Furthermore the walls are very thin and you understand each word of your neighbours. this is due to the fact, that the hostal earlier was a normal apartment and also the doors are very thin and not those of a hotel. I didn't sleep for 3 nights. This might not be a problem for those that come to Barcelona for partying, but for me who was there for some sightseeing it was a problem. Still...for the price we paid I probably can't complain, as housing in Barcelona is quite expensive. I would probably also return there, but only if they guarantee me a room in the part of the breakfast room.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR324674192", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Zetti"}, {"Content": "Very Central, clean and cheap \u9686\u9686       our beds", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR163765734", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HostalCentral"}, {"Content": "Excellent place for private rooms...
