We wanted to purchase some show tickets and thought you could possibly just buy them there for convienence. The first thing I asked to man is if there was a catch and do we have to attend a timeshare presentation. He said no, all you have to do is go to such and such place to pick up your tickets. Unfortunately I believed him and never read the receipt he folded and handed to my husband. After I read the fine print about sitting through a 90min presentation I was aggravated but decided well we are saving money. The 90 min presentation was really 2 hours. After the presentation a high pressure salesperson who was very rude and offensive sat with us and treated us terribly b/c we weren't interested. Please Clarion and all customers go online and read the terrible reviews about VSA-Vacation Services of America.

We had a king size room on the 6th floor with a view of the pool area. Every room has a balcony which is a nice addition, and there are two white plastic chairs on each one. The pool seems to be always open and I would encourage that if you are on this side of the hotel to get a room towards the top of the hotel. We could not hear any noise from the pool but I'm sure the lower rooms could be affected by this. The room is a good size, king size bed, 2 night-stands, a desk with a black leather desk chair and a good size arm chair. The room also has an entertainment center with a large flat screen tv and a fridge. The bathroom is small and extremely outdated. The sink and vanity are separated from the toilet and bathtub but the toilet/bathtub space is so tiny it is a tight fit getting in and out. There is maybe an inch of space where the door clears the toilet. This hotel also offers free breakfast at the buffet next door, Saddie's. The first day, this was fine. But having to endure this restaurant 2 more times was torture. There is no variety at the buffet, same thing everyday. Pancakes (that I think were made of rubber because I needed a knife to cut them...) biscuits and gravy, grits, oatmeal, bacon, sausage, ham, cereal and a selection of canned fruits. Nothing seemed homemade to me, tasted like everything was from a frozen bag or a can. It would be much nicer if there was a rotation of items. But I do need to add that the staff was always very helpful and courteous and were always working very hard. No slackers here. There is also live music, which is a nice touch, unless of course you want to talk to the people you are having breakfast with... The reason I say this hotel is just average because there really needs to be a remodel. The room just feels very dated. The vanity for example still has the older mini-fridge in it that is no longer working, that is just an eye sore. The wood is very dark and dated and just gives the general impression of many years of dirt and grime. You can really tell where the hotel has tried to make cosmetic changes, new tv and larger fridge in the newer entertainment cabinet, a curved shower curtain and I'm guessing a newer mattress because they were quite comfortable. You can tell because these small changes really stand out, but the rest is lack-luster.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and friendly.\u201d", "Author": "cupcake0512", "ReviewID": "UR134004290", "Content": "We had a great time.

We have stayed in rooms throughout the hotel ( the suites are our favorite) and every room has been spotless. We stayed in a double queen this time with a balcony overlooking the pool, my kids loved that.The rooms are very modern and the beds are always very comfortable. The hotel has the cleanest pools and that is a must for us because our kids love to swim. This hotel has an indoor and outdoor pool as well as two hot tubs and are great places to relax after a long day of visiting Branson's attractions. The complimentary breakfast is now located at Sadies Sideboard and my family really enjoyed it, biscuits and gravy, bacon, country ham, sausage, pancakes, cereal, fruit, ect., if you leave hungry it is your own fault. Coffee and water is complimentary, my kids had small juices which are a dollar and is a bargain with such a great breakfast. There is also an entertainer at Sadies who sings country songs every morning which we really enjoyed . The hotel has many places on the property to relax and all the amenities you could want and is located in the center of the 76 strip and within walking distance to many attractions. The only two negatives would be that my kids love the hotel so much that its sometimes hard to get them to leave the hotel so we can tour Branson and when our vacation is over and we have to leave.

There was a sign in the lobby indicating remodeling was afoot, but that it should not interfere with our stay. I'm not quite sure what is being done, but I detected a wonky smell the second I entered the lobby. Paint? Adhesives? Not sure. Fortunately that smell didn't follow us to the 7th floor \"penthouse\" suite. I didn't receive the same genuinely warm welcome as our last stay. The clerk seemed more concerned with our license plate number than anything else. I'm pretty easy to get along with, but honestly, this woman impressed me as so not wanting to be there. Oh, the license plate obsession? Apparently, it has to do with parking lot accidents and I suppose people claiming a car had been hit that wasn't even registered. Not 100% sure. Oddly enough, at checkout (when a different clerk was much warmer), indeed a guest had just reported hitting a car in the lot. Kudos to this young man for reporting it; bad news for the hotel employee whose car he had hit. This being said, be aware that this is a very sloped parking lot (particularly at the front of the hotel) and try to park as close to where you can access your room as possible. The penthouse level (7th floor - front building) has 6 rooms, and I don't think one lick of improvement/upgrade had been done since our last visit. An argument could be made that lots of people don't use these rooms I suppose, and it hasn't been needed. But I hope at some point they at least change out the turquoise and white wallpaper which still clashes with the deep red bedspread and valances (I shudder to think a hotel doesn't change out spreads over 2 1/2 years, although it appeared clean and undamaged.) The spa tub in the bedroom rather than the bathroom still sported a dangly artificial plant on its ledge. I suggest removal. Otherwise, the room was clean and quiet, and the mini-fridge and microwave were appreciated. I felt sorry for the guests this particular weekend who were in rooms close to the college students who claimed the outdoor pool area (beer aplenty on the tables). They made their presence known well into the night as well, but 7 floors up, it wasn't troublesome. Regarding the breakfast, I don't know it Sadie's next door is a temporary or permanent arrangement; but I suspect a weekday experience would be more positive. It was fairly crowded the Saturday we were there (passed on it the following day and headed to Bob Evans). The breakfast was satisfactory despite some very greasy bacon (passed on that) and inclusion of only coffee and water (the cheerful and attentive waitress did bring me hot tea at no extra charge). Even continental breakfasts include juice and milk, so this seemed a bit chintzy. The milk by the dry cereal had a stern sign warning not to use the milk for drinking! Ha! Also, we had barely started to eat when a guy started to sing to recorded music! His tip jar was conveniently placed, and he mentioned his cds were available for purchase several times! I know this is Branson, and people are hawking timeshares and such at every turn, but I could've done without this. The hotel still has a desirable location smackdab in the middle of the strip (yes, tornado damage was evident as one drove W from 65...and, yes, traffic still is challenging).

Both of these stays were in the tower facing highway 76, and were hotel (indoor corridors), balcony rooms. We loved these rooms and looked forward to staying again. I booked online and requested a balcony room well ahead of our travel date. When we arrived, there were two busloads of teenagers. I asked if we were on the same floor as the teenagers. The answer was no, they were in a different building. In addition to the tower with balconies, there is a very large, 4-story building behind this one, but with outdoor corridors, motel style. I assumed the teens would be in that building, and we were in the balcony rooms. As my travel partners unloaded the van, the clerk told me to stop them, that we were in the building behind the main one (the motel building), and the huge group of teens were in the main building. We were not happy, since I specifically requested a balcony room, but decided to make the best of it. The clerk proceeded to tell us to drive around back, stop at the entrance to the other building, go in and get a cart to unload (which is about 50 feet from the door), take the cart up the elevator to the 4th floor, then to the room. This entrance is very cramped, with a sharp turn to get to the elevator. Driving the luggage cart down the hill to load the car, then back up, through the small lobby, and around the corner to the elevator is no easy task. Once you are on the floor, it is even harder to get the cart out of the elevator landing and onto the very, very small outside walkway to get to your room. The luggage cart and the maid's cart most definitely do not both fit, and when were leaving, the maid had to completely back her cart into another room to let us pass. She did not act too happy about having to interrupt her cleaning to do this. I would imagine this happens to her many, many times a day. When we got to our room, I found a hair on the sheets, but otherwise it seemed clean. The bathroom area with the toilet and tub shower are the smallest I have ever seen in this nice of a hotel. TINY!! A large man would most definitely NOT be comfortable in this small room. The lavatory was outside of the toilet/tub area, and the microwave and coffee tray were both on the sink countertop, which itself was not large, leaving no room for makeup cases, blow dryers, curling irons etc. We ended up turning the microwave sideways and moving the coffee maker. There is not a closet in this room, but instead a large portable wardrobe, which takes up much needed space. I will not stay at this hotel/motel again until they change their online booking to where you can choose a balcony hotel room versus a very small motel room. The price is the same, and this is ridiculous. The motel is very large, and it is a long walk to get to some of these rooms, (probably 15 rooms on each level). I often travel with my elderly mother and we have stayed here in the hotel part, but she could not make the walk to a room in the motel section. It is very small and very, very inconvenient. Unless you call the hotel directly and confirm you will have a balcony room I do NOT recommend staying here. On a positive note, the beds are very comfortable.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cBest Stay Always\u201d", "Author": "vacaRus", "ReviewID": "UR57443732", "Content": "We always in enjoy this hotel!

Not wanting to risk getting to town & finding \"No Vacancies\" (Been there...done that...don't want to do it again.) I did my research before booking by reading the reviews. I choose the Clarion for 2 reasons. First, it was one of only 2 hotels I could find that had a fridge & microwave in the double queen rooms. (The other being the Clarion's sister hotel Comfort Inn & Suites. We would be traveling with a 3 year old, so a fridge was my main priority in looking for a room since I thought it would be beneficial for milk & juice.) Secondly, the Clarion seemed to have good reviews & the pictures looked really nice. When you book online there is a space to make any special requests. I requested a \"room with a balcony\". I understood that the request was not a guarantee, & that the request would not be viewed by hotel staff until our check-in. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk didn't even acknowledge our request. (No, we didn't get a balcony.) It would have been nice for her to at least mention that she noticed we wanted a balcony, but they didn't have any balcony rooms available. Instead she proceeded to give us all of our info papers & the map of the property. She told us we were in the \"North tower\" & that we needed to drive around back to get to our room. I assumed the \"North tower\" was just like the main building w/ indoor corridor room access & would have balconies too. WRONG. I was disappointed to find that the \"North tower\" was just a normal looking motel w/ outside walkways & room access. Nothing at all like the photos posted on the Clarion website. Nowhere did I ever see a photo of the \"North tower\". It wasn't a big deal that we didn't get a balcony because I knew not all rooms would have them, but I did think the entire hotel would have indoor access (which I prefer), so that annoyed me. Also, I don't think the rooms in the \"North tower\" should cost the same as the rooms in the main building. We used the AARP discount, so maybe everyone who gets a discount or uses a coupon gets kicked back to the \"North tower\". I don't know, but online there is no indication that the buildings have different rates regardless of discounts or coupons. The room itself was about what I expected. We typically stay in mid-grade hotels, so this room was about typical to what we're used to. The big complaint was the bathroom size. It was the SMALLEST (& I do mean SMALL) bathroom I've ever seen in a hotel room. I noticed some others had commented on the bathroom size before I booked, but I didn't think it could be that bad. I was wrong. It was annoying. You could barely close the door without bumping the toilet. If you had the bathmat on the floor & then tried to open or close the door it would scrunch up the bathmat because there wasn't even enough clearance. Another annoyance was that there was not an ice machine on our floor (4th), so you had to go up or down 1 floor to get ice. The outdoor walkway was so narrow that if the maid had her cart out it was difficult to get past especially if you were carrying luggage. It would have been impossible to get by with the luggage cart. There was only 1 elevator at one end of the walkway, so if you couldn't get past the maid's cart with your luggage you'd have to take the stairs at the other end of the walkway. I will give them credit for having comfortable beds & pillows. No complaints there. The pillows & comforter were down which I considered a little more \"up-scale\" than most hotel bedspreads & pillows in this price range. Housekeeping did a good job re-stocking the towels, tissue, & soap. No complaints there either. Breakfast was average. Nothing fabulous, but they did have some \"warm options\" if you didn't want just donuts or fruit. We didn't use the restaurant, pools, or gym facilities so I have no comment on them. Also, while some may enjoy being on the \"strip\" & within walking distance of some restaurants & theaters, that really wasn't a big selling point to us. We didn't walk anywhere, & in the future I would prefer not to be in the middle of the hustle & bustle. All in all it wasn't a terrible experience, but we won't be back to the Clarion. I'm sure of all the hotels in Branson we can find something as good or better for the money that's not on the \"strip\".", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "interviewtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR23204495", "Content": "We picked this hotel because it looked so pretty on the outside.

I was not disappointed! Our kids ages, 11,10,4 and 2 all had a great time. They enjoyed both pools. My only complaints would be this: They need to hire someone to monitor the outdoor pool. The fountain in the middle was an open invitation for some kids to climb on and jump off(despite a number of warnings from employees passing by). Also they seemed to like to put their hands over the spout so that when they released them the water would shoot out harder. This got to be quite annoying, since my 2 and 4 year old both dont like water in their faces. It made it impossible for us to enjoy the outdoor pool as much as we would have liked to. Perhaps I am to strict with my children, but I thought the parents were a little to preocupied to really care what their kids were doing and who they might be bothering. Also, on our 3rd morning there we were pretty much forced to carry our breakfast back to our rooms.(It was that or eat outside in the heat) They had a conference booked and the breakfast room that was so big and acomidating on our first 2 mornings, was now only big enough to serve about 50 people. I would suggest that if they want to hold conferences there that they build a different building specifically for that purpose. Other then those two things, I really cant complain. My husband is military so we got the military rate, which is awesome compared to others we priced! Our room, while not huge, was big enough for the 6 of us. When you think about it, your only there to sleep right? The hotel was right in the middle of everything. The rooms were clean and well supplied. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful! My husband and I both enjoyed the small balcony, and it was great for hanging our towels to dry. Since our room had a fridge and a microwave we went to the local Walmart and grabbed some cheap soft drinks and snacks. The selection on the televison channels is not huge, and if you have younger kids they may be disappointed that there is no Disney channel. I know mine were. But we kept them pretty busy and tired so they didnt notice after that first morning! One thing I would suggest if you have a bigger family is Papa Grands pizza buffett.

We booked through the hotel website, which turned out to be cheaper than booking with an online agency, such as Expedia or Orbitz. The room was very nice with a private balcony, as well as a microwave and mini refrigerator. There were plenty of big, fluffy towels and a nice fluffy bathmat. The breakfast is fine for those who want something like muffins, cereal, donuts, etc. We chose to eat at the Hard Luck Diner, which is next door. The prices are good and they have singing servers. Buckingham's Restaurant was fabulous. We would like to compliment our server, Hana. She was excellent. The food was freshly cooked and worth the wait. We had a lovely meal in a private booth. The wine and food is fairly priced and high quality. For those who prefer all you can eat and burgers and fries - go elsewhere. There are plenty of choices a few steps from the hotel. We did not use the indoor/outdoor pools or jacuzzi but they looked great and were quite large, as hotel pools go. There is also a lounge off the lobby with complimentary coffee and a computer with internet access. The hotel also has 24 hour security.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kahului, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "Pathleader", "ReviewID": "UR10654682", "Content": "Very good beds, pool is large and staff is friendly.

Rode the \"Ducks\", go-karts, and had a great time at the Landing. Nighttime light and music show is super. The real show was the \"Buckets and Boards\" street performance team though. Stick around if you see these two guys setting up! Our room at the Clarion was great. Clean, fairly quiet, and no smell of smoke anywhere. Even though we were close to the lobby, access to the pool and exercise room was convenient. Kids had a blast in the outdoor pool and hot tub. Didn't have time to spend any time at the indoor pool though. I would definitely stay here again. Only gripe I have is with the attached Buckingham's restaurant. With two kids, the dinner service was unbearably slow (over an hour before any food was presented). When our steaks came out, they were lukewarm. Not undercooked--just had been sitting on a counter somewhere for way too long. Coming from Kansas City I'm used to at least a little bit of \"sizzle\" when my ribeye comes out of the kitchen. Not even a little steam on this one. Probably the worst $100 meal I've had in recent memory. Go to Sadie's buffet next door--best country cookin' you'll find, and it costs next to nothing.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ks", "Title": "\u201cLoved it with one exception\u201d", "Author": "tird", "ReviewID": "UR8284512", "Content": "We stayed 4 days this July.We took our 9 year old Grandson.This was a first stay for us.We enjoyed are stay and will stay again.The rooms were clean and they had a great air conditioner I like my room cold.I asked if they could have the air conditioner on when we arrived as I have a medical condition and the heat bothers me.I hate going into a room that is hot, then you have to go somewhere to let the room cool off.But the air conditioner was on and it was nice and cool in the room.The pools are great and you can go at any time and swim.I have stayed at other hotels where they closed the pool early but not here.I loved being able to hang our wet bathing suiets on the balcony to dry I hate haveing them in the bathroom they never get dry.The halls smelled so good except a few days and I could smell cigarette smoke, where it use to be a smokeing establishment.You cant smoke in your rooms but people do at the pool and on there balconies.The brekfast was good but after 3 days you get a little sick of the same thing .They served doughnuts,cereal, biscuits and gravy.You could make your own waffles which were very good.They had fruit and of course your usually juices.I was dissapointed in the TV selection.They didnt carry that many stations and when we werent going to a show or swimming there was nothing to watch.My Grandson was borried with the cartoon channel which was all they had for children.You also can order food from the oasis restaurant and eat pool side which my Grandson enjoyed.The only staff that was rude was the man working in the oasis restaurant.He could use some instructions in being cordial.I liked being close to the shows and we walked to 2 ot them from the hotel.All in all we loved it and will stay again.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "OP", "Title": "\u201cNice for the Price\u201d", "Author": "KayGeePC", "ReviewID": "UR8117987", "Content": "If you want no frills clean and comfortable, this is it.

This was one of our most pleasant stays. Our only disappointment was we had reservations for the North Tower and due to a overbooking of rooms had to stay in the South Tower the first night instead. The rooms were OK there however we preferred the other building. The Manager bent over backwards to get us into the North tower the next night since we did prefer the view and the outdoor balcony that these rooms offered. In this building you also have rooms available with King beds and Suites. If you are picky on your pillows and beds, this is the place to stay. We forgot our pillows that we usually bring but were pleased that we did not need them. We also liked the rooms having both a refrigerator and micro waive in them. They were doing some remodeling and putting on a new roof which made it a little inconvenient to get in and out but this was not a major problem and I believe has now been corrected. This was suppose to be a non smoking facility so don't know if some folks were smoking in the hallways or elevators and did not care for that factor however the staff was diligent to try to remedy this. The continental breakfast was above par for Branson and the room was very nice where they had it. They also offered a discount coupon for Sadies next door for a full spread at $2.95 if desired. They had both a great indoor and outdoor pool and thought that the outdoor pool was one of the nicest in Branson. It made you feel more like you were at a resort. We will definitely stay there again and the hospitality was great. The positives by far outweighed any negatives that were incurred during our trip.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNonsmoking room smelled like smoke!\u201d", "Author": "WendyMO", "ReviewID": "UR8043440", "Content": "I booked this hotel off of the reviews from Tripadviser. We first stayed at the new Hilton Promenade on Branson Landing and fell in love with this new hotel. When we checked into this hotel, the outdoor pool area looked better than the only indoor Hilton pool, however we were quickly wishing we were back at the Hilton once we were in the rooms. The balconies are nice but my kids thought the room smelled like \"puppy chow\". There is no option for relaxing in your room and renting a movie- there is no pay movies. Quite disappointing for a family that wanted to watch a movie together. The room wasn't bad, just out dated. The color schemes, bedding and furniture were adequate but nothing to write home about. The bathroom was the worst- the door would not shut all the way- only as far as the middle of the toilet seat. For the little bit more money that the Hilton charges, we went back for the remainder of our stay.
