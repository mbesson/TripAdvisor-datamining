Alt Tempelhof is spotlessly clean and comfortable. It is not luxury but has all amenities that you would want, is safe and secure and conveniently located near public transportation that quickly takes you to all sights. There is an optional breakfast buffet but also a diversity of very nice places to eat all meals within a few blocks of the hotel. I would happily stay here again, it is excellent value and a reliably comfortable and secure place to stay.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201c\".....Best hotel in Europe\"\u201d", "Author": "Woehlk79", "ReviewID": "UR38005393", "Content": "Considering the price this must be the best hotel that I ever have stayed on in Europe. The room was clean and of a high standard, with AC, TV, safedepositbox and mini bar. There is a big public outdoor parking lot beside the hotel, where you can park for free, the hotel also have an underground parking lot, this one you have to pay for. We parked outside, without any problems. The Hotel is situated just opposite from \u201cAlt Tempelhof\u201d U-Bahn station, this means that you can be in the city center within 15 min. This is really a great hotel, with great rooms, friendly staff and a great location only 10-15 minutes away from the hectic city center.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cnice little hotel but bad internet system\u201d", "Author": "a-humming-bird", "ReviewID": "UR10010304", "Content": "It is a nice and clean little hotel.

There was some protection which would not allow our laptop to connect. So, we ended up not able to check email or use internet.

They arrived the last day I was staying at the Hotel Berlin. However ,when the package arrived, one of the front desk personnel refused the package and it was sent back to the fed-x office. My name was clearly printed on the label of the package. All the front desk needed to do was check the hotel guest list. In stead she lied to me when I inquired about the package and told me nothing had arrived. I had very little time to retrieve it and had to take a train to the fed-x office. The train required more money than I realized so I had to give them my passport number and info. This caused more of a delay and consequently I had no more time to get to the fed-x before my other train left for the next destination. This caused a chain reaction of events and stress on me that were not necessary. I never was able to retrieve my package and my family was out the expense of sending it to me. I have never forgotten this major inconvenience to me and my family and would like for this hotel to go on record for their unprofessionalism. I still do not know why an employee would do this to a guest. They had no concern of the expense and trouble it caused me and my family. I would not recommend the Hotel Berlin to anyone!", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Alt Tempelhof", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199387-Reviews-Hotel_Alt_Tempelhof-Berlin.html", "Price": "$84 - $143*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Luise-Henriette-Strasse 4</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12103</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199387", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/83/da/83da195f3a02253c498b59fcd24aca514large.jpg"}}
