However, we didn't feel the love during our stay. The problems began on our arrival, about 8:30pm. Upon entering the hotel lobby, we found no one at the front desk to check us in. Despite ringing the bell on the counter twice, we were standing at the desk for more than 5 minutes before a male and female employee slowly sauntered into the lobby from the direction of the hotel restaurant. I'm standing at the desk, holding a printout of my confirmation, and the female asks without apology, \"can I help you?\" Anyway, she finds my reservation and says they will set up our romance package immediately. To their credit, by the time I retrieved our bags from the car and located our room, they had delivered a small tray with 6 chocolate-dipped strawberries and a chilled bottle of Mondavi white zin. The strawberries were delicious. However, the wine was NOT the romantic bottle of \"sparkling wine\" I expected. It also wouldn't have been our wine of choice, had we known we were getting wine instead of the advertised sparkling wine. The room itself was clean, but small, and I liked that it had a refrigerator and microwave. The bed was nice enough, but too soft for our liking. However, what made sleep the most difficult was the thin walls. While the neighborhood is quiet, we could hear every sound coming from the adjoining rooms. Thank goodness no one was having a \"religious experience\" that night. The next morning, I went down to get some of the featured Starbucks coffee from the free coffee setup near the front desk. There, I found myself waiting in line behind a couple of hotel employees, who were also getting their morning coffee. After enjoying coffee in our room, we went to the small hotel restaurant for our included breakfast. When I showed the courteous waitress our breakfast vouchers, she took away our menus and returned with a 4x6 inch piece of paper on which had been copied a list of the breakfast items we could order. The list included omelets, bacon/ham and potatoes. We were also invited to help ourselves to items from the continental breakfast bar. All 'n all, breakfast was tasty and adequate, if not extraordinary. We checked out with no further incident. However, we won't be returning to this property, and in the future will seek romance elsewhere. \"Romance Package\" (excerpt from hotel website) During your stay, you'll enjoy: In-room sparkling wine or cider upon arrival. Full breakfast for two in the hotel's designated restaurant.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinetop, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cgood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "podoho", "ReviewID": "UR126785050", "Content": "this is a nice hotel set back away from I-17 in a business park setting - clean, quiet, with a good breakfast buffet for around 10 bucks - well worth it", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in North Phoenix\u201d", "Author": "2MoMyPa", "ReviewID": "UR126148242", "Content": "We stayed one night at the Hilton Garden Inn on Pinnacle Road in mid February. I think it is a fairly new hotel judging on the surrounding area. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed.

The breakfast was fantastic with great service as you could order a la carte or serve yourself at the buffet. Great way to start the day. When we reserved online, the price with breakfast was the same as the price without breakfast so definitely take the breakfast. It was $10.99 each for the buffet. My only negative comment about the hotel was the pricing at the bar. I ordered 1 (regular Bud) beer and 2 Bailey's on the rocks and the bill was over $21 (plus tip). The Bailey's were $6 each and they seem to treat the 'rocks' as a mix since they charged $1.50 more for each drink.

Granted, I don't travel frequently enough to be one of their uppity-ups, I usually get free bottles of water when I check in. Not this time. When my family and I arrived in Phoenix, it was very late, so sleep was the only thing on our minds. In the morning, my daughter was \"starving\" so we headed to the lobby where I was informed that breakfast was an additional charge. Huh? Since when? Not that paying for her breakfast was any sort of issue, however, as an Honors Member (Silver) I haven't paid for a meal in a Hilton in ages. When I asked if they had my number on file I was politely told no, so up to my room I went to retrieve my card. When I returned to the desk, the young lady explained that I was now Blue (not Silver) and had no more points. No breakfast for us! Bummer. And no bottled water either :( LOL. Shame on Hilton for not telling me that they took away my points. And my color. Coming from the DC area, I knew that the heat would fry me like an egg, so it was off to run on the treadmill in the exercise room. Well \"room\" is an overstatement. It is an exercise closet with NO air movement at all. Half the time that we stayed there (6 days) there were a bunch of teenagers from a sports team that used it as a place to watch TV. I didn't even bother complaining, I pick my battles. The only thing that we really couldn't get used to was the water. Have you ever tried to rinse the water off of the water that's on your skin? You will at the Hilton. It's the water softener. What a nightmare. Shampoo bottles flying everywhere because they were \"slickery\"... Skin that doesn't feel clean... I will take hard water any day, thank you very much. As for the rest of it, it was ok. The hotel is a stone's throw from a nice area, and a breath from the eh, not so nice area. I didn't use the hotel pool or hot tub because my parents have a better one :) Oh, and one of the teenagers had a nasty open sore on her arm and was headed to the pool. ICK!

We live in the Phoenix area and were doing a sunrise hot air ballon ride in this part of Phoenix, so we decided to make a weekend out of it. The hotel was nice, the room was clean and looks just like the pics on here. The bed was comfortable. We had a king bed in our room. There was also a desk/desk chair, arm chair w/ foot stool, microwave, small refrig, and flat panel TV. The bathroom was roomy, there is no tub (ok with me), and the shower is tiled in with a glass door. There was only one odd thing about the bathroom, the toilet paper holder was located under the sink (mounted there), so you had to lean over and look for them. It was just very odd spot. I guess they did it to not put a hole in the granite sink. The pool area is small, but adequate. The pool is heated. They do have a restaurant on site, but we didn't eat there. There is a nice little patio area with a gas fire place also. Good for sitting outside in the evening. The fitness room had nicer equipment in it. We didn't use the business center, but it looked adequate. They do have free wifi. The staff we friendly, however we did have one issue. We booked our first night on Expedia, then added two additional nights (through Expedia again) for a total of 3 nights. We asked on checkin to make sure they were all linked so we didn't have to check in and out or move rooms. We checked in around 6p for the first night and that person said that it was taken care of, but check with the front desk in the morning. I spoke with the front desk the next morning, and we weren't linked. They had to issue us new keys and said we were taken care of. The next day, we were locked out of our room and had to visit the front desk again and ended up with yet another set of keys. They said they had called us to leave us a msg, to let us know, but there was no msg. Plus it should have already been taken care one of the other two times we spoke with them about it. They were very friendly the whole time, it was just a minor inconvenience that should have been pretty simple to take care of in the first place. The hotel seems like it's in the middle of nothing, but there are tons of places to eat very close. Also a nice outdoor mall with a movie theater.

UPSIDES: - Staff goes out of their way to be helpful, it has good security, a super clean \"new feel\" to rooms and public areas, and a nice, contemporary/friendly business traveler vibe to guests hanging in the bar and restaurant. - While there's not too many restaurants close by there's mini-pantry for sodas and frozen meals(there's microwaves and refrigerators in each room), a very happening bar, free spa water and cookies in the lobby, a decent restaurant w/ good food and room service available. So, no matter what time you arrive you can eat and settle in easily. -The other services are comprehensive and good, too. Free wifi and morning paper, good gym, small but functional outdoor pool/hottub, business center and on-site washing machines for if you've been on the road for awhile. - I saw others complained about the bed, but mine was GREAT, and they may not have realized there's an adjustment on the mattress where you can make it firmer or softer on each side. I also didn't have a problem w/ the AC that others mentioned. Mine was easy to adjust and not loud at all - despite it being 110 degrees outside. POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES AND TIPS: - TIP: Ask for a room away from the elevator. My room was a couple down from the elevator hallway, but the \"ding\" on it is pretty loud and woke me up as others left in the morning before me. - My room had a large double sized shower only - I quite liked it.

After many hours of driving and getting lost in the area of Carefree, AZ. due to my lack of preparation and not having my own vehicle with navigation (or a map) I found this quiet but lovely hotel. I was road weary and exhausted when I checked in after 11pm but was greeted with a smile by Amanda. I got what I thought was a great rate, $99 for the night. I bought some Visine and a bottle of Chardonnay in the shop next to the front desk and headed off to my 1st floor room after she had asked me what my floor preference was. Being so exhausted I had a bit of trouble with the a/c (my fault I didn't see the panel on the wall) I called down to the front desk and Amanda was at my door to fix the problem in a few minutes. Great service! The room was decorated in attractive subtle blue and earth tones with luxurious white down bedding. A large flatscreen TV that swiveled to fit any seating position within the room was in the center with a microwave and desk and a nice sitting chair in the corner. The bathroom was attractive and sparkling clean with a granite counter, extra towels and Neutrogena bath products. The next morning I stopped by the lobby for a coffee to go and met 2 smiling employees working in the breakfast area. I didn't get their names but they were quite friendly and helpful. I was sad that I had to head back to Las Vegas so soon. If I ever find a need to be in the Phoenix area again I will most certainly return to this hotel.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cHilton hits the mark - great hotel\u201d", "Author": "MightyMick", "ReviewID": "UR14361761", "Content": "Highly recommend this hotel.

I stayed that the Hilton Garden Inn Happy Valley for a few days while on a business trip. This hotel is definitely designed with the business traveler in mind, including a nice workout area, laundry service, bar and a single restaurant offering various dining options throughout the day. Overall I was very pleased with my stay, and would consider it above average when compared to other hotels of its type. The bathrooms were nice with stand-up tiled showers, and the rooms were spacious with a 40 or so inch high-def television. Free internet is offered throughout the property, as well as other various amenities. My one complaint would be the thinness of the walls - but I cant complain too much about it as this is not a 4 or 5 star property. There is a pool and jacuzzi but I did not use it due to the mild weather during my stay. There is also a nice patio area for dining / drinks alfresco.
