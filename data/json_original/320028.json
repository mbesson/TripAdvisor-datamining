It is very budget and basic. We booked the Garden Villa and although spacious, it looked very tired and dated, so we upgraded (yes we had to pay) to the Pool Suite which is very nice. Hard mattress and pillows though.There were a lot of renovations happening while we were there which was really disappointing. The pizzeria right next to the pool was being worked on, cornered off by fibro sheets and the occasional chainsaw and hammering as background music while we tried to relax at the pool.The Tennis courts were being renovated so not in use.Then they decided to empty out the pond that surrounded the restaurant which was messy and smelly from old water and dying coy fish.Outside the resort is dirty, crumbling concrete fences, a new holiday inn resort being built opposite, there were bull dozers and machinery on the beach and emptied shops used as rubbish dumps in between the Rama and the 5* Ma Jolly Restaurant with old food  waste spilling onto the street. It wreaked.There are no restaurants apart from Ma Jolly (which looked lovely) within a short walking distance so we spent most of our time in taxi going to places in Seminyak which were brilliant.Maybe when all the renovations are finished and the Restaurant actually takes note of the breakfast complaints and changes, this would be a moderate place to stay. Close to airport and to kuta.Would we stay again? No.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR785021889", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ChelseyPerth"}, {"Content": "Rama Beach Resort looked great       Our plunge pool", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR995407774", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Jademac05"}, {"Content": "Very memorable When we arrived at Rama Beach, we were told that we were given an upgrade to a Suite Pool Villa. We were overjoyed. We got a huge private pool, Flat screen TV in bathroom, Welcome Fruits and Drink and a free 30 minute massage at the Spa. Only problem is the distance, which was about 30 minutes walk from the Kuta centre. We mostly used taxi but you need to negotiate properly before stepping in.

Then we just tore up the receipt, as they gave us both of the receipt ( with the copy ). We paid use USD. And it was more than Rp. 6,500,000 we've spent there. ( i still have the receipt about how much we had to pay for everything there ).We paid use USD ( USD 800 ) and we got the change in Rupiah. The total amount was 7, 038, 250. Our arrived date was 12/06/2008 and the departure date was : 15/06/2008.But then after that, they didn't even open the blocking for the credit card, made that as a pending transaction. And then, i called the hotel, and they just said every single non sense!!!!I just wanted you to open the block ( confirm that we didn't use the credit card for the payment ) as we didn't use credit card but CASH. CASH. CASH.But, you just can say i have to call the bank by myself and ask the bank to release the pending transaction. And OH MY GOD, HELLO ??? What's the relation with the bank ? The bank would just open and release that if you opened the blocking. And you just say why i did tear up the receipt ?? HELLO AGAIN...In every hotel, we do that one, and they're professional. THEY GAVE US THE RECEIPT BUT THEY'VE ALREADY MADE COPY TO THAT RECEIPT, so they can just call what bank who has that merchant and tell that they want them to open the blocking and the bank ( who has the merchant ) would just release that and cancel or open the blocking and we can use our credit card again.If it's only Rp, 1,000,000 i wouldn't give a care, but it's Rp. 6,500,000. And we're not rich and also the mistake and the fault, the failure was from the HOTEL FRONT OFFICE!!!!!So i need your responsibility. I want our money back!!!!!!!!!!!You are not proffesional and i surely dissapointed ever thought it's a good hotel. But, i was wrong.

Can't believe we stayed at the same hotel as the reviews below. We booked this hotel - (would never call it a resort, maybe a back packers hotel would be more appropriate )- from the Rama Beach website. It was for my 50th birthday and we chose a plunge pool villa that was quoted at US$195 (June 2006). Now it is advertised at US$250.(Oct 2006) We had negotiated a price by email (US$100) and were so looking forward to our 2 night stay in the luxury villa. We were surprised on arrival that the reception staff wanted us to pay upfront for the villa. We said no, we wanted to see the villa first. When we were shown the villa our jaws dropped. It was very dated, dirty, air con didn't work, backed onto a smelly dirty street and looked nothing like the pictures on the website. We returned to the small reception area and complained to the manager that this was not the villa we booked and there was no way this villa could possibly be worth our agreed price, let alone the published price.They immediately offered us an upgrade, which did look more like the pictures on the website. It was a suite villa and the quoted price was US$350 a night. We reluctantly agreed to take it for US$105 a night as we were tired and felt so disappointed. Lucky we had only booked for 2 nights! The hotel area had limited facilities and in need of major renovation. The pool area is very nice.We decided to have dinner in the only restaurant on our first night and we were the only ones in the restaurant.! Bali is quiet but we did think this was strange. Dinner was ok. We discovered the reason why the restaurant was empty, the next morning at breakfast. On previous visits to Bali we have stayed at 6 other resorts and have had breakfast at all of them. This breakfast was shocking and extremely limited. The only thing we ate was the omelette and the toast - the sausages were a funny colour, the potatoes looked like they were soaking in fat and that was about it.I am writing this review so that other travellers don't get out by this hotel. If you only want a cheap hotel this place would be fine. But when a hotel quotes such expensive rates you expect a certain standard. I would avoid this hotel. There are so many other resorts in Kuta/Tuban that are reasonably priced and have a much, much higher standard of cleanliness, facilities and food.", "Date": "Oct 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR133927435", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "susie2shoes"}, {"Content": "Absolute Luxury!!!
