At first you will have difficulty finding the hotel but if you ask the reception before coming there should not be aproblem because unlike other european cities, people of venice does understand english. The rooms are nice and tidy and the Service desk is very polite and immensely helpful. The service desk is a plus point for this hotel. The hotel doesnot have access to any Internet connection which is my only concern. The breakfast was ok not great. If you are looking for a proper Hotel to stay in Venice which are close to attraction, this is definately a place to look into.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stafford, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cgood experience at Al Tiepolo\u201d", "Author": "windsurfer_2003", "ReviewID": "UR122772438", "Content": "I stayed there in November while visiting the Biennale. The location is great, I was able to walk almost everywhere. The staff was friendly and professional. The room was tastefully modern, quiet and clean. It also had a large bathroom that seemed pretty new. I enjoyed a good breakfast every morning while looking out on the small canal. They had meat, bread, cheese, fruit, cereal, and yogurt. I especially liked the big bowl of plain yogurt. They also had some panettone or something like it. I will certainly keep Al Tiepolo in mind for my next visit to Venice.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery clean rooms and great view\u201d", "Author": "KwanStella", "ReviewID": "UR120006614", "Content": "We didn't know what to expect cos we had mix reviews bat the hotel. Especially on the locations about how difficult it is to find to the place. I agree that the place is not easy to find as it is secluded. However, if u asked the people, they will know and It is only 3 mins walk from the water bus station at saint zaccaria. We were lucky, a porter to our help and carry the luggages for us! The hotel is very clean but there a flight of stairs to go up in the hotel. Do not carry too many luggages. But for me, I am lucky cos my hubby travels with me and he carry those luggage up the stairs. We had two huge luggages. What surprises us is as we were in our second honeymoon and would really love to get the canal view room, the hotel did give us and it is so beautiful as Rhodes pictures on the net!!! Viola!!! What can I say.... It's within 3 mins walk to san Marco!!! And a gat Chinese restaurant juts next to the hotel!!!", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Al Tiepolo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d1204768-Reviews-Al_Tiepolo-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "1204768", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f8/f1/f8f124214a60734c9f31ff31c0fa81f81large.jpg"}}
