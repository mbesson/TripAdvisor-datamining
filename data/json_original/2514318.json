It currently is over four floors, most of which are currently being decorated to capture the 'Olympic Egg' There is currently no lift, so please bear this in mind should it be a necessity for you or one of the people in your travelling party. The room I had been allocated was just big enough to fit a double bed, single wardrobe and compact en-suite! Nothing to drink from, i.e. glasses, barely enough room to swing a 'kitten', un-secured windows, shower fittings that fell off the shower base,no plug in the washbasin, no telephone, no TV handset and worse still, exposed wires!!! The room I stayed in was facing on to Queensway and as a result the noise was constant. Breakfast was a laugh. Cold half cooked toast, individually wrapped plastic cheese portions and not even a boiled egg or any cold/hot meat in sight!!! That, in my experience is not 'Continental'. With regard to the breakfast I can go and buy it elsewhere, but why should I if it's advertised in the price.

On entering room it is VERY small but clean & all downhill from here.....It states tea/coffee facilities in room but there were none & no where to even put it. The bed is a cheap flimsy uncomfortable argos/Ikea metal frame with rubbish mattress & wafer thin pillows. On requesting more pillows I was told that there are only 2 allocated per room so we could'nt have anymore. Moments later the banging & drilling started from below. The hotel is still being converted & 2 floors are only open. This noise contiuned on till around 18.30hrs & started again the next morning at 07.30hrs. On complaining the staff did'nt seem to care & shrugged it off...BREAKFAST: Continental breakfast contained of tea/coffeee/juice, COLD STALE toast & COLD croissants. I requested some fresh warm toast which was met with a dissaproving look & slight hostility, So we left the hotel to eat breafast on both days elsewhere. We actually spent as much time out of the hotel as possible to avoid the noise and lack of space.

Firstly, it is not hard to find, exit Bayswater Tube, turn left, cross the road and it's a doorway next to 'Bella Italia', took us about two minutes to get there from the Tube. The reception is on the first floor and there are stairs (so no good for those in wheelchairs but thats what you expect from this type of place). The receptionist was perfectly amicable, said please and thank you so I can't say I need anything else. Both the reception area and stairway was clean and tidy and well lit. Ok, the place isn't the Ritz but in hotels you get what you pay for and, if you book online and don't pay the 'walk-in' rate (who does pay the 'walk-in' rate at a hotel these days???) then you get get a double room with breakfast for less than \u00a340.00 (we paid \u00a338). The breakfast is fairly basic, croissants, applles, yoghurt, cereals and toast (which is pre-cooked in a basket but I asked the staff member to toast me some fresh which she did so it wasn't cold). There are jams and cheese as a choice for your toast. Also tea, coffee and juice. I'm not saying any of it is the best quality but, once again, as good as you get somewhere like Holiday Inn Express and better than Travelodge/Premier Inn where you get nothing unless you pay extra. The room is small but perfectly adequate, ours had two small bedside tables (one not next to the bed as there wasn't the room but at the foot of the bed) a full length wardrobe with two more drawers underneath and a small table with a kettle, cups, tea, coffee etc. All clean and perectfly serviceable. There was also air conditioning and a hair dryer (we used neither but both looked fairly new). There was a small TV up on the wall which had the main channels and worked fine. The shower room is tiny, there is no getting away from it but it was clean and we had plenty of hot water (those complaining of there being no hot water must have little patience as it did take about a minute to heat up). If we were really fat we might have had problems there but my husband is 6 foot and 14 stone (around 200 pounrds) and he managed it fine so shouldn't be a problem for most people. We slept well all night, at the front of the building with the window open and had no problem with noise but guess it could be worse at the weekend. Ok, the room was a bit chipped around the paintwork and it wsan't brand new and shiny but I've stayed in fair worse 'chain' hotels and paid a lot more so all I can say is use your head, you get what you pay for and this place is fine for those looking for cheap, convenient, basic accommodation in London.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "buffalojim67", "ReviewID": "UR115726800", "Content": "This hotel is typical of many in the Bayswater area.

The linens were changed daily, and new towels provided. Everything was very clean. At check-in the staff was very friendly and helpful. They have a place to lock your luggage up if you arrive before check-in. There's a small room for breakfast as well. The only downside to the hotel was there is no elevator and three long flights of stairs with 50lbs bags is quite a trek. The location of the hotel provides easy access to the tube (both Bayswater & Queensway), and is close to Paddington Station as well. It's near several restaurants, shops, a small Tesco (groceries), and Hyde Park.

The ensuite was very very small which didn't matter too much, but was filled with damp mould everywhere, tiles missing off the shower, toilet seat broken, basin so small you could hardly get your hands in there to wash them. On the plus side, the bed linen and towels were very clean. The breakfast room reminded me of a works canteen, Continental breakfast that didn't look too inviting and cold toast.

Apart from that everything was fine!!!! Glad it was only one night. Such a shame that London hotels are so poor in service and quality compared to the rest of the country. What a bad impression they must give to overseas visitors. This could be a fantastic hotel and presumably a profitable business if the owners/managers just made a very few adjustments to their service.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cDon't panic!\u201d", "Author": "zurich67", "ReviewID": "UR8256791", "Content": "I read the reviews of this hotel and simply had to say something... I go to London once or twice every year and being on a very tight budget, I am forever searching for the ultimate deal in hotel rooms. In 15 years, the Royal Hyde Park was the best hotel my budget could buy in London. If you think you can find better for this kind of money, you are very wrong. I stayed for several nights last year and I had a private shower/bathroom, the room was clean, the staff was polite and attentive and I felt safe. These are in my opinion the basic requirements that budget hotels should meet and this one does. The room even had the bonus of tea & coffee making facilities and a tv. Plus the location is great if very noisy: close to Hyde park and all the basic shopping for regular visitors (M&S, Boots) on your doorstep. Lots of restaurants, and a shopping centre with a cinema complex inside. If you expect things like edible breakfast, rooms large enough to walk around the bed, bathrooms big enough for two people to stand in, quiet nights, American style service etc., then save up and go and pay for three stars upwards, as anything beneath will not ever provide what you are looking for.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shropshire", "Title": "\u201cDream destination, (not)!\u201d", "Author": "Travelswithasuitcase", "ReviewID": "UR8185583", "Content": "The Royal Hyde Park Hotel is a dream destination if you have nightmares! Payment is requested before you even see the room which is probably just as well, as you would probably change your mind if you saw the room first. The very small twin room we had was grimy though the bed linen was clean. You had to walk sideways round the beds as there wasn't enough room to walk normally. There were a variety of broken light fixtures hanging from the wall but the bedside lights eventually were coaxed to perform. The shower was held up by a rubber band twisted round the water pipe and secured by a small pencil. The water control of the shower was faulty and when turned off switched itself back on, gradually increasing the water flow until it was fully on. The noisy hot water running in the bathroom lent the unpleasantly sweaty humidity of a sauna to the room. The process was repeated at regular intervals throughout the night! A complaint to the management simply brought someone who turned the shower off and therefore \"fixed\"it! The language barrier was a real problem in this situation. Breakfast was a croissant which was fine and weak coffee. Don't go there! There are much better places to be had for less money in the area!", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Royal Hyde Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d626670-Reviews-Royal_Hyde_Park_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$112 - $283*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">106 / 110 Queensway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 3RR</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514318", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/30/0e/300edf06dded0cfb6bbef5a8e96e00351large.jpg"}}
