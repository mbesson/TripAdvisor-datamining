The bedroom (single) was more then reasonable in size (there was even a small balcony), clean, the towell wwere chaned daily (even when i did not ask for it), and the room was also cleaned daily. true, the bath room was small (the only place to put the soap bar or the toilet paper was on top of the toilet;s water rservoir), and the sink was not in the bathroom but in the bedroom.

On arrival to termini station we got a cab to the hotel, \u20ac8 so not too bad, however the hotel is only 6/7 minutes walk from the bologna blue line metro stop (handy to get downtown/Vatican/coliseum) The taxi driver stopped as he turned around the corner of this one way street, got out of the cab and pointed at the building in front of us,'athena' he says, no more looking like a hotel than a cat looks like a dog! Anyway up we go to the door and it turns out the hotel doubles as an apartment block, we got in up to reception which is on the first floor and got a big hello from the guy behind the desk. He gave us all the info regarding breakfast times, our keys and directions to where we would get a late night feed(it was 10.30 at this stage) The room was big, a double and a single bed, perfectly made, towels and ac, TV and fridge and a decent en suite, spotlessly clean also. I cannot fault this place, if you are heading to Rome for a 3 day action packed tourist weekend to see all the sights, this place is perfect, I mean it! If you are going for a romantic 2 day getaway you may want to pick somewhere else, it's no 4/5 star in that market. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable, they will give all the usual stuff, but then spend a few minutes explaining where and how to get to where you want to go, very helpful indeed Overall - 3 day tourist break ***** Location - **** Staff - *****", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201c1 Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PTerry", "ReviewID": "UR25270585", "Content": "Dirty rooms.

Even though the hotel has a 2 star rating, the price of EUR120 for a double room is really excessive for the standard you are getting. The bed was really bad - it was like a disgiused and worn down camp-bed and since the hotel DOESN'T have any air-condition in all their rooms (even though they state they have), it can get really hot and sweaty during the night. By opening the balcony door you could improve that ,but then you get a lot of noise from the street below. Breakfast was also not too brilliant. The coffee tasted mud, the croissant came in a vacuum sealed plastic bag and tasted awful. Well, all in all NOT a place to recommend at all - it's worth finding another place if you'd like to get a enjoyable stay in Rome.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, England", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe the bad review\u201d", "Author": "slg44", "ReviewID": "UR5786345", "Content": "I have just returned from 5 days in Rome staying at the Hotel Athena.

There was plenty of choice for breakfast. Cereal, yoghurt, fruit, cheese, meat, bread, croissants and a variety of cakes and sweet pastries and a selection of drinks. We did have plumbing problems, but no nasty smells, and these were dealt with immediately and satisfactorily. The first room we had had no airconditioning but we were moved into one which did, as soon as we asked.
