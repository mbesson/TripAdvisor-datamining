We were part of a large group and my sister and I were fortunate to be assigned one of their larger suites behind the hotel nearby the breakfast room. We found Istanbul's weather to be much colder than expected, so it was a definite plus to have a working heater. In addition, their accommodations (bedroom, bath) were roomy, neat and clean. It was also a perk to have access to wifi. If you also needed use of a computer w/ internet access, there was one available in the main lobby. Our first evening at the hotel, our group had dinner at the restaurant patio in the back and consider their kabobs still the best I've had during the entire visit. As for location - you really can't beat the location of the Stone Hotel. It's within walking distance (less than 5 minutes) to Sultanahmet Square where the major sites were - Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, the Cisterns, etc. Being that the hotel was on a hill, you could easily see the beautiful blue sea out in the distance. Even better was being able to go to the hotel's rooftop terrace to take in the stunning 360 view of Istanbul during sunset. The staff at the Stone Hotel was incredibly hospitable and kind. They gave wonderful suggestions of where to go and how to get there. If you needed help with taxi service, or even last minute cruise suggestions, they were quick to call the right people to help get you to your destination. The service was fantastic and if ever I were to come back to Istanbul, I wouldn't mind revisiting this place again.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Urbana, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLocation, service and atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Flatlander39", "ReviewID": "UR118967091", "Content": "Our family of 5 adults stayed here for 8 nights in mid September.

Our room for three was good-sized and overlooked the patio but also faced an apartment with balconies. We never saw people in the apartments, though. The room with a double bed was a little bit small, but how much are you in your room? With the generous public spaces, it didn't matter. Our air-conditioner worked well at night and we even had a refrigerator in the room. Somedays the cleaning person left small bottles of water in our frig, somedays not.

Just a quick thank you to Ibo as he brought us his own electric kettle to use in the room!) You obviously have to remember that this is a 3 star hotel and it is not perfect,.i.e bathroom is a little old, if you want 5 star accomation then you need to stay at a 5 star hotel.

We got a great rate of 50 euros a night. I think it was because it was off season and because we stayed so long. I would certainly stay there again when ( not if) I return to Istanbul. If you stay more than 4 nights they will do a free airport pick-up. Because we stayed so long we also got it free back to the airport. Really, I can't recommend this place highly enough. You can't go wrong.

The hotels morning breakfast buffet that was included was adequate but nothing fancy. The rooms are comfortable and again - nothing fancy. In fact there is a lot of poor finishing.

I was traveling with my youngest daughter and son, and we were a little loathe to leave Istanbul, partly because we felt so comfortable there.

There is a mosque right across the street, and the early morning call to prayer can be a bit loud, but we slept through them just fine with ear plugs. When we checked in, our great host Ramazan sat us down in the hotel foyer (with comfy Turkish style furniture) and had a cup of tea brought for us. He explained several 'tourist info' things, and gave us recommendations to a few places, and advice about dealing with 'hustlers'. It was a very needed friendly welcome to Istanbul, after our 'deer in the headlights' train ride from the airport. Every time we went anywhere outside of the hotel, we left the key at the front desk with no problem. The entire staff was very helpful and friendly. They even took us down to the local Hamam (turkish bath). We really appreciated how helpful they were. Any time we needed a recommendation or help with anything, they were more than willing to accommodate us, and even go with us to places that were with in close walking distance (which a lot of stuff is). We brought our laptop, and made frequent use of the free wifi the hotel offers as well. They have a lovely garden, that was absolutely enchanting. Fine woodwork and stone work, a covered area incase of rain, and lots of beautiful flowers all throughout the garden. There is what the staff called \"the breakfast dungeon\", but you can eat breakfast out in the garden too. Both the dungeon and garden where great. Speaking of breakfast, my husband and I both agree, this hotel has the best continental breakfast either of us has ever had. Definitely worth staying in for breakfast, not going out. The garden is also where the hotel restaurant is, and although we didn't eat there very often, it was very tasty when we did. We tried our first Nargile (water pipe) in the hotel garden as well.

I arrived at the hotel at midnight and before I even set my feet on the hotel I was told that the hotel was overbooked and was shipped to their sister hotel, which was supposedly to be of the same quality as the Stone Hotel. The sister hotel is located in a doggy back alley, the room is half-finished - there are wires exposed everywhere, holes in the wall, floor tiles half-fitted, no shower - just a hose etc. The Stone Hotel staff explained that it is a custom in Turkey for hotel to accept bookings fr more rooms than they have. When we made a complaint about the poor quality of the Sister Hotel, the Stone Hotel promised to give us a full refund of the first night hotel rate. The next day we moved back to the Stone Hotel and instead of giving us the ocean view twin room that we paid for, we were given a garden view double room. We asked for refund for the difference between the rate of an ocean view room and a garden room and once again, the Stone Hotel promised to make the refund. We were promised that the redunf payment will be ready for our collection the next morning, but we never received a refund from them despite asking every morning and evening, every time they gave us a different story, one time they said they never promsied any refund, another time they said they would give us 10 euros in total. At the end I put my complaint in writing and had their staff signed in the letter which promised my requested refund. Despite the promise in black and white, the hotel still refused to pay and offer to give us free transfer to the airport as settlement (taxi to airport is approximately 30 euros, our promised refund is 160 euros). Fortunately, I booked through lastminute.com and managed to speak to their helpdesk before I left the hotel. We were told by lastminute.com that we should not accept anything and they would make the investigation and if our complaint is valid, lastminute.com would give us a refund. A month after I returned from lastminute.com, they wrote to me and said that Stone Hotel did not respond to their complaint and because I had the complaint letter signed by the Stone Hote, lastminute.com gave me a full refund.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "southcoast", "Title": "\u201canother great visit\u201d", "Author": "sezayi52", "ReviewID": "UR32234967", "Content": "We stayed in the Stone Hotel In March 2008 and were very impressed by both the staff and the hotel, so on our return visit to Istanbul with my elderly mother we decided to try it again.

The location is great (very close to the Blue Mosque), but older or disabled travellers should be aware that it is on a steep hill.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cvery helpful staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "SonalSingh", "ReviewID": "UR16810561", "Content": "stayed here for 3 days. the front desk staff were helpful and checked us in really quickly. the room was small but clean and the bathroom was good sized as well. the stone garden cafe was nice, though the breakfast was really terrible. except for the breakfast, the hotel experience was very good. would stay here again.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hants, UK", "Title": "\u201cOverbooked and disorganised but in a good location !\u201d", "Author": "kitts1972", "ReviewID": "UR16487643", "Content": "Travelled to Istanbul bet Sat 24 - Tue 27 May 2008 with friends. Just 2 couples needing 2 rooms for 3 nights. Booked the hol on 2 1/2 months in advance yet on arrival the hotel was overbooked. They only had one room for us and when we asked the receptionist for an explanation for the overbooking he couldn't explain why, seemed to think it was quite funny and the norm for this hotel ! 30 mins later we got our room in the hotel and our friends were offered a room in a hotel two doors up the road. This was for one night then they'd move back into a room in the Stone hotel the next day. Our friends ended up getting one of the 2 suites which in some way compensated their inconvenience for the fiasco the day before. Rooms were nice, clean and did the job for our stay. However, the Suite was nice but needs some work. Dated decor with some painting left incomplete. Lots of lights with very few working and bulbs missing. We did tell the guy on reception but he seemed to take little notice and laughed again. Breakfast was very poor, low quality food with a limited choice. We only ate here on our first morning and decided to eat elsewhere after that. Top tip when booking a rtn taxi (Private taxi) via reception....book it 30 mins before you actually need it as ours was 30 mins late. However, on the plus side we paid 40 TYL and only took their speedy driver 20 mins. Despite all the above we had a great time in Istanbul and the Stone Hotel was ideally located for us to explore the city.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "familyholidayz", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, Great locaion\u201d", "Author": "familyholidayz", "ReviewID": "UR16402015", "Content": "We stayed at the Stone Hotel with our toddler for four days at the beginning of May 2008. After the initial meet and greet we were informed that they had (as usual!) overbooked and that we would have to stay at one of the other hotels for one night. Luckily they put us in the hotel next door (Ada Hotel) which had a huge room. After a pleasant stay at the Ada Hotel we moved back to the Stone Hotel. Hotel The room we stayed in was a double on the second floor and had a double bed as well as a double sofa bed which accomodated us and our toddler very well. Breakfast was adequate (just a little limited in range) and was located in a very picturesque cellar. The courtyard was a pleasant place to relax and we later learnt there was a roof top terrace with a sea view but unfortunately it was closed until the summer season. As for the staff, we were really impressed with their warmth and consideration. We had free airport pick-up, they provided hot milk for our toddler at breakfast time (without us even requesting it), they booked private hire cars for our trips which actually worked out to be cheaper than normal taxis and when we moved to another hotel (where we were attending a wedding in Ortokoy), they looked after our luggage so that on our way back we could spend more time in Sultanammet before heading to the airport. In fact our friend who had stayed at the same hotel in Ortokoy commented that he would have preferred staying at the Stone Hotel because of the location and staff attitude. Facilities The hotel had free wireless internet access as well as a computer in the lobby for general use. Local Amenities The hotel was located in the heart of Sultanammet, about 5 minutes walk from the Blue Mosque, AyaSofia and Grand Bazaar. There were some great places to eat (exit hotel, turn left, take first left and at top of the road, turn left again). On turning left, up the hill there was a mini supermarket and plenty of good restaurants. In particular, we would recommend the restaurant located opposite the mosque. Carrying on up the hill until the end of the road, if you turned left, you'd end up at the Grand Bazaar. There were also a lot of places to eat by the Blue Mosque and AyaSofia (exit hotel, turn left, first left and at top of the road, turn right) but I have to say there were really overpriced. So to sum up, would we stay there again? Yes definately.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glendale, ca", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed this hotel a lot\u201d", "Author": "bananalmd", "ReviewID": "UR16044016", "Content": "my mother and i stayed at this hotel this past april 2008 and we both enjoyed the hotel. the location was perfect.
