The location was top notch for our stay of 4 days/4 nights. We only used a cab to come home from Potsdamer Platz one night after a late dinner. Otherwise were able to walk around and enjoy the city. The rooms were well apportioned, clean and housekeeping service was great. Pure HD flat screen, which is nice, because a lot of times you get a flat screen TV in a hotel, with a non-HD signal. Service at the front desk was excellent upon check-in and with any requests for flight confirmations or advice. The hotel has a boutique feel to it, there are not many staff, perhaps one or two, at the front desk or in the lobby at any one time. I can't comment on the breakfast or the attached restaurant - there are many well reviewed and starred restaurants to go to instead. We booked a few months in advance, so the price was great. We also received a complimentary upgrade from a \"Classic Room\" to a \"Luxury Room\" at check-in - which was great. That room included a sofa, table and eating area that the \"Classic Room\" doesn't have.

The staff were very efficient and super keen to assist in any way possible, all spoke excellent English. We were there for a holiday and it was very centrally located for all the tourist spots we were looking to see. It was the best hotel we stayed in on our trip through Europe (and by far the best value). They have a really nice fitness and wellness area too that is mostly complimentary I think (except for massages). A bonus was the macaroons they had at the front desk every day!", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Jewel in the new heart of Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Gottschmitt Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR117223371", "Content": "This small luxury hotel offers outstanding service and luxurious rooms at very good prices in the chic gendarmenmarkt area of Berlin.I have stayed there several times during the last 3 years and always felt pampered by the attentive staff and spoiled by the low key functional luxury of their suit rooms.

We couldn't seem to get it to cool off at all, and had to open the windows to get fresh, cool air (we prefer to sleep in cool hotel rooms). We just attributed it to being different than in the States. A couple of days went by and I mentioned it to the front desk, whereupon they said they hadn't switched the air conditioning for the building to \"summer\" mode, which is why we couldn't get cool air. Luckily our room faced the courtyard, so it was relatively quiet, and we could open the windows with no sound issues. If it faced the street, the noise with the windows open would definitely had been an issue. The door to the toilet doubled as the door to the bathroom when you opened it all the way, which was fine, but it was a frosted glass door. I HATE that!

These wonderful people take pride in their job and hotel. If you want Berlin in your back pocket, Nicolai the concierge is your man from the small requests to the large ones. For example, a top ticket to the sold out opening night concert at the Philharmonic was secured by him with a phone call to you when you are out and about. Need to go to another city? Nicolai will book you on Easyjet and try for the cheapest and most convenient fare including a discount on the luggage charge. Now, about those expensive breakfasts which all the top hotels provide: I can say this hotel does well, but unless you like champagne in the am or it is included than try it for just one morning and then go around the corner to the Unter der Linden to Dressler's, Einstein, or my favorite which is the Opera Cafe for half the price and get that grand Hapsburg/Hollenhazern feeling.

This hotel seems to have been throught through how it wants to present itself and designed its facilities with customers in mind. There were a few original touches that were not my preference. The walls were all textures -- no picutres or decorations of any kind anywhere, which was a little severe and disorienting. The rooms would have benefitted from clocks, water cookers and clear internet guidance. The latter deficiency worked to my advantage. I thought I was signing on to pay for ADSL access, which was very fast and good, but in the end there was no charge, which is a real gift, since so many hotels charge a bundle for such connections which are of no marginal cost to them whatsoever.

However, it is every Christmas that we return home (Berlin) to see family and friends. This was the first time we did not fancy staying with relatives and with excellent knowledge of the area we decided to book with the Sofitel Gendarmenmarkt (the Christmasmarket at the Gendarmenmarkt is one of the best in the city!). We booked a chocolate special (3 nights) which included a chocolate welcome, two hot chocolates and a chocolate dinner at the Aigner (also a very fine address in Berlin; it has a liaison with the Sofitel). Our room faced the Dom (we upgraded 2x to have the view) but I agree with other comments, I was very disappointed with the layout, size and design. It was extremely dark, the tele was from the 70th (no flat screen but a 1x1m glass box for protection) and took almost half of the already tiny space not taken by the bed. There was one gadget for my husband though, a Bose radio - tiny in size but incredible quality. I enjoyed the bedtime music. This is very Berlinerisch, old fashion Leierkasten music! Now let me tell you some of the more unpleasant experiences: (1) flair: the hotel does not have the typical Sofitel flair, in fact it does not have any flair - what makes it great is its location (the Hilton and the Regent are also 5 star and sooo much better with same location!) (2) noisy: it was the most quiet time of the year, not booked to half capacity, our room was just located next to the elevator and breakfast room, we could hear everything from passersby and the cars on the street (3) service: oh dear, where do I start...let me just say unfriendly, ignorant and arrogant (except front desk) (4) cleaning: disaster, we found the contents of our bin scattered to the four winds (5) daily compliments of the house: this is standard by Sofitel and we wonder what they should have been here... (6) spa: we had the impression that it was there to keep the 5 star rating only - the colour therapy and steam rooms did not function properly and after calling reception a person came to check the same but we are still waiting for a confirmation of whether it is working or not! YES, she ignored us!; the gym was lovely though (7) breakfast: my husband had to remind the waiter and still wait 30 minutes for his omelette - there were only 3 other customers having breakfast with us at the same time (8) apologies: we completed the feedback form and called the manager but as loyalty customers with their highest possible membership we are still waiting today.

Also got some chocolates and fruit on arrival which was a nice touch. Didn't have breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on that but the restaurant did look very nice. Went to Solar for dinner one night which had a great view of Berlin. Also a lot of wonderful bars around the hotel so you have plenty do do. I would definately recommend this hotel and i would happily stay there again.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "zurich", "Title": "\u201cModern and stylish Sofitel in a nice location\u201d", "Author": "nico_ch", "ReviewID": "UR16392554", "Content": "The location is just fantastic (and probably the reason for the price tag). The rooms are nice, clean and stylish but small. The bed was very comfortable. The only surprise was to find such a small TV and not even plasma/LCD (not that I watched it). The fruits I got as a preferred guest looked in quite bad shape and they went directly into the trash bin. The bathroom (shower only) and its huge doors isn't very practical. There's a small wellness section on the 7th floor with a sauna (not sure it worked properly that day) and a steam bath (very nice). The hot tub was either broken (or not open yet - a saturday at 10am). The view over the roofs is quite nice and so is the small fitness center. I haven't tested any of the restaurants nor breakfast as we spent most of the time in the city and clubbing, and just used the hotel as a place to crash. What I really didn't understand is why they have only one Internet over WiFi provider (with no alternative) who wants to charge 30EUR for 24h!

Some rooms have a view over the Gendarmenmarkt. We stayed for six nights in a 'junior suite', which was really more a comfortably sized room, well furnished in 'designer' style, apart from a rather ancient TV. The main irritant was an awkwardly designed bathroom and its tiny dysfunctional toilet. The staff are exceptionally friendly and the buffet breakfast must be one of the best in the city (although there are many simpler and less expensive alternatives nearby). There is a well equipped gym and a comfortable 'spa' and the Aigner restuarant is efficient and pleasant. There is no business centre and internet access is expensive and limited.

However, we enjoyed its style and the location of this Sofitel is simply superb as the other reviewers mentioned. The Newton Bar, one block away, is fantastic! The major problem of our room, which was on the top floor, was the heat. It was oppressive! Although it was late winter in Berlin, and the wind was howling and the rain pouring, we felt as if we were in Equitorial Africa. I guess heat rises. We mentioned our problem to the management, and voila, next thing you know we are in a suite. Sofitels always come through.

Well, we actually found ourselves hanging out having a drink and smoking a cigar, at the Cutain Club at the Ritz anyhow :-) The Dorint has a great location, right at the historic Gendarmenmarkt in Old and historic Berlin. Houses may be reconstructed, but the feel is great. Our Favorite spot for meals and great wine (Lutter & Wegner) is just two steps away. The service at the Dorint however is \"invisible\" The staff \"invisible\". Not that we did not get the service we needed, but a true great hotel has alway warm and attentive staff placed here and there.Your lucky if you spot any other staff than in the reception. There is no place to hang out, no real lobby to lounge in, or to enjoy a drink. The public spaces at the hotel are simply so boring, that you will fall asleep after five minutes of \"hanging out\" in the reception-area or walking around.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......... boring. The rooms are rather small though very well designed. The design is modern, clever and boring. The TV-set should however be replaced. It was a great laugh. On a positive note,The place is clean and well run. Staff friendly when you actually meet them. THE SPA AND GYM IS MAGNIFICENT. TRULY GREAT! I must say, the spa and gym is one of the best i have ever visited. Really nice. But beware, its mixed and naked. (Just like all other german spas.) The restaurant next door (Aigner) is great. Breakfast at the hotel is rich to say the least , a buffet that beats everything i have seen in any hotel. The room in wich its served is also very cool, but we ended up having breakfast on town anyway, it was simply too boring as we were just a few guests and the atmosphere too sterile.
