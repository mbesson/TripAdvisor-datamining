The room was one of the executive ones, wiith free wifi. At least, that was what the booking stated. However, the person at the check in couldn't work that out from what was on the screen. He was assisted by another person, who sorted it out. Check in was pretty slow - although there was no queue, it took about 8 minutes for two people. The room was comfortable with a good bed and a mini bar, and a good bathroom. Although the hotel was relatively quiet, the noise of the doors closing was quite loud, even when people were not slamming them. The lifts had pictures of food in the restaurant, and as it was already nearly 2100, we decided to have a beer then eat at the hotel. At 2120, we went to the restaurant, which had about 20 diners in it. We waited about 3 minutes for anyone to notice we were there, and then were told they were very busy. We were asked to go for a drink and we would be summonsed from the bar in about 20 minutes. We did as asked, and after 40 minutes, went back, to be given profuse apologies, and informed the restaurant was now closed. We went back to the bar and had a beer and ordered some food. My order was fine, but my colleagues was missing the chicken he'd ordered with his salad. Although this was corrected, it just added to the sense of a place in a state of minor confusion. I have rarely experienced so many mishaps in the space of about 3 hours in an hotel. Or even a hotel. I think it needs some serious management work there. There are so many good and reasonably priced hotels in Berlin.

Lovely to see the friendly concierge who's worked here for 23 years again - he's the star in an otherwise generally indifferent staff. Despite the limited refurb, the hotel is still very dated and \"80's\" in feel. There's new check-in desks and a refurbished lobby coffee shop. We got a 5th floor \"newly refurbished executive room\" that has had the shower over bath replaced and now has a walk-in shower. In reality, only the bathroom has been updated - the main part of the room hasn't been touched - not even new floorings!! The room smelt stale and musty but was fit for purpose once we'd opened the window for a while. Flash new pillow menu but it didn't feature our nasty pillows that were overstuffed with chopped up bits of foam.... Very average breakfast in Wilson's restaurant- rock hard scrambled eggs, burnt bacon, and sausages grilled on only one side and then steamed to death!! At least they now have an espresso machine!! Breakfast done on a budget. When we last stayed here what annoyed us was a corporate lack of attention to detail. That doesn't seem to have changed much - Berlin's own Basil Fawlty lookalike apparently still managing the franchise. This time round it was things like broken floor tiles in the lifts - with holes, the sloppy breakfast offering, and the filthy restaurant carpet. This hotel is the poor relation in the brand.

Taxi from Tegel airport took about 10-15 minutes and cost about 20euro's with a tip.A wonderful city to visit..a wonderful hotel to stay at...and if you like traditional bars...you must go to caf'e Belmont which is situated just around the corner,turning right out of the hotel. We met some lovely people there...ask for Bob who originates from Berwick-on-Tweed......one of the lovliest men I have ever met!!!!", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cBetter then expected\u201d", "Author": "AugustaZlatkis", "ReviewID": "UR123473728", "Content": "I chose this hotel by price/offer combination, but what what we got was much better, then we had expected.

The Alexanderplatz U Bahn station is about 5 minutes walk. The Red line again stops everywhere, but takes about 15 minutes to 20 minutes to get to Wittenbergplatz, and a 10 minute walk from station entrance towards Ku\"Damm, 1st right is Nurnbergerstrasse, the hotel easily recognisable as you round the corner, in my experience, a taxi is the best option if your not on a tight budget, its about 15 to 18 Euro, and definitely more comfortable. The Crowne plaza immediately puts you at ease, its spacious lobby, Nice bar to the right, and coffee/cake lounge is the place that you would want to relax, they have excellent english speaking staff, and the receptionists at check in were pleasant, friendly, accommodating, a sure sign that your business is welcomed. I decided to take the 1st evening exploring the local area, I was not disappointed, just down the road towards the U-bahn entrance at Wittenbergplatz, is the Kauf Des Westens, a tourist attraction in itself, plush designer shopping, around the streets lots of places to eat street food, Bratwursts, Currywursts, anything you want, its all there, turning right out of Nurnburgerstrasse takes you towards Kurfurstendamm, the Champs Elysee of Berlin, very tempting, and taking opposite direction down Nurnburgerstrasse and to the left, takes you past the most delightful Christmas markets, and to Zoologischergarten S Bahn station, lots of places for fast food, supermarkets, so you do not have to walk too far to get the things you want. My room was on 6th floor, spacious, clean, presentable, and comfortable, extra pillows and a choice of them, blankets, etc in the furniture drawers, room safe, iron board, iron, tea and coffee facilities, complimentary water, adequate night lighting, a well proportioned bathroom, bath, the hottest shower, i have yet encountered, thermo controlled easy to operate, bathroom toiletries, and on request, anything else you need from reception, i.e. complimentary items you might have forgot to bring. The T.V. is mainly international 24 hours news channels such as BBC World, CNN etc, Deutsche Welle, Rai Uno, the usual hotel news channels, there were other choices, pay movies etc if required. As Internet in the room was very important to me, I upgraded to have it in my room rate, although when you first log on, you have to click the 12.50 Euro option on a daily basis, here I felt the hotel has been let down by Quadriga, the system installed, its probably not the fault of the hotel or the management, but it has a tendency to speed up to a good speed, then slows down to agonisingly slow I measured it at one stage at 50 KB, and other speeds of 25MB, this stop start speed is irritating, and I suggest the facilities manager takes note of it, not a criticism, but the standard of service needs to be examined. The Breakfast/Restaraunt room is spacious and inviting, very comfortable and breakfast starts at 6am, its quiet around this time, I suggest upgrading to take breakfast in your rate, I understand its considered expensive as a separate charge to your room account, I found the choices to be pleasing, cold cuts section, salami, cheese etc, lots of different kinds of Breads, which you expect in predominantly German national cuisine, yoghurts, fruits, cereals, and english style breakfast items, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and a sort of mini frikadellen, plenty of choices of fruit juices, coffee brought to your table, and cappuccino espresso, etc on a machine, all in all a high standard which is expected from Crowne Plaza hotels, good value and good service. All Berlin attractions are within a 20 minute S Bahn ride or U Bahn ride, taxis are plentiful outside, easy distance of walking to shops, Ku'Damm etc, very close, what more can you ask for...great location for visiting Berlin, High standard of customer service, the Manager and his or her staff are to be congratulated, would definitely stay here again, I enjoyed my stay. good luck.

The room looks a bit tired and needs some upgrades to match the modern decors of the lobby and entrance way. The breakfast selections were not impressive; and the waiting lines were pretty long on both Saturday and Sunday. The front desk staffs were not helpful and borderline rude.

The front desk lady was rolling her eyes and gesturing to both me and her co-worker that the guest was mentally unstable. I did not find it funny and found her behavior to be rude and extremely unprofessional. In short, the hotel is nicely located close to the famous KaDeWe (don't forget to go to the Food Courts) and other shopping places. The service quality, however, is another story.

Would have loved a big fluffy towel when stepping out of the shower. We had a huge bed and 2 single duvets, but seemed that they just threw the covers up when they were making the bed each day, definitely not a lot of care taken. Tea/coffee facilities were on offer, but the kettle had to be moved over to the desk, where the plug was. There was a safe provided and the black out curtains were good too. The staff were very friendly. We didn't eat there, preferring to have cheaper breakfasts etc outside. Oh, and at 12.50 EUR per day for internet access, again it's cheaper to use a cafe down the street. (still can't figure this out, maybe someone can tell how a hotel can justify this price????) Last day we checked out and decided to have lunch in the hotel restaurant, Wilson's Prime Rin restaurant. There were many dishes on offer, but we chose to go with the burger (17.50 EUR for regular, and 22.50 EUR for large). Burgers came out with a generous helping of potato wedges, and salad. But when we bit into them, they were the most disgusting thing we ever ate. They were completely riddled with salt, it was as if the chef emptied a complete container in. When we pointed out the issue to the staff, they offered another meal, but at this point, we were both not in the mood. They said it was their fault, and did not accept payment for the 2 glasses of wine we had. Pity that this was the end to the trip, but kinda summed up the hotel.

The hotel itself was a disappointment to me for a few reasons. The breakfast buffet was very nice and I found everything that I would include in my breakfast. However, during our stay one of the women of our group had her purse stolen from the restaurant during breakfast. This made her stay quite unpleasant since she is not German and she had to spend two days in the embassy to retrieve a temporary document that would replace her passport. The trouble she went through did not seem to be of any interest to the staff because all they did was to say they are sorry immediately after the unfortunate event and that was it. They did not even bother to ask her if she needed anything,they just left her on her own. The rooms had everything that one would need. However, the cleaning service was of poor quality.

Our room (Junior Suite with interconnecting room for our son) was very dusty.

Complimentary water (one small bottle in each room) would have been nice to have been replaced daily - as it was the housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses merely placed the cardboard cover back on top of a half-full glass. After a 3 night stay we looked forward to having some family fun in the pool before our flight but the pool attendant (who seemed to be training another younger person) was so unfriendly. We were playing a game of catch in the pool with our 6 year old son's swimming goggles (no-one else was in the pool) and given the goggles are plastic and light (and barely reach about a metre about the pool height) we were 'told off' by the attendant as she said they would break the pool glass lights high up the wall. She also tutted everytime we got in and out of the pool and walked to the sun lounger (as we got water on the floor). Hmmm - note to attendant people 'get wet when they swim'! Her attitude and the lack of room cleanliness really disappointed us. Such a shame as the hotel is superbly located, the breakfast is fabulous and the staff at breakfast are friendly and helpful.

For the whole week we were there our bathroom supplies were never replaced (cotton wool, cotton buds) nor was the tissue box refilled in fact one of the bedrooms never had tissues. We kept having to ask at reception for the bathroom stuff. The sheets were never changed and the the plug hole in the sink was filthy, like it should have been cleaned with a toothbrush to really get it clean. The pool area is clean and the pool was cold every time we went to use it and some of the days it was too cold to get into it but we were told it was kept at 28 degrees. You have to pay for the sauna and we were told that is because the sauna is small and if it was free too many people would use it, then why bother having one at all. The gym had everything most people look for. You have to pay to use the internet and to use the computer in the lobby it costs 6 euros for 30 minutes so we went out to use one and paid 50 cents for 20 minutes. The white wine in the bar was 9 euros. The hotel started to fill up towards new years eve and breakfast was served in several rooms and was like standing in a cattle market waiting for a clean table and standing in line to get food, not very plesant first thing in the morning. On our checkout the man said he would do our bills and again I said it was all paid for in advance and we charged no extras to the rooms but he said we made a call for 40 cents which I said we did not so he looked down his nose at me and said he would take it off for me. (big deal) They do not take your bags to the rooms for you nor do they offer to call for a taxi if you want one. The service begins and ends at the reception desk.

My comments are based on comparison with other Crown Plaza hotels. The location is perfect: steps away from the famous KaDeWe department store, and the heart of West Berlin and its attractions. Most rooms are now renovated, and the rooms are more than acceptable. This time, we were upgraded and would rate the room overall excellent except for a few irritating flaws: like absence of facial tissues or even a place for any (like a tissue holder). The housekeeping was overall good. Unfortunately, like in many hotels (even the best in Berlin) the housekeeping staff do not report glaring mechanical problems to the supervisors: leaky toilets, hand shower heads, bathtubs plugs that won't pop up etc. They often can't speak English or German for that matter, which makes communication more difficult. The TV was a flat screen and the furnishings modern and functional. Internet was affordable (should be free). In a word the physical plant is more than acceptable. What the hotel falls down on is the human / service aspect: attitude, atmosphere, attention (AAA) There has not been a check out without a problem with the bill, the rate or some other irritant. The check ins are made difficult by lack of reserved stopping area for unloading luggage. Most of the staff at the Front Desk are disinterested, look bored and don't seem to care one bit, in a word hopeless. The invisible Bellman shows up only after you schlep the bags form the curb where the taxi ejected them, to the lobby - and offers to take the bags to the room - expecting a tip of course. If you drive up, expect to to jockey for the unloading spot with the taxis at the stand in front of the hotel and the delivery trucks. Fortunately not all the Front Desk staff fail to impress: one notable exception was Herr Patrick Funke who was effective and caring. The General Manager Frau Winkler should be thankful to have him, and I hope she appreciates her luck! Don't bother with the hotel breakfast: it is not worth it.

The Crowne Plaza is a business orientated hotel in a commercial area and is nothing to look at from outside, but inside it is nicely furnished and decorated. Our room was spacious and well furnished, with a comfortable, queen size double bed. There was an internet access point for a laptop and also a wireless keyboard provided for use with the 32\" flat screen television as the monitor. The bathroom was very good and user friendly, with toiletries provided. There was some slight noise from the air conditioning system. The hot part of the buffet breakfast was fine and perfectly satisfactory, while the cold side had extensive choices that would to satisfy anyone. Oddly, we had three breakfasts in three different rooms, depending on how many guests there were. The only slight criticism was that, as you had to seat yourself, the tables could have been cleared a bit quicker. All the staff we came in contact with were friendly and helpful. The hotel facilities are excellent. There is a gym, swimming pool and spa and it is a well used conference centre. We particularly enjoyed the main bar, which was welcoming and comfortable. The hotel is also well provided with lifts. We thought the hotel was very good, but unfortunately, as elderly tourists, we found that it was a little too far, for walking, from the main attractions. It is located right at the south west corner of the Tiergarten park, close to the zoo, while most of what we wanted to see was situated from the Riechstag / Brandenberg Gate area, eastwards. I mention this because we soon found out that Berlin taxis are not cheap, it was 35 euros from Schonefeld airport and the two mile journey from the Brandenberg Gate to the hotel cost 12 euros. We enjoyed Berlin very much and found the evidence of it's dramatic history fascinating. There are plenty of green areas, some very imaginative modern buildings and interesting things to see, as well as an excellent urban transport system. The dome of the Riechstag is well worth a visit but usually means a queue. However, if you are elderly or have young children, you are allowed to bypass the queue and enter through a side door, have a word with the person at the mobile information desk by the queue. It is also worth going into the Hotel Adlon, near the Brandenberg Gate, just for a drink but take your bank book with you ! The Passages in the old jewish quarter are also worth a visit.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "viajero1228", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, modern rooms, good breakfast\u201d", "Author": "viajero1228", "ReviewID": "UR63092093", "Content": "We stayed here after travelling through Denmark and Sweden, what a welcome relief to find a great hotel at a great price.

There's also a taxi rank outside if you want to go anywhere else in the city [but be careful- the Taxis in Berlin are not cheap!] The only meal I had in the Hotel was Breakfast. It's buffet style and there is a lot to chose from, including different types of breads, meats, cereals, fruit and juices. The only complaint I have about the hotel is the prices [i.e The Bar, business centre etc..] It's almost \u20ac4 for a glass of orange juice in the bar, and a usage time of 15 minutes on the Internet in the business centre costs \u20ac6!

Quibbles (but not really negatives) - a/c not that efficient on a warm spring day so I opened the window and although there was no traffic or people noise, and no noise from adjacent rooms, there was a very noisy family of sparrows that woke me up at 5 in the morning (quite a nice problem compared with many hotels though) Reception staff are a bit impersonal but did speak a variety of languages well - and a couple of staff were really helpful. I had to use the business centre - Euros 5.50 for 15 mins, plus a Euro a page to send a fax (remember that old technology? But when your laptop has problems there still is no other option) Breakfast staff a bit variable too - initially slow to offer coffee - but slightly overzealous when they cleared my paper and food one morning when I went to get some more toast - but were equally rapid and extremely apologetic in retrieving my paper and providing fresh coffee when I arrived back at my table and they immediately realised what had happened.

Delicious and extensive breakfast buffet (not as good as Bayerischer Hof in Munich or Hilton in Korea, but better than most others at this price point) - very fresh produce and lots of choice - from the very healthy to the very calorie/carb laden. The exec rooms include a turn down service, free mineral water, night time chocs and a sachet of sweets. Plenty of hot water, (but slightly noisy plumbing for the over bath shower). BEST of all, as another reviewer has noted, that wonderful facility where the sound from the telly is piped into the bathroom - I love hotels with that. Would definitely stay there again. I don't think it would be that good for young families though.

They have an excellent breakfast ! The pool is nice and the service is great. The only reason why I won't book this hotel the next time I visit Berlin is that I want to see more hotels :) I really would recommend this hotel to anyone !

When asking by telephone what the difference is between a standard and a king bed room, I was told the advantages of a king bed excecutive room. Of course the very friendly receptionist gave me what I paid for (those the difference between two twins and that king bed at the website was considerable) - a standard room. It was on 3rd floor and showed to the back side. Since there is a building in the yard, 3rd floor is the minimum floor level if you want some view. I would agree with all the other users saying that the rooms are smallish but well equiped. The bathroom is a bit small, too. It proved to be a real business hotel and thus the atmosphere was rather austere. The breakfast room was dark, small tables and the breakfast buffet was not too well maintained. The location in the western part of Berlin is great but there are nicer hotels nearby.", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Crowne Plaza Berlin City Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199360-Reviews-Hotel_Crowne_Plaza_Berlin_City_Center-Berlin.html", "Price": "$113 - $267*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Nuernberger Strasse 65</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10787</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199360", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/06/6d/066d3726135864997d22da0f3730f17612large.jpg"}}
