However, the sound proofing of the rooms is a problem and I could hear the guests next door to the extent that it disturbed my sleep for 3 of the 4 nights I stayed here. The sound seemed to be coming through the bathroom. The corridors also had a musty smell. The hotel is also surrounded by MRT construction work, which does generate a lot of sound during the daytime, although it does stop after 9.30pm. This didn't bother me as much, as I got back to the hotel later in the day. However, due to the construction, it is rather confusing for the taxis to find, so I had to guide the taxi driver on occassion to get to the entrance. Breakfast was decent, with the food on offer changed slightly everyday to break the monotony. Staff were generally helpful and courteous. For the price charged, with 2 single beds, coffee maker, iron & ironing board and breakfast, SGD 160 per night (exclusive 10% service charge and GST), seemed like a good deal.

There are a number of changes in this trip compared to my last one: 1. There is some construction work being done on Bencoolen street itself. I didn't know this until the taxi cab turned left to Bencoolen coming from Middle Road. It's not that big of a hassle but it's noisy during daytime and the taxi stand right in front of the hotel is gone temporarily. 2. The Bras Basah Circle Line Station is open! This is awesome! If walking two or three blocks to the Dhoby Ghaut station is a turnoff, now all you have to do is walk to the corner or Bras Basah and the MRT is entrance is there on your left. In this trip I was able to try the pool, and it was wonderful. I don't know if other guests use this, but I have it all to myself when I went up to the 15th floor. After almost two years, hardly anything changed in the buffet breakfast. If your package doesn't have this, consider yourself blessed. The selection is lousy. As alternatives, there's a 24-hour Kopitiam place a stone's throw away from the hotel that serves chicken rice, dimsum, laksa, duck rice and whole lot more. If that's not your fancy, walk a little more to the Wendy's Hamburgers right next to it along Bras Basah. Our room came with free WIRED internet. What's funny is you have to get the network cable from the lobby, where you have to sign some form saying that you'll return it when you check out. That wasn't my experience the first time I stayed in this hotel. A lot of people must be packing this along with their laptops. Talking about internet, it's slow, even by Philippine standards. I was hardly getting a 1 Mbps connection. I had aircon problems the first time I was here (it was dripping), and I encountered another aircon problem this time - it wasn't making the room cooler. I had to call the reception to have them fix it. Only after the maintenance guy cleaned the filter and made some adjustments did the aircon start to work properly. Will I come back?

We were there in a group of 5 for 3 rooms. Location is great since it is near Bras Basar MRT station and easy access to Suntec Convention center where the Spikes Asia festival was held. Being a Thai citizen, we are used to the HIGHEST standard of hospitality available anywhere in the world. For the price of 190 SGD per night for a 3 star hotel, it was appalling. For that price, you can probably stay at a 5 star hotel downtown BKK. Rooms were ordinary. The TV turned on by itself every morning. (I thought my colleague turned it on, vice versa). We couldn't get any sleep. Pillows were low and needed two to stop our necks from breaking. For breakfast, I really have no idea where to start. Choices were limited. Everything was BASIC. Quality was extremely low. No cheese. Bacon was soggy. 3 choices of salad to choose from and their dressing looked like it came out from a bottle. Last but definitely not least. Where did they hire these people from? The receptionist (male with glasses) probably in his 20s was downright rude. He was pushy and impolite. Repeatedly asked us for the LAN cable (when it was already returned). Only when he realized he looked embarrassed. He needs a harsh lesson in hospitality. Though it was company expenses, none of us were impressed. Would have loved to stay at the Ibis which was a few steps away. They said on their corporate website that free WIFI was available only to find out that it was available only on the ground floor. You need a LAN cable upstairs.

The only downside was that the gym located by the pool is too small, the equipment too limited (just one small bike and one treadmill) and the room is far too hot to use. BTW the poster photo of the swimming pool is very misleading - the pool has a cityscape in the background, not an airbrushed blue sky!

There was a 21\" flat screen TV and free wired internet (wireless is only available in the lobby and the restaurant). The bathroom was OK with a tub plus the usual towels and toiletries. The bed was comfortable and my wife and I both had two pillows each. On the downside, the aircon started dripping on day two. We can hear it dripping on the carpet throughout the night.

We took the package which included a room upgrade [spacious with interesting view], free breakfasts and one free dinner. While not fussy eaters, we found the breakfast lacking in imagination but more importantly, lukewarm at best. This also applied to the evening dinner so we did not take dinner again, as we like our food hot. Northwards to Orchard Rd; Southwards down Raffles Boulevard towards the sea; Eastward to SE Asia and on to Little India and West across Fort Canning Park to Clarke Quay and Chinatown, the central location is perfect. As indicated before, there are only four sunbeds at the pool along with some tables and chairs, but there were never many people there and we were there once every day. To keep in contact with family, the free interenet access in the room was ideal and the king sized bed was wonderfully comfortable.. The reception staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and happy to give advice and information about the area. Steve, the manager,showed real concern that we were happy with everything.

And there was free hi-speed internet Was it worth it? Well it was in a very good position with a small but pleasant food centre next door. The room at first seemed 3* depressing but actually it was pleasant in the daylight and clearly the bathroom fixtures had been modernised. The breakfasts were a little limited but then they were free, and they did have some pleasant Chinese food alongside greasy western. And given other hotels for the same money didn't include this - it was good. The free evening meal was a joke - there was nobody in the restaurant (This is Singapore, food capital of the world!!) - and the food on the buffet was very sad, suicidal even.

The Hotel was clean, and the size of the room was very good, free Air Conditioning, a fridge with soft drinks supplied (Chargable) a TV etc etc, everything you would expect - The ONLY problem we encountered was that our room was right opposite the lift and it 'dings' everytime it arrives at the floor - It was very annoying but to be honest we got used to it. I was pleasently surprised with the breakfast buffet, alot of other reviews said it was samey but what do you expect for breakfast, there was Asian cuisine to Ceral and Egg and Bacon, fruit etc - I just had a few different variances every day and it made a good start to the day. The Hotel Location, we thought was fantastic - OK, it is about 5/10 min walk away from an MRT stop, but we actually found we walked to places anyway, nothing is really too far. Orchid Road is just round the corner from the hotel and in the opposite direction you have Raffles Hotel and the Chijmes Centre - About a ten min walk.. The hotel also does have a taxi rank right outside which incidentally were very cheap to go any where. The swimming pool on the roof is 'cute' and very nice, had a nice morning up there in 30 degree heat and sunshine in December !!! :o) Next to the Hotel is a 7/11 store which had most essentials but as you will start to realise Singapore is not cheap in the centre apart from their own cusine. Next to the 7/11 is a Hawker Centre (Food outlet) we thought this was fantastic, 2/3 course meals for around \u00a33.00. If you like trying new dishes then do try the hawker centre's around the city, by far the best way to experience the food - Do not be put off by how food places look in Sngapore, they pride themselves on how food tastes and not the ambience - Hygeine laws (so we have heard) are very very stricked in Singapore. Try the Satays in China Town the were fantstic !!!! Western food is singapore we found expensive, but then the exchange rate was terrible when we went, however it can be expensive but it is very very good !! I could go in to all the sights we saw etc, but discover it for yourselves - everything we done was worth seeing and doing. For our nghts out in Singapore we headed to the Chijmes, Boat Quay, Clark Quay etc all very pretty - Alcohol IS expensive in Singapore so do not be surprised, we were paying \u00a36 - \u00a39 a Beer depending on where you went - Please be aware there is nothing cheap about a Singapore Sling in Raffles, but it is a must - Wonderful afternoon sat in Raffles chcking Monkey Nut shells on the floor :o) Just remember do not drop litter, smoke where there are ash trays and tipping in restaraunts etc is not nessassary - it is not encouraged. All in all we had a wonderful week in Singapore from shopping to site seeing to trying lots of different foods. It is clean, tidy, you can eat your dinner off the floor down in the MRT and people are very friendly - Singapore is a must !! I will just also add - New Year .... We found very little information on New Years eve celebrations before we went, however there are several parties all over but we headed to Marina Bay about 10 - 10.30pm, we had a fab view, the atmosphere was amazing and the Count Down and fireworks were out of this world.

Feeling slightly trepiditious after reading hundreds of varying reviews online, we decided that we would give it a shot anyway. After all, the majority of the time when we were last in Singapoare, the hotel was used for sleeping in and swimming! We arrived at the C.B. around 1500 hours. Check in was swift and the concierge very helpful with the luggage. We were checked into room 607. If anyone reading this has stayed or is planning to stay in C.B., please ask to be away from rooms that have 07/08 at the end or else you will find yourself opposite the lifts. Good points about the Hotel: Pool was hardly used - a good thing because it is rather small and I like to do laps. If it had been busy, all I could have managed was a small dip. Corridors were clean and lobby was spacious. Location is a huge positive. Bugis Street one way and Orchard Road the other. Dhoby Ghaut was perhaps 5 minutes walk if that. Negative: No safety warnings at the pool. On my first swim, I slipped badly coming out of the shower as the slope slightly. They aren't designed for safety either - no grip-safe tiles at all. Just normal tiles you might find on a kitchen floor. After suggesting that the staff put a warning up, nothing was done by the end of our 10 night stay. Breakfast. Oh, dear Light, what can I say about this? Buffet style which is okay, but very very limited selection. Three types of fruit juice. Apple, orange and pineapple. The orange tasted like strong diluting juice and I couldn't even bring myself to taste the other two. I ended up savouring a few extra hours in bed and then eating at the Kopitiam thirty yards away. Laundry and ironing facilities were disappointing. There were no instructions on how to work the iron. You had to assume that the timer switch that was meant for the light was actually for the iron. It was six dollars (Sing) apiece to use the washer and dryer and yet only three minutes away was a laundretted that charged 10 Sing dollars for collection, laundering and delivery - all on the same day! Good points about the room: Very spacious Huuuuuuuuuuuge bed - well above king/queen size. Air-conditioned and the window opened ever so slightly. Curtains were amazing at keeping the light out. I woke at 1000 hours one morning and thought that it was still the middle of the night. Bathroom was spacious enough. Negative Aspects Walls were PAPER THIN! I was woken at 0600 by some German man's nokia ringing over and over and then the hotel phone calling to wake him. I ended up shouting through 'Answer your bl**dy phone!' We were given an inter-connecting room - obviously one meant for families. On our second night within the hotel, two girls decided that they were going to play 'knock door runaway'. Feeling decidedly angry at having my night disturbed, I knocked on their door and asked them in no uncertain terms to stop knocking. I then spoke to the front desk and they sent three people to our room to investigate. We were informed that our inter-connecting door could not be opened by the adjoining guests as long as ours was 'latched' into place. There was no lock on it and the fact that there was only a knob on one side (the side into each room) was supposed to assuaged my fear of someone sneaking into the room and perhaps raiding our items. Luckily, the girls appeared to only be stopping over for a couple of nights - of which I am glad - their incessant chatter and giggling had me at my wits' end and I am someone that enjoys a laugh far more than the average person. THE CLEANERS HAVE TO CHECK UNDER THE BED! It's all fine having a newly re-furbished hotel, but the bath was so old that it was stained yellow. Before I took a bath myself, I scrubbed it to ensure that it wasn't nicotine or dead skin stuck to the sides. The TV was so-so. Only two English channels - BBC World News (which repeated every 20 mins or so) and HBO, which due to injuries, my partner and I spent a lot of time watching. The lighting could have been more adequately placed and a lot brighter. After three days in the room, the lightbulbs were replaced by dimmer ones and so we had to have every single light on to feel comfortable to read! I would recommend this hotel for people that have a smallish budget and anyone that is looking for a 'stopover' room between travelling destinations.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "pompey1001", "ReviewID": "UR16397615", "Content": "Dont hesitate to book the Bayview hotel in Singapore, it was a lovely hotel and the breakfast is fine.

It was decorated in light woods, had a cotton duvet on the comfortable queen sized bed, flat screen TV, desk, safe and mini bar/fridge. The bathroom had a shower over the tub and the vanity was nicely decorated with red tile and black accents. Good water pressure and nice amenities too. The room looked recently refurbished. I particularly liked the soft lighting, the overlapping blackout curtains and the air conditioning, which kept us plenty cool, just the way we like it.

I asked how I get a taxi, or could he call one for me as it was 5pm (ie peak time) and he told me that I could hail one outside as they go past then walked off on me. I waited for nearly an hour on the curb and when I was finally first in line, an English businessman stole my taxi as I was lugging my bag to the boot. The concierge saw me the whole time and did nothing. Luckily another English businessman saw this happen and promptly gave me the taxi he had rung for 20mins beforehand. Having the 7/11 next door was very handy, but I didn't really enjoy my experience. I am a small female who travels alone, so things can get daunting. I've travelled extensively but I have never had so many problems in one place. Oh, and there was this creepy Indian guy that would follow me around the lobby and in the lift. I often saw him sitting on the couch near the brochures watching women.

Nevertheless the hotel looked exactly the way it was shown on the internet with no hanky panky business. Our check in was a 2:00 PM which was a wierd time. The guy at the reception desk said we could come in by 11 AM to check in which seemed a good proposition. When we were about to check in a lady came down (Seemed European) who was extremely annoyed with some water leakage from the ceiling and how her husband would be so annoyed with her for this! We were extremely scared to hear and this and we thought we were in for some major crappy room in such cases. But that was definitely not the case. Our room was right at the end of the corridor and near the house keeping room so in the morning we had some noisy house keeping chinese lady making all sorts of irritating noises. Finally we had to ask her to stop it and she did. I found the bathroom stinking at times maybe because the main bathroom drain was right under us (Atleast I am presuming that). The funny part was before I left for Singapore I had checked with the hotel on the breakfast that was suppose to be included with the room rate. Once we reached there the reception lady haughtily refused the breakfast saying that she never mentioned about the breakfast. Anyhow the seven eleven store right next to the hotel was a boon we had coffee and a butter croissant every morning! Good clean room with a clean bathroom was something I liked about Bayview and yes its sooooo close to the Dhoby Ghat MRT station and very close to Plaza Singapura Mall which is a boon in disguise.

Arriving at Bayview was a a very pleasant surprise. For a country where city space is premium price, Bayviews hotel offers a nice welcoming atmosphere when you step inside their lobby. The room we were given is of very decent size. We have booked a triple room for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids. We definitley have plenty of room to move about. Oh, we have stayed in some big city hotels before when you only have just enough room for 2 suitcases. The staff are amazingly polite, helpful and friendly, but that is most of Singaporean for you.

Funny how we found on the 2nd day that to go to most places of interest like Orcahrd, Raffles hotel, Bugis Street and the Suntec Mall, it is easier to walk because of the one way road system whichmeans some routes will have to do a turn around to take you to the next street. Well, walking was fun, go to see some interesting buildings. When you get to Bras Basah (that chages to Orchard Road as you go right). turn left and 2 streets away is Chijmes. Don't be fooled. It is not a place of worship. walk in and enjoy beautiful gardn setting of several eating and drinking places. Be warned- can be pricey for some budget travellers.

Bedding was hard and uncomfortable, with very thin blanket that had a very cheap feel. Breakfast was quite awful, all the bacon was burnt to a cinder and scrambled egg was soupy. Walls in the room was also very thin as I could hear someone next door coughing every time. The door of the room also didn't close properly when it swings shut. Of course I didn't realise this so the door was unclosed for the whole night. At 5am I woke up becos someone was knocking on my door. When I got to the door that was when I realised it was still open. Imagine how terrified I was discovering that after hearing knocking at 5am! I quickly slammed it closed and looked though the peep hole to see no-one there. But the thought that someone could have just come in while I was asleep creeped me out big time. Worst part of this is that something was maybe going on in Singapore that week so I couldn't book anywhere and ended up paying to pay 170 SGD for this hotel. It is a major rip off for this standard and I imagined that all the other people who wrote positive reviews about this place must have paid a lot less. Basically was told by friends that you should not be paying more than 90 SGD for here.

Probably one of the most conveniently located hotels we have ever visited. Short walk to most attractions including art museum, Raffles area, Bugis and even Orchard Road! Just outside the hotel, there is a 7-11 store plus a 24-hour coffee shop selling a wide range of cheap delicious food. The Kopi-O (black coffee) is only 80 cents! You can get a decent meal for under S$5. Although the rooms are a bit small, they are comfortable with most ammenities such as a room safe and coffee/tea. The bathrooms are immaculately clean and quite modern. Hotel facilities include a small roof-top pool with good city views, and free internet - the reception will lend you a LAN cable or you can use the wifi in the lobby. This hotel will suit business travellers and also tourists who spend most of their time sightseeing, as they probably won't mind the compact rooms. Probably difficult to find better value for money in Singapore.

Travel airport-hotel: my travel agent forgot to mention the shuttle bus on the voucher and I had to pay for it. It was 7 S$ one way, (shared with 5 people) in a Mercedes van with no meter. When I got off he offered to take me back for 35 S$ and I rejected. He lowered the price at 25 and when I told him that I will check with a taxi first, he took off. (the taxi for the airport is 15-20 S$ from anywhere in the city). Beware of crooks. I was a bit tense before the arrival to the hotel, taking in account my disastrous experience with Golden Landmark Hotel a couple of years ago. Since my flight arrived at 8 AM in Singapore ( 13 hours of flight ), and I had the next plane at 1 PM next day I booked two nights to be hassle free and to check in immediately. Location: the location is good, almost in the city center, near everything. Lobby modest, one TV screen, only some sofas, no internet. ( you can get internet access in department stores with computers and also in telephone stores, free of charge). The room paid: Superior with breakfast. What I asked at the front desk: High floor, good view, quiet (not near elevator), non smoking, no pets. I was extremely pleased to see that was very clean. Clean indeed, without any smell and I could walk relaxed and safe bare foot on the carpet and in the bathroom ( do you follow me ?). This is the first time after many years in hotels all around the world in this price tag\u2026 Bathroom clean, with no mold. Some amenities. Towels worn, but clean. Bed (double) very clean. Whole room refurbished with very good taste in colors and design. A small safe working, hangers. TV, I did not check tough. A minibar but does not worth the money. It is a 7/11 shop next to the hotel full of drinks. Lights: extremely well done, switches everywhere, could modulate light in every corner intelligently. Very pleased. Air con: individual for the room. Working. Could adjust flow and temperature. Very pleased with that. Overall: room very good for the price. View: do not be fouled. The name has nothing to do with the bay. Take a front street room. The building is somehow low and very near the other buildings all-around. The best view is on the main street. Take a higher floor, ( I was at 12) because the traffic is high and noisy. Scary: to my horror, the room was connected the next one by a double door. Each room could open only its door (only interior handle), nevertheless there was no system in place to clearly lock my door from inside. The elevator correct and safe. I was surprised to see an announcement that is available some free laundry on the last floor. ( I did not check tough). Anyway, is good if you stay for a longer holiday. After checking in, I went to take my breakfast. You will get a voucher for that. Breakfast: disappointing. No cheese, no bacon. Scrambled and fried eggs, a processed ham pathetic, one Chinese processed meat can type sausage, some cereals, no milk one type of orange juice, one of coffee, (no decaffeinated), and tea. Some fruits and sweets. For the price, almost nothing. The restaurant clean and refurbished. Conclusion: do not include in room price the breakfast, does not worth the money. Go around the corner, there are plenty of restaurants with great choices. Town: each time I go I relax and enjoy. People are friendly, smiling and relaxed even they are not rich. Can take and understand a joke. Think about Tokyo for example\u2026. In Singapore was an IMF meeting at the time and police was at every corner. They discretely scrutinize you, nevertheless, overall you feel very safe in town. I went to Clarke Quay, took a boat around the bay and after that the lunch. I tried to walk there but is a bit far (2 Km ?) and I was approached by a old may with a rickshaw. I did not negotiate any price. The guy was so old and weak that almost I had to push him since could hardly make any progress. After less that one km he asked me 10 S$ that is 5 times more than the taxi for the same distance. I gave him 3. The restaurants on the Quay were empty. I shopped a bit around and I could see that one can get first beer free with the meal. Do not forget to ask. I took tenderloin that was advertised at 22 S$. I offered him 15, he rejected, we settled at 18 and first beer free. Do not forget to bargain. Returning, I took a taxi and cost 7.5 S$ for 2 Km, that later I felt high since for the airport like 15 Km I paid 15 S$. Dinner: I returned to the hotel and asked them since I leave very early and I do not get the breakfast in the morning to give me a cold snack. There were a bit surprised and after some deliberation they gave me a voucher for the dinner. Only a few persons there. Food was much better that breakfast (buffet also). A few type of meat some sea food even a Japanese dish. It was good enough for me. There was no orange juice and I asked for it, telling them I have no intention to pay for it since should be included. They brought a glass. Promptly. I did not take a coffee at the time and before leaving the hotel I went to take a coffee that they gladly served free. From what I could see ones should not go for meals in the last half hour before closing because food is scarce. Overall impression of the hotel: very good for the price, very clean room, staff friendly and helpful. Restaurant's foods rather poor, do not worth the money. I would go again and I would recommend it for longer holidays too.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bayview Hotel Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d305428-Reviews-Bayview_Hotel_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$149 - $296*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">30 Bencoolen Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">189621</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "305428", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3d/f3/1f/deluxe-room.jpg"}}
