But I was not disapoointed to end up at Hotel 26. A very modern hotel, much bigger rooms, bigger windows, bigger and better beds. A the breakfast included in the price, which almost accounted for the difference in the price, although to be fair to Junckers, they paid the difference in tariff by way of an apology. Staff at Hotel 26 were very helpful, the reception was light and very modern, the breakfast area/bar was very clean and well organised. Not an issue for me but there is no lift in the hotel so if stair are a problem ( its 3 story ) this might not be the place for you. The Hotel is in quite funky part of town, with lots of bars and restaurants to choose from. excellent bus, tram and u-bahn all in easy reach. Hotel 26 is set back from the road in what looks like a communal garden so is very quite at night. Breakfast was brilliant and is included in the tariff. Lots of tea or coffee, cheese, cold meats, eggs, salmon, baked goods. A great place to stay in a great location. Good value for money. If travelling alone and are not too fussy, you could save money by staying elsewhere, but if looking for a quality hoptel at a good price Hotel 26 will be hard to beat.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best places in Berlin to stay\u201d", "Author": "cybergabi", "ReviewID": "UR85618193", "Content": "Been there twice, first in December 2003 and in October 2010. I wasn't not disappointed either time: It's a wonderful, quiet oasis in a backyard of a buzzing and vibrant district. Comfortable and spacious rooms, very clean, nice people who run it, and includes a great (widely organic) German breakfast buffet. They have free WiFi and a beautiful summer terrace. Rates are really competitive (we paid \u20ac79 per night for a double including breakfast). One minor downside: They don't have an elevator, so if you're handicapped, make sure you reserve a ground floor room.

I travel alone & single rooms are usually really pokey. This was not the case with Hotel 26. I was in Berlin for a week so it was nice to have plenty of room to unpack & put away my suitcase. The rooms were clean & new & had simple Ikea furniture. It was quiet enough so I had no trouble sleeping. However, It was rather hot while I was there & the rooms did not have fans or a/c. A mini-bar would've been nice but that's a minor qualm. The internet connection was really fast & you could get it in your room or use the computer downstairs at no extra charge. The breakfast was AMAZING! It was served in the hotel cafe downstairs which was really cute & it was lovely to eat breakfast outside in the courtyard. On entering the cafe you are offered coffee (or tea if you prefer) & the staff refilled mine as soon as it was empty (oh yeah, the staff were really nice). As for the selection, there was fresh fruit salad, muesli, yoghurt, juice, cold meats, cheese, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, fabulous fresh breads, croissants & sweet breads (try the chocolate bread if they have it). Ok, enough about the breakfast, now on to the area. I love Friedrichshain! Not as \"kool\" as Kreuzberg perhaps but definitely a lively place with great bars & a lot of great places to eat. A couple of my favourites were Nil on Grunberger Strasse 52 (a Nepalese eatery place with falafel rolls for \u20ac2!) & Lemongrassn on Simon-Dach-Strasse 2 (Thai restaurant). But there are dozens of great places around Boxhanger Strasse & you'll have fun finding your own favourites. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Frankfurter Tor U-Bahn stop, also about a 10-15 minute walk to Warschauer Strasse U & S-Bahn station, & a short & pretty walk over the Oberaumbrucke to Kreuzberg. The hotel is also within walking distance of one of the the most popular bars/nightclubs in Berlin, Berghain/Panorama Bar. I would not hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cagliari", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, good breakfast, great apartment\u201d", "Author": "Ilovesardinia", "ReviewID": "UR22803727", "Content": "Stayed at hotel 26 with a colleague during the itb trade fair and we enjoyed our stay a lot.

Yeah, I did recognise the fittings as being pretty much exclusively from Ikea but so what, they aren't the cheapo fittings and I went on to buy fittings just like them for my home so I'm not complaining. I stayed in about 3 different hotels in the area (within the same price range) and this was by far the nicest with a delicious breakfast buffet offering cereals, mueslis (without chocolate), natural yoghurt, dried fruits, fresh fruit salad, croissants, rolls, toast and jams, meats , cheeses and table service for tea and coffee. In the summer you can sit outside on their patio overlooking their garden at the rear and enjoy your morning tea in peace as the whole hotel is set back from the main road. Several times my flight was late arriving so reception stayed open late to let me in as the desk closes at midnight and I got there after 00:30. Clean spacious rooms with air conditioning units and fans which was extremely necessary in the summer heat! It sounds funny but I also appreciated being able to open the windows to let air in as in another hotel it wasn't possible!", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canterbury, England", "Title": "\u201cHotel 26 - Top Notch\u201d", "Author": "Kentster", "ReviewID": "UR5192311", "Content": "Stayed here a few nights in October.
