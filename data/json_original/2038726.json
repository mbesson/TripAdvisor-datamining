I have stayed here for about 20 nights since the start of 2012 and can only say whay good value for money the hotel offers. Great Spa and pool, area, very good 9th floor Club lounge and bedrooms of a 5 star standard. You can gain access to the Club lounge via a small upgrade charge or by paying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 one off charge per day and for this you get drinks and snacks. For those visiting the main historic sights of Istanbul you need to be aware of the location of this new hotel but for those doing business on the Asian side the location is very good.

You do not recognize it if you stay for one night but if you stay for 5 you will clearly see it needs improvment. I wrote detailed explanation about this in the survey of hotel and got personal email back where he infomred there would be invested in more training for house keeping so i am sure it will be improved on my next stay. I ordered room service and the food was delicious. I really loved the spa, and it is highly reccommended. the massages are excellent and i went there every day of my stay.

My special compliments must go to the hotel-staff, which was very attentive to all my needs throughout my stay and always genuinely warm. It is not very common in chain-hotels.

My overall experience is has been very poor. Things constantly broke down and unfortunately it took hours of agony before they were fixed. On our first day the aircon didnt work and we waited four hours in a freezing room getting it fixed. On our second night the jacuzzi didnt work and we waited for two hours for them to fx it, yet they couldnt. They advertise a gym & spa on their internet site but you have to take a taxi to get to a local gym for this. It is a complete shambles! The first room they gave us had accumulated dust and used tissues under the bed. The floor manager offered to upgrade us to another room. Although I specifialy asked for a non-smoking room this upgraded room was clearly a smoking room as there was an obvious smell. When I pointed this out the manager pulled a face to me as if to say I was being unreasonable. He very hesitantly agreed to move us in an identical room at a different floor. As I have been with a small child I was getting very tired of this room hoping. Eventually we settled in our new room. However the air-con in this room was not working and we felt extremely cold. When I reported this it took them over three hours to get it semi worked. It was very cold and I was wrapped in blanket waiting for it to fixed! Not quite the 'luxury' they promise on their internet site. Meanwhile the manager offered us a bigger and better room at another floor and asked me to view it. This room was not even furnished yet! They suggested they would get it ready in no time. My child and I waited at the lobby. It had been seven hours since we checked in yet we still have not had a room to relax. It felt as if they were going thru trial and error in everything. After the room the manager offered us was ready he came over and explained that there would be additional charges for that room. I was extremely upset as I was waiting for hours to settle in a room and they tried to fool me by supposedly 'offering' an upgrade and then requesting further charges for it. At this stage if I hadn't pay for my entire stay upfront I would have happily move to another hotel.... We were assured the aircon was fixed in our previous room and we returned there. THis hotel has jacuzzis in the rooms -although in my opinion they would barely qualify for a whirlpool. And when we tried to use it, you guessed it, it was not working. WHen I reported this they sent a few technical staff to fix it. These people remained in my room over an hour and they couldnt even fix the thing. Furthermore these guys had such a bad smell I could not bare to breathe! Considering the hotel has been operational for only a few months I found uncleanness and poor quality of equipment unacceptable. On the positive, the reception staff esspecially Ozkan Bey is very polite and helpfull. But sadly that was not enough to give us a comfortable stay.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Limak Eurasia Luxury Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d2038726-Reviews-Limak_Eurasia_Luxury_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$139 - $169*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kavacik</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2038726", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1d/f4/1df48a7df8ad601d9848609c164776643large.jpg"}}
