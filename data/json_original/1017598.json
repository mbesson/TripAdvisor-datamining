What I noticed most of all was that everyone talked about the owner Turgay, I figured all of these people can't be wrong... and they weren't! My column isn't up yet but I am in the midst of writing it and thought I would stop to write my review on Trip Advisor. First of all I went right by the hotel because you don't realize it's there. I had to walk back and check for the address again and sure enough there it was! I rang the doorbell and a young man answered and promptly took my luggage up the stairs for me. I was able to get an early check in and they allowed me to check out a bit later as well, and that type of service is deeply appreciated. The room was great with full amenities. I had a European style stand up shower, and was fine with that, and had a full kitchen with a microwave, living room and bedroom. I loved the room and felt like I was in a home away from home. Coras is right downstairs! Now, that's convenient and there is a Provigo down the street for groceries, so you are able to get some frozen dinners or if you choose cook your own meals, or just go to Coras for an awesome breakfast. It is close to the Metro Station, you can also catch buses there that will take you right downtown and it's clean and super convenient. I really don't think that you can ask for anymore. I don't get to Montreal that often but I know that I will not want to stay anywhere else but Parc Suites.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, MD", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, beautifully appointed & gracious service!\u201d", "Author": "Rhiannon94", "ReviewID": "UR128111947", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights while visiting McGill Univ.

Very close to McGill and would be an excellent base for anyone moving a student to that instituation in the city. We stayed in a room with a king bed and pullout queen sofabed. The queen sofabed was suprisingly comfortable as these types of sleeping arrangements can be touch and go depending on the hotel.

Either that or I got the one room that is not a success out of the 6 room hotel. I get there and the owner was nowhere to be found. I waited and rang the bell (in the winter on the side of the road), called two numbers, nothing. 10 minutes later, I finally get buzzed in. When checking in the owner was so very rude and unapologetic. My stay was for 6 days for work, so I thought this place would suit all my needs, what with the kitchen and the homely looking rooms. Not true. There was no iPod dock, no alarm clock, the toilet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flush properly, the shower took literally 20 minutes to heat up and the sheets are maybe 100 thread count?? I was up scratching half the night for a week. I even asked if I could have new sheets, so the manager tells me he would have the sheets washed for me instead because he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any extra King size sheets. They only washed the top sheet, so the itch continued. Starch much? First day there, I obviously will need a cab. No one is to be found at the concierge desk... so I had to go and flag one. Not until my 4th day there did someone at the desk offer to call a cab for me. Also, the rooms that face the back alley are forced to listen to a very loud heating/cooling system so I hope you can sleep with noise! Because this is NOT a quiet hotel. Needless to say, I will not be going back. People I spoke to that live in Montreal all said that L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122appartment is the place to stay, so next time, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where I will be. I am only giving this hotel 1 star based on the location. Hotel Du Fort was a 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retro hotel, but this place takes the cake for places not to stay at.

The hotel was kind of us to let us check in early when we arrived in Montreal sooner than we had expected. The young Parisian women who greeted us was very friendly and accomodating with the helping us with our luggage and locating the free parking in back of the hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable. I recommend the king-sized suite. Pluses: full working kitchen, an amazing grocery store located nearby, friendly service, you pay when you get there in full- and free unlimited wi-fi and phone calls to the US and Canada at no extra charge. Free parking. A metro is also located nearby if you need it. Cons: Free parking is located in a small area in back of the hotel out in the open which can be a bit troublesome in winter- summer should be no issue. Location of the hotel could be a bother for those who want to be a bit closer to Rue Catherine. Again summer time this should be no big deal, but winter is a different story. Although I didn't find it a big deal, if you want an elevator, this is not the hotel for you. Tips: Run the water in the shower or bath for at least two minutes otherwise you will think there is no hot water. Ask for extra soaps or shampoos- some of ours were 1/2 full- but that could be due to the fact they let us check in early. The staff again is wonderful! Thanks for everything.

My husband and I came up for the Thanksgiving weekend and had a lovely stay. The manager helped us with our luggage checking in and leaving, personally took my husband to the parking lot behind the hotel. Our room is on the top floor, which is 3 flights of stairs up, facing the street. Had a cute little fire escape veranda to check out the street and let in some fresh air. WE are in our mid forties, and see climbing the stairs as exercise to burn off all those extra calories from the great food in Montreal. We love our king size bed, it was firm and supportive and gave us excellent nights sleep. The sheets were clean and fresh. The kitchen was fully stocked with the necessary pots and pans and utensils, the fridge was clean. I like the bathroom as it was very clean and bright. The hot water took a bit of time getting to me but that's fine as long as I do get hot water! Took a bath and there was plenty of hot water! And the best thing of all is that my towels smells nice! Most hotel towels have this industrial laundry smell, mine smells like I have done the laundry myself. The sitting room is comfy, couch is perfect for us to catch some tv time after a long day of sight seeing. I do wish for brighter lighting in this space, but that is just a personal preference of mine. Is the furniture brand spanking new? Nope, but they are not old and decrepit either. In any hotel that has been around for awhile, the furniture will take some beating. For the price we paid, we are completely satisfied and happy with the condition of the room. We are already planning our next stay at this very welcoming and home away from home.

We wanted to relax in a cozy way and enjoy Montreal. The staff and accommodations at Parc Suites were the perfect answer. The staff was simply wonderful. Everyone at the front desk was friendly, helpful and informative. The women who cleaned our rooms were marvelous. Maybe the best comment on the staff comes from one of the front desk folks themselves. They told me that their hope was to make Parc Suites like our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchome away from home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We feel they succeeded. We had a very comfy and clean one bedroom suite. The queen size bed was extremely comfortable, which says a lot considering that we ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t young and have many aches and pains. We found the living room and kitchen area roomy. We love to cook and used the kitchen a lot. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re food nuts so we always bring two of our own pans and some spices but the kitchen is supplied well. We cooked amazing dinners of salmon, marlin, buffalo, veal, duck, chicken wrapped in bacon, rib eye steak and lamb loins in that kitchen. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two large flat screen TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. For you computer nerds, the dvd player in the living room desk not only plays dvds but also plays mp3 music files and avi video files. (Video in avi format lets me put 4-5 movies on one dvd disc, so we could bring most of our extensive music and movie library and play them through the living room television.) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also free and reliable internet connections that are both wireless and wired. The location couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be better. The hotel is centrally located and near Old Montreal, the underground, Chinatown, etc. We walked many places or drove short distances out to the neighborhoods and to the Jean Talon and Atwater open markets and La Maison Du Roti butcher shop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c must sees if you love food. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great supermarket just doors away and another a block and a half up Avenue Du Parc. The restaurant downstairs from the hotel is terrific for breakfast and lunch. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into beer, Benelux and their wonderful brews are literally around the corner. Finally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to address two of the complaints I read in past reviews of this hotel. First, yes, there is no elevator. Our suite was on the top floor and although we can walk, both of us are disabled. But no matter, the front desk person enthusiastically carried our luggage upstairs without complaint. My wife and I viewed the climb upstairs after each outing as part of our daily exercise and in no detracted from our very enjoyable stay. Second, someone complained about the homeless folks and that the hotel was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon the wrong side of the tracks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Without being overly political, homeless people are unfortunately a fact of life in many cities. My wife and I both dealt with homeless people through our jobs so maybe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not as put off by them as some other travelers may be. We actually found the Montreal homeless we encountered to be polite, friendly, and non-threatening. Besides, when we walked around the corner past the Hilton Garden Inn, a homeless person politely asked us for money.

At the last minute my daughter (age 20) decided to tag along with my colleague and I. She called Montreal \"the result when Europe and New York City decide to have a child\". I think that means that she likes the place. First impressions were a bit iffy. A few intoxicated (seemingly homeless) people were leaned up against the side of the building with their hats open for our donation. Eek, what had we done? Once we crossed the threshold and climbed 30 stairs to the reception area, we knew we were in good hands. We received a friendly greeting and were offered assistance with our bags (which is no small thing given the vertical challenges here). Although we were offered a room at the level of the reception area, we decided to brave an additional hike of 21 stairs to room 8. It faces the rear of the building and is very quiet. Rooms (in this case a 1 BR suite) are updated and ours was very comfortable and quiet. We could see the conference hotel from our \"balcony\" (a fire escape, outfitted with one chair and some blooming geraniums) and as time passed, we became more and more happy to be staying so near but so off the beaten path. In the light of day, the homeless folk had departed (convenience store with beer for sale is apparently a great attraction) and the neighborhood character was more fully revealed (area is pulsating with university students, given the location close to McGill). We loved the extended hours supermarket next door (great for stocking up on water and breakfast fixings), the easy walk (10 min) to the Hyatt conference center, and reasonable walk (within 30 minutes) to many great areas with fabulous restaurants (such as L'Academie where you can bring your own wine). Even a simple bistro on Sherbrooke and Parc, steps from the hotel (with cardboard cutout of ice cream cone dangling in the window) offered outstanding pizza at a bargain price. Staff couldn't have been nicer. My colleagues had family members visit for a few hours and a staff member hopped into the family's car to escort them to the free parking (access is a bit tricky with all of the one way streets in the area). Whenever we asked for anything (such as extra towels or a taxi) we were quickly accommodated. Chain hotels are a dime a dozen but a stay in a place like this is memorable. Why think twice?

Hmmm\u201d", "Author": "moris41", "ReviewID": "UR65285823", "Content": "Hello. Ok, here goes my first review, ever, so I'll try to make it short, to the point and as objective as possible. The hotel itself is rather small and as the add says, these are suites in the heart of Montreal. The entrace is clean, up-the stairs, and the suites are clean but I found them a little smaller than expected. There was a kitchenette so cooking was possible and we took advantage of the grocery store a few feet south (towards Sherbrooke) which is a rather large store. And the service, Oskar was very, very attentive and tried to make us feel comfortable. That being said, there are a few 'down' sides that would make me think go here twice,,, with family that is. As in any large city (I guess including Toronto) beggars are part of the landscape, but this time, too close for my own comfort. The place next door seemed like an abandoned Chinese/Japanese restaurant where the beggars hang. They are quiet but just their presence made me feel un-easy. Quite honestly, this is the first time I felt insecure in Canada. Can you believe it? The parking was in back of the hotel and the access less than comfortable, in order to go to the back you could take the shortest route which is a passage between a large wall and a convenience store (note: If you go to buy groceries, my advice is not to go there) and it smelled like pee. I even caught a guy urinaring who promptly leaned towards the wall when saw me coming. When I first noticed where the car was going to be parked (my own car, not rental) I felt very uneasy. I asked the bellboy if there was any sort of security and he said all the guests parked their cars there and with no issues. They have a surveillance camera (hope they DO watch!) Then, I went back to check it out and the area was very well lit, but just the fact that it was out in the open and in that not so welcomy area made me feel uneasy. Nothing happened, thank goodness. Again, this may have been my perception and since I have never felt this uneasiness anywhere in Canada (actually Ontario) I can tell that at first I felt a little like when I was back in my home country, worried about theft, not that you don't have to be security conscious in every place, but there are areas where you take security for granted. The microwave broke. It was replaced almost immediately. The sofa arm rest fell off. IT was not fixed but I don't see this as a huge deal, only the fact that the thud it made when it fell turned heads. For the rest of it, we had an enjoyable time. Montreal is quite as expected. Nice city. Will I go back again to the same location? Hmm, I'd be interested in checking the prices at the hotel accross from the street first... Then I'll probably make a deciscion. In summary: If you go with family, this could be a good option and if you are not that picky about your vehicle security. If you go alone or as a couple...Hmm, maybe there may be better options.

I think this is the Parc Suites' secret weapon in competing with the big hotels in town, because their personal service is really noteworthy. But their free parking is also no small perk in downtown Montreal. Other hotels in the area charge $25 and up for nightly parking fees. There is a staircase to climb upon first entering the hotel, to reach the check-in. I would guess that might make the Parc Suites unsuitable for handicapped visitors.

This small hotel owner is serious about providing his guests with the best possible service. As it was, I had all the comforts from home and more: Fresh fruit in the room and in the lobby, attentive service, soft jazz playing in the reception area, beautiful wood banisters, and a very central location (several caf\u00c3\u00a9s, bakeries, food store, banking etc within half a block). I felt very safe there; my one piece of advice to women traveling alone would be to ask for your car to be taken to the parking area at night as the walk around the building to the front is a bit isolated.
