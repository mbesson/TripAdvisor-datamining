The location is perfect for travelers with kids - across the street there is a bus-stop (city direction, direct line to Luxembourg gardens, and the townhouse), a great bread shop a few buildings down, a supermarket right below, and a public park (with sand-pit, and swings) 10 min walk away. The only downside of its location is that when coming back from town, the bus-stop is a few blocks away - a small problem with a tired, uncooperative, little kid. For those who need to work, the internet was free and the connection reliable. There is a small dining room downstairs where they have coffee and tea. The apartment itself is small - one bedroom with a comfortable queen size bed, and the living room has a pull-out couch (not the most comfortable, but OK). The kitchen is tiny, but has everything that you might need - and the hotel provides all the cleaning supplies. The staff is very very friendly, and always ready to help.

Everything you need is 30seconds away - grocery store, bakery, and restaurants. We visted both the bakery and grocery store several times during our stay. The hotel is not even a 5 min walk from the Tram which can take you to the Paris Metro system - very convenient for visiting all the sites and travelling to train station (not all metro stations have escalators so pack light). The room itself was good and clean - though the layout was strange. The shower/bathtub/sink were in a room separate from the toilette. The bed were two singles - one which was the \"couch\" and the other pulled out from underneath it. They were comfortable enough for our short stay. We did have some issues with the heat - was way too hot but the thermostat didn't work to adjust heat only if you turned it off, so it was a delicate balance. Kitchenette had everything we needed. Our room faced out onto the street below which didn't cause too much noise except first thing in the early morning - something that sounded like a forklift moving around back and forth caused early wake ups.

I've been to Paris several times for vacations and this was my first time I came here for work. I've chosen this hotel due to the close distance to the exhibition center at Porte de Versailles and I wasn't disappointed. I upgraded my booking to the clubroom level and it was the right decision that the room was located on the very top floor with nice balcony along the living room to the bedroom giving the perfect space for refreshing air of Paris in the morning and very quiet corner at night over a glass of French wine. The bedroom is a bit small but the living room is quite spacious. Separated toilet and bathroom is pretty ideal for 3 people sharing the room. The kitchen is fully equipped with necessary utensils. Only weakness I found was that the wardrope was bit too small and not ideally enough for 4 ppl staying for a week. The convenient store next door is great, although closed on Sunday so you may like to stock up or be prepared for Sunday arrival. U can take a bus into Paris Centre (Hotel de Ville or City Hall - or u can easily get off at Pont Neuf for Notre Dame) from the bus stop right in front of the hotel, however the route on way back might be a bit tricky as it's one-way street where the hotel is located. U can easily take Metro and connect with Tram as well.

The appartment we rented was a self contained one so all the kitchen requirements one would expect, good flat screen tv, hifi - not that was much time to watch tv! There are supermarkets large and small 2-10mins away also french-moroccan owned/run supermarkets selling delicious rotisserie chickens! tubs of stuffed olives houmous etc to take back and eat in if you wish, and of course the typical coffee bars. So do stay here if you think this sounds what you are seeking! We flew from Southampton with FlyBe early on the Saturday returned the Monday and managed to fit in a good 3hrs up the Eiffel, cruised the Seine on Batobus [a must] visited the zoological gardens and did the Car Rouge [book this online prior to going to save some euros!] and a few miles of walking Paris districts, oh the tram is superquick, cheap,clean so look this one up aswell!

Very good experience. Great little neighbourhood with everything you could possibly need, including a grocery store, just steps away. Great bus service on same street and not too far from Metro. (I recommend the bus...less crowded and a great way to see more of the city.) Room was clean and efficient. As elsewhere in Paris, space is limited, but it suited our needs. Had a few \"discussions\" with staff about what constituted \"extra\" cleaning, for which we paid 8 euros a day. Some days it was a full cleaning, other days they merely changed the towels. Odd! Front desk staff was generally helpful and friendly. Laundry in-house (a bit pricey but available 24/7) or in launderette a couple of blocks down the street. Wifi available in lobby and very reliable. Regular plug-in hi-speed internet in rooms. A desktop and printer is also available free of charge in the lobby. Liked the balcony and patio doors in both rooms of our suite. Pullout sofa bed in main room was surprisingly comfortable. Bedroom had very large regular bed (twins pushed together). Would definitely recommend. Good value and kitchenette helps you save as well. Many wonderful take-away caterers and bakeries within a stone's throw. As quiet as can reasonably be expected in a Paris neighbourhood...mostly residential with shops on main street. Had no trouble sleeping.

It was our first trip to Paris and without any knowledge of the Paris area we made our decision on reviews similiar to this. To begin with, a really good tip for those who are travelling to Paris for the first time(as we were). On arrival at the CDG airport and after collecting bags, if you follow the signs indicating the metro/train station you will come across an information desk. Here you can buy a metro pass, which in our case because we were there for 4 days we purchased a 5 day pass. For the 5 day pass we payed approx. 50 euro each which was fantastic value considering a single ticket would have cost approx 8-9 euro(and we would have used the metro 10+ times during our stay). The pass also gave us access to the outer zones of the city including a trip to disneyland and surrounding areas. At the information desk you can also ask about the accommodation you have organised and the staff will quite happily print off a map and point you in the right direction. From there its a short walk to the airport metro station where you place your ticket in the machine positioned next to the gates which let you through the the main station platform. The trip on the metro with one change of trains along the way took around an hour with us getting off at the Alesia station. From the Alesia station it is about a 10-15min walk to the hotel and is very easy to find. Along the way there is a great selection of bakerys and patisseries and right next to the hotel itself is a small supermarket with all the basics. On entering the hotel we were met at reception by a very friendly member of staff who quickly confirmed our booking and gave us all the relevant information we needed. Our room was on the first floor overlooking the street below. We had absolutely no problem with being on the road frontage as the neighborhood was very quiet and we had no noise issues throughout our stay. The room was a spacious self contained apartment style setup with a well equipped kitchenette. It also had separate bathroom and toilet. It had a double sofabed in the lounge area which was easy to interchange between sofa and bed and was also very comfortable in both situations. During our 3 night stay we did not get back to the hotel before midnight any of the nights. At no stage did we ever feel unsafe walking from the train station to the hotel in the early hours of the morning and were surprised at how quiet the area was at night. Overall we had a great stay at the citadines didot alesia with it offering all the basics we required and its relative close proximity to the metro.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley CA", "Title": "\u201cGood choice if you are willing to use Metro\u201d", "Author": "drlaz", "ReviewID": "UR77427455", "Content": "The Citadines chain are charmless, purpose-built hotel apartments, but they afford privacy and convenience for a family with children.

The neighborhood is away from the tourist sites, but the Metro is a pleasant 7-minute walk (Plaisance) and trains run every 3 or 4 minutes until early morning. The T-3 tram is a two-minute walk, but transfers from tram to metro on the same ticket are not allowed. (If you have a pass, this is not a problem.) There is a bakery across the street with fine breakfast pastries. Many of the restaurants on the street were closed for August vacation, including the small supermarket that usually occupies the ground floor of the hotel, but we did manage to get a cheese plate at the bar up the street at 11:45pm.
