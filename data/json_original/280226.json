Overall, it was a decent stay. We were in room 14 (I think that was the number, anyway) on the first floor behind the breakfast area. It was a little noisy, and I think not their nicest room, which was understandable as this was really a last minute booking. When entering our room, there was a tiny hallway with our private bath on the left and a very small bedroom ahead. The bedroom was a little worn, and the bed was typical for Europe -- too hard for our tastes. It was extremely clean and well maintained, however. The bathroom was reasonably large with a separate toilet / bidet area. The towels were the thin waffle type, but generously sized. The shower was a bit of a problem. It was a step down from the main bathroom area, as it was located under a stairway. The shower doors did not fully enclose the shower area so it was impossible to keep water from going everywhere. This was causing tile deterioration and a musty smell in the bathroom, although it was still very clean - I can't imagine the amount of scrubbing that had to be going on to keep the mildew under control. The staff was English speaking and helpful. When specifically asked, they would provide a great Rome map (don't bother buying one) and give recommendations and directions on anything in Rome. They were typically Italian, being courteous by not getting in your way (like the waiters not wanting to bring your check) so you do have to ask them directly for help. It was nice having a full time desk clerk there, as we stayed out late. I must respectfully disagree with some other reviews on the area being \"unsafe\". There was a lot of graffiti -- it's a huge problem all over Rome -- but we never felt the area was remotely unsafe. Italian women were out alone late in the area (no, not that kind of woman either) and things stayed busy till after midnight. It was a vibrant, authentic, and fascinating university area - think East Village NYC, or any urban college community. It was actually a relief to get away from the central historic area in the evenings, which started to feel like Universal Studios Roma after a while. The food was more authentic and cheaper here too. While the staff in the stores and restaurants spoke a little less English here than in the touristy sections, almost everybody spoke some English and were very encouraging and helpful when we tried out our phrasebook Italian. The drawback to the area was transportation. While it was not exactly remote, it was a 30 minute direct bus ride to the Trevi Fountain / Spanish Steps area (bus 71), a 30 minute direct tram ride to the Colosseum (tram 3), and a 1 hour direct but very windy bus ride to the Vatican. You could also connect to the rather limited subway system via bus 71. The buses could be pretty difficult to navigate, too. I think if you are the type of person who likes to go back to the hotel a lot during the day, you should fork out the extra money for a very centrally located hotel. Otherwise, seize this (or similar) opportunities to experience a more authentic side of Rome, and take daily field trips into the historic centre. Overall, not a bad stay.

Although the room itself seemed clean it was impossible to ignore the smell from the bathroom and the carpet was starting to wear through. Outside the noise from the locals continued until approx 4am so we didn't get much sleep. We left the next day to find another hotel. Overall, very poor. Both on the state of this hotel and for the Ateneo Garden Palace for not honouring our original booking.", "Date": "May 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sandton", "Title": "\u201cGreat value !!\u201d", "Author": "JPCS", "ReviewID": "UR3395525", "Content": "We stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed it tremendously, we went to Rome to see the sights not to hang around the hotel, and for a place to sleep and eat breakfast, the Laurentia is ideal.

But Bus stop is close at hand. Pickpockets in Rome are a menace , I caught one Guy trying to get his hand in my Wifes handbag on the Metro, so be very careful.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, helped advise us on places to eat and visit, and how to get there. It is a bit set back from the city centre, but the 71 bus just around the corner takes u straight to the city centre in about 5 minutes. The tram line is just down the road, which makes it quicker and easier to get to the colloseum. The location is only a drawback if you are planning on staying out till very late, otherwise Hotel Laurentia is the place to stay! :) The rooms are very reasonable for the price, breakfast is nice, but above all the staff are incredibly welcoming and really make the stay worthwhile! :) Next time i go to rome i will definately be staying here!", "Date": "August 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot what you expect\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2207018", "Content": "Reserved a taxi with the hotel people that never showed up and had to find one on my own after 1 hour of waiting.
