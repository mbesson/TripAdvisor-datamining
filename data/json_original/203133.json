Firstly, the staff in the hotel are excellent. Always helpful and polite, especially the front desk. The location of the hotel is the main selling point. A few minutes from Trevi fountain, then further to Pantheon and Spanish Steps. Then the other other tourist sites are a short taxi or bus ride away. The rooms we had were on the third floor and were of good standard, if a little wear and tear showing. However, they were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a tad small and the shower difficult to move in. Be careful with the safe, no instructions on how to use it so we had to ask. The doorman came to the room and went through it with us clearly. A good example that the hotel staff are the main asset of the hotel. Being near a busy street we were worried about the noise, but at no time was our sleep disturbed by the street outside. Breakfast was good, though the room was in the basement and a bit boring to be in. The bar was shut each night, mainly because most people were outside in the lovely weather at local bars and restaurant. I would recommend the bar and grill restaurant next door and associated with the hotel. Good value for money and choice of food to keep all happy. As previously mentioned, wifi is an additional cost. I used it in the lobby to get boarding passes at Eur3 for the hour. No printer, but staff said email the boarding passes to their email and then they printed for us. Yet again I have stayed at bigger, more expensive hotels and never received this level of service. The hotel organised a car to return to the airport in. At Eur45 (3 people), good value for money compared to the Leonardo Express.

However due to some problems with the rooms I was offered a room at Hotel White for the same rate. As a reference, Hotel Tritone was listed as 3-stars while Hotel White was 4-stars. The hotel is excellently located just far enough from Trevi Fountain to avoid the masses yet centrally located enough to be a short walk to the Barbarini subway stop, the Spanish Steps and even to the Colosseum. I was put into a standard room which was equipped with cable TV (10 channels or so), in-room programmable safe, mini-bar, pants press and some other nice touches including toiletries and slippers. The doors are keycard controlled, no keys to drop off at the reception desk. You do need to put your key into the slot to activate the electricity in the room but the bellhop will walk you through all of that including programming the safe. The hotel offers free breakfast from 7am-10:30am for all guests, 7 days a week. No room tickets are needed and there's a selection to satisfy nearly every type of appetite. It's all you can eat and you can take as many trips as you like. For a nice quiet breakfast show up around 8am before it gets too busy. If you eat between 7-8am you'll probably have the area to yourself which is a nice quiet way to start the morning. There is a computer available for use at the front desk for 5 Euros for the length of your stay. Wifi is free in the reception and lounge area but does not extend to the rooms. No filters of any type were apparent on the internet access. The area around the hotel is very safe and I had no problems returning to the hotel between 2-5am on multiple nights during my stay. The main issue you will have is trying to get back in the front door as the doorman is usually not at the front desk during those hours. But if you knock on the door he'll appear within a minute or so usually. The hotel is located right next to Quirinale so there are police around 24/7. There's a grocery store at the corner to the right and plenty of edible pizza orderable by the slice to the left on the way to Trevi Fountain. There were renovations ongoing during my stay but I was already up by the time they started so it didn't bother me. It appears they're renovating the entire 2nd floor which looks promising. Otherwise there's very little crowd or traffic noise and it is very quiet a night so you should have no problems even if you're a light sleeper. The hotel took credit cards for payment and offered payment either in US dollars or Euros. They will call taxis for you although I would suggest arranging for your own ride back to the airport if you choose to go by taxi as it seems they do add a surcharge for making the call for you. However getting a taxi to Termini will only cost you whatever the meter reads (about 10 Euros with the night surcharge).", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tel aviv", "Title": "\u201cgood choice\u201d", "Author": "natashaTelAviv", "ReviewID": "UR10912901", "Content": "We paid for standart room but were given new beautiful executive rooms!

It's so close you can get up at 6am to go and see the Trevi Fountain with no one else there and be back in bed at 6:25. The room was clean and comfortable (and in good nick) and while not massive was perfect for our needs; although the bathroom was a little on the small side it was perfectly adequate. There is an electronic safe in the room (you set the code) and a minibar which is very useful as a fridge. If you are as tight as I am you can go to the local Spar shop to replace items from the minibar before the maid comes round - it works out at about a quarter of the price (3 euros for one can of Heineken from the minbar or 1.65 for two cans from Spar). Breakfast was excellent - the dining room was very clean, and there was no problem with food runnning out. We turned up a couple of times at 10am (breakfast finishes at 10:30) and there was plenty of food left. There were sticky croissants, pastries, cereal, toast, fruit, cold cheese and meat, scrambled egg, bacon and mini frankfurters (when in Rome!), fruit juice and of course coffee and tea. All the hotel staff were very friendly and spoke adequate English. We were on the top floor at the back of the hotel and never had a problem with noise; and the aircon was very efficient. The map the hotel gives you on arrival was excellent we never left 'home' without it. A top tip if you are planning to visit the Colosseum: don't wait in the queues outside but pop down to the Palatine Hill ticket office, a short walk away, and buy a combined ticket to the Palatine and Colosseum for 11 euros. You can then return to the Colosseum, march past all the queues and go straight to the turnstile at the front. And then go and visit the Palatine later. On a general note we felt Rome to be safe if you exercise common sense. Just be aware of the red rose guys down at Trevi and their little scam of 'giving' you roses and then asking for 'a little something'. Just be firm and say no.

We walked everywhere, no need for taxis or buses etc. Spotlessly clean room, great breakfast, sound-proofed rooms, english speaking staff. Our room was probably one of the nicer ones, up on 3rd floor and with a bath, but the bathroom was so tiny you couldnt really use the bath! The whole room was small but I guess its to be expected in a cramped city. Bad points.. Just read previous poster re: A/C. Am annoyed now!! We had exactly the same problem, the room was very very stuffy with window closed, and very noisy with window open. I asked 3 times (3 different staff memebers) for A/C to be turned on / room made cooler and each time I was told this would be done, no problems. Of course this never happened as now I read that the A/C is not turned on at all in March!! I wish the staff had told me this instead of making me think our A/C was broken and that they were ignoring my requests. The staff were polite enough but you get the feeling they are laughing at you when you walk away, in fact we saw them do this when some guests were complaining at the front desk. This is very unprofessional and I did not like that attitude, but they were helpful with booking us restaurants and airport transfers etc. They are just not good with complaints! So, yes I would recommend this hotel based on excellent location, cleanliness, breakfast, value for money, sound-proofed rooms, but the staff could be better and the A/C needs to be switched on in March!

In fact almost everywhere we went people spoke in English as soon as they realised our Italian was limited to Bonjourno. We walked everywhere & found some great Piazza's close by for good food & drink If you want to experience Rome don't be tempted to stay in the \"chain hotels\" as they are all so far from the centre you will miss out. The hotel is comfortable and very clean, but beware standard rooms are very small with only a shower, no bath. However, I suspect many of the cental Rome hotels are like this as space is such a premium. Also make sure you request a room at the back of hotel as those on the front are very noisy. Once the people have left the street cafes etc, the cleaning trucks come round at 3 & 4am. One annoying point was that I had specifically booked a hotel with Air conditioning so we could keep the windows closed at night as we knew Rome was a noisy city. However, we discovered that the a/c is centrally controlled and was not operational in March as it was still classed as winter. So we had to have the windows open as the room was far too stuffy without and had disturbed nights. However, if we had asked I am sure they would have moved us. The breakfast room is more than adequate, continental style breakfast was plentiful and of decent quality. As highlighted by previous reviewer, we never saw the bar open. The food at the restaurant next door where guests get 15% discount is great and they have live music every night. Also the best ice cream shop in Rome, San Crispios where they handmake the most delicious flavours in small batches, is just around the corner from the hotel. Don't miss it.

Hotel is obviousley not used to such young guests on a regular basis but they went out of their way to be helpfull and make life as easy as possible. The staff, from the chamber maid to the front desk were all very professional and helpfull, most staff appeared to have a much better grasp of English than I do of Italian and when asked for information or assistance seemed eager to help.

Not the cheapest hotel but certainly not the dearest and I personally felt it was good value for money for both its location and service By the way the breakfast is more than adequate and there should be something for everyonr, from doughnuts to scrambled egg and bacon.", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4076210", "Content": "We have recently returned from 3 nights at the White Hotel in Rome. As it was my husband's birthday I had previously e-mailed the hotel requesting the best possible room, when we arrived we were taken over to one of the hotel apartments which was really nice, and very clean and spacious. The hotel had even provided us with a bottle of bubbly which I thought was a lovely touch. I also took advice from previous reviews and pre ordered the hotels own Airport car service which was \u20ac40 Euros and well worth it as the return taxi to the airport cost 40 Euros and would have cost more if the driver hit heavy traffic!! The food in the restaurant attached to the Hotel was lovely, however my personal favourate had to be eating out at a restaurant in Piaza Navona for the standard of food and the great atmosphere. The prices weren't bad either. The hotel itself has a great location, literally in the same road as the Trevi Fontain which is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking in the evenings. We went to the Colussium which was amazing however I must warn people about the Gladiators outside of the building who will try and rip you off. They approached us when we got out of our taxi, asking us about our trip and before we knew it they'd used our camera to take 3 pictures of us with them and CHARGED US \u20ac10 EUROS EACH for the privilage!!!! Do not stop for these people, they may seem freindly but they just want your money.....and lots of it! Overall an excellent weekend, in possibly the most beautiful city I have visited. The hotel was lovely and the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved it that much that we will be returning to Rome for New Year!", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NCLE", "Title": "\u201cfantastic location shame about the weather\u201d", "Author": "CBW01", "ReviewID": "UR4042767", "Content": "Took my partner to Rome for a four day break for his 40th birthday as a surprise, after reading about the hotel, location, city etc knew it would be fantastic. Everything was as expected except for the weather it rained solidly for two whole days but it added to the fun and nothing was spolit as we kept popping into the cafes, shops and touristy places to dry off. The Hotel was situated with everything within 30 minutes walking distance except the Vatican but only a few stops away on the metro.Buy a 3 day pass which allows you to hop on and off the buses and metro. The staff in the restaurants cafe bars etc were brilliant nothing too much trouble. The White hotel was extremely clean, comfortable and the staff very friendly and always available to help with maps, taxis or information, with it being so central you stumble on the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and other breath taking sights without looking for them. When the weather cheered up on the Sunday and Monday, you spent a lot of time in queues, so try to visit places in the afternoon when the big groups of tourists have left. Would go back to both the Hotel and the City again an would recommend it to friends as a must.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood for small people and those who can live in cupboards!\u201d", "Author": "Farnese", "ReviewID": "UR3997337", "Content": "A lovely little hotel, totally spoilt by the truly awful bedroom. The first room we were shown to was unbelievably small, probably only 7ft by 7ft! I just couldn't accept it and luckily as we checked in mid morning, they were able to offer us another room with the same size bedroom but with a little sitting room attached, so at least we were able to spread out a bit. The room we ended up in had 2 small single beds pushed together and seperately made up. There appeared to be a towel between the matress and the base which I didn't investigate but made the whole room look sordid. Bathroom was OK, minibar and safe were good to have. It was also very dark and the light switches had a mind of their own. What a shame as the staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble and they are all knowledgeable and speak excellent English. Location is superb, we walked everywhere.

Hotel White delivered all that. Downsides of our five day sunny stay, breakfast's became boring, no fresh fruit or fresh yogurt, toasting machine took ten minutes each slice. The room was reaching a redecoration stage, but not close enough to spoil our stay. The Air Con is very noisy if used above the low setting, I'm glad we didn't stay in the summer months. Our room was not your most expensive, so can only report on our second floor room with views to the close building on the opposite side of the street. I expected more from a 4 star hotel, perhaps in the centre of Rome I expected too much. Most attractions, bars and shops were within easy reach. My top tip, hire the Hotel's taxi from and to the airport, at a charge of 40 euros one way,you save a lot of hassle for the sake of about 10 euros.", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Jackthegreyhound", "ReviewID": "UR3685978", "Content": "We stumbled upon this place because we had booked a hotel in Rome and then found tripadvisor, and read the place we had booked was awful! The White Hotel got good reviews, so we stayed here in June 2005 for 5 nights. The room, although compact, had everything we needed, including minibar and TV. Shower/Bathroom was marble finished, modern and pleasant. Room was air conditioned, which you could control, and was quiet. Our stay was perfect, in that the staff were efficient, and helpful, breakfasts (Buffet style - included bacon, eggs etc) were huge, and the location was superb - on a little alley leading to Trevi Fountain, with local restaurants (including an excellent one next door associated with the hotel) on your doorstep. We saw just about everything we wanted to see - colleseum, pantheon, vatican, roman forum, shops - without needing to use public transport - everything is walkable (vatican - 20 minutes max - Pantheon was about 5 minutes away). Would recommend this place without hesitation and will be back. One word of warning about Rome - Taxi drivers will quote a price in advance for a trip from the airport, but if your flight is late, or at night, they will try and charge a premium - try and arrange through hotel, and let them argue for you....", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Charles, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with a great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3427296", "Content": "We picked the White Hotel based on the reviews we read on this site and the reviews were right on the money!

Our room was a loft set-up with the bed upstairs and everything else on the lower level.
