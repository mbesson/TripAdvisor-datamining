For $89 a night, you get what you paid for, and a little more. My husband, 8 month old son and I stayed at the Regency Hotel this past October from Oct 15-Oct 19, 2004. We arrived in PR pretty late, at 1:30am 10/16. The staff was pleasant and courteous. I called the Hotel to make sure we had a late check in the day of Arrival and we had no problems what so ever. Once we arrived at the hotel, they upgrade us to a Suite on their own accord. I asked for a crib and they had one sent up immediately. Though the pool was nothing much to speak off, it really didn't matter when you can use ALL of the amenities at the Wyndham Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino that is right next door to them. I think to many people are expecting 4 star service when it clearly states it is a 2 star hotel that is meant to go if you are on a budget. Will my family and I stay there again on our next visit to Puerto Rico? Yes we most definitly will...Personally, all my family and I did was sleep, and bathe in the hotel room...and both the room and bathroom (w/great water pressure I may add) where clean, the bed was pretty comfortable. What more do you want?!! If you want a 5 star Hotel, then this is definitely not the hotel for you....But if you just want to lay your head down to sleep at an affordable price, I would go with the Regency.", "Date": "December 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alamogordo, NM", "Title": "\u201cExtreme Letdown\u201d", "Author": "Boyd1944", "ReviewID": "UR2823639", "Content": "This hotel was found on the travelocity website and was supposedly a Four Star listed hotel. It should be listed as a NO STAR hotel. Our flight arrived late into San Juan as scheduled. We arrived at the hotel at 11 PM. The Doorman/Bellhop watched us struggle our luggage from the taxi cab to the counter. The desk clerk stated \"You finally arrived!\". The lobby/reception looked run down. The clerk said to \"sign here and your room number is so and on second floor\". The doorman/Bellhop was now out smoking, so we got our luggage, took the elevator to the second floor. We could not locate our room as indicated on the key. My wife went down and ask which room? \"Oh, it is 211. The number on the key is a code number in case it gets lost\"!. We get into the room and the only light that worked was the ceiling light. The night stand lights did not have bulbs in them. The room air conditioning was leaking water out of the ceiling, we believe due to the humidity. There were no towels in the bathroom. We tried to turn on the TV to see how the election was going and the TV would not work either. We called the front desk and told them of the problems. In 10 minutes a maintenance man and a security guard showed up with light bulbs and towels. We \"crashed\" into bed rather late. The next morning, we went down for the listed \"free\" Continental Breakfast. The breakfast area was in a \"dead end\" hallway leading to the back of the hotel. The breakfast consisted of only coffee (instant), white bread/toast, jam, a few (limited) pastries. There was no fresh fruit or cereal or even juice. We asked at check out for a member of management to file a complaint/refund and the clerk said there was no one in yet. We could not wait due to flight connections for our trip. Travelocity is wrong for listing such a terrible hotel.

While I got a great rate online, the old adage \"You get what you pay for\" applies. My number one complaint is No internet access. Not through the room phone via dialup (probably because they use Sprint as their carrier, which is a lousy service and ***** for internet dialup. They used to have internet access through the room TV, but discontinued the service months ago. If you are on a business trip, what good is it if you can't get online? USELESS. I was very frustrated by this. I brought along my laptop but couldn't get online. Complaint number two: Like most hotels in Puerto Rico, they charge you daily for parking. I have only encountered this in Puerto Rico. If you are a paying guest at the hotel, I don't feel you should be charged for parking at all. It's only $5 a day, but bothersome and onerous. It's like they are nickel and diming you to death. Parking in San Juan is dog-eat-dog. It's a jungle out there, and parking spaces at a premium, but they should not charge parking to their guests. Complaint number three: No coffee makers available in the room, and if you want an iron or hair blower or small fridge you have to call housekeeping and ask for one. They do offer a complimentary continental breakfast on Floor 1 between 7AM-9AM, but if you miss it, too bad. On the positive side, Regency guests are allowed to use the pool next door at the Wyndham Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino, (the Regency has a small one on Floor 1) but once you see THAT place you'll realize what you passed up in quality in order to save money, not just in terms of the pool but also the hotel. The Condado Plaza pool has a swim-up bar and water slide. The Regency Hotel pool is just a pool. In fairness, I must say the employees and staff of the Regency were very polite, the hotel is centraly located, and there are plenty of restaurants. One caveat: Stay away from the Puerto Rico casinos, very, very hard to win here. The slots have a 93% payout rate (LOW).

The state of the hallways, rooms and what they call a pool was dispicable. The only mentionable thing about staying there was that they allowed you to use the Wyndham pool (magnificent). The hotel room stunk the carpet and bathroom was filthy they had to move us to a different room which was not much better because the toilet overflowed.

For 1 night only, it wasn't horrible, but I would not recommend staying there for a vacation, unless you don't mind rooms that open to the outside, very old bathrooms with condensation dripping from the ceiling and carpet scary to walk on with bare feet. The building is in the shape of a \"T\" and there is a hallway across the front of the building, but it's open at one end and rooms down the side open to the outside. I could easily hear the group of kids in the room next door until late. The lobby is barren. Even if both elevators are working, expect to wait a long time because they are terribly slow.

The carpet was old, ripped and stained, the chair had a burned out hole in it, and the bed covers smelled awful. The staff did what they could to reaccomodate us, however, and we were given a different room. Please note, the first floor is not great, but it is far better than the other levels. Our new room was better but smaller and located right in front of the breakfast area, which gets quite roudy with kids in the mornings. The continental breakfast, by the way, consists of coffee, bread and danishes. All in all, it was a roof over our heads, not a place I would stay at ever again.

We had a balcony that over looked the pool and ocean and the porch/walkway overlooked the cruise ships. We were very happy here.
