On both visits I was welcomed by the shuttle service drivers at the Montreal Airport by the most friendly drivers. They always welcome you back as if they have known you for ever. Once you arrive at the Hotel you are greeted by the most wonderful front desk staff which throughout your stay are always more than willing to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms are spacious with a full kitchen, full size fridge, microwave, dish washer, and all dishes and utensils you will require. You are NOT expected to wash your dishes just give them a rinse and leave them in the sink and the cleaning staff will look after the rest. This is a wonderful touch when being on business. There is a shopping centre near by (walking distance) with a fantastic super market (Adonnis) that will meet and exceed all your food and beverage requirements. One of the best super markets I have ever been in. This Residence Inn also provides a full buffet breakfast each morning and a dinner buffet 2 and 3 nights on a rotating basis each week free of charge. All were very good during my stay. When away from home on business for an extended period of time this is as close to home as you can get. I highly recommend it.

And, no, it is not as close to the airport as I thought but that was a non an issue for me. However it is within walking distance of a mall. Given the isolation of the hotel, I was still able to get around easily. A ten minute or less walk along Beaulac to De La Cote-Vertu, I caught a bus to the station in going to Downtown Montreal. If one drives, it is even better. Great place to stay. It is literally sparkling clean. The suite resembles that of a junior condo unit with everything besides a washer and a dryer; there is no word of a lie. I stayed in the King Studio with Sofa Bed.

Whenever I needed a taxi, it was VERY prompt and they take credit cards which was helpful to expense my transportation (my company credit card is AMEX). Surprisingly, this Residence Inn provides room service - it's attached to a Courtyard Marriott that has a restaurant. The food was decent. Hotel aside, it you're looking for convenience to the sights (Old Montreal, Notre Dame cathedral, waterfront, etc) you'd be better off in town. Although the Residence Inn is considerably less expensive, round trip taxi service to go in town can run you about $80 or more. This hotel is VERY convenient to various companies if you're here for business, however. You can arrange for daily pick ups and drop offs to your company which are all less than 10 minutes away (including Canon, Brother, Merck, Valeant, Elan, etc).

One day when we arrived for breakfast, almost all the food was out. They refilled the food very slowly. The other two days was better.

Drove into Montreal for a family birthday party and needed a hotel close to the Transcanada Hwy for a quick return to Toronto. Found this hotel on-line and got a great deal ($130 all-in per night). Hotel looked brand new from the outside and we weren't disappointed. Check-in was super fast and super easy. Room had plenty of closet space and came with a beautiful fully functional kitchen. (were those granite countertops I saw??) Although our room overlooked the highway and we found ourselves next door to a room with a small yapping dog, once our door was closed we heard absolutely nothing. (I am an extremely light sleeper, so the fact that the room was literally soundproof to the outside, makes this a \"must-return\" venue for me.) And finally, the buffet breakfast that was included in the room rate was absolutely fantastic. For those of us not watching our weight, we had a choice of pancakes, waffles, eggs and sausages. For the rest of us, there was fresh fruit, yoghurt and plenty of cereal choices. And everything was delicious.

We were lucky to have arrived on a Thursday. We walked over to the Courtyard for a glass of wine, then back to the little dinner spread. We were delighted to get something to eat without leaving the hotel......and free! We used public transpertation to get into the city. About a 5-6 block walk to bus which takes you to the train. We bought a 3 day pass for all public transportation. Also at that bus stop was a terrific mall. From the outside it looked pretty bad. But they are working on re-doing the entire outside. Inside was everything you could need, including a huge food store, a dollar store, a food court, banks, etc. Also in that same area, there are plenty of eating establishments. We had a rental car to drive to these spots, but you can hike it. I would especially like to mention John at the desk. he was so very helpful in our stay. He even helped me find my husband when I lost him!! I am unable to address housekeeping because we do not use housekeeping when we travel. We make up our own room. The hotel did not disappoint.

Check in was fine and the room was fine. We had a family of 4 staying and found the suite to be a little crowded but still nice. The breakfast in the morning was the typical free breakfast with a few hot items. On our way back home we were to stay there one more night but opted for the Fairfield Suites instead. We thought it was an upgrade from the Residence Inn plus it was closer to the airport. The staff at the Fairfield was extremely helpful. The downside to the Fairfield was you paid for parking if you had a car, you occasionally heard a plane since you were so close, it was not easy to find the turn in as others have stated and you can not walk to any restaurant or shopping. But, given those issues, my family still preferred the Fairfield and I preferred the lower price and the great help and advice at the Fairfield.

I found the room very comfortable and clean. Breakfast was good. Loved the croissants in the morning. I always took an extra one and a piece of fruit with me. It is short drive to Trudeau. If you have a rental car, I suggest filling up near this hotel. There are two pumps close by. The hotel is near Cote-Vertu (shopping mall) I found it closes too early to enjoy after work. There are some nice restaurants within walking distance on a nice day. The Residence Inn is a great value. I think it's like an Embassy Suites without the booze!

We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Montreal with a car especially for families and individuals who need extended stay facilities for their spacious rooms fully equipped with a kitchenette & dinette. The kitchenette had a stove top range, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker, china and cutlery. I'm sure I would miss listing some other appliances, but in general I believe that this had more appliances than a standard Residence Inn (I have only been to 3 in total). . We were in a studio with a king sized bed and a queen or twin sized sofa bed. It was comfortable for our family of 3 adults and one child. It was our first visit to Montreal and wanted a room in downtown. However, after comparing prices, not to mention, additional costs for hotel parking (average of $ 18/day) downtown and a lot of bad reviews on mid-level hotels, we decided staying in this airport hotel. It was a pleasant surprise to find out that it was just 10 minutes (off-peak) to 40 minutes (peak) to downtown. Walking distance was a shopping complex with cinemas and restos. A complimentary hot and cold breakfast buffet was so filling that we had lunch at 3pm later in the day. This is versus the 1 croissant and a cup of OJ I have read on other downtown hotel reviews. I also read that most downtown hotels are old and had small rooms even for the mid-level brands. 'The staff was very friendly and helpful, nothing else we could have asked for. Other in-house facilities were an exercise room, heated pool and a kid's room. I am sure that there are other services and features that I would not be able to mention, but you definitely have to consider this hotel the next time you plan to go to Montreal. And I hope that the hotel's staff and management will continue to delivery excellent service or better!
