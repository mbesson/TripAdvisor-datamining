The design is cool but not cold with quirky touches. We stayed in an Open Space room on the 4th floor which was worth the extra euros. Its clever design and use of space make the room feel big. The comfy bed, fantastic shower, soft towels and linen all added to a happy stay. If you go, don't forget to pop up to the 5th floor terrace for an aperitif - its a gorgeous little quirky space which is heated when its cold with blankets provided for extra warmth and cosiness. We only had breakfast at the hotel once. It was good but slightly overpriced and served by a lady who I think must have had a bad day in the office....The hotel is located in a residential area with plenty of alternative breakfast options around including Bar du central which is perfect for a lazy Sunday brunch.....Brasserie Thoumieux is just around the corner and not to be missed.

There is just a curtain to seperate the bathroom and bedroom so don't go there with anyone that you don't feel quite comfortable with as you might see more than you bargained for....! Breakfast was not fantastic and served by a woman who seemed to be scowling the whole time, but if you are in a rush in the morning it is adequate, although overpriced at 10euros for a croissant, some bread and a juice. The location is great, it was just a stroll from the Eiffel Tower and lots of other attractions, although we got a tourist bus from infront of the tower to see the rest of Paris. There are lots of shops and bars and bistros in the area with plenty of choice for eating out and shopping. It is a more residential area than a bustling tourist area, which was nice.

Instead, I had to stand in inches of dirty water which flooded the whole bathroom. On our way out we alerted the receptionist and were told he would send someone up to deal with the issue. When we got back to the hotel the receptionist informed us that the shower was \"clean\" but that the water was going down slowly. We asked whether we could move to another room but were told that the hotel was full and that there was nothing he could do about our problem. He offered no solution and no apology. After asking for a manager we were told that there was no one available until the morning. We tried the shower again and ended up with a flooded bathroom and were forced to put towels all over the bathroom floor so that we could use the toilet overnight. The bathroom was so badly flooded that we had to stand in water while using the toilet. The following morning we complained to the concierge and requested a full refund and were repeatedly told that a refund was impossible as the room was given to us at a discounted rate. We were then informed that the receptionist who had dealt with us the night before was a temp who had no knowledge about hotel policy. When we asked the concierge for the manager she informed us that there was no manager available until the following Monday. After it was clear that we would not let the issue rest, a man behind the reception suddenly intervened in the conversation and assumed a position of authority. We then asked whether he was the manager and were told that he was the \"deputy manager\" and that the concierge was referring to the official title when she said there was no manager available. (Clearly the hotel policy is to deny the existence of a manager unless absolutely necessary.) We argued with the \"deputy manager\" for over 30 minutes. He placed a constant emphasis on the discounted rate of the room as though this was an excuse for them to avoid compensating us for our inconvenience. Finally, we were offered a 20 euro breakfast and drinks at the bar. After informing the \"deputy manager\" that this was not acceptable we were offered a 10% refund. We were rushing to catch a train so didn't have time to argue about the issue any further. In the end we received 16.50 EUROS for having to stand in dirty water while showering!!!!", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Salil S", "ReviewID": "UR125202654", "Content": "Had a wonderful time here.

This was my third trip to Paris and, by far, this was my favorite hotel -- which stemmed from a combination of its location, the size and boutique hotel vibe, the laid back atmosphere, the price, and the well appointed rooms. There is also a great roof deck on the top floor, which is a perfect spot for coffee or a glass of wine and was a huge amenity for us. We really enjoyed that space and it was a great retreat at the end of a long day, as well as a relaxed location to start the day with a cup of coffee while we planned our adventures. As others have mentioned, the hotel is very modern in decor. The rooms are small, but very efficient with their use of space -- one of the most efficient I've ever experienced, in fact! There are mirrors everywhere, so the room feels open and light even though it is small. The bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was lovely and the shower was great. In addition to being super stylish, it was also incredibly clean. As much as we loved the room, I have one word of caution -- there is not much separation from the bedroom to the bathroom. There is a semi-transparent curtain that separates the bedroom from the sink and shower area. My friend and I took shifts to the roof deck with our coffee in the mornings so the other person could have some privacy while getting ready. I'm not quite sure how we would have made it work otherwise. It wouldn't be a problem for couples, unless you are on different schedules and have an early riser (or are super shy). The location is excellent. It is on a quiet street, but less than a block from a string of great restaurants and shops. It's very close to the Invalides, the Seine, and the Eiffel Tower; we walked from here all over Paris and found it very convenient. I've stayed in other parts of Paris in the past and this was my favorite location. You aren't stuck in the middle of the most touristy parts of Paris with high-priced, mediocre food, nor are you in a purely residential or business area where everything is closed by 6pm. It was the perfect mix and it was lovely to be able to walk down the street for breakfast or dinner and have so many options nearby. There are also some great boutiques. Our favorite meals in the neighborhood were Les Cocottes de Constant (more affordable and casual) and the fancier (and more expensive) Le Violon d'Ingres. Both were amazing and both are owned by the former-chef of the Crillon and Ritz, Christian Constant. If you are foodie, you must check them out: http://www.maisonconstant.com/eng_home.htm. And by all means stay away from the touristy restaurants on the Trocadero and Rue Rivoli. You'll spend a fortune and walk away wondering what all the fuss is about Parisian cuisine...

For the 19 Euro price you only get a juice, a yogurt, a few pastries and coffee with milk. Nothing else.

Latter is closest only 5 min walk to hotel. Hotel is sitated in region 7 near Invalides and 5 min walk to Eiffel Tower. If you are looking for the nightlife buzz then I would suggest a hotel closer to Latin Quarter. There are numerous restaurants and bars in immediate area of hotel but it is located in a quiet street. On arrival we were met by fluent english speaking reception staff who were very helpful and friendly. We were allocated a room on the 1st floor. Room was quiet, very modern and pleasant inside. They were spotlessly cleaned every day by efficient maid service. Loved the shower and the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on. There is a complimentary safe and a mini bar (you can fit full size bottles of wine in it). Hotel bar prices are extortionate 14 Euros a cocktail and 10 - 12 Euro for a spirit. We needless to say bought a carry out for the room and drank elsewhere which was a pity as the bar and rooftop terrace are lovely. Plenty of supermarkets / off sales and eateries in the area all reasonably priced. For best eating options and deals go to Latin Quarter where you can routinely get a 3 course meal for about 15 Euro per head (again alcohol quite expensive 7-60 a pint and about 5-6 Euiro for a small house white wine (nothing special). Hotel is about a 40 minute walk along Seine from Latin Quarter or you can get Metro or a bus.

Or if you would prefer to save that experience for a later, head east and in a few moments you're at the footsteps of Les Invalides, and just a few minutes away from the beautiful Pont Alexandre III, after which crossing turn left to start your journey among so many Parisiens and tourists alike along the Champs-Elysses, or right towards what is probably the world's most famous museum. This basically is to say that the location of the hotel is fantastic and you don't need to take the metro or taxi to start a new day discovering Paris. When you are browsing through pictures of the property on websites, believe me, these photos are genuine. The lobby, bar, and restaurant are beautifully decorated with ultra modern decor which is just about as picture-perfect as you can get. If you have a chance to visit the rooftop terrace, enjoy a drink to end your day. The rooms are lovely, spotless, and space-efficient. Do not expect the most square footage as one must remember this is Paris, and Europe for that matter where space isn't always at the forefront of hotel engineering. Nonetheless, the 7 Eiffel appreciated the fact that a good nights sleep is often near the top of travellers lists, and the beds/pillows are probably one of the hotel's strongest assets. The staff of the 7 Eiffel is remarkable and always greeted us with a smile and did their best to accomodate us upon any request we had. They also speak english very well, not to worry. In summary, would I suggest this hotel for visitoirs to Paris? Definitely. With all of the positives, and virtually no negatives, it's hard to find a reason not to stay here when you visit the City of Lights.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon Bliss\u201d", "Author": "ettlemae", "ReviewID": "UR115265072", "Content": "We had an amazing time in Paris at the Hotel & Eiffel.

I picked the hotel as it was recommended on a Guardian travel feature and after looking on the website I knew it was the one for me. I booked one of the Open Space rooms (which are the largest in the hotel) as they have an additional living area and a balcony. Upon arriving at the hotel I was immediately sure I'd made the right choice as it looked every bit as good as it did on the website (and not that many hotels can say that). The room was perfect in every way and excellent use was made of all the space available. The balcony faced on to the flats opposite, but it was great to be in the thick of Paris life. The room was spotlessly clean and the maid did a great day of making it up for our arrival (and for the days following). The bed was so comfortable and my finacee wanted to take the pillows home. All of the communal areas were wonderful too - I just wish I'd made better use of the roof garden (could have spent hours up there). The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from the Metro and only 10 minutes from the Eiffel Tower. It's in a great area with loads of shops, cafes and restaurants in the streets near by. If we hadn't been so keen to see all of Paris we could have happily spent our time in the hotel and the surrounding area. All of the staff were really friendly and being a non-French speaker wasn't a problem for them. All in all, a perfect stay.

Their website has some good early booking (booked in early December) options which allowed us to get the most basic 'City' room for around \u00c2\u00a3110/night. Its worth doing this if possible as the normal rates for such rooms can be as much as \u00c2\u00a3180. This reduced price allows the hotel to compete with several in the area and allows the traveller to get a far higher standard room for their money. The room itself was spotless and perfect for two on a romantic weekend. Although small its easily enough for a short stay (its worth noting that the bigger, more expensive rooms are not really much bigger) and are filled with little luxuries to aid your stay. My one criticism of the room would be the lack of a proper toilet door which leaves a large gap onto the eye-line of the bed in the most inconvenient place. So best only stay with people you like. The decor is 'vivid' in the lobby and probably not to everyone's taste but its toned down enough in the rooms not to be a problem. There is the usual TV, kettle, free safe, toiletries, Air-con (although ours did not work), phone, wi-fi (not the fastest but enough for light surfing) and even his and hers bath robes.

Be warned, the room is very small, we stayed in a Double, but we are very used to a boutique style hotel, so we knew what to expect. We actually were stuck in Paris, for a few extra days because of the snow storm and came back to the hotel. We were able to book a Christmas special that included Breakfast. The Breakfast if its included with the room is highly recommended. It was a basket of breads, fresh coffee, a beautiful fruit salad, jar of yogurt, butter, preserves, etc. Great way to start the day! My only complaint would be about the Room Service. The Room Service was said to run until 1:30 am. I went down to the desk around 11:30-12 midnight and he told me that most of the items could not be ordered.

Book for the Eiffel tower and the Louvre in advance as we did to avoid the massive queues. Finally, shop around when eating, the prices vary widely and a little walking can save you lots. Make use of the supermarkets as well.

The hotel is located in central Paris and is 900 meters away from the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is newly renovated and has a modern spark to it...which I just loved! My husband and I had suite 108 and was just perfect for the two of us. Before we had left we were considering upgrating to a bigger room as it was our honeymoon but I am so glad we didn't. These smaller rooms in my opinion are more for couples are there is not door to the bathroom, it is all open concept with a curtain you can use to make it more private. We presonally didn't mind because we are married so I thought it was cute. If I really had to say something bad I would say that it is not the best place to stay for individuals that are on business. The reason why I say that is because the internet access was not all that great. Sometimes we had access, sometimes we did not. Although there is a computer in the lobby that can be used. But remember, keyboards in France are a bit different than in most parts of the world so it takes a bit of getting used to. Also, the irons in the hotel are not that great. We tried ironing some clothes and it was just pointless. But those are all such minor things compared to all the benefits you get! I was even shocked that they had a professional blowdryer!! This is the first time I had been to a hotel that had one of these. I actually had brought my own becasue I was worried the one in the hotel would not be stronge enough. I would say that this is a 41/2 star hotel with 3 star pricing!! At least we got an amazing deal for $140/night. One more thing I have to mention is that our bed was very comfy!! We had a TV in our room that had English channels and I loved all the mirrors that made the room look much bigger...I could go on and on about our stay:).

It was totally hidden (so we would not have discovered it on our own), but had a live Big Band Style of music like we were straight out of the 1940's playing throughout the night. It was fantastic! Our only negative of our stay would be that we found that some of the bathroom amenities were not always replenished, but it was easy to find a housekeeper to do so.

We got the 2nd room late in the evening when we returned. Then the drama started. One of the rooms had a recurring problem (in the WC) of lights going off automatically and coming back at will. My wife called the reception and the person told her that he could not do anything. He is alone in the reception and can not leave the place unattended. My wife asked him what she could do next to get the problem fixed. He just did not know what to do and probably did nothing. We managed somehow. By 10 pm, one of the rooms became stuffy and we figured that the AC was not working. The reception again responded with \"can't do much at this time\" response. I went down to the reception and then this person (his name is Gildas) came up to our rooms. He tried to spent sometime but could not fix the issue. After about an hour, we figured that the AC in our 2nd room was also not working. We were in Paris for 1 night only and could not enjoy at all because of no sleep. We also booked Lido show for 11:30 pm on 9th June but could not go there because of all these problems. We opened the windows of both room to spend the night somehow. We asked Gildas to give us other rooms but he denied the same. He told me that there were no more rooms while I did see another guest checking in around 10:30 pm on 9th June. We got a brief sleep and woke up at 6:30 am to find that the ACs in both rooms working. I went down to the reception and got to understand that the AC started working in the morning only. I told the people at the reception of the horrid experience. There was no effort to apologize instead a lady walked up to my rooms and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153its working\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153its working\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Well all they did was to leave 24 Euros out of total 298 Euros they billed me for the 2 rooms with breakfast. The hotel had charged Euros 250 at the time of reserving and only 48 euros were to be paid more during the stay. I was so sick of the whole thing that I just left after paying 24 euros more.

It is a very modern and clean boutique hotel. Many of the rooms are newly renovated. The bed was very comfy, as were the pillows. There was a coffee machine in the room which was a welcome touch for our early morning rising. We noticed, like another reviewer, that the shower water tends to leak onto the floor. I think that is more of a miscalculation in the renovation. It looks nice, but functions less that perfect. But it is such a slight thing, that we just put towels on the floor to soak up the extra water. Location is EXCELLENT. Situated on a quiet side street we were able to get sleep and yet still get the Paris street feel. The neighborhood is safe and well lit. The Rue Cler is up a few blocks (fresh fruits, pastries and cafes to choose from), the Eiffel Tower was a 5-10 minute walk, there is a Metro stop (La Tour Mabourg) a few blocks up. On the side street are at least 4 cafes (from a petite dejuner to a full meal), a few pastry shops and two wine shops. There are also restaurants on the walk to La Tour Mabourg metro stop. If you make it to Paris take a walk to the Eiffel Tower, cross the street, walk down the stairs and get on the Batobus. It is a hop on-hop off taxi boat that stops all along the Seine. It is a pleasant and time saving method to seeing as much of Paris as you possibly can. Also,the staff at the Hotel Eiffel Park were very helpful and friendly. They spoke English very well, which just made things easier.

The staff was very helpful and the room was extremely quiet and clean (the bathroom was sparkling white). Please keep in mind that hotel rooms in Europe are very small so do not expect a huge room. We did not care about this since we only needed a comfortable, clean, quiet, air conditioned place to go to sleep at night and that's exactly what we got at this hotel. The Eiffel tower is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We would head to it almost every evening to wait for the tower to get lit. So we would grab a blanket, a bottle of wine, a baguette and some fruit and we would have a picnic right by the tower. It was WONDERFUL! If you are thinking about staying here go for it, this is a great little hotel (only 5 floors) near major sights. Other tips & info: - Do not buy breakfast a the hotel instead go to a (delicious) bakery around the corner called La Boulangerie. -The hotel is located in the 7th arrondissement. -The hotel is walking distance to Les Invalides. - Train station in less than a block away. - Take the metro from the airport to the hotel, it is easy and cheap (we paid 8.50 Euros each as opposed to 50 Euros for a taxi). - Get wine from the supermarket located near Starbucks (sorry I forgot the name). - If you are fit, I recommend you get a map and walk everywhere instead of spending money on taxis or metro. We didn't spend a dime on either because we walked everywhere. - Eat in the Latin Quaters area. - It is very hard to get a cup of American coffee (Starbucks serves it but we didn't like it) so be prepared to drink a lot of expresso. We ended up loving it. - If the weather is good grab your breakfast and head to the hotel's rooftop, its a nice way to start the day.

There are 2 hand towels and 2 bath towels provided, so if you are accustomed to using washclothes then bring some old ones from home and discard them along the way. Two of the bathrooms had tubs with the typical half-glass partition instead of a shower curtain as most of us Americans are used to. The other room (207) had a shower stall with a very low shower head. Also, the travelers photos show a blue sign in front of the hotel - they now have a beige/brown sign (I don't believe that they are affiliated with Best Western any longer). There is a storage locker on the lower level if you need that on your first or last day - you take the elevator to -1 and push the bell and the person at the desk 'opens' the door for you - there was also an ironing board in this room.

At the end of rue Amelie on rue Dominique to the left about a block is a Starbucks and to the right about a block is Columbian Cafe. Rue Cler is also a block over.

The hotel was OK, not terrible but not amazing either. It is in a good location 10 mins walk from the Eiffel Tower and close to some lovely caf\u00c3\u00a9s, restaurants, boulangeries etc. I got a good deal and paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac95 a night for a twin room only. Breakfast was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 per person so we ate at one of the close by caf\u00c3\u00a9s where breakfast was a more reasonable \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 pp. The free wi-fi was also a bonus. But the staff were not great. When we arrived we were booked into room 106 which was a double room. I had ordered a twin room as my son and I wanted separate beds so we got changed to room 104 which thankfully had twin beds. But the beds were joined together using a large bed spread - it wasn't a major issue to separate the beds but it would have been nice if that had been done before we got to the room. The lady from reception left us to do this. That first evening it was quite hot and humid in the room but there was no way of turning on the air con. There was a unit in the room but the control unit had been taken out. We were both already in bed by this stage so I dialled 9 to speak to reception but no one answered. So I put on jeans over my pyjamas and put on my shoes and went downstairs. Earlier in the evening when we came back from the Eiffel Tower I had seen the man at reception was on the phone. And when I went downstairs he was still on the phone - obviously talking to family or friends! - so this was why he hadn't answered my call. I asked him if it would be possible to turn on the air con and he said no., it was impossible. He helpfully suggested that I should open the window. So that is what I did and we had to put up with noise from the street. Admittedly it wasn't that noisy but 1 car a minute did drive past so my son was still disturbed. Plus it was a very still night and very little air came into the room to cool us down. So overall this is an OK hotel let down by unhelpful staff. But despite this we had a magical time in Paris and hope to return soon but not to this hotel!", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "estonia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, highly recommended\u201d", "Author": "august444", "ReviewID": "UR27509478", "Content": "Our family of 2 adults and 1y 9m old son were in Eiffel Par hotel for 4 nights.
