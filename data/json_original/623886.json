They gave us a room number and a parking permit. So far,so good....until 3pm. From the outside,the place did not look too good. I also did not expect to walk the two blocks and cross two streets to get to the boardwalk. I opened the door to the room....and SURPRISE!!!!!!!!!! There was a family sleeping in the room!!!!!!! It was the correct room and the lady told me that they have the room for the next three weeks. I pity them! Now, this is our blessing in disguise. The mix up with the booking landed us with no room since they only have a very small room which would not fit two adults and two kids. The positive part? I got refunded for my two day payment. I booked this hotel 8 days in advance. What security can you expect if they cannot track of what room is occupied and what is not? Can anybody just have the key in your room? I will never ever book in this hotel ever again!!!!! I cannot say for their cleanliness because I did not get to see the inside the room, but if the couch in the office is any indication of the condition of their rooms...I would say bring your own vaccum and sheets if you still dare to stay here!

Ants EVERYWHERE!! I told them about it 1/2 hr into checking in and said they'd spray. The ants were worse when we got back. I then went down the next day to explain to them nothing was done about it and they're all over place in the shower, bathroom, in my clothes, bags of food, along the walls, night stand..just everywhere we walked. He didnt seem too concerned and said I'll have someone come up in a bit to spray. We were there for hours and no one came up. The towels were rough, very bad odor of musty, odor and smelled like somoene peed all over the room. All of our clothes smelled and were damp when we took them out of the suitcase. even after coming home I could smell that odor in my hair and bags. I felt sick over that smell while we stayed. I couldn't sleep on the very uncomfprtable bed and knowing the comforter had stains on it. I was so itchy and bitten the 2nd night and we both couldn't sleep comfortably on the beds and kept seeing different bugs in the room. I woke up every hour with worry and one time with feeling like something was crawling on my face. I do now have a bite on my jaw area. I can't get pics of all the bites but here's some.

The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and we had a great time. You can walk to the boardwalk, the beach, beer stores, and to a free fishing pier. You are not guaranteed a parking spot, but there is plenty of free parking on the surrounding streets which we only had to use once. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot as Nice as you think\u201d", "Author": "ang22877", "ReviewID": "UR8352257", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 days, It was not as nice as you would think from the pictures online, first of all you dont get a parking spot with your room so if you go out and there is not parking in the lot o well you have to drive around looking for some were to park, the room was not very clean i had to buy a can of lysol to spray everything, the lamps were broken, the carpets were stained, the beds were horrible i would'nt let my daughter sleep on the comforter, i had to but my own sheets down over the ones that were there and her own blanket she used also the outside of the hotel does not look nice, its just not taken care of at all. this is not a family hotel at all its ok for a couple or spring break kids, not for kids at all.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cNot What I Expected\u201d", "Author": "FalinAngel", "ReviewID": "UR8239202", "Content": "I won't say the stay was terrible, but it did leave something to be desired. Upon check-in (which they allowed us to do early) they said that they first need to inspect the cleaning. When we arrived to the room, I needed to do some light cleaning. The ceiling fans blades had a coating of dust bunnies , the filter in the Air conditioner needed rinsed, and the sink, and tub needed wiped down. We had no channels in the back bedroom, we called the front desk (w/ our cell phone as there are no phones in the rooms) they assured us someone would be right down. We left our room at noon and returned at approx. 4pm...still no cable. We called back and were told that there was no request, but they could get it fixed by 6. The following day we went to the beach after my childrens bathes we realized it would be a loooong time. A half full tub took 1 1/2 hours to drain. By the time I finished my shower the tub was a quarter full again. If staying here schedules bathes and showers VERY far apart. The air conditioning was more like a fan. We stayed in a kin suite which is a bedroom, livingroom, bathroom; the air conditioner is very tiny and located in the livingroomso it did very little for our children in the bedroom. The coffee pot comes with a metal pot and makes the coffee taste like a tin can....I suggest bringing your own from home. And don't plan on plugging in your microwave, coffee pot and refridgerator all at the same time, because they designed the rooms with the purpose of making this impossible. We noticed that all the billboards on the Parrot Lagoon Properties boasted stay 2 nights get 1 free. When we questioned the front desk about it, we were told it was a weekday special (we stayed Tues-Wed-Thurs nights) and it was for walk ins only. After we got back home I checked their website and sure enough it also states stay 2 nights get 1 free. I called and asked why I was charged a full 3 nights and no real reason was given other than you must have not mentioned it and now there's nothing we can do. All in all it was okay for the price, but in future visits I will spend the extra $10 a night to stay elsewhere.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampstead, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cReally great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Nascarhoney", "ReviewID": "UR8218572", "Content": "We were not sure what to expect after reading the reviews, but we gave it a shot anyway.

I was expecting a horrible experience. However, I stayed in the 'king suite' and found it to be not bad. It had been freshly painted. I took my own sheets and a cover for the couch to make myself more comfortable but I would not have needed sheets. They looked clean and fresh. The carpet was a little dirty and I'm glad I covered the couch but I probably did not need to. The location was perfectly in the middle of the boardwalk, although two blocks away.
