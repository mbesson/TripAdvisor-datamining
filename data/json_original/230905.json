Just hop on a 197 bus right outside Schipol airport, and it will take you to museum square right across from the hotel. It is in a quiet area, and there are many things to see around it e.g. concergebouw, Van Gogh and Rijk museums. To get into the centre, either hop on a tram in front of concertgebouw or you can walk (It's perhaps just over a mile, but all flat and lovely sights to take in!). Our room was on the ground floor and very spacious. The lady at reception warned us that it may be noisy around breakfast time, as the room was just outside reception and offered to show us another room. However, we didn't notice any noise at all over the three nights that we stayed. The bed was very comfortable too and we slept well! There is a good big shower, and bathroom is nice and modern. The floor was a little dusty in places, but it was clean otherwise. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. They offered good advice about tourist attractions and transport. They kindly kept our bags after we checked out as our flight was in the evening, so we were free to check out more of the city. We didn't get breakfast, but the cafe at the concertgebouw offers good breakfast for about 9 Euro 80 cents, which is slightly less expensive! There is a bakery around the corner (opposite the restaurant, 'Boeuf') which is cheaper again, if you want croissants, coffee etc and you can sit in. I would recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay again.

Getting to the hotel from Schipol was easy, take the 197 Red Bus @4.00 euros per person, get off at Concert Hall (ask the driver to tell you when you're there, they never hesitate to do so). Hotel's location is perfect, situated in a quiet neighborhood but aside from the bus stop, the tram also stops right in front of the hotel. Should you prefer to walk, museums like Van Gogh, stores like LV or nightlife like Leidse are only walking distance. It's also worth mentioning that Albert Heijn supermarket is just nearby and closes at around 10 in the evening. The hotel makes it easier for first time tourists to get around by selling the iAmsterdam card that gives you unlimited access to select museums, complimentary river cruise and GVB tram/bus rides depending on the number of hours you purchase, cost ranges between 30-70 euros. What makes this hotel great and different from the rest is its staff's hospitality, we constantly asked for tips on where to go and they never failed to tell us with utter enthusiasm.

It was a very nice gesture of the hotel staff to let us check-in approx. 3 or 4 hours early, since there was a room available. We had an early morning flight and the hotel was on the way from the airport to the town (very convenient 197 bus, 4 euro), so we stopped by to leave the luggage and refresh ourselves. We asked for an early check-in, in case there was such a possibility and they happened to have a free room (actually 2 rooms, so we had a choice). We didn't have breakfast in the morning, just a coffee (it costs 1 or 2 euro). After the check out we left the luggage at the hotel for the rest of the day and took it back on our way to the airport around 6pm - no problem there. When it comes to location: it's very close to public transport but quite far from city centre. We walked the distance once, but it's better to take a tram, since there is a lot of walking later on anyway. It would definitely be easier to have a hotel closer to city centre.

Location De Lairessestraat is a quiet area but within walking distance of some excellent restaurants and bars. If you want to be in the heart of Amsterdam, this may not be for you but the city is so small that it is only a twenty minute walk to the main areas. It is right beside Museumplein and the Van Gogh Museum and the Concertgebau. To get into town take the 5 tram. Buy a ticket (7euro for 24 hours) at the hotel reception. Thanks to another tripadvisor we discovered the bus 197 from Schiphol to De Lairessestraat (the stop is Museumplein). And it cost just four euro! That compares to 15 euro for one of the airport shuttle buses. Style/Character This is a very clean, modern and simple three star hotel. It has an eco 'face lift' that marks it out from others. There are nice touches such as a wall made entirely of plants in the reception area. Service The staff was the friendliest and most helpful I have come across in a long time. We encountered four members and each were excellent. We forgot to bring a european adaptor and the hotel staff obliged by lending one for free. We didn't have to pay a deposit. Rooms Spotlessly clean. Very comfortable beds. Our room was advertised as a double but it was a twin when we arrived. Nice touch with the decor- instead of bedside tables there were two tree trunks and the light covers were bamboo. The shower was powerful. Two minor quibbles: the lights were much, much too dim and a light sleeper would be distracted by the noises from other rooms such as doors banging. Food/drink There is no restaurant here but a short walk away there are a few. I recommend the Bark- a seafood eaterie with the butterfish a good choice. Also there is a wee 'brown' pub behind the concertgebau called something like Wengel (?), which was lovely and cosy. A note on breakfast.

I had one of the best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel here. Breakfast was not the biggest selection I have ever seen but it was unlimited and very very nice - plenty to satisfy most people.

Hotel open 24 hours so no worries about being late (or early!), it had a quiet family feel to it which suited us but might not suit stags or hens!! Location of this hotel is really good - Seconds from both the Van Gogh and the Riyksmuseum. A 5 minute walk from there and you are in Leidseplein with all the shops and restuarants anyone could want and boats for canal trips. From there it is a lovely 10 minute walk to Dam Square with all its attractions and Anne Frank House. From Dam square a further 10 minutes walk to Grand Central Station and the Red light District. There are also many markets within 10/20 minutes walk too - perfect. From the airport take a red bus, no 197 and this will take you directly into the city and it stops 50m from the hotel door (4 euros each way - much cheaper and easier than train and tram). When we read the reviews on here before we went we couldn't believe that the hotel was as good as everyone said it was for the price but believe it because it really is.

When checking in, it turned out we had accidentally booked for a wrong weekend but thankfully there was one room left. The check-in person was very pleasant and helpful. The room was ready in 3 hours so we went for a walk around the Museumplein and when we got back, we were informed the price for the night was 146 euros which was much more than the original booking. I understand that can happen if there's only one room left but I would've appreciated to be given this information straight away so we could've looked elsewhere too. The room was a good size, clean and towards the garden which I would recommend as there's a busy street with a tramline on the other side. The decorated wall is very pretty but the remaining 3 look a bit ignored as someone pointed out earlier. Bathroom is a good size. There is no air conditioning which will be a problem summer time as the sun was shining in the whole day. We kept the \"balcony door\" (there was no balcony though, just the door next to some railing) open but in October it was too chilly to keep open all night. Sound isolation between the rooms isn't great and you can hear people walking in the corridors and the doors closing so I'd recommend bringing ear plugs. Our phone wasn't working the whole time either. Breakfast was 10 euros and OK - nice plum juice and different kinds of pastries and coffees, scrambled eggs were cold and there was only 1 kind of ham and cheese though. The Breakfast room is very pretty and even had some Marimekko pillows which is always a bonus :) My husband had forgotten some items (a CD and a post card) in the room which were handed to us when we came to pick up the luggage, which was great.

We stayed in Museumplein last time so we were looking for an affordable hotel in the same area. Hotel Conscious was the cheapest one in the area at about $170 a night. It is in a great location right by the Museumplein tram stop. Though we walked everywhere and only used the tram for getting here from the airport. Btw if you come from the airport go to Zuid station and then take the #5 tram. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much quicker then going to Central Station and less hectic. We arrived early on a very rainy day and thankfully our room was ready as we were soaked. The main reception lady we encountered was very friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel is very modern and clean. Last time we stayed at an older hotel in a traditional Dutch house. I kinda missed that aspect of it here. The room was very spacious with comfortable bed. In terms of d\u00c3\u00a9cor I found it funny that one side of the room with the bed was decorated very nicely with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wallpaper and nice tree end tables. Though the other side of the room with the TV was completely white. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost like they forgot to decorate the other side. Even though the hotel is on a main street it is very quiet and the room had big windows which was very nice. The breakfast was an additional 13.50 euro which we thought was really expensive so we bypassed that. We had breakfast at a really nice bakery around the corner south on Van Baerlestraat at a fraction of the cost. We rented bikes from the hotel which was really convenient. I believe it was about 7 euro for 3 hours and 13 euro for 24 hours. For dinner in the area I would recommend Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Pompa for tapas and Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Loetje for great steak and fries.

The size of the double room and bathroom was very spacious for Amsterdam. I appreciate their commitment to the environment, I really do. However, the bed was weird and the pillows were lumpy, and the towels were thin and rough. There is such a thing as eco-luxe but maybe this is too much for the price range of this hotel? I could tell that originally the mattress must have been awesome -- all soft and fluffy. But after god knows how many guests, the middle of the mattress was worn down and it was kind of like sleeping in a hammock or canoe. And those lumpy pillows -- what is up with those?? Not comfy at all. And the spare ones in the closet were only marginally better. They were soft, but too soft and don't support your head or neck properly.

We had some difficulty finding the hotel (it is on the same road as the main entrance to the concerthall, on the right looking out from the hall) and when we got there we were knackered and freezing! The first room we were sent to hadn't been cleaned and the bedding hadn't been changed. We were given another room which was fine. The rooms were small but quite nice, travellodge style, decent bathroom with a good shower. There is a TV with a few English speaking channels and a clock radio. There were however a couple of problems with the room. Firstly, the beds are two singles pushed together with a gap where they meet. We were away for a romantic weekend, this was most unromantic! I had expected the beds to be amazing from some of the other reviews, i wasn't a fan. I think they are memory foam which you either love or hate. Secondly, even though the canals were frozen due to sub-zero temparatures, the room was so hot we had the window opened for our entire stay. This was ok, but not great for the eco credentials! The receptionist was great, he gave us really useful map and talked us through where everything was, gave us some recommendations for restaurants etc. The night receptionist also ordered us a pizza when we came in wasted on a couple of the nights! We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the breakfast, but there is a great wee deli about 200 yards down the road (turn left as you go out) which had great value and excellent quality mid morning snacks and lunches (we never got up til well after breakfast!)

We didn't eat breakfast in but found the short walk of approx 200m to the amazing concert hall worth it where you can have amazing coffee and a croissant for approx 4 euros a head. The hotel is situated in the museum quarter which is just 5 minutes away from the centre of the chaos but still very central nonetheless. There are some fantastic restaurants approx 3 minutes walk away all suggested by our host. We ate at Boeuf and Kjnip and weren't disappointed!!! There was a lot of game on the menu (venison, hare, wildboar) and they were delicious. The museum district is a lovely area to be in, pretty classy but we wanted to explore the city. Trams pass approx 50m from the front of the hotel and they will take you wherever you need to go. We were a 3 minute tram journey from the Diamond Museum, Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum....should really have walked! Amsterdam Central station is on the north side of town whereas the hotel is a little south so be prepared to take a tram ( No. 16 or 24) to the \"Museum plein\" which takes approx 10mins. The hotel is a 1 minute walk from the tram stop. On our way home we took a bus to Schipol Airport (No. 197 or 370). They leave outside the hotel every 15 mins and will take you direct to the airport which we found more easy than lugging suitcases across town and through central station.

The Concertgebouw is almost directly across the street and is one of the world's greatest venues for classical music. A good-sized grocery store is located underground at one corner of the Museumpleine and was very convenient to get drinks and snacks for our daily sightseeing. Vondelpark is also very close. It's a bit like Central Park is to Manhattan - greenery, ponds, picnic areas, concert stages - surrounded by some well-heeled quiet residential neighborhoods. There's a stand for rental bikes right outside the hotel, and the tram stops at either end of the block. Of course, several tram lines converge around Museumpleine so the hotel is very close to all of them. Our room was on an upper floor and was furnished with simple, modern furniture and conveniently designed light fixtures. It was very comfortable and spacious with a large operable window overlooking the street. Although a tram runs directly in front of the hotel, the room was very quiet.

The hotel is situated on the edge of Museum Square within easy walking distance of the street market on Albert Cuyp Street (well worth a visit), the Heinieken Experience (definitely worth a visit!), the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. Being a couple of miles away from Centraal Station and the harbour it is convenient that there are 2 tram options with a tram stop not far away from the hotel. Check-in was effieicent. We had booked through Airmiles and despite Airmiles never having sent the voucher for the hotel (we did chase them for it and it was never received; same thing happened with a trip last year too), the hotel honoured our booking. At check in you will receive lots of good information about travelling around the area, points of interest and excursions. You can book excursions at the hotel desk and the tour bus will collect you from the hotel in the morning on the day of your trip. We stayed in room 20 which is on the ground floor next to reception. We had read other reviews that there is a lot of road noise at the front of the hotel - we weren't at all disturbed by road noise but the wall between our room and reception is paper-thin so you will hear every phonecall, every conversation, every guest and the kitchen door squeaking on its hinges. Between about midnight and about 6am the hotel is quiet however. The room decor is lovely with a tree mural on the wall behind the bed, bedside tables made from tree trunks and lights that looked like donner meat on the spit!! There was no air conditioning in our room but despite the warm temperatures outside we didn't find it too warm or stuffy in the room. The en-suite is lovely although the desing of the shower with the door opening out into the bathroom meant the floor floods and gathers in a puddle under the sink. The shower gel was empty when we arrived but everything else in the room was well presented. The hotel is an eco hotel. The lobby is flooded with natural light and one wall boasts an array of plants, just beautiful. There is a garden area behind the breakfast room for guests to enjoy the sunshine and it is lovely. Breakfast is a typical Dutch buffet with breads and pastries, cheeses and cold meats, eggs and bacon, cereal and fresh fruit. There are snacks and drinks available to purchase from the reception. WIFI is free of charge and security protected - request details from reception. Check out was efficient and we were able to leave our bags with reception while we went on a final day of sightseeing in and around Amsterdam. There is a discounted taxi rate if you book at reception, for getting to the airport. The fare advertised is 32 or 33 euros (I can't remember exaclty) but we were charged 35 euros by the driver. A bit cheeky but still better value than booking another private hire which would be closer to 45 euros. The people who have Conscious Hotel are opening another one in Vondel Park, not far from Museum Square, in October and I am looking forward to trying that one out during my next visit to Amsterdam. I love Amsterdam, the people, the buzz and the country and to find such a charming hotel run by people who genuinely love what they do, is the icing on the cake for me. I really hope my work or leisure trips take me to this part of Netherlands again soon; next time I won't have to spend anytime choosing my accommodation as it will undoubtedly be Conscious Hotel Museum Square or Vondel Park.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel, with great staff\u201d", "Author": "hersh_k", "ReviewID": "UR71281824", "Content": "Our family arrived in Amsterdam on July 13th -- the night when 800,000 fans celebrated the World Cup Dutch team's 2nd place victory.

I can't remember the numbers of the buses but if you call the hotel or email them then they will be more than happy to help. The location of the hotel is great, 2 minute walk to the tram stop and then 15 mins on the tram to the city centre, we didn't walk it as it was very cold when we went but I imagine it wouldn't take too long. Get the tram to Leidsplein from the hotel or walk it and find a restaurant called Rancho - down the little road by the Pancake place, best ribs ever! Unlimited pork ribs (tender meat, delish BBQ sauce), yummy crisp chips and a salad for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13! The hotel breakfast was yum - I believe everything is organic and fairtrade but don't quote me on that! They had scrambled egg, bacon, boiled eggs, different breads and rolls, cheeses, cold meats such as ham, salami etc, the nicest croissants ever with lots of different condiments for them, fresh fruit and different cereals as well as tons of juice - pineapple, apple, orange, and a couple of others as well as tea and coffee. The gentleman bringing out the food/clearing the plates was so friendly and helpful. The hotel reception is small but nice, the reception staff are amazing and as soon as we arrived the lady gave us a very helpful map with all of the attractions clearly marked and she described the tram stops to us and where to get tickets etc. If you wanted a can of pop/choc bar then they sell these at reception (not cheaply but as to be expected), one night I was in reception using my laptop (free wi-fi!) and the night receptionist kindly offered me a tea/coffee or juice, free of charge. When we left we had a late flight but as with all hotels had to be checked out by a certain time (midday I believe), and they were happy to hold our suitcases behind reception whilst we wandered the city for a few more hours. The rooms were comfortable, and our beds were AMAZING!

From the minute we entered the hotel we were greeted with a lovely smile and welcome from the receptionist we just knew we had made the right choice. Our room (203) was just perfect for our needs. It was clean, spacious with a large flatscreen TV on the wall (not that we used it). There wasn't a hairdryer in the room but reception will provide one with no charge. The bathroom was also large with a great walk-in shower and the bed the comfiest we have ever slept in. Breakfast made for a great start to the day (were also greeted with a friendly good morning from the breakfast cook) cold meats cheese, a selection of organic rolls and bread. Croissants, jams etc. cereals, hard boiled eggs and bacon and scrambled eggs. The breakfast was also topped up as soon as it was required. One small tip is that the coffee isn't very strong so drink a little and then add an expresso. The location is perfect right next to the concert hall and only 5 minutes from the main museums. There is also a tram stop 100m from the hotel if you want to use the tram rather than walk. There is also a supermarket a two minute walk away if you need any bits and pieces. Leidsplein is about a 10 minute walk and from there you can head in to the centre of Amsterdam. Alternatively catch a tram to Central Station or Dam Square and start your exploring from there. There are a few restaurants/bars nearby with Cafe Welling being a traditional Brown Cafe frequented by locals if you just fancy a beer. We also had a fabulous meal with great service and sensible prices at http://www.sardegna.nl/ which is only 5 minutes from the hotel (will review separately).If after a long day of exploring, you are just looking for a cheap and cheerful meal (but still tasty) head to Albert Cuyp Street where there is a market as well as a large number of ethnic restaurants including pizzeria's where you will get good Pizza and Pasta dishes for 5 euro's.

The room i had (408) was ideally located on the top floor at the back in the corner. The room was clean, tidy, well appointed and basically everything i had hoped for! The bathroom was pretty big, with a large shower cubicle and plenty of space. The room was equipped with a large flat-screen LCD tv, with a fair few cable/digital channels - including BBC1 and BBC2, a desk/work area with chair, another easy-chair and a large wardbrobe with a built in safe. The beds by the way are incredibly comfortable!!!! Breakfast in the morning was more than i was expecting, based on some previous reviews. A good selection of fruit juices, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, scrambled eggs, bacon and breads were on offer and all were very nice. They also have one of the best coffee machines ever! The breakfast room is light and airy, mainly located in a conservatory at the back of the hotel. The conservatory opens up onto a small garden, with facilities for smokers. The rest of the hotel is very clean, light & airy with a very modern feel. The main feature of this hotel is by far its customer service. The hotel seems to have at least 4-5 main members of staff who work on reception at various times, but all were very polite, cheerful, very helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay a pleasent one. Even going so far as to check-in our flights for us and printing our boarding cards before we left. Couldn't have asked for more! We travelled to the hotel via the Connexions hotel shuttle bus service from Schipol. For 23.50 return it took us right to the hotel, no fussing around with trams or trains! However, when you book your return time to the airport 24 hours before your due to leave, make sure the hotel gets a confirmation number from the bus company! We nearly didn't get back to the airport on time due to a miscommunication! A small annoyance, but luckily corrected at the last minute! The only things i would recommend to improve the hotel are: tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, slightly brighter lighting in the rooms and better sound-proofing on the doors (people coming and going late in the evening can be heard clearly) On the whole, this is a fantastic hotel! If i ever go back to Amsterdam, i will surely be booking here again! PS. If you want the best steak you'll ever eat, a short walk to Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Loetje on Johannes Vermeerstraat is the destination for you! Get there early (7pm) and put your name down for a table, as we waited an hour on our second visit, but its worth it!

The room was large and the bathroom was fab, with a massive walk-in shower. The bed was really comfortable, so much so that I'm going to invest in a feather mattress topper! The only problem with this room was the noise- from other guests coming past Reception and a delivery at 4am in the morning as I'm a very light sleeper. However, this was easily resolved and the next morning we were given a new room (101). Again, this was at the front of the hotel, but the traffic noise from the road didn't bother me. It was a good sized room, with 2 good size single beds pushed together and a nice bathroom. We had a great nights sleep. Breakfasts were good, there was a hot drinks machine (no coffee/tea in rooms, but you can pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 out of breakfast hours for a coffee etc..) and a toaster, plus the usual cereals, yoghurts, cheese, meats, croissants and hard-boiled eggs etc.. You are able to borrow a hairdryer from Reception, which is handy if you're trying to keep hand luggage to a minimum and even a travel adapter (if you manage to forget one like we did!) and the usual iron/ironing board. Dining in Amsterdam isn't cheap (we'll research set menus next time!) We tried the Pizzeria nearby (turn left out the hotel, take a right at the traffic lights and it's right in front of you). We had a pasta/ pizza main meal (the veggie lasagna portion wasn't massive, but it was nice!) , desserts and 2 beers/ small tumblers of wine for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50.

The hotel is a little out of the main hub of Amsterdam, close to the main concert hall, Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum. However, it is only about a 15-20 minute walk in to the main part of the town (cut across the grass opposite the concert hall) or you can get on a No 3 or No 5 tram - again opposite the concert hall. There is a supermarket close by the tram stop as well - Albert Heijn (it is underground) if you need to get any vital supplies. The reception staff at the hotel are incredibly helpful, they will help you with any information about ANYTHING! I particularly liked the gentleman who looked a little like Arsene Wenger who was wonderful but all the staff were excellent - couldn't be faulted in any way. The room was large, fairly basic (the room had a balcony with two sets of french doors) and the bathroom (with shower) was very good. The previous reviewer has mentioned the comfy beds - the comfort factor was the feather bed topper, on top of the mattress. My room was at the back of the hotel, so was peaceful - could see a tennis court, some flats, a room in a kindergarten school and lots of trees (did not find the school any disturbance at all). The room also had tea/coffee making facilities and a large flat screen TV - BBC1, BBC News 24 and CNN are a few English speaking channels that could be received. Breakfast is a buffet type. Tea/Coffee, fruit juices, cereals, croissants, bread, bread rolls, few cold meats, scrambled egg, bacon and unusually fruit cocktail. My only small criticism would be that there was no toast making facility - have never stayed anywhere without toast! Amsterdam is a wonderful city and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. There is also an airport bus which leaves every 15 minutes about 200 yards away from the hotel - which is cheap and takes about 20 minutes to get to Schipol - so ideal.

Hotel We have stayed in a quite a few hotels and I can honestly say this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. I can't afford top end hotels so have never experienced 5 star luxury but we have stayed from budget to 4 star so quite a mixed bag. Musuem square hotel is the most friendly,clean,welcoming hotel. The staff are such lovely people, all couldnt do enough to make our stay one we would never forget! We got a great welcome, with all the local info so we knew the best places to go, got a map with all the tram lines highlighted so we knew exactly which ones to get about the most efficient way. Location The hotel is based in the museum area which is a really nice area, yes it is a little bit out of the city, but, I would rather that than central station area, which our guide book warned us to stay further out, Amsterdam is not a massive area and as the public transport is so good it really does not matter! I felt safe walking about all the time whether it was early morning, or late at night, yes I was always holding onto my bag but then I always do! The trams are 16 and 5 which we used, the 16 stops right across the road from the hotel but we always got off at concert hall stop which is a 5 min walk. I Amsterdam card I do recommend this purchase, I bought ours off the official website and you take your confirmation e-mail to the tourist office opposite the station, we got a 48 hour one for about \u00c2\u00a345 this had a public transport ticket as well so all of that is included in the price which was so handy as we didnt have to worry about paying for any more tickets when we were there which helped us budget, the first day we paid for a tram ticket, 2 singles and that was 5 euros just that and it was for a hours use! so you do get your money back on these amsterdam cards. What is not included is the train fare from Schipol Airport to Central Station that is 3 euros each one way. On the card we got museums free entrance and a free canal ride, there is 2 to choose from a one hour or one and a half hour trip depending on which side of the city you get the boat, we got the blue boat company near hard rock cafe as that is the side of the city we were staying. Although we did use the trams a lot, and I mean a lot, we also walked loads, take comfy shoes, i thought mine were comfy but after 3 days solid walking they weren't such a good choice, but this is not to say that you have to walk as much as we did as that was just us, you can hop on hop off any tram/bus, your transport card you just have to swipe when you get on and get off the tram, so easy, and if you are not sure where you are then the locals are always helpful in helping you to where you need to go, I also recommend the heineken experience, that is 25% off with the card, that is really great, as is Van Gogh museum, that was free with the card to! Food When you go you must have a pancake, The Dutch can really make pancakes, all the food we had was really lovely, the hard rock cafe as always was super great food. If you are going to visit this city I can honestly say the hotel was fantastic. The beds were a dream, I have never stayed in a hotel bed quite like it, some people have commented on the lights, as it is eco friendly they use energy efficient bulbs so it is quite dim when you first put them on but the rooms are so airy and light and clean, Breakfast was buffet style, hot food was bacon and srambled/boiled eggs and the rest was cereals and rolls,cheeses,hams fruit etc so a good feed We are going back next May for more of a explore as we fell in love with this city and will be staying at the Museum square hotel for sure!

If you are travelling light or with only 1 or 2 others, take the bus 370 or 190 if I am not wrong and will take you to the hotel in less than 30minutes, faster and avoiding the hassle of changing from trains to tram. It's location is just fantastic, so close to Van Gogh Museum and from there, you can simply walk to the central of Amsterdam. Upon arriving, was warmly greeted and introduced to the hotel and it's surrounding. All staffs in the hotel were so helpful and friendly during the stay. As for the rooms, I was lucky to get the two rooms side by side located on ground floor, with doors leading to a shared garden (which was also just beside the breakfast garden). The two rooms I got had differences and was nice for me to take note. One has shower and one bathtub. The room and bathroom size was very spacious and as newly refurbished, rooms were also fresh and exciting. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Be mindful that the hotel has a 'green' concept, as such that during the day, rooms are lightly lilted and as night falls, then the room will get brighter, thus do not try to find switch to make the lights brighter during the day. Breakfast was simple, but ample and delightful. The only few recommendations I will make is to include some stuffs in room, like a bin and coffee table in the room as they had such a big space, as well as a longer curtain panel for the bathtub as water tends to splashed out messily as the curtain panel for the bathtub is very small and does not totally cover up the bathtub. One thing I would advise is to be a bit careful while using the hotel's preferred car company. This is in no way hotel's fault. As I try to book a day trip out of Amsterdam, I was quoted quite a high price to go visit windmill and the flower auction place. On the day of departure, I also booked a car to the airport which the price was aright. But I need to say the people operating the car are very money-minded and were always quick to offer a second car or to take you to some place at higher prices. Bear in mind these are not original Dutch people, but foreigners who had settled into the country for long time, like many other parts of major European cities. Thus, do some homework and sums before deciding whether to use the car company.

Only mirror is in the bathroom - with 3 girls staying together we would have appreciated an extra mirror/a full-length but it wasn't much of an issue.

True it is a fair bit from the centre, but the public transport is good. We decided to walk everywhere and there is plenty to see to keep you going. We averaged 12 - 16 miles a day and had very sore feet after 3 days!!! It is near the beautiful Vondelpark, and is next to the museum and fashion quarter which houses all the upmarket designer shops ie Chanel etc. Keep walking and you will come to The Hard Rock Cafe and go a little further and you will come to lots of restaurants etc. For normal shops like H &M, C &A and many other recognisable names head for the streets of Dam Square. Be careful though as the Red Light District is on the other side of Dam Square, (and is well worth a visit) ACCOMODATION. The room was small but very bright and clean. The bathroom was modern. There was a fridge, a safety deposit box, a television, phone, kettle and a welcome pack of tea, coffee etc. The hairdryer was not present, there was a hole in the wall where it once hung but had been removed. This did not bother me as I took my own anyway. If I had reported it I am quite sure a satisfactory outcome would have occurrred. STAFF The staff were all lovely, friendly and very helpful. BREAKFAST. Fantastic and well worth getting up for. Wide range and would satisfy even the fussiest of eaters! The kitchen staff were lovely. There was a variety of cereals, fruit cocktail, fresh fruit, cream bacon, scrambled egg, rolls, toast, bread, meat, cheese, fruit juices, tea and coffee, biscuits etc VALUE As a place to stay for bed and breakfast it is certainly good value for money. However, if you buy crisps, coke, sweets etc these items are expensive. Better to go round the corner and opposite the Concert Hall to the Supermarket (not obvious you have to go down an escalator-beside a car park) where you will find things much more cheaply. At the moment as the Pound is doing so badly against the Euro we found Amsterdam very expensive. PLACES OF INTEREST There are lots of places to go. We visited Anne Franke's House , The red light district, Dam Square,Van Gogh Musuem, The Reijksmuseum, went on a canal boat, visited Madame Tussauds and had a quick look inside a coffee shop which was a real eye opener!!! In short lots to do and lots of places to eat and drink. The Sottish bar off the main shopping street at Dam square is the cheapest in town.

I had personally read the reviews which all appeared to be favourable and I can honestly say that in no way were we disappointed with our choice. The staff/owners were exceptionally friendly, helpful and very willing to provide maps on which they highlighted tram routes and generally where places of interest were located. The rooms were a good size with a TV and a fridge which was \"for our convenience\" which I thought was a lovely touch. Most importantly, the bed and pillowswere superbly comfortable and whereas our room at the front of the building on the 4th floor was a little noisy with the windows open, because it had air conditioning we were able to close the windows and sleep peacefully without being too hot. Another member of our party was at the back of the building on the 1st floor which was lovely and peaceful but didn't have air con, however there was a large door/window that could be opened to allow air into the room. This basically meant that wherever you are in the building, you will have a good night's sleep!! We didn't order breakfast as it was continental and we wanted a bigger meal to set us up for the day so I cannot comment on how good/bad/value for money it is, however at the time of our visit, the pound was very weak against the euro which did make everything just that little bit more expensive than I had seen before however this isn't any reflexion on this hotel in anyway. The hotel is within a 5-10 minute walking distance of the beautiful Vondelpark which is wondeful to sit and relax in on a summer's day. There are 3 tram lines within walking distance of the hotel which are Nos 5, 16 and 24 and Leidesplein is only a couple of stops away on tram 5 however Dam Square is only about 10 minutes which meant for us, Museum Square Hotel was ideally situated. On our first night we arrived later in the evening so we opted to eat just around the corner from the hotel and we enjoyed a beautifully cooked steak with sauce, fries with a very pleasant and welcome service. For my birthday we went on a Dinner Cruise which we booked in advance through www.viator.com and cost \u00c2\u00a3110 for 2 people but we both considered it to be worth the money once you compare the cost of this to cheaper cruises that do not serve dinner. The cruise began at 8pm so we were able to enjoy the daylight, dusk and nightfall and the beautiful colours of the red light district and lit up bridges reflected in the water during our 2.5 hour trip. The food was gorgeous and we were given complimentary glasses of sparkling wine followed by beers, wine or soft drink which were also included in the cost. If you have the money to spare and would like a romantic evening, this is definitly the way to go, however if you would like to enjoy the sights at a more reasonable cost, there are candlelit cruises for \u00c2\u00a322 per person that last 2 hours. I have visited Amsterdam a few times over the years but mainly in the autumn/winter and as this was my first summer trip and the sun was shining, we chose to treat ourselves and take a 30 minute horse and carriage ride around the cobbled streets which we caught from Dam Square and cost 45 euros regardless of how many people are in the carriage, as there were 4 of us, this worked out relatively cheap and was one of the highlights. You can hire them for longer (an hour) or for less but we felt 30 minutes was perfect. Overall we found the Dutch to be very friendly, helpful and with a laid back un-hurried approach that was conducive to a relaxing time despite the apparent hustle and bustle of a vibrant city.

Getting there and back from the airport is really easy, the bus 370, and the much more frequent 197, stop at the bus stop almost right in front of the hotel.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201clovely, quiet, reasonably priced hotel\u201d", "Author": "CherlyLondon", "ReviewID": "UR13778229", "Content": "This is a lovely small hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff.

There is also public transportation outside of the hotel (just be aware of thieves in the bus stop. They can steal your belonging without you even notice- this is of course a tip that is not concern to this amazing hotel). The hotel room was very comfortable and clean. Shower and bathroom are in good shape. Breakfast was quite good; we suggest the hotel manager to add some vegetables to it so it will be perfect. If you are into kosher food you can order that in advance. And above all the reception service was incredible - Very helpful and kind. The hotel manager was extremely nice and helpful too.

We had a lovey view out of the window to the street below. The room was clean and spacious, with three beds, small fridge, a very good selection of tea and coffees (good choice and quantity), and all the other amenities that were advertised. There was noise from the street below, but once the windows were shut, it was gone. There was also a/c available, but we never used it. On the coffee table in the room was also a couple of tourist books and guides which we did enjoy looking through. The breakfast was typical of hotels in Amsterdam, bread rolls, croissants, sliced bread, slices of ham, cheese, salami, cereals, juices, chocolate milk, fruit, hard boiled eggs and a selection of jams and spreads. It was all served in the conservatory at the back of the building which was clean, tidy and generally lovely. We did want to go into the bar one evening, but found out it had not been open for a couple of years, which I think is a shame, as it looks very nice, but instead we decided to get a couple of drinks from reception and take them to our room as they do offer some drinks and snacks at reception. However the lovely lady on reception said we would be really overcharged and instead suggested a local supermarket, which we would never have found without help, and turned out to be a real find! The location was great, close to a lovely park between the Rijksmuseum and the Concert Hall. About a 10 minute walk to the Leidesplein, for lots of restaurants and shops and then a further 10/15 minutes walk to the red light district, dam square and the area near the train station. The Hotel staff could not do enough for us, they were always ready to give directions, suggest places to go and they always asked if we'd had a good day on our way in and wished us an 'enjoy your evening' on our way out. They even knew our room number before asking after just one day. Not sure if that was good thing or a bad thing! I really enjoyed this hotel and thought it was excellent.
