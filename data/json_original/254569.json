This hotel was a total ripoff experience for me. I booked through an agency, and there were problems with that. A long story short, I got a room at the top and the back, a tiny room with a tiny bed and a tiny shower (the wall slanted in) which would have been okay if it had been priced accordingly. What I was shocked to discover is that this tiny room with the tiny bed and the tiny shower (it is room 404, in case you want to know) was being rented out AS THE SAME PRICE AS THE REGULAR ROOMS WITH DOUBLE BEDS!!! When I pointed out the rather obvious unfairness of this arrangement, I was met with arrogance, defensiveness, and outright aggresion. I could go on and on about that: the rather tactless approach of the owner and her son, but there is no point. The point is, they are interested in getting your money, and once they have done that, they don't give a damn, because they know that you will never stay there again. See, the hotel rooms in London are so expensive and so hard to come by, that they can give really incredibly bad service and still stay in businesss.

The room I was offered when I stood my ground was on the fourth floor - the lift goes only to the third - and was equally small but at least had a window giving some natural light. The web site advertises single rooms as having double beds. What is the reason for that? With a single bed the room would have been just about OK for size, having a double bed meant edging around the bed all the time to get anywhere. For two people it would have been difficult to move about the room. The fittings were tired at best, the carpet very worn, the walls needed painting as fittings had clearly been moved recently and left dirty patches on the wall and the nail holes roughly filled, the door fittings had been changed and taped over, part of the curtain fitting had become detached from the wall etc. These seem like small things but taken all together with the others I have not listed the effect was off putting.
