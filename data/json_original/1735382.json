This is the one I would be least likely to visit again. The room was small. It was so small that my travelling companion and I had a bit of trouble maneuvering around the space. The bathroom was also on the small side, particularly the shower. Then, there were issues with cleanliness/upkeep. During our first night staying in the hotel, I discovered a Twix wrapper behind the air conditioning unit, a bunch of long hair stuck in the shower, and the hotel notepad full of doodles and proclamations that someone \"loves circles.\" Our room also lacked a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign or a price list for the minibar. It felt as though corners had been cut when preparing the room for guests. The bed was comfortable though. The walls blocked out sound rather well. Reception was a bit hot and cold. The bellhops and night crew were on the warmer side of the spectrum. The bellhops were particularly chipper and pleasant. The day crew on the reception desk, on the other hand, was kind of gruff. Even when they were not busy, they seemed short. They seemed to give the impression that my requests or queries were burdensome. That is probably my biggest issue with this hotel. I want to feel welcome, not like a burden. The location itself was ok. It is quite close to the local transportation. It is a bit of a jaunt to the Sultanahmet area, but some travelers would prefer to separated from the tourist hub. The biggest asset to this hotel for me was the breakfast. It is provided in the basement. Although it may not have the rooftop breakfast that other hotels may have, it has the most impressive spread I may have seen at any hotel I have visited. There was a plethora of options that were labeled. I am willing to experiment with new foods, but they provided options for those who wanted something a little more familiar.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade", "Title": "\u201cGreat,little hotel\u201d", "Author": "MishaBelgrade", "ReviewID": "UR124019570", "Content": "Great, little hotel !

Hotel is really nice, clean, rooms and bathrooms are little beat small, but it really doesn't matter 'cos staff is very friendly and polite. Maybe they are not very good with foreign languages, but their kindness will make it up for you. Breakfast was great, plenty of different kind of food, something for everybody and some Turkish dishes which is great for tourist curiosity! If you go to Mirilayon, order Turkish coffee at the bar (and you will try Turkish delight with coffee, of course), it's strong, but very tasteful and enjoy your vacation in Istanbul.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA very enjoyable stay.\u201d", "Author": "john6w", "ReviewID": "UR119669004", "Content": "I was transferred to the Mirilayon at another hotel's expense because of a problem with my room. How happy I was to now be at the Mirilayon! The location is great - just a short walk from Aksaray tram stop, and not too touristy. I was offered a drink and Turkish Delight upon arrival. The room was very comfortable, the shower room a little bijou. The breakfast was impressive and included Turkish, a range of cereals, breads and preserves, plus a selection of English-style hot options. Also, some other dishes were cooked to order at no extra charge. By far the best aspect of the Mirilayon is the staff. Nothing is too much bother. Special mention must go to Esra on reception who I found to be very welcoming, efficient, along with speaking very good English.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel for economy stay, nothing to say bad about!\u201d", "Author": "Tatiana_2010", "ReviewID": "UR63814792", "Content": "We had a perfect 3 days in the hotel. Rooms are quite small, but nice. The staff is just perfecrt and very very helpful, thank you very much to all of them. Upon arrival we had welcome drink and turkish delights, in the room the welcoming bottle of wine and fruit busket was waiting for us, that was a plesure. Breakfast is very ok, anouth to be full, plus to the open buffet you can order omlet, pancackes and other things, which are totally free. Destination: it is close to Aksaray train station, what is comfortable to get from the airport by metro, and city center. 2 tram station to Istambul Grand bazaar, what is also very comfortable. Hotel is NOT in the city center, what was nice for us, as I like to sleep in a quite, not very turist croudy places. But if you would like to be in a walking distance to all the sightseing places, choose other hotel situated in Sultanadmed area! There is a very cute SPA in the hotel, I had very nice experience of turkish peeling and foam massage done by lady. Very recommended experience. So, I woud advice to choose this hotel if you want to explore the wonderfull city - Istambul and ready to use public transport, which is very comfortable by the way, if you want to make a nice shopping ( there are many shops in the area of the hotel) and to be not far from the center of the city!", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cDecent all the way around\u201d", "Author": "vagabond04", "ReviewID": "UR60958666", "Content": "Mirilayon has good facilities, the breakfast is good, and the service is excellent. They really go out of their way to try to help you. Much of their staff spoke very little English, so that limited our abilities to communicate with some of the employees but others knew enough to answer questions when we needed it. The rooms were a little outdated and small, but overall clean and cozy. They say they have a restaraunt, but the menu consisted only of bar drinks and the kitchen was closed when we tried to go there for dinner. The location is relatively good as well. We were able to walk to all the major sites. It's hidden on a little street a little distance from the Grand Bazaar.
