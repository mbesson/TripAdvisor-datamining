{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A wonderful place to stay M y partner and i have just returned from 15 nights at the Sari Sanur and we cannot fault the place especially at the cost. The staff are polite and helpful. The small cottage type rooms are well equipped and clean internally and extremely private outside in your own small walled porch and garden. Breakfast is served on the porch which i think is a great concept much better than a dining room. The pool is nice and the beach is a 2 minute walk with sunbeds and umbrellas provided by the hotel(at no cost). The main street with restaurants etc is a 1 minute walk in the other direction so overall a very well situated place to stay.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR883827248", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bellbells"}, {"Content": "Very Good Budget Hotel/Resort I stayed at Sari Sanur for 5 nights upon recommendation of a friend in Bali. For the price, it was fantastic. You get a bungalow of your own and its very private with your own garden and an entry door. Location: Sanur is roughly 30 minutes away from Kuta and is quiet. If that sounds okay, then this location will suit you perfectly. You have direct access to the beach within 100 meters and there are plenty of of restaurants aroundService: Simply put, I had no complaints about the service whatsoever.Food: Breakfast is serviced in your room and it is obviously much better than eating with bunch of strangers at a buffet. You get a choice of American, Continental, or Indonesian and I was very happy with its quality. Room: Very roomy and a nice bathroom. The bed was fine and you get a TV with HBO, CNN and Starsports. Only complaiont I have is that after couple of days, I noticed there were some bugs that managed to come into the room. I imagine that may not be 100% unavoidable in place like Bali. Others: I loved the easy access to the beach and all the restaurants that are along the Beach. Bonsai Cafe, the restaurant that yoiu must walk thru to get to the beach, is one of the better ones on the beach. The Picadilly Restaurant was good also. If you are into nightlife, I would not recommend this hotel as it is 30 minutes away from Kuta.Overall, you cannot ask for more considering the price.", "Date": "May 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR794109550", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chungt79"}, {"Content": "Comfortable, good value, great location We spent six nights at Sari Sanur. We found the rooms well serviced, clean and comfortable. The rooms were functional rather than luxurious with a very large king size bed, A/C, limited TV coverage, good storage including safe. Bathroom was servicable, hot water variable. The mini bar was well stocked and very inexpensive. Laundry was also very cheap. The bathroom has steps into it, and down to the shower area. Each room has an outdoor patio, quite private, and surrounded by tropical gardens. A good breakfast (Indo, American or Continental) is served daily on the patio. The pool is small (around 8 metres diameter) and waist deep, but clean. There is also a kids pool. The location is great, a 2 min stroll to the excellent Bonsai cafe on the beach (try the chili crab with a Bintang). There is also a ' Circle K shop on the beach just down from the Bonsai cafe. Handy for topping up on necessities but watch how they ring up your purchases and count your change. A one minute walk to the main shopping strip at Sanur including a very inexpensive beauty parlor (Achityo - or something similar). The mosquitos were really annoying both in the room and on the patio. We bought coils to try to deter them.", "Date": "Jul 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR371573479", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JAVMelbourne"}, {"Content": "what a pity i was looking around for quite a while for 3 days accommodation in Sanur. I chose Sari Sanur at the end for its low price and looking good pictures from the net, as well as the ok review from previous traveller. However we were disappointed and decided to change to another hotel instead right after 1st day there. I have to admit, when this small resort was built, I am sure it was built with great characters and detailed design, the deco was nice for the price they charged us (41$ for Delux Bungalow). But the problem is that seems they are lacking of staff or other reasons, efforts are not puted into to maintain the place, the pool was dirty (the first scene you have once you pass the reception), the room we've given had a bad smell and didn't go away although we've opened all windows for a while; the rooms are too dark, the small garden surrounding the room is out of control and heaps of mosquitoes are flying around even during day time hours... It would have been a great value small hotel if only they have the people to work on it!", "Date": "Mar 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR747045241", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "muwing"}, {"Content": "great budget hotel       bungalow front", "Date": "Dec 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR963659317", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "andyandyandy"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6129\u5136\u68f0\u3123\u505d\u9289\u55d0\u5157\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19955808, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR487367561", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6129\u5136\u9287\ue1c0\u6d36\u9365\u53c9\u76b8\u9287\ue0a3\u8e48\u9288\u5c7b\u4f28\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19955674, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR360146299", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u55d0\u4eef\u9287\u5fcb\u501e\u9287\u5fcb\u4ef1\u9288\u5d83\u4ebd\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19955412, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR853017027", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\u67ab\u5142\u9289\u693c\u5137\u9287\u72ae\u4ebc\u9287\u253f\u4eb1\u9288\u5fcb\u4e9c\u9287\u52ec\u5285\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19955226, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR521500285", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u5a42\u7df1\u93b0\u71b4\u4eb4\u9287\u5098\u501e\u9287\u4ff1\u4eda   showReview(19955016, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR669418542", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u3123\u4ef8\u9288\u509a\u7568\u9287\u52e9\u4f04\u9287\ue0a4\u790c\u93c1\u70b9\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19955005, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR438841574", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\ue1ba\u5031\u9287\u70bd\u501e\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u9287\u52ea\u6c49\u9287\ue0a0\u4eb0\u9287\u6b0d\u4eda\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19954768, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR197758544", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6129\u5136\u5b84\u8eb2\u505f\u9289\u5c7b\u5157\u9289\ue0a0\u4f00\u951b\u639e\u7d23...   showReview(19956271, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 11, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR559450091", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d584920-r20263985-Sari_Sanur_Resort-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "584920", "Price": "$54"}}
