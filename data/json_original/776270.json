{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent Service I arrived to the hotel pretty late at night. I was new to the Phoenix area so I had some trouble coming from the airport. Jane at the front desk was so helpful when I checked in. She explained to me where I could go for dinner and if she could assist me with anything. I travel a lot but the service that I received was excellent. I would definitley reccommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR398018069", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cmpm142"}, {"Content": "Don't stay here. I just stayed here with my family and it was terrible. We were on the IHOP side and we heard nothing but car horns, car alarms, car doors, and people talking all night long. The windows were closed and it was like they were not there at all. We were in room 315 and the floors were filthy. My socks were black from walking around for an hour. It really made me worry about my very young child who was crawling around at the same time. The front desk staff were clueless. I asked them about near by restaurants and the only ones that they could name were the two right next door (IHOP and Burger King) and the one in the hotel brochure. (Thanks, big help) Access was also tough because of light rail construction going on next to the hotel. We were only there for 12 hours so I couldn't tell you what the construction noise was like. I can tell you that I would not recommend this place and I would not stay there again.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR410409001", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "comfam3"}, {"Content": "Great Stay This hotel was clean, staff was courteous, rooms were much bigger than expected. There was road construction going on at the time but we didn't notice any noise from our room. Continental breakfast was very good, with make your own waffles and other continental breakfast fare.

The room was clean, it was nice to have a microwave and fridge, and checking in went smoothly. The only complaints I have include the heavy road construction and the fact that we were woken up several times throughout the night by loud hotel guests in the parking lot (playing loud music, yelling, etc). I understand that the construction isn't the hotel's fault, which is why I rated it a 4 instead of a 3. But I hoped that there would be a security guard in the vicinity that could control rowdy guests.Since we stayed a few days before Superbowl Sunday, we paid a hefty price. If it was around $100, I would probably stay again. But only if the nicer hotels were booked.The continental breakfast was standard. Waffles, danish, cereal, etc. We also ordered from Z Pizza, which seemed to have a great and unique selection of pizzas. They delivered right to the room, which was nice.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR982014329", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ohiobnr"}, {"Content": "Heavy Road Construction This hotel is in downtown Phoenix. There is very heavy construction just outside the hotel where the city is installing a light rail. We should have asked to be moved to another Marriott property. The $159/night price was far too high for this hotel even without the construction; however, the room was clean, the bed and shower were decent, the staff was courteous, and if you prefer a hot breakfast over the usual hotel continental there is an IHOP across the street.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR916117419", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "SEHBedford_Texas"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d776270-r14411474-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_Phoenix-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "776270", "Price": "$233"}}
