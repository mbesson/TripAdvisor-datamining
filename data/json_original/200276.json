The hotel is in a safe area but it's just so far away from civilization. If you suddenly want to go out somewhere at night like say a pub, restaurant, etc. you have to walk 5-10 minutes to the Schonefeld station to grab a train to your destination. The station is not 24 hours open so it could be a problem on weekdays. The hotel is rather nice though. Cosy rooms, friendly staff and good food in the restaurants. The pub, however, is not open everyday which can be a problem for some of you (like myself) recreational beer drinkers. The TV in the room is rather small and obsolete with very few channels to choose from featuring only German channels (showing American TV in German). So TV for non-Germans is not really a good option. The internet however is quite high speed. You can stream your TV shows or live TV online without any problem. All in all I would recommend this hotel for travelers wishing to stay in Berlin for not more than 3 days. More than that and you're bound to get a wee bit depressed for being away from civilization.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wroclaw", "Title": "\u201cCloseness to airport, very clean & nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Artur N", "ReviewID": "UR122779716", "Content": "The Schoenefeld Airport is 10 minutes on foot.

Before flying out I did the usual of looking up hotels and reading the reviews but it's always difficult to make a decision! As I travel alone regularly I tend to go to hotels where there are fewer rooms as it makes me feel safer. This hotel is near the airport and I can see that it would definately suit business people as opposed to young travellers as it is probably too quiet. However the train station is only a 10 minute walk away. The room was clean and the staff were friendly....other than that the hotel was ok. There is an Italian restaurant attached to this hotel where the food was ok and the sevice was good. I tended to eat out in Berlin and come back and sit on the terrace to enjoy a few beers.

Oh, and the coolest automatic coffee machine ever!! Has snotty morning/daytime receptionist but nice one late-afternoon and evenings; small noisy rooms, NO A/C !! bad mattresses, tiny shower but effective; no electric outlet in bathroom for hairdryer or shaver or whatever; no reading lights, tiny t.v. set, windows open just a crack so you'd better hope for cool weather if you're here in summer. But: free wireless LAN, free bathrobe, and LOTS of red, satiny drapes, pillows, bedcovers etc to simulate an Italian decorated hotel. Beautiful from the outside, well-worn on the inside. The general area is pleasant enough, but in the evening, no inexpensive restaurants nearby: only a snack grill (Doener sandwiches from Turkey, and hamburgers). There's a nice little supermarket 3 blocks away, though. And during the day (if you're hanging around your hotel instead of being out in the city doing tourist stuff) there are some small restaurants and bakeries, etc. in the area, and especially down in the U-Bahn below street-level. U-Bahn : to get to ANY of the \"attractions\" you'll need to transfer at least once, usually twice. If a small red canopy over your bed and heavy red curtains, etc. is REALLY important to you, you may like this place, but I'd say pass on this one; there's much better hotels in the 100-dollar per night range.

Breakfast was in a seperate building but only 30 seconds walk from reception. it was a typical German style buffet and very good indeed. Service was efficient and friendly.
