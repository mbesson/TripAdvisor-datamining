After reading some other reviews I was slightly concerned that I may have made a mistake booking this place - I couldn't have been more wrong. It was extremely easy to find from Termini and in an excellent location for walking to all the major tourist attractions. The staff, especially those on reception were very helpful, and more than happy to advise on where to go and how to get there etc, always with a friendly Bonjourno or Ciao! The room was large with a compact bathroom, and cleaned daily with towels also changed daily. Our room had quaint shutters which opened up to view the bustling street below, although noise was kept to a minimum by the double glazing (apart from the singing Scottish rugby fans!). Breakfast was really good, OK it was basic cereals, pastries, cheese and meat with proper orange juice and coffee - your normal continental breakfast then. It was plentiful and certainly enough to start your day off well. The lift was small - big enough for two plus luggage, but the stairs weren't a problem. We realised on the last day that there was a lovely terrace where you could eat breakfast - will definitely remember next time! So to sum up, this is a fantastic value hotel in a really central location and I honestly don't think you could get much better - it is very highly recommended. I will definitely retrurn to this amazing and beautiful city and I will book in at the Milo!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "JillieB652", "ReviewID": "UR125923686", "Content": "Just spent 4 days (March) in Rome.

The elevator was broken the day we arrived and they offered to carry our bags to the 5th floor (though we didn't accept the offer... but we should have:)). Value: No add'l comments. Sleep Quality & Rooms: I would have given the rooms an average rating if there was air conditioning. The only reason we were upset about the A/C is because we were never aware of the fact that they didn't have AC. Rome has been unusually hot this September and we could not sleep during the evenings b/c of the heat and the noise from the street. Our room was facing a busy street and we had to keep the windows open to circulate the heat. I don't fault them for the noise on the street but for the fact that we had to leave the windows open. There was a small noisy fan to help circulate the heat as well. The bathrooms had no circulation so were always muggy and always had lots of condensation. Cleanliness: Very Clean Location: The location was great. The hotel was located approx 2 blocks from the central terminal of the metro, which is also where the train is located.

It is only a few minutes walk from the main train station in the city which also holds the biggest metro station inside of it. This metro station will take you to just about anywhere you want to go in the city including the Vatican City, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc. Even closer to the hotel is the other main method of transport in the city (the tram) however we did not use this on our stay. When you arrive at the hotel you have to go down a wide alleyway and then turn left to a staircase. You have to up one short flight of stairs before you get to the lift which is in the centre of the staircase. You can take the lift up one floor to the hotel reception on the second floor. Our room was on the top sixth floor however the lift only goes up to the fifth so we had to climb a flight of stairs however this was not a major problem for us as it was only a few short steps. Our room was accessed through a door on the sixth floor that you must first press a buzzer to enter the next corridor as the building is shared with a few other hotels. The reception would then buzz you in. The room was a very good size with plenty of storage space for our luggage cases and other items. The wardrobe was a double one and had a large flat safe inside which there is no charge to use. We had a large mirror in the room also with a small fridge and a fan on the desk. The bathroom was nice and clean and although we never saw the maids the room was cleaned daily and we were given nice fresh towels. The shower was nice and spacious and there was a good supply of hot water. The breakfast area is located through the reception and it offers a good continental selection of croissants, pain au chocolate and cereals etc. There is also coffee, fruit juices and yogurts. The breakfast service runs from 07:30 until 09:30 which was early enough for us to have a good breakfast before heading on our various pre-booked tours. I believe that there is also a terrace to have breakfast outside however we never did this. Also in the area behind the reception there is computer and printer access for guests and a fridge with water and other various bottles of drinks that are cheaper than you would pay elsewhere so I found myself stocking up before heading out. On the way to the train station we found a small supermarket which had large bottles of Fanta, Coca-Cola etc for only 1 euro 50 which was a hell of a lot cheaper than the 4 euro that you pay at the tourist attractions. We will defiantly be going back to Rome again and we would definitely consider staying at this hotel again and would recommend it highly!

The hotel is very close to the Termini, an is easy to find. It is located on 3 or 4 floors of a 6 storey building shared with 2 other hotels, but don't let that put you off as it is secure and well maintained. Breakfast is cereal, rolls, croissants and coffee-if you want tea, hope that Maria is working as she is really nice and prepares a tray with tea bags, lemon etc and a pot of hot water, the other girl said that they didn't do tea and didn't look happy when I produced my own tea bags and asked her to heat some water up-that said, she still brought us some hot water with a smile! The room we had was nice and clean and spacious, with a good en-suite and powerful hot shower. The TV signal was a bit hit and miss, and we didn't always get the one English channel (BBC World News) , but we didn't go to Rome to watch TV so it didn't really matter! The bed was comfy, but the double was two single mattresses on a double frame, so the middle was a big ridge :-( There was a small fridge in the room, which was really useful, and there is a mini market across the street if you need supplies. Watch out for the hotel tax-it clearly states at reception that this is payable in cash upon check-in, so when we weren't charged, we thought that it had been included with the initial booking. When we checked out, we were informed that we owed 2 Euros per person per night for the hotel tax, not a big deal, but the hotel should follow it's clearly stated policy and charge up front as is advertises. Despite it's central location, I didn't find it too noisy and was able to sleep each night. On the whole a good stay, and I would go back to this hotel.

The emergency room locating service at the Rome airport placed me in the Hotel Milo as it is very near the main train station, and I was going to be taking the train the next day. They also arranged for a shuttle van to take me to the hotel. I arrived late in the evening after a long, stressful day being stranded in Paris, and, I was exhausted. I am a small woman traveling alone, wearing a back brace and carrying a cane. So, I was a bit vulnerable to begin with. Then I accidentally left my purse with my passport, wallet, driver's license, money, credit cards, and cell phone in the shuttle van. I only had a few Euro in my pocket. I was completely helpless at that point. There were two young foreign-born (not Italian) men working in the lobby area. One was at the desk, the other at the bar. I was the only customer in the lobby so they were not at all busy. Yet, they repeatedly refused to help me. They refused to call the police, refused to call the emergency room locating service at the Rome airport so the service could immediately notify the shuttle driver that my purse was in the van, and, refused to go with me to find a police officer outside. They made unacceptable excuses every time I pleaded with them for help. I was exhausted, in physical pain due to a bad back, and quite frightened. I could not think very clearly . I pleaded with them over and over again to help me for at least half an hour, but they would not. They said it was not the hotel's problem, it was mine. I told the one young man this is no way to treat a visitor to Italy. He replied, \"It's not my country. I just work here.\" I asked him if this is the way women are treated in his native country? He would not make eye contact with me. I then said, \"How would you like it if someone treated your mother, or sister, or daughter like this if she was traveling alone in a foreign country?\" Again, he did not reply. I finally ran out of the hotel into the night to see if I could find a police officer . I crying and shrieking as I ran down the steps because by then I was in a panic, and ,these young men were so cold and indifferent. They almost seemed to enjoy seeing my vulnerability and suffering, and, this shocked and upset me as much as having lost my passport and money. On my way out ,I met the shuttle van driver who had discovered my purse in the van, and who was kindly returning it. The two hotel workers did not even help me take my luggage to the room. They saw my cane. They knew I was injured. But, they just stayed at the desk and watched me painfully struggling with it. They didn't show me how to work the old elevator, and, did not bother to show me the room, either. When I finally arrived at the floor, got off the elevator, and found my room, the light would not work and I was in the complete dark. I couldn't even find the phone. I began crying in frustration again. I had to go down the hall knocking on doors to wake up other guests to help me. Two other guests, Italian women, put on their bathrobes and came with me to my room to help me. The room was plain, but adequately appointed. It was clean. But, there was a lot of street noise outside all night long. It sounded like men were loading trucks. The noise kept me awake most of the night even with the window closed. I felt unsafe in this hotel, so I was eager to leave in the morning. I was hungry, but, I didn't even have the breakfast. I just wanted to get out of there. But, before I went, I asked a different desk clerk, an Italian man, to give me the name of the manager. He didn't want to give it to me. He kept stalling, asking me questions, and playing little mind games. When I told him the way I had been treated the night before, I realized that he had already heard the story from his two co-workers. He defended them saying, \" It you wanted service you should have gone to a 4 star hotel.\" Before I left, I told him that when I return to the United States, I would tell the emergency room locating service at the Rome airport about this experience, and I would write hotel reviews to make sure that other people, especially women travelers, know the way guests are treated at this hotel. He said, \"Go ahead, tell the President, too\".", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seoul", "Title": "\u201cvery kind staff\u2661\u201d", "Author": "pyr1101", "ReviewID": "UR61378822", "Content": "very kind staff, and close to termini St, coloseum, basilica, etc.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cClose to Termini\u201d", "Author": "lu10", "ReviewID": "UR58842327", "Content": "We spent one night Mar. 6 upon arrival in Rome before taking the train to Venice.

We went up to the first room he assigned us to, walked past the pealing wallpaper under the flourescent lights, and found that it had no air conditioning, despite their claims on all the booking sites that the property is airconditioned.

Next door to the hotel is a laundromat/internet place. A nice woman showed us how to get a password and then a 50 minute usage card from a vending machine. We did our laundry a few days later and the guy that worked there was....curt. He helped us but it seemed like one too many people had annoyed him that day! Note this place isn't affiliated with the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance of the Colesseum, Trevi Fountain, and the Pantheon (highly recommended) so that was cool. My favorite pizza place was by the train station - Taglio Pizza - so simple but so good. I ate there 3 times in 5 days.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "dillinger", "ReviewID": "UR6817390", "Content": "stayed 3 nights very close to railway station and bus and tube entry courtyard which is shared by other hotels a bit offputting but inside very nice and clean room, cleaned daily ,fresh towels staff very friendly and helpful couldn't fault it. but outside you must be aware of pickpockets as anywhere else.i think rome is a safe place compared to some other places. really enjoyed it.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "gringo472", "ReviewID": "UR6807410", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel as part of a two city tour of Italy, having arrived by train from Venice we were at Termini station, which is only a few minutes walk to the hotel, the area itself did seem a little dirty and seedy with alot of youngsters hanging around in large groups and street vendors selling sunglasses, bags and belts, although we weren't harrassed by anyone. The hotel was easy to find, which is good when you have suitcases to carry. The first impression of the hotel wasn't that good, as when you enter you are immediately in a dirty looking courtyard which housed the enterances to lots of hotels. Hotel Milo's reception was located on the first floor, and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful, and we quickly received the keys to our room on the sixth floor, which meant using the lift, which in itself is an experience, although I'm sure it's perfectly safe it made you feel a little uneasy. Once inside the room, it wasn't the most spacious room in the world but it was clean, had sufficient storage, had a TV with limited English language stations and a safe to keep your valuables in. The bathroom was clean, had a small shower cubicle and a bidet and sink, all in all no issues with the bathroom either. Breakfast was served in a room just behind the reception on the first floor, which having read other reviews must be new as the other reviews mentioned a cafe across the road, the breakfast itself was adequate, with cereal, coffee, croissants, yogurt and juices, all served in a clean environment. The location of the hotel is excellent with all the major bus, train and metro links you would need to access virtually any part of the city. If you are looking for a cheap, clean hotel with great transport links then this is an excellent choice as in my mind the hotel is really only a place to sleep as during the day you are busy sightseeing. If you want large rooms, satellite TV, big selection at breakfast and a better neighbourhood then look elsewhere. One small point to note is as all the floors in the hotel are tiled, you could be lying in bed at night and the noise of the other guests walking and talking is quite loud as the sound seems to echo, also when we stayed there was some building work going on, which meant drills and hammers making noise too, especially as they were starting work long before 9 AM.", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, United Kigddom", "Title": "\u201cGood point are good, bad points are a slight concern!\u201d", "Author": "Welshlady84", "ReviewID": "UR5493606", "Content": "We have just returned from a week in Rome and we stayed for 7 nights in hotel Milo. It was me age 22 and my sister age 18. Firstly we arrived at the airport and found a great company in arrivals called Terravision (don't be put of my the name) that transfer every housr to and from Ciampino to the Termini/station for aroud 8E each. It's about 40 minutes to the station. The hotel is Literally two street in front of the station and too the left so walking is not a problem, although BE WARNED the traffic is a nightmare, it\u2019s a free for all so you have to walk out and dodge the cars like the locals\u2026be careful. The hotel has a strange set up, you enter a courtyard and the reception is on the 1st floor and the rooms begin on the 3rd floor and there are other hotels on the 2nd and 4th floor, so they have a lift that is a nightmare for those afraid of small space and old mechanics I advise the stairs every time, but it\u2019s not great if you have mobility problems! The receptionists were very helpful and speak moderate English and you can have air con for 5E a night which is in some way recommended as it\u2019s so hot in July, although it\u2019s too loud to have on at night so they provide the room with a fan, if you can cope I recommend saving the cash. The room is clean and spacious, with a free safe for your documents and cash and a huge full length window for watching the world go by. Also there is a hairdryer and empty fridge. The maids come in at around 10:30 and supply new linen and towels every other day. Breakfast is served across the street (with yellow umbrellas) until 10 o\u2019clock, you get a pastry, toast, juice and a hot drink\u2026in that temperature it\u2019s just enough. They also have a great menu at night which is really cheap, no service charge, great waiters and it\u2019s open 24hours\u2026you can\u2019t loose! Also down the road to the right there is a supermarket that sells big bottled water for 40c\u2026great value\u2026.BUT all the water in Italy is drinkable, so fill up the bottles in the local fountains and save cash. The area is quite noisy also but it\u2019s part of the ambience of Rome, so we ignored it. The small PROBLEMS: \u2022We thought the are was good and pretty with a fabulous church in front of you and the Coliseum and Piazza Venetia a 5 minute walk down the road and the hotel is on a direct route for the shuttle buses, however we were told by our tour guide that the area was dangerous at night as it was a drug dealing and prostitution hot spot\u2026not safe for young women to travel at night apparently\u2026we didn\u2019t notice a problem and we are only young so I suppose it\u2019s something to keep in mind. \u2022Pick pockets are a real problem, always keep your bags in front of you and don\u2019t take out large amounts, and don\u2019t look like a tourist!!!! \u2022We also noticed that the bottom drawer of our cupboard had an envelope with adult material in it, so if you have children in a separate room, I recommend you check the drawers first. \u2022If you like TV the only British/American channels are CNN and MTV international.

Considering the reasonable room rates, the hotel was well placed for 'Ancient Rome', the Coliseum was around 15 minutes walk, and the Metro was 5 minutes away. Regular trains run to the Coliseum and the Vatican. The Hotel is unusual as it forms part of a large building which is divided into 4 hotels, and is spread over a number of floors. We were on the 6th (top floor), and our room was in the eves of the hotel, which gave it some character, and was away from the inevitable road noise. We found our room clean and a good size. I agree with other reviewers that it would benefit from a 'Spring Clean', but generally the room and Hotel were satisfactory and good value for money. The Hotel would not suit you if you are less mobile as the lift does not go down to the ground floor. The lift itself is quaint and old-fashioned with opening wrought-iron doors.

Additionally it cost an extra 5 euro a night for air conditioning. The hotel provide breakfast at the cafe across the street, which is basic but fine, croissant, toast and coffee.

No chane of moving rooms - The lights in the room didn\u2019t work and the person on the desk didn\u2019t seem to care. Eventually he came up and used tape to fix the light. - On Sunday night we returned to the hotel at 1.30am and the hotel was closed !!! It took 30 minutes to gain access by knocking on lots of doors / doorbells and finally we woke up the night clerk. He told us the hotel normally closes at 1am - The staff were unhelpful. - Bathroom was dirty, with mould, etc. But other rooms we saw were clean and nice. - No fresh towels provided - The staff didnt seem to care - Lots of noise - but that's a typical Roman problem, so cant blame hotel for that - It was bad value for money - 150 euro per night for a twin room I can see that this could have been a reasonable place to stay IF (a) price was better and (b) there was no water/light/dirt problems.
