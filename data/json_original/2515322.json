An apartment, basically a hotel room with a proper fridge, cooking facilities, dishwasher, etc. makes travelling more comfortable for me, especially in a place like Paris where there is such a selection of great food to buy and eat at \"home\". It also saves quite a bit of money not having to eat in restaurants for meals all the time. This is one of the best Citadines I have stayed at, and it certainly compares well with other (non-apartment) hotels I have used in Paris. The location is brilliant for shopping with the department stores of the Boulevard Haussmann round the corner, along with the many other attractive streets nearby. The food department of Galeries Lafayette kept my little kitchen well stocked during my stay. The area around the hotel is clean and bright and, as a woman travelling alone, I felt safe and comfortable. The hotel is quite secure and, indeed, you have to ring the entry bell to enter the foyer, even though the Reception desk is manned. The public areas are clean and pleasantly decorated and internet use, on a PC provided in the business area, is free of charge. This Citadines location is the most expensive one I have used in Paris and, though it was very nice, and particularly well located for my shopping trip, I do not think it is sufficiently better than Citadines Louvre or Citadines Les Halles (both of which I have stayed in and found great) to warrant the extra cost. On this trip I booked the Citadines Opera Vendome as part of my Eurostar package, which worked out a very great deal cheaper than booking via the Citadines website. Over the years, I have stayed in both expensive and fancy, and cheap and cheerful (and occasionally not so cheerful ... ) hotels in Paris, but nowadays I am definitely happiest in a Citadines.

My wife and I were taking our usual Spring break with our married friends. We booked our stay via the Eurostar web-site to include accommodation and first class rail travel from London Waterloo. Total cost of the trip was \u00a31000, only \u00a3350 of which was the hotel. We chose the apart\u2019 hotel format as we thought it would be an interesting change from our usual two double rooms. It was certainly cheaper than two doubles, and to be honest much more fun, as we could really kick-back and relax. The Opera Citadines is very well located in a quiet pedestrianised street. Boulevard Haussman and the shops are no more than ten minutes walk away, the Louvre is in easy walking distance, as is the Seine for boat trip enthusiasts. The hotel is equal distance from the Opera and Madeleine Metro stations. The accommodation takes the format of a small flat. In our room you stepped into a hallway which opened up to one side to become the kitchen area, boasting a kettle, sink, two ring induction hob, combination microwave oven, mini-fridge, and mini-dishwasher (by Arthur Martin). Off the hallway/kitchen were doors leading to a toilet; a bathroom with sink, bath, and shower head; the master bedroom with double bed and built-in wardrobes; the living area with a comfortable fold-out sofa bed, built-in wardrobes, chairs, and a dining table for four. Both bedrooms had TV\u2019s, hi-fi\u2019s and telephones. We took the room with the sofa bed, which was very comfortable., and very easy to fold out. Everything was very clean and simply decorated. Each bedroom had a wind-out blind, which was very useful to block out the sun. Each room had a very small balcony - ideal for people watching. The ceilings are high, and the French windows large. I didn\u2019t hear any noise from the surrounding rooms. In the kitchen you get crockery and cutlery for four I believe, plus some pots and pans. A nice touch is that your room service includes a dishwasher tablet, so no need to go out and buy a box of sixteen when you only need two for a two day stay. We didn\u2019t attempt any serious cooking in the kitchen, but I\u2019m sure a reasonable meal could be produced from the utensils provided - Beef Wellington, anyone? We choose not to try the hotel breakfast, instead we hunted down croissants and jams, and pulled out the dining table\u2026 There are lots of restaurants in the surrounding streets, and underneath the hotel there is nice bar. There is also the bar at the Edouard VII theatre where the staff were very agreeable, and Bouvet Ladubay Rose is available. Overall I would happily stay at this hotel again.

Several years ago we had a bad experience at the Grenelle-Trocedero property -- a three star Citadines in Paris. The two four star Citadines in Paris provide daily cleaning and maid service. The three star properties donot provide daily maid service (unless purchased) and I suspect this may have contrinuted to our experience at the Trocedero property -- where our room was dirty, run down and generally unacceptable. The Opera Vendome is very good. It has a great location close to the Opera, Place Vendome, Place Concorde and great shopping at two of Paris's most well known shopping venues Le Printemps and Les Galleries Lafayette.
