Far from city centre, but easy enough access via the metro, which is within 5 walking. The staff aren't friendly, the rooms are microscopic, and the bed is super uncomfortable. If you are visiting for more than a few days i would look elsewhere. My partner and I were there for two weeks and the room was almost unbearably small. They have free wifi which is a bonus, but they really don't like you in the lobby, which makes me wonder why they put couches in the lobby in the first place.

A supermarket and a great cafe in the corner are just a few steps away from the hotel. What I dislike: The room is quite small, with noisy A/C and you can hear the traffic in street with an opened window. The non-smoking room I had smelled like a smoking room. A half-emptied beer bottle sitting in the fridge. In general it's quite ok for a tidy small room with a reasonable price. I stayed there because my friend live nearby.

The price of 47 euros included a buffet breakfast. We stayed the first night at Hotel Confortel Bel Art (51 euros). Due to laziness we would have stayed a second night there but the price had gone up to 76 euros! I hunted around in Trip Advisor for an alternative. Bonanova Park deservedly has good reviews. The hotel. Very convenient. Near the metro. And yet it is quiet. The hotel is sideways on to a quiet-ish road. The receptionist was a very helpful lady (only spoke Spanish). She allowed us to deposit our luggage early in the morning. She volunteered the wifi code (see Bel Art review). Around 2pm we returned after our morning meeting. We asked the lady if there was a good chinese restaurant nearby. She directed us to the SI-CHUAN restaurant (about 2 blocks from the hotel). Please read the separate review for this restaurant. It really was excellent. The best chinese food I've tasted in Spain (18 years) and it cost only 7,95 euros!!! So read the Si-Chuan review! The room (incredibly EXACTLY the same room number as the Bel Art). Slightly smaller than the Bel Art. The furniture was a bit \"teak-effect\" and there was only one chair. Double bed with blankets. Wifi was OK. A little slow. The minibar was well stocked but expensive. I mean 3,40 euros for a 25cl bottle of cheap beer? lol! The lighting was far better than in the Bel Art. Not a great view. You look out on the next door block of flats. I did like the quaint entrance down a steep slope. The bathroom was excellent. Very clean. The water glasses were in plastic bags and spotless. No bath but a GREAT shower. An overhead shower head as big as the mothership in Independance Day and a separate handheld shower head. Piping hot water. The freebie toiletries were excellent. A comb, 3 shampoo, 3 gel and a decent bar of soap. Soft towels. There didnt appear to be any extraction system to dissipate pong/steam. When you open the \"window\" in the bathroom you just get an inspection window for about 100 pipes and cables! The walls were a bit thin. You could hear conversations in adjoining rooms. Absolutely no traffic noise. The room decor was slightly dated - 1970's? - and the bedroom radiator reminded me of school classrooms and dormitories. The buffet breakfast was very good. Nothing cooked and hot but more than adequate. I particularly liked the local pastries (almond cake etc). Overall an excellent TWO star hotel. I would rate it alongside the Bel Art which claims FOUR stars.

It is easy to find (the hotel offered directions), although we did arrive late and got lost in the dark when we walked down the wrong street!

BUT: I had a room right in level 2 above reception and kittchen. I woke up every day when the kittchen started about 30 minutes before breakast start, maybe because they spoke so loud with the front desk. Also, shower of next room and people walking above were as load as if you were in there room. It is one of these congrete buildings where the inner walls carry the weight and usually transmit noise easily. Believe me, I have read a lot of reviews about hotels with noise complaints that I considered OK, but this room in perticular was sound-open ...
