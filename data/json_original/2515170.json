Very near the metro and only a 10 minute walk from Opera where we got the bus back to the airport. Check in was very easy, we were upgraded to a courtyard room when they found out our trip was my birthday treat. We were given a map of Paris with the hotel marked and the route to the major attractions. Our room was on the 3rd floor but there is a lift so no problem there. The room was quite small and the bathroom tiny but no worse than other hotels we have stayed in in France. It was very clean and the bed was comfy. The shower was fine with plenty of hot water. Soap and shampoo were provided as was a hairdryer and safe. There are loads of restaurants nearby, the hotel does provided breakfast, at an extra cost, but we didn't try that so can't comment on that. There is someone on duty at reception 24 hours so there is no problem if you are late getting back. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would stay again with no problem.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "ChristosK78", "ReviewID": "UR126745577", "Content": "We were looking for a fairly priced hotel for our stay in Paris. We wanted to stay in the Montmartre area for our 4 night visit, and we stumbled upon Hotel Monte Carlo. The rooms are small but that shouldn't come as a surprise for visiting Paris. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Le Peletier Metro (2 minute walk). All in all the stay was very good. The staff was polite and helpful and the hotel is clean. They do offer breakfast at an added cost, which we did not try. The free wifi though came in very handy, and they can give you an access code for every person. The bathroom was very small and it is nearly impossible to have two people in that area at the same time. One thing two keep in mind, because of the room's size, if you are travelling with a big suitcase it may be a slight problem. We had two small suitcases so there was not a problem with the space, but had we had one or even two full size suitcases, then only one could be laying down open at any given time. But like I said, if you want a convenient location, a clean hotel, and you don't want to spend too much money then Hotel Monte Carlo will do you just fine!

I stayed here for two nights and here are the pros and cons of the hotel: Pros: 1. Centrally located near Le Peletier metro station, about 10 min walk to Opera and shopping area on Rue Lafayette. Metro is literally 3 min walk from the hotel. 2. Budget friendly, this place is inexpensive, just book it from hotel's web site for deals. 3. Many places to eat and drink around, food choices from all over the world. 4. Room is very clean and spacious bathroom in European standards.' 5. Thomas at the front desk is very helpful for sightseeing tips and directions 6. Small hotel but charming with the unique decoration, simple and humble accommodation. 7. Hotel surrounding area is average, Banks with ATM near by. 8. Free wi-fi for all of your devices, excellent reception even on third floor. Cons: 1. The room is very small (and that is expected) and the twin bed is even smaller, probably the smallest one that I have even encountered traveling all over the world. So, if you can avoid getting the twin room. 2. The walls are super thin, so you hear everything, I mean everything and something are not meant to be heard in the middle of the night. 3. Skip the hotel breakfast, you can do much better for almost 9 Euro somewhere else. 4. Not sure why there is no shower curtain in the shower area (tiled shower), but the water is all over the floor and toilet seat. 5. There is no air con in the hotel, only fan and a small openable window. Verdict: If you are staying for a few nights (like myself), its adequate and inexpensive and friendly service. Its centrally located near a lot of different sight seeing spots and access to Roissy Bus at Opera to CDG airport. I would stay here again next time in Paris as it is a bargain for the budget traveler like myself.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood!

We have been to Paris many times previously but 1st time in this location. On arrival, greeted by a typically-natured French male receptionist, who refused to smile!!!! Allocated Room 403, fourth floor via very small but functional lift. Hotel is very clean, both rooms and communal areas. On entering our Room, where intially aware of a \"communal shower area\" situated directly beside same. Signage outside same states that it is not to be used between 11pm and .Didnt think much of it at the time, however, were made very aware of it use during the very early hours of the morning throughout our stay...... like 5.30am! As always, rooms in Paris are small and you can hear everything, so sounded like someone taking a shower on our bathroom at ridiuclous hours each morning. That combined with the road noise (there is a very popular Irish bar a few doors down from the hotel and revellers could be heard well into the wee hours from our Room) might make another court yard room better option. The Room itself was small, but as to be expected of Paris. It was clean and had adequate facilities (mini safe, hairdryer, fan, flat screen tv) for the rate. The bathroom was clean with a good shower however, the interior of the bathroom in general was a little tired, e'g mouldy ceiling in bathroom, main room was in better order, reasonably well decorated. Staff on reception the following day were exceptionally helpful and reccomended places to eat plus also booked a table for us at our chosen restaurant, which was greatly appreciated.it was just a shame our intial encounter on arrival was not as memorable.

The bathroom is small. But, after all, miss, this is France! If you aren't willing to be in a room that is best compared to a cruise ship cabin, you're going to be paying big money to stay in the city of Paris. So, level-set your expectations as far as room sizes...only the big \"Americanized\" hotels have the same size rooms that you expect for this amount of money in the US. That having been said, if you are a larger person (and I'll be happy to give specific measurement details via private message), you may have trouble in the bathroom. I am probably close to the largest that you could comfortably be to get in and out of the shower easily due to the very narrow entrance. The toilet and sink area was not a problem, though. Checking in was no problem. While I speak some French, I was able to switch to English with the desk staff. The lobby is nicely decorated, with several sitting areas. We opted to not get the breakfast because we were doing early morning departures and wanted to be able to eat on the go. The front desk mentioned the presence of a market nearby (practically across the street), and I will say that we stupidly did not take advantage of that. Go to that market and pick up some reasonably priced French wine as well as soda or other needs...it's much cheaper than buying at restaurants. You can also re-use smaller bottles as water bottles while you're touring. Also, if you're taking a train after (as we were), you can take wine or other beverages and snacks with you on the train and have a mini-picnic as you go. There's also several restaurants near the hotel, including pubs, a creperie, and a few cafes. One metro stop is very nearby and a few others are a short walk away. You can also take the RER line A (most often used for Disneyland Paris) from the Opera station, which is a short walk away (maybe 10 minutes, walking briskly). The room itself was clean and nicely decorated. It was very colorful without being garish. The lighting is a little dim at first, because of the use of CFLs, but it brightens as you leave it on. A fan was provided in the room, as well as a small LCD TV with remote. The window opens for cooling purposes. (There is a heating element but no air conditioning.) There were plenty of electrical outlets for our purposes, and wi-fi is included at no extra fee (but you will need to get a separate code/login for each device you plan to use). The wi-fi was perfectly usable for e-mail, blogging, podcasts, and photo uploads. We did not use it for streaming video at all, so I can't comment on that. The water pressure in the shower was fine, and shampoo and soap are provided, as well as plenty of towels. The sheets and bedspread were very comfortable.

The price was FANTASTIC, I felt, which was the primary reason I chose the hotel. I enjoyed the price, most of all, the easy access to the Metro, and the fact that I had a shower in my room, (no toilet, however.) That being said, you are somewhat in the middle of nowhere, as far as central Paris goes. It is a healthy walk to the river, as well as other landmarks. But, this is probably a contributing factor to the price! A comparable hotel in terms of creature comforts was, when I looked 30% more expensive. And, after all, you're in Paris! Enjoy the walk! A bad product of that, however, was that I got lost A LOT. There aren't any major landmarks that I could see to get my bearings, and I was frequently finding myself walking in the wrong direction. Certainly not the hotel's fault, but there you go. I enjoyed my room, which was adequately cool with the fan running, although it was on the warm side, (no AC.) The staff are reasonably friendly, although the African gentleman who greeted me kinda reminded me of the stereotypical Parisian who looks down their nose at crass American tourists! haha! But, again, it's Paris, and one has to more or less expect such behavior from time to time. He wasn't outright rude, but I did get that vibe. Might have been in my mind! What irritated me was the WIFI. I had to get a ticket for each device that needed access, and the ticket was only good for a certain time period. Also, the first two days I could get WIFI in my room, but after that I had to go down to the lobby. True, it's free, but I think a simple password would have been good enough. I did avoid the breakfast the first few days as it cost money, but I think it beat having to stand in line at another cafe wasting valuable time. Also, the few times I went to Starbucks a comparable meal always cost more money than what the hotel was charging. I'd recommend it the hotel's breakfast.

The hotel has a nice and cosy feel to it although it might be a bit hard to spot on the street with its nondescript facade. I took the metro from Gare du Nord, having arrived from London on the Eurostar and was pleased to have found my way to the hotel in under half an hour (although navigating my luggage in the crowded metro trains was quite a challenge). The check-in was smooth, quick and easy although 1 thing I would add is that the front desk staff were efficient but they weren't all that friendly, on the 4 days that I was there. The hotel has a small lift but it probably makes more sense to walk up if your room is not too high up. The staircase and the corridors were generally dark for most parts of the day and it might be a bit unnerving if you come back late at night but it was fine for me. I was given a room on the 3rd floor, coincidentally, named Londres (or London) from where I just arrived from! The room is not big but its very cosy, nicely decorated with the theme of the city of which it is named. The room came with an LCD tv, an in-room safe, a proper luggage rack, a comfortable double bed (even though it was just me), a writing desk and a fan. The bathroom was neatly appointed as well, with a proper hot shower cubicle and cool red tiles. No complaints about the room except that it could get stuffy if the windows are closed at night but if u keep it open fully, the street noises and more importantly, the cold winter winds of Paris (it was below freezing when I was there) will likely disrupt an otherwise perfect sleep. The best part for me was the fact that the hotel felt safe, with card-key access and an in-room safe as well as the fact that there was free wifi! Only minor peeve was that the walls are quite thin so if you have rowdy neighbours who come back late at night, and if you're a light sleeper, it might be a bit disruptive but otherwise, no issues. Location-wise, it was about a 5mins walk to the Le Peletier metro station, which is 1 stop from the Galeries Lafayette, which is also a nice 12-15 minute walk away. Food-wise, I didn't book a room with breakfast but along the same row, you'll find a good authentic chinese restaurant, a japanese restaurant, a french cafe and the best part, a small grocery shop to stock up on anything from fruits, snacks to fresh produce.

I stayed in the \"Amsterdam\" room, one of the Double Bed rooms facing the small courtyard; by Parisian standards, the room is large, although living in New York in a cramped 3 bedroom apartment has jilted my notions of \"large\". If you're accustomed to spacious bedrooms and plenty of room to walk around in, Monte Carlo isn't for you. In place of a closet, you're provided with an open-face armoir and safe. The \"double\" bed (actually two singles pushed together) is placed sideways--this is necessary, as if it were placed straight it would rub against the armoir and desk (which is still too close for comfort, at the foot of the bed). In typical European form, the shower is a tiny cube with no door, so you'll waste several of the towels they place in-room soaking up the excess water that inevitably splashes all over the tile-floor bathroom, or possibly fall on your way back to the bathroom. But hey, I traveled to Paris on a budget, and could've done worse. The staff keeps the place pretty clean, replaces the amenities daily, and doesn't seem to go to work until around 10 AM, so they won't come barging in while your asleep. The front desk staff could be more accommodating--I arrived from my 9 hour night-time flight from New York in a Parisian snowstorm around 2 PM only to be told that check-in was at 3, my bags could be held, but I'd have to go wander the city aimlessly for another hour. After the flight, amidst a snowstorm, all I really wanted was a few hours of sleep, but apparently that was too much to ask from the Monte Carlo, because, as previously stated, check-in is at 3. The worst part of this hotel is the noise. Even facing the courtyard, I could hear everything going on in the hotel--coughing, showers running, the people from the \"shared bathroom\" rooms going to the restroom, doors slamming. If you don't have earplugs and are a light sleeper, you're not going to get much rest. Around the third night I invested in some earplugs and began drinking heavily at the bars to induce sleepiness in order to get over this hurdle--not exactly the \"dream scenario\" for a Parisian vacation. I had friends in the city I could stay with and catch a few hours of sleep after the holidays, but I'd imagine most travelers don't. The bottom line is, the Monte Carlo is a cramped, loud budget hotel that's kept sparkling clean. It's near the metro too, but few places aren't. If you can sleep through almost anything and don't mind a tiny room, the Monte Carlo may be for you, but at the price you pay, you could probably do better, and if you couldn't, pay a little more.

We all checked in at the same time. Through orbitz, we booked the room with a private bathroom, but the man at the reception said that our booking did not indicate a private bathroom and if we wanted one we would have to pay an additional 90Euro surcharge on top of our rooms that we already paid 220 euros for. We didn't really have a choice so we paid, brought our baggages upstairs, and went out for the night. We got back to the hotel around 2:30am and were getting ready for bed at around 3 am when we got continuous phone calls from the reception desk. The guy who checked us in earlier with 3 people calls us and tells me that the room is only for 2 people and one of us must leave or pay 129 euros to upgrade to a 3 person room. I try to explain to him that he should have told us this in the beginning when it was during normal business hours so we can find a new place to stay. We definitely booked a room for 3 people it was becoming so much of a hassle at 3 am with no where to go. The next day we talk to the man at the reception and his \"colleague\" who we later find out was the owner. They are still not budging about the the reservation. My Orbitz reservation even said 3 people on it, but they insisted that was impossible because orbitz does not book for 3 people. I then sought to compromise with them and explained to them that they should first credit me the 90 Euros for the first upgrade for a private bath. They were still insisting that I pay the additional 129 euros. So i told them I will just move hotels and please refund me the money for the nights I did not stay. Now they tell me that there are no refunds and I must leave if I am with 3 people. This was a huge inconvenience, not just moving hotels, but being stuck with almost $500 of charges that I had to dispute with my credit card once i got home.

The hotel was indeed wonderful: small, but cosy, modern and a warm atmosphere from both the interior and the friendly, helpful staff.

Breakfast is sober and simple - croissants, toast, jam, chocolate spread, cornflakes, orange juice, coffee, tea - and doesn't quite compensate it's price. If you book a room at the street side and sleep with your window open, it sometimes can become noisy; but a large fan is supplied in every room, so we could sleep with the windows closed, hearing absolutely nothing of the outside. We did miss a small refrigerator in the room however, but that's just a detail. The hotel is very well located, near two metro stops, but the street - especially around Boulebard Montmartre - is very crowded in the evening. There are some nice restaurants only a few blocks away (e.g. Vaudeville, Les Noces de Jeanette...) and loads of shopping facilities on the boulevards.

The location is an easy walk from the Le Pelletier Metro station and you can reach all of Paris from the Metro. The price (for Paris) is excellent. We made an economical choice of a room with a shower (extra) and another without. The rooms are tiny. The first room overlooked the street and we enjoyed the view of a side street in Paris. There are excellent small mom and pop restaurants everywhere near the hotel. We took the RER train from Charles De Gaulle airport to Gare du Nord. Rather than take the train and walk up and down stairways with our bags, we rolled our bags and walked to the hotel from Gare du Nord - a good 20-30 minute walk. The hotel has an elevator that takes two people and one bag and we had a third floor room. At night we found that the hotel supplied fans (there was no A/C) were noisy and we could not get sleep. We exchanged the fan in the middle of the night with the night manager. The next day when we returned from our travels we found that they had put a new fan into the room. Nevertheless, (coming from a soft life in the US with AC) the 90+ degree temperature outside was oppressive and we cracked the windows open only to have the noise and light from the street keep us awake. The location of the hotel is superb and the value for money is tremendous. If you are on a tight budget and want to be close to the action you cannot go wrong - Just don't choose one of the hottest days in July to come here and stay. We took the Metro and then walked to Notre Dame, Tuilieries, Louvre, Jardin du Luxembourg, along the Seine, to the Shakespeare and Company Store, to the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe as the Champs Elysses. The Metro gets a little scary later at night and there were a lot of people sleeping off the street at the entrance to buildings. The hotel offers free internet - which we used - and one cup of coffee in the morning - which we did not know about until the day we departed. We had some delicious crepes in the restaurant kitty corner from the hotel. Everything in Paris is more expensive than the US especially food items. We found a great bakery close to the Poissoniere metro stop by walking up from the hotel. Great prices on croissants and freshly baked stuff washed down with a cup of ... (Nescafe)! An early morning checkout at 5:30am and we walked to Gare du Nord. There is something unearthly and beautiful about Paris so early in the morning. Unfortunately the automatic machines dispensing RER tickets for the train to CDG would not take my US visa (no smart chip) nor my large Euro notes. Trying to come up with 35 Euros in small change was impossible and we had to wait till the counter opened at 7:00 am to get a human being to sell us tickets. Our advice if you are taking early morning trains and relying on automated dispensers is - take plenty of change!", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "VEK_10", "ReviewID": "UR72753940", "Content": "We stayed at Monte Carlo 4 nights in July.

We had 2 rooms, one with a shared bath and the second ensuite. Shared bathroom had the courtyard view while ensuite had the street view. For the money we paid for the rooms, we will stay there every future trip to Paris. Although there are other reviews and comments on the friendliness of the staff, we want to emphasize these comments may be understating their helpfulness! We felt as though we were being treated like major guests in a very upscale hotel here in the USA. And, to be upfront, as we observed the staff interact with other guests, they all received comparable service. So, we don't feel we received special treatment, just receiving what the staff normally does for all of their guests. As an example: The first night, Cheruse (male staff deskman, spelling of his name is probably incorrect: My fault for not being more diligent) made suggestions about where to go for dinner. Many desk clerks do this at hotels; however, he took extra effort to be accurate with his directions and with his recommendations. We felt he was giving us useful information, personalized to our family, not simply making standard recommendations to everyday tourists. A second example: In the evening, we would bring in pastries from the local bakeries and wanted to sit in the small lobby while we socialized and relived our day exploring Paris. The staff members would bring us clean dishes, cups and silverware to use as we enjoyed our pastries. Without being asked, they simply made the effort to help us! This is a boutique hotel; the rooms are not going to be large and expansive. The rooms are meant to be used as a place to keep your luggage safe and a place for you to sleep at the end of your day. We felt very safe in this hotel; never once giving a thought to whether our belongings would be there when we returned. We were only a 20 minute walk from The Louvre; a 5 minute walk from the Opera House, and 10 minute walk from Sacre Coeur Basilica. If you wish to use the underground, there is Le Peletier station about 5 minutes away. A third example of special attention was when Tomas offered to arrange a shuttle for us to get to Charles De Gaulle airport on the morning we were to leave Paris. The night before we were to leave, he called a service and negotiated for us a flat rate of E60 for the four of us and our luggage. When the taxi arrived promptly at 9:00 am the next morning, the driver claimed not to know about the negotiated arrangement. Tomas stood up for us and contacted the dispatcher to resolve the misunderstanding. When we arrived at CDG airport, the driver only expected to receive the agreed upon E60. Yes, we did tip him, too! Re-reading this review, I genuinely feel as though I am leaving out more of the special attention we received at Monte Carlo Hotel. If I have, I offer my sincere apology to the staff and owners. Based on our stay, we all four wish we could offer the most glowing recommendation possible. Other than the recommendation for this hotel, we also strongly suggest first time visitors to Paris take the \"red bus\" tour. It cost us E24 each, but you have two days with unlimited use of their tour buses. You can get off at any of their stops and then board another tour bus which arrives approximately every 15 minutes. We were able to visit all of the major tourist destinations without ever needing a taxi or the underground.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poitiers", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel and staff - we will return.\u201d", "Author": "brandybubs", "ReviewID": "UR58982447", "Content": "We chose this hotel because of it's good reviews and it was a great choice.

Just be careful, when you come back at night - everytime we had a problem in finding the right street with hotel - as there are so many same small street on same junctions :) Maybe it was just our problem.

The hotel is centrally located, within a 10 minute walk to the Opera / Galleries Lafayette, and roughly 20 minute walk to the Louvre. Many restaurants, cafes and bakeries are located nearby. Le Peletier metro station is just around the corner which is also a huge advantage. The owner of the hotel is amazing and goes out of his way to make you feel welcome. The rooms are tiny but this is Paris, and should be expected. I stayed in a single room with a shared bathroom and was initially a little apprehensive with the idea of having to share a bathroom. This was not a problem at all as the bathroom was also vacant when I needed it. This hotel is extremely clean!!! There's also free WiFi which I used every day and it worked well. Couple cons that i'm hoping the management of the hotel will read and take into consideration. 1) The shower on the 4th floor has a very STRONG, unpleasant moldy smell that literally made me cough and made me nauseous. I'm not sure if it's mold or something else, but the smell is quite strong and can't be good for one's health. 2) The night staff was very unhelpful & unfriendly. I needed help a couple of times with directions or help with the metro system, and the gentlemen came across as bothered and unwilling to help. 3) You cannot check in before 3pm even if your room has been cleaned and is ready to be occupied. While most hotels do allow guests to check in at an earlier time assuming the room has been cleaned and is vacant, management of this hotel doesn't seem to be flexibile around their check in policy.

Yes, it was clean and very near a metro stop and the staff were pleasant and friendly (although we hardly saw the same people twice in our three day stay). It was also warm. We had a quiet room that overlooked a dingy courtyard although the walls were very thin leading to the other rooms. But I am afraid I found it quite uncomfortable. The room was very small and oddly shaped, the colour scheme was extraordinary, the woodwork was dark brown the carpet also dark brown, the walls were very dark green or very dark purple so it felt like walking into a gloomy cupboard. The TV only got French channels. The lights were dim and I found it quite hard to read in bed. After dark there was no chance of writing anything at the very narrow desk which was pushed against the far wall, just no lighting there at all. The double bed was 2 narrow singles pushed together, which developed a gap in the middle by the end of the night. We didn't want to spend the evenings there at all and felt a bit banished to the rainy streets! The bathtub was gnome sized, and the floor had a pronounced slope. We didn't try the breakfast as it looked a bit dull but we did find a great boulangerie patisserie just a few steps to the right in rue de Provence. You can sit down and have coffee, fresh orange juice a tartine and a croissant or pain chocolat etc for 6.50 euros there. Beware it was shut weekends! In fact the whole area was a bit dead at weekends. It's a rather workaday area of Paris with a lot of philately shops, a little road of food stores (rue Cadet). It's not too far from the Folies Bergere and some Jewish shops. And also a lovely chocolate shop in rue Provence. But it's not exactly a thrll a minute, nowhere you can sit around really and nothing much to see. I much prefer staying on the left bank. Given that it was a very tiny hotel with odd shaped rooms in a dull street, the owners have done pretty well with it and they have tried to make it individual. I guess what I am saying is that it is not any kind of a boutique hotel if you were expecting it to be and somehow from the photos I thought it would be.

I highly recommend this little gem of a hotel to anyone seeking affordable accommodation, excellent customer service, and a perfectly located base while visiting Paris. I was lucky enough to get a room in the back corner of the top floor of the hotel, so street noise was not an issue at all - extremely quiet. I had a double bed, with no ensuite facilities, for \u20ac70 per night. The rooms are quite small (and, unfortunately, not very soundproof) but the size of the room - and the rich, warm colours that the entire hotel is decorated in - only adds to the charm of this hotel. The cat motif is everywhere in the hotel (which I loved); it's a shame the cats are no longer in residence. There was always fresh towels and sheets provided, and a pleasant, fresh scent would prevail after the room had been cleaned. The room itself had everything needed during a visit - telephone, heater, flat-screen TV, in-room sink (with shampoo & shower gel provided), and a safe where you could lock your valuables away and not worry about them being stolen. This is, however, a very safe hotel as is the general area around it. The shared facilities were always fairly busy but the shower & toilet was kept extremely clean; I heard housekeeping cleaning them at various points throughout the day. The bed in my room was incredibly comfortable and you seemed to sink in, yet be firmly supported. The staff at the hotel are very firm about check-in time - they will not allow you to check in prior to 15:00, but if you do arrive early they will hold your luggage at Reception while you explore Paris until check in time. A cold buffet-style breakfast is provided each morning, which is absolutely delicious. I did feel, though, that \u20ac9 is a little steep in price but there is a wide variety of food and plenty of it. You can get a cheaper breakfast in the area around the hotel, but it will be Continental. There is a very small lift in the hotel, which is good as the stairs are very steep and winding (just be prepared for the sudden stop of the elevator when it comes to your floor!). For those traveling with laptop computers there is free in-house WiFi, but you need to bring your laptop to the lobby in order to connect. The location of the Hotel Monte Carlo is perfect - many of the main areas/sites of Paris are walkable from the hotel. The hotel is very close to the Grands Boulevards Metro station and is a close walk to Gare du Nord and the Opera, where you can catch the Roissy bus to/from Charles de Galle airport for \u20ac8.50. All in all, a great stay at the Hotel Monte Carlo in Paris.

I NEVER give out such information, especially at the hotels or small businesses, where chances of fraud are paramount! Anybody can access this information which is stored in the hotel's books forever and steal the card information and this happens left, right and center! Without the security code, I was told, the hotel could not take my booking. Well, I regularly make reservations at various hotels all over the world and I was never asked to provide such level of security information. Secondly, the hotel do not accept Visa Debit card. They only accept credit cards. As I do not have credit cards but used my Visa Debit for years all over the world without ANY problem whatsoever, I was extremely surprised as to why Hotel Monte Carlo would not take my Visa as a guarantee of my booking. They did, however, suggest that I could transfer the money via Western Union (no way!) or make an inter-bank transfer which would add at least 20% on top of the total amount. Alternatively, the hotel suggested they take the first night's payment \"to see if the card works\" but this amount would not be refundable.

The front desk was very helpful and the atmosphere of the hotel was peaceful. During the stay the staff helped us to book a place at cabare Moulin Rouge, it was a very beautiful show, and on departure they called for us a cab early in the morning. The housekeeping employees and breakfast crew always greeted us with a friendly smile. Speaking of breakfasts, they serve it till 11 in the morning which is very convinient if you like to sleep ( and you would like to sleep till 10 o\u2019clock as the bed and pillows are very comfortable and soft! ) and they have about 5 different kinds of cheeses, boiled eggs, cereals, jam, honey, fruits and bio bread. The coffee was wonderful. The hallways and rooms were always kept clean. Our room was lovely blue and green. A very highly recommended hotel to stay inParis.

The bathroom was a let-down. The light above the basin was loose. There were cracked tiles and the shower was so small you were hanging out of the cubicle if you weren't standing ram-rod straight. The shower also leaked at the tap. Having said that, the bed was comfy, there was a TV and a safe inside the wardrobe. What saved it for me was when we returned from our out-of-town stay, we had another room which was pure luxury compared to the first one. Our bathroom was clean, in great order and with a bath. The bedroom was larger too. We felt we'd been given the honeymoon suite, it was that different from the first!

There was also an internet place just down the street (they also have 3 phone booths in there for really cheap phone calls long distance!). For those who love to shop, there is a Galleria mall just blocks away! We walked everywhere. We walked to the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and along the Seine River. The furthest was the Eiffel Tower, and we got there in about 1/2 hour - 45 minutes. Thank god for the elevator in the hotel(for our baby stroller and all!). The staff was friendly and helped us with any directions we needed. There were 2 useful maps in the lobby that were perfect for us to find our way around. We didn't take advantage of the breakfast, as we found it at the numerous cafe's around the area. The room itself was sufficient. We had room 403 which was front-facing with 2 big windows that opened up to the street. It was pretty hot when we were there, and wanted to keep the windows open as there was no air-conditioning. However, it was pretty noisy at night, so we used the big fan they provided for us instead. They didn't have a cot for the baby, so she shared the king-size bed with us (it was actually 2 twins pushed together, so we had to watch she didn't fall between!). We opted for our own bathroom, which had a bathtub and shower with great pressure, and never ran out of hot water. To get to the Charles de Gaulle Airport, we took the direct bus from the Opera House which was very close by. It cost 8.50 Euros each, and took about an hour to get there. You just buy your ticket from the bus driver. It stops at each terminal at the airport as well. All in all, the Hotel Monte Carlo suited most of our needs.

Located in the 9th Arrondissement, it is convenient to the Metro, Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est and Paris shopping. A three minute walk to the Cadet Metro station makes it a perfect location for getting around Paris in a hurry. I booked a single room with ensuite bathroom for two nights and paid 95 Euros per night. The typical French Breakfast (bread, cheese, coffee, yogurt, cereal, etc) is not included but is available for an additional 9 euros. Because I was only in Paris for two days, I didn't waste time with breakfast because just around the corner on Rue de Cadet are some of the best boulangers and patisseries in Paris -- where you can buy exquisite pain du chocolat for 1 Euro and the most scrumptous quiches and fruit tartes for a mere 2 Euros each. The hotel is well kept and the staff is very friendly, courteous and eager to please. My room was quite spacious but a bit stuffy upon first entering. No air condition but a fan and windows to open. Paris was very hot and so it was a challenge to make the weather work in my favor while in my room -- but the rain kept both mornings and evenings cool and I was out and about during the heat of the day so I escaped what would have been a very warm room for most of my stay. My room was located facing an inner courtyard which contained the open door to the hotel's kitchen which was a bit noisy at times. Also you could hear anyone else located in rooms facing the courtyard who had their windows open -- these were mostly rooms above and below me -- there was no one across from me so I did not have to worry about anyone looking into my room. Fortunately, by the time I was ready to go to sleep it was quiet. The bed was comfortable, the ensuite bathroom was of a nice size but with shower only -- plenty of towels, clean linens and a safe in the room for valuables. The housekeeping staff does a nice job and they even have a sense of humor -- I had a statue of a horse in my room on which they changed the poses daily! I know this neighborhood and most of Paris very well so I didn't have a great deal of interaction with the staff but they were very accomodating throughout my stay. The neighborhood is safe to walk through day and night but it is a very busy neighborhood with lots of activity on the streets. Both nights I arrived back at the hotel near 10 pm with no problems walking from the metro station.
