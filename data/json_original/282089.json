Since the Riviera hotel was sooooo pricey (but totally worth it) we decided to book just an affordable hotel. This one looked nice on the pictures, and the location is great. I dint have that many complaints about it, however I would think twice if I had to stay there again. Lets say its a petite hotel, the rooms are way too small, the TV is way too small, in fact, It was kind of funny there is no real furniture at all but a chair, everything else is made out of the same room, it was kind of funny actually. They said that the remote for OUR Tv was missing, so we had to get up to change the channels everytime, since OUR TV was the only LG one, and they didnt had any other remote for that one. I liked that our room was right in front of the pool, which is on a second floor, so you get a view of the fifth avenue. The pool by the way was pretty small as well, but it was ok since there were very few people during our stay. You get a free continental breakfast with eggs and toast at this restaurant in the front of the hotel, however the service there was terrible, we only had it once since the first day we waited for 10 minutes for them to give us a seat and they didnt even stoped to say hold on a moment, they basically ignored us completely, the girl at the front desk however seemed concerned about that when we told her our poor experience at the restaurant. Overall, it was an ok, average staying, I guess I should ask for more for the price we paid, but I think there are better hotels out there for the same budget", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cJust Right!!\u201d", "Author": "MellieEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR60597758", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel over the Easter break and it was awesome!! Right on 5th ave but far enough down from all the noise. The hotel was really clean and all you need in Playa. Only blocks away from public beaches where you can rent 2 chairs and a hut for 90 pesos. Or go to Walmart and buy your own umbrella to take to the beach. The beaches are breath taking and amazing, the sand never gets hot!!!! and the colour of the water is beautiful. The rooms are kept very clean and you can rent a in room safe for $3 a day. The TVs do have static but you should not be in Mexico to watch TV! The showers tend to run cooler water than warm but after a hot day it is refreshing. The coffee shop Ah Caoco is amazing, ask for Henry he will take care of you and the Aca Los Tacos is perfect for some great food and they make the best drinks!!! The perfect hotel for a wonderful stay in Playa. The front desk do have a hard time understanding English however just draw some pictures and you are good to go.

It's right on the famous 5th Avenue in the City Center approx 2 blocks from one of the best beaches. Just outside the open lobby, is the most popular coffee house in town, A Cacoa. Your room coms with a continental breakfast at Karma's Bagels. This breakfast is not fancy. It's toast, juice, dry cereal, coffee or tea and yogurt. Just enough to get you going without dipping into your pockets right away. The rooms are clean but on the smaller side. If you can check in early and request a room with a balcony, they are nice. When we arrived, they were all taken, but we spent absolutely no time in our room, so it wasn't an issue for us. The hotel is completely tiled , which can be noisy, but guests figured this out and were considerate of each other. The tile kept the hotel cool and comfortable. The tv is hooked up to cable, but you need to push the cable button or you'll have a fuzzy screen. We watched little to no tv, so this wasn't an issue for us either. The staff is friendly and nice, but speak very little English, so they don't always understand what you are asking them. They will do their best to make you happy. I cannot comment on the pool - we never used it, but its cute and looks perfect for that quick dip. This hotel fit us perfectly. It was economical, clean and in a great location. It is not a resort, but one of the several \"boutique\" hotels on and near 5th Ave which is loaded with bars, shops and restaurants of every type and price.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cDefinately coming back to this hotel next time!\u201d", "Author": "Andreassons", "ReviewID": "UR49158209", "Content": "We are a family with 3 children, 4, 14, 17 years at the time, and this hotel was perfect for all of us!

We came home at 4.45 pm the second day after going to one of the ruins to find two men in our room--one at the foot of one of our beds watching tv with the air conditioning on, whilst the other had removed our glass doors leaving debris all over our bags and clothes and was sitting outside on a ladder. The reception staff had no idea that the men were in our room nor that this work was being done and the manager was disinterested with the situation leaving the desk staff to try and deal with the fact that our room was unfit to enter for another hour. At check out, we were led to believe that we got a discount for our trouble, which we did not ask for but appreciated. But after checking out one of us left our bag at the hotel and returned to collect it and the manager refused to give it to us unless we paid extra money saying that the desk staff was wrong about the price and he wanted more money. We had traveled throughout Mexico for 2 weeks and had a wonderful time and stayed in many great hotels both budget and mid range. It was very disappointing to be treated so poorly at our final destination and I would highly recommend that people looking for clean, reasonably priced accomodation go elsewhere as there are many wonderful places in Playa del Carmen but this is definitely not one of them.

We got a great room on the top floor in the corner with two bacalonys, we had a great view of 5th ave and the beach. We could see Cozumel from our balcony. The room was very clean and comfortable , air conditioning worked great, tv worked great, bathroom was clean, shelves for our clothes, and hangers. Rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels we left something for the maids daily and they always left something on our bed. The toilet was plugged one day and we let them know at the front desk on our way out and it was repaired when we returned. Breakfast was tea, coffee, toast, jam, this was ok and when we wanted more we went to a restaurant. We ate at various restaurants on 5th ave and all the meals were great. never got sick. We enjoyed being able to choose different places to eat each day. We did a lot of exploring and went on day trips. This was our second time to Playa del Carmen so we were famalier with some of the Trips available. We did our trips on our own. We took a taxi to Puarta Adventura and arranged Deep Sea fishing with Captain Ricks, also Parasailing there. There is a bus station on 5th ave so we took the bus to Cancun for the day. Went shopping and checked out the hotel zone. Another day we went to Cancun and took the ferry to Isle Medaize, island of the women.(sorry for the spelling) When there we went snorkling with a local boat, it was great. We walked to the end of 5th ave and took the ferry to Cozumel for the day. We found that it was cheaper to go on our own, and had no time limits to explore.

The kitchen is dirty. The television signal is not good, and the room have old furniture. All the services the websites show is not true about this hotel.

This hotel is located at the 'quiet' end of 5th avenue about 1 1/2 blocks from the beach. It is a four storey walk-up design (no elevator) with cafe/bar/restaurant on the lobby level. There is a small pool on the 2nd floor which we did not use during our stay. Rooms are quite small and I would recommend an immediate upgrade from the Standard room provided by Sunquest. We were lucky enough to get (for an additional price) a balcony room facing the main street on the top floor. If you don't like stairs DO NOT stay in the upper floors of this hotel. The restaurant is quite inexpensive and we thought it was fine for a very casual lunch or dinner. My gut feeling is that a standard room here would be a bargain at around $50/USD per night. I wouldn't really consider this hotel unless you could pay around that price for a standard...slightly more for an upgrade. I plan to e-mail Sunquest and suggest they offer more than ONE hotel which is not all inclusive - for those of us who like to explore and not always eat & drink in their hotel. Just a word about 5th Ave. We live in downtown Vancouver (near Robson St) and were amazed that 5th Ave was as busy as our area, however there is a quiet section of 5th just north of this hotel. We found ourselves enjoying the quiet part of 5th ave much more. It also seems to attract the Europeans giving it a very different flavour. If you want loud crowds and lots of people trying to sell you things then stick with the busier section of 5th. 10th Ave also seemed to have a quieter feel, with a fair selections of restaurants. All in all a super little town to explore and enjoy the sunshine in (we came back to minus 9 degrees and snow....yuck).
