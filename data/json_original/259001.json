Handy safe location. - Room was small: We booked a triple room but there was no space on the floor to open my medium-sized suit case. - Noisy: Our room was beside the reception and facing to the street but no view as the windows were covered by scaffolding. Other guests chatted loudly at the reception area at night and it was quite disturbing. - No hidden cost? : Agoda.com's site said all cost, e.g. taxes, service charges were included, but the Hotel requested us to pay \"Rome City Taxes\" which was introduced last year. Agoda.com's site should have updated the information if it insists to state \"no hidden cost\". - Breakfast: although the booking voucher from Agoda.com clearly stated as breakfast included, the hotel refused to provide breakfast and they said it was Agoda.com's system error and they are not responsible for the information on the website. However, the hotel knows the same errors have been happening. Who is responsible for it? - Agoda.com customer service: we contacted the company to sort out the breakfast-not-included issue before check out through Agoda.com\u2019s customer service links but they never replied to us. After I came back home I called its UK contact number. The customer service advisor said she would contact the hotel and find out the fact. I have not heard from her yet for a week.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat service\u201d", "Author": "Lennart L", "ReviewID": "UR124020090", "Content": "Very helpfull staff at the hotel and located near sight seeing busstop and termini train station.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "Kelly C", "ReviewID": "UR123259219", "Content": "My daughters and I toured Italy in October and Hotel Sweet Home was our favorite of the many hotels we stayed at. The staff is so helpful and even carried our luggage up because we were just exhausted from our trip. They offer free maps and suggestions about the best way to see Rome. They offer free calls back to the States and were accomodating in every way they could be. No free breakfast but there are places all over to eat so that was no problem. The location is wonderful being so close to Termini Station. We walked everywhere we went and it was a great location.

We hadn't any view from the window, because it was close by some banner. Room and bed cover are in red color, that makes it pleasant to be here. Walls are too thin, you can hear everything what is going in the next room! It could be some problems with hot water - because of the old pipe system, the water temperature is changing and not stable. No breakfast, but you can find a lot of restoraunts or cafe in this area. We had our breakfasts on the second floor of the train station.

The room is huge, about 20' by 30' plus the biggest bathroom of any other hotel, it had a bathtub shower combo!. It was newly remodeled (as of Nov. 20). Everything was clean (No mold). Very secure (have to be buzzed in at main door). Service was extremely friendly and helpful (they knew every bus route gave complimentary maps and even offered free phone calls to the U.S.) And you can't beat the location. A couple blocks from the main train station (the main bus station is at the same spot). A laundry right across the street. A supermarket right across the street (must have for cheap bottled water and nutella with fresh bread). A gelateria and good resterants on the same block (and McDonalds 2 blocks away). ATM right around the corner and of course you are within walking distance to all the main attractions. We took a bus to the Vatican, but walked back (with four kids age 5,7,9,11).

We felt very safe there, and he gave us so many tips! The next day we departed for a cruise. After the cruise we decided to stay one additional day in Rome, so we called Franco the day before the cruise ended. He was GREAT!!! Totally accomodated us, especially last minute. He gave us a nice price break because we were returning... He also helped arrange transportation to the airport at 4am! He was amazing! The rooms were clean and comfortable! The location--- SO SO SO close to Termini, it really couldn't have been any better! Our next trip to Rome, we will definitely be visiting Franco again! **The restuarant below the hotel was delicious as well.

It is very clean, comfortable, safe and basic hotel. The price is reasonable, the staff is very polite. Especially Franco, the director of the hotel is very friendly, helpful and he speaks English very well. It is only five minutes walk from termini station, shuttle bus stop for airport and city tour bus stops. Our room was on the first floor near reception. However we were not disturbed by any noise at night. In my opinion, the only deficiency of the hotel was the lack of breakfast. There are various breakfast choices nearby but I would rather drink a cup of coffee or tea before leaving the hotel. Franco said that he was planning to arrange coffee- tea facilities and put some croissants in the refrigerators in the rooms. Before leaving Italy, I booked a room for one more night by phone and my room was ready when I went there, although I had not paid any deposit. There is a restaurant below the hotel run by Albanians. I also suggest that restaurant for those who do not want to walk far in the evening.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Signal Mountain, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, great value and very clean\u201d", "Author": "gerritdp", "ReviewID": "UR115126865", "Content": "Hotel \u201cSweet Home\u201d I\u2019ve made my reservation several months before arrival and had perfect communication with Mr. Franco.
