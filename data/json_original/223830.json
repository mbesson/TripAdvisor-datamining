The downtown Marriott was the conference location, so I didn't have to choice from a list, but there are a bunch! In fact, most of them are lined up on the same street with the Marriott I stayed in including a towering JW Marriott, Westin, Hilton, etc. The location was great; although all of the activities I was involved in were self-contained in the hotel, it is connected by a skybridge to other downtown locations including the Convention Center which is directly across the street. The staff was very effiicient and friendly and the rooms were nice. Although it's an older hotel (70's 'ish) the rooms were I saw, including mine, were good-sized and all had been updated with fresh wall coverings, paint, carpeting, bed coverings, furniture and 32\" flat panel TVs. I was surprised by how many channels were available on the TV; I find they are usually much more limited. The bathrooms were also very nice and clean and had obviously been updated as well though the floor and bath tile were showing a little age. there are two restaurants off the hotel lobby. One called the \"City Grille\" is obviously the hotel restaurant. They offered a nice buffet breakfast (typically cheaper than ordering breakfast ala carte, especially since it includes your beverages of choice). We also had lunch there one day and although the food was fine, it was pricey for a sandwich and salad. I'd recommend using the sports bar restaurant, champions, which is off the lobby as well, but appears to be separate from the hotel. They had a nice variety of foods, everything we tried was good, and they were a bit more reasonable price-wise. Dinner at the City Grille is likely to cost you about the same as a dinner at McCormick & Schmicks Steak House, which was only a $5 cab ride away. My only issue was that I discovered when I turned in the first night that my Marriott number had not been applied to my reservation, so they were unaware that I need a down-free room. As soon as I made them aware the next morning, they had housekeeping remove all of the down and replace it with fiber-based products. Although I don't know how it compares to its neighboring hotels, I would definitely be happy staying there again.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Spot for Convention Center\u201d", "Author": "HermanG", "ReviewID": "UR124921347", "Content": "We attended a trade show in February, and the Marriott hotel was a great spot.

Upon arrival I learned the New York Giants were staying at the hotel. This provided for celebrity viewing but was well handled by the hotel and security staffs. It did not cause any problem for hotel guests that I could tell. Check in was very smooth and fast. The front desk staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. I stayed on a 7th floor room with a view of the alley behind the hotel. I did see a view of Lucas Oil Stadium at the very edge of the window. The room was nicely sized with two double beds. Plenty of room to walk around with two people in the room. The bathroom was nice sized and very clean. This was the cleanest hotel room I have stayed in in awhile. The hotel is connected to the convention center by sky walk and can be accessed without going outdoors. I ate at both restaurants in the hotel. both were over priced with average to good food. I had a great stay at this Marriott. It is centrally located for all downtown Indianapolis activities, very clean and comfortable. My biggest complaint is the food prices.

The staff said it was because they operate on a first-come, first-served basis. Still from the basis of customer service, I want to know that I am guaranteed a certain type of room AND that I don't need to beat someone there to get that particular room.

We booked the room through Priceline and got a great deal despite it being the first weekend of pre-Super Bowl activities in Indy. For attending those activities, the location could not be better! Right across from the Maryland Street leg of the Convention Center and just half a block from the zip lines and activities on Capital, we were in the heart of everything just half a block away. The valets at the Marriott were so cordial and up front about valet vs. self-parking in the garage under the hotel. Valets at some hotels lose interest in you if you decide to park yourself, but these guys were very nice, helpful with directions, and also very welcoming each time we went in or out of the hotel. The elevator from the parking garage goes straight up to the end of the hotel lobby--very convenient. When it came to checking in, Alex at the front desk could not have been nicer, answering my questions about a possibly extending our stay (we didn't but only because one evening of the Super Bowl stuff was enough) and arranging a late check out for us. We asked for a room at the end of the hall with a king sized bed--and that's what we got. Great view of the State Capital, too. The room was a standard King room and not overly large, but certainly big enough. The large flatscreen had a wide selection of channels, including HBO. Having a refrigerator would have been nice (we did not use the minibar). Although there was a national sorority convention at the hotel, we had a very peaceful stay and slept quite well (very comfortable bedding!). This is also the first hotel in a L-O-N-G time where we weren't awakened in the morning by hearing \"Housekeeping\" and tapping on the door of a nearby room. Although the housekeeping staff was working just a few doors down from our room, we weren't aware of them until we were ready to leave and went by the cart. Internet is free in public areas or in the business center (2nd floor). Guests can print 20 pages for free in the business center. The cost for Internet in the room depends on where your provider is located; if it is a local provider the connection fee is $1.00. Otherwise long-distance phone rates apply. We were able to use the business center for about 15 minutes to look up restaurant info, etc. The only negative for me: parking fees are high--$28 to self park for 24 hours and $34 to valet--but that is a city-wide issue in downtown Indy. The toilets in the rooms are also incredibly loud--similar to airplane or cruise ship toilets. The menu for the restaurant on the first floor looked amazing, but we didn't get the chance to try it this time. Definitely plan to next time--and this is a place we will be going back to again.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shorewood, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat location to Convention Center\u201d", "Author": "dlunz", "ReviewID": "UR123134339", "Content": "My family and I stayed here for two nights in January for JAMfest Super Nationals cheerleading competition at the Convention Center.

This was my third time staying at this hotel (in fact, only place I've stayed when in Indy). This was the location of the business meeting, as each past visit was, so I didn't choose the hotel myself. Mostly good points about this hotel. Great location, near to convention center, Lucas Oil field, downtown (you can walk nearly anywhere, including Conseco Fieldhouse). Location was great. Interior is nice, no complaints. They have a Starbucks in the lobby (yawn) and another restaurant that I ate lunch at but no dinners (lunches were pretty good, and I heard good things about the dinners there). Service was very good and very nice - typically midwestern. One really nice amenity is that there is a sports bar attached should you be there with a beer-drinking-after-the-meeting crowd (I always have been), which is good since you don't have to go far. And, it's super convenient to the convention center. Complimentary toiletries in bathroom - loved them! Citrusy, really nice. Good HD TV, and nice work desk (is this a place that caters to business crowd?). Great service, friendly staff. So, mostly good. The bad? My god, paying for internet!!!! $12.95 /day or so. When will hotels get over this? Wait, did I previously presume this place caters to business crowd? Why not charge for cable TV, and go back to the days of paying for phone calls? If providing a system for us to use is that big a deal, wrap it into the room cost and we'll all be happy. Note to Marriott and other hotel chains also still clinging to this past practice: we all use internet in our rooms. It's not that big a deal! Charge us a bit extra if you have to, just don't rub my nose in it by making me pay extra. Also, room soundproofing is average at best, but can't blame the hotel on a wingnut arguing with his wife on the phone while others should be sleeping (like, after midnight). The bath towels were strangely thin and coarse - don't recall them like this in other Marriott properties, but I'm a Hilton man usually (nice towels). They were thin, coarse, and not pleasant. Would I stay here again? Heck yeah, if it was a business meeting. If I was choosing the location, maybe, maybe not. Would depend if something that appeared better was available. BTW - I was there during an exceptional heat wave. Nice to find out the pool was closed - no sign, no mention at front desk, nothing at all. Thanks. No idea why it was closed. If it was to upgrade, maybe they should let current guests in on it. Also, what if that was a selling point in my reservation? Any return, rebate, etc.? And Marriott should not be happy with that blue glass monstrosity they erected in JW Marriott. I can't imagine a place more out of character with Indy than that place. Isn't there a city planning board????? How did that place get passed? (you want character? check out Crowne Plaza at Union Station - wow!!). I was not impressed with that blue glass monolith - kept thinking of \"2001 - a Space Oddessey\". Wanted to grunt like a monkey and go up and touch it.

When we arrived we were greated by a smug young lady who told us that they gave our room away and put us in a double bed. I asked her if it was the same price and she said it is. I was upset and asked her why they would give our room away. She stated that there is \"no guaruntee\" of the room you get even by booking online.. Hello!? I asked to speak with the manager. He came out with the same smug atitude and told me the same story. We also had a coupon voucher for the room because of our family being an employee of the comapany. He would not allow us to use it either. I accepted the room because it was a Colts game weekend and everything was booked. He did give us a coupon for breakfast...After I countinued to complain but neither were very apologetic. We went to our room to find out that the Motel 8's rooms are just as nice. I paid $350.00 with tax for a room that looked like the Red Roof Inn PLUS parking! NEVER will be stay again...I will book my room at the OMNI Severin WAY in advance!!!

It took several minutes of sticking our key in the door and call to the Front Office Supervisor, to inform us of this. 2) Prior to arrival, we had asked for a room with extra towels and a hotel employee confirmed this request via email. To our surprise, our room did not have a single bath towel. It took two calls and a little over two hours to get some towels. Overall, this is a solid 3-star hotel.

The valets were great, one even walked my husband to the car when he forgot his cellphone charger in it. But yeah, $28?! Self-parking was full due to an event downtown at one of the stadiums. Every other garage in the area was full too due to the event (not sure what it was). It just kind of irritated me that the hotel wasn't full, but the parking garage was because non-guests can park in it and fill it up. Not cool. Essentially the only way out of the valet parking was to leave downtown for dinner and come back later after the event goers had left downtown. Didn't want to bother. There were quite a few people milling around the lobby the whole time. But I've noticed this quite often in downtown Indy.

The bell boys were nice and polite and generally the front of house was friendly too. We'd just found out that we were pregnant and they remembered, which was nice. However, what annoyed us was one particular concierge man who was condescending and patronising. We wanted to book the limo service from the hotel to the airport (costs 12 USD per person, which would have made it 24 USD for two of us; a taxi would cost between 23-27!). He spent about 5 minutes trying to dissuade us from asking him to book it (it's easier to get it from the front; it's faster to get to the airport). We explained to thim that our trip from airport to the hotel was diabolical (taxi seats felt like the springs had sprung for good, wipers were not working, air con not working, windows were down so got wet from rain!) and he asked where we were from and whether we had taxis where we lived?!! (what's that got to do with anything?!!). Another time, we wanted to rent a car and previously asked one of the concierges whether we had to pay to park in the hotel carpark. There were 3 of us together when we asked and the woman had said that it was free for hotel guests. We were real happy so on the day we rented the car, we approached this same condescending person and asked him for the pass to the car park and he said that we had to pay 21USD for the day. It wasn't the fact that we had to pay that got us, it was what he said when we told him that we had been misinformed. He said \"oh, maybe you asked whether you could park at the marriott courtyard?

The bar at Circle City has better drinks and better service unless they are really crowded \u2013 management does not seem to understand that more people means they need more servers, but the ones there work really hard to keep up. When it is not crowded the service at this bar is quick and friendly, especially Jen and Tyra. The rooms are standard for a nice hotel and are normally very clean. The bathrooms are small but nice with marble tops. There is adequate closet space. The beds are comfortable, but as of this writing only one floor has gone to the Marriott Beds. There is a TV inside an armoire (like most hotels) with an adequate number of channels \u2013 warning when you turn on the TV it comes on SO LOUD that you could hear the TV in the next room. And that leads to the real problem with this hotel \u2013 it is very noisy. You can hear outside noise, you can hear other guest open the doors, you can hear the elevators (main elevators clank, and the service elevators whir loudly), and you can even hear the sound of, well, urination from the next room (as well as people talking in a normal voice). Turn on your TV and bring ear plugs and you will be fine though. I have found the service to be mostly great. The are a lot of younger people working here, so you will find an isolated incident where the response is not appropriate, but overall they bend over backwards to make you happy. Matt, one of the managers is almost annoying in wanting to make sure you are satisfied. Ask and you will receive it if your request is at all reasonable. Pros: -Adjacent to the convention center -Walkway to the mall -Nice lobby -Good Service -Decent restaurants and bars -Clean rooms Cons: -Noisy -Sometimes overly crowded -Noisy -Did I mention it was noisy?", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westfield, IN", "Title": "\u201cNot So Good...\u201d", "Author": "sletohdarnoc7355", "ReviewID": "UR6850820", "Content": "I stayed between Feb. 25-27 and did not have a good stay. First, when we tried to check in at 4 (check in time), they said they ran out of room keys. So then we waited for 2 and a half hours for our rooms. The rooms are starting to show their wear and tear and could use a renovation. One day, I brought leftovers from another restaurant and needed a plastic fork. They told me I needed to buy food from room service if I wanted one. That is ridiculous. They are only \"At My Service\" if I pay for it; even though I paid $180-night in a standard room. I recommend upgrading to the concierege lounge-- it's a great value. However, don't stay here... go to Hilton, Conrad, Hyatt, or Embassy Suites.

The lobby is plush with marble floors and huge ceilings. The service was excellent, everyone was there to greet you and help you out any way they could, grabbing the doors as you entered the lobby and made sure every question was answered. The lobby offers wonderful strawberry water, lemon/lime water, shoe shine, great restaurant, sports bar, and many other nice things. Both my husband and I have stayed in hundreds of Marriotts all over the world and we would consider this to be almost a JW. We were on the 15th floor with a great view of the capitol and downtown. The rooms are average size and the bathroom is larger than most Marriotts. The only difference we saw in the room compared to others we have stayed in were the bed linens. The bed was very comfy but it did not have the updated linens with large pillows and fluffy down comforter. But the niceness of the hotel more than made up for it. We would highly recommend this hotel. It is a couple of blocks from all the great restaurants and shops. We walked to dinner and back with no problem.

This was my first trip to Indianapolis. I arrived to the hotel around midnight after a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport that set me back $25+tip. I had no problems at check in. Despite the hour, there were three Marriott staff behind the desk ready to assist us. This high level of staffing was evident throughout the entire weekend. In addition to the front desk and concierge, there were typically four or five staff members floating around the lobby during my entire stay, regardless of the hour. I\u2019m sure this is not typical. The five IRL show cars in the lobby were a nice touch. My room on the 8th floor was well appointed, but not overly spacious. The bathroom was large, but was lacking a vent fan. Be sure to leave the bathroom door open if you don\u2019t want to fog your mirrors. I didn\u2019t have washcloths in my room when I first arrived, but I didn\u2019t make a fuss out of it either. Washcloths were provided when room service cleaned the room on the next two days. Hot water was plentiful and the pressure was good, though the pressure varied slightly during two of my 3 showers. The shower head was adjustable so I\u2019m sure I could have resolved any pressure issue, if there was one. The television in my room was large (maybe 32\u201d) but had small traces of static on some channels. The beds were a little stiffer than my liking and by the third night I was looking forward to my pillow-top back home. I did enjoy the turn down service that was provided without request. It was a hot weekend and I tried to push the room\u2019s AC a little. I set it in the low sixties but it never quite got down there, hovering around seventy for my entire stay. The location of the hotel was good. Indianapolis has a very walkable downtown and the hotel is just a block or two away from a wide variety of restaurants and bars, and three or four blocks from several clubs. Just a short walk west of the hotel is some nice green space and some great paths for joggers, runners, and bikers. I didn\u2019t dine at any of the hotel\u2019s restaurants, but bellied up to the bar in Champions one afternoon for a few drinks. There was not a lot of selection on draft. The view from my room was to the east, and directly faced another hotel. Peering around to the south provided me with a view of the RCA dome. The Conseco Fieldhouse is a 10-15 minute walk to the east. Upon returning from the race on Sunday the hotel had a nicely displayed cookie display in the lobby, with a note saying \u201cThanks for visiting.\u201d I grabbed a few sugar cookies and headed over to a computer set up by the concierge to check in online for my flight out the following morning. The main page had direct links to all the airline website check-in pages. This was a nice service and worked flawlessly. A pre-5am checkout was no problem and there were multiple cabs at the stand available for the trip back to the airport. It was an enjoyable weekend and the good folks at the Marriott downtown really put their best foot forward.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, IN", "Title": "\u201cGood but not Great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4452660", "Content": "We have our guests stay at this hotel when they visit our business.

This place is big and if that makes you happy then great but it seemed there was wasted space and the hallways were long. It just didn't have that special luxury feel you get at the Radisson or Hyatt. The Hyatt is right next to the mall and offers so much more for about the same price.
