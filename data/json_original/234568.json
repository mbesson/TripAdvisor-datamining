The location of the hotel is perfect. On the Rambla, next to the Liceu metro station. You're halfway to the sea front and to the center at Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. Right next to the Barrio Gotico as well. Hotel is very simple, small rooms and small beds (twin beds) but just what you would expect from a 3* european hotel. The rooms and bathroom are clean though. The TV was not working all the time. I give it to you, you're not in Barcelona to watch TV in your room but when you want to put some background music or watch some news, it's annoying to constantly have a \"bad signal\" message and lose the picture. Now, the very negative point was the service, Worse customer service ever. The staff tried to rip us off twice. Once at check-in, because they cancelled the wrong room, they wanted, one of the person had to stay alone for one night in a twin room. Room charge was \u20ac150 and he paid \u20ac75 but the person at the desk asked for an extra \u20ac118 because of the single occupancy, because, you know, 75+118=150.... right? We argued about it, saying that it was their mistake if they cancelled the wrong room to start with. So they credited the money back. When I checked in the second day, my friends were out so I checked in and the front desk charged me \u20ac150 because \"the first person stayed in a twin room the first night, so I have to make up for the second half of the first night\". I was not too sure about it but paid it anyway, as all I wanted was to drop my bags and go out join my friends. When we returned, the person who made all the bookings complained again, saying that charging for the first night was not right, that they already tried to charge us for \u20ac118 more. Lots of arguments and discussions and eventually, they agreed to pay me back the \u20ac75. \u20ac150 for one night in a 3* hotel would have been indeed a bit steep. The staff did not care much about us complaining. We wanted a direct phone and email for the general manager and all they kept giving us was the general email address of the hotel, stating that \"this was the manager's private address\"...

On our arrival there was a fellow guest busily changing her room as the first was not to her liking. This didn't bode well but I was prepared to be open minded. We had booked a non-smoking room but weren't allocated one and discovered that the hotel was full so couldn't change rooms. The room was very small which I wasn't really too bothered about but it reeked of stale cigarette smoke. The bed was a very small double and the bedspread had several stains on it. They looked unpleasant. We found another bedspread in the cupboard which was clean so we changed it ourselves. The sheets had cigarette burns on them. To be fair, the hotel member of staff to whom we spoke about it was very apologetic but he was the only one who was pleasant throughout our stay. The other staff were indifferent to say the least. Although there was allegedly a bar (we always book a hotel with a bar) it was never open. There was no information in the room about the hotel so we didn't know what facilities were on offer. There was no instructions for anything. The bathroom was ok but very outdated and really needed to have been cleaned better. There were hairs in the bath - not ours! There were shampoos etc but the towels were old and thin and had definitely seen better days. One of our towels had a stain on which looked like mascara but we weren't sure. Our room was at the back of the hotel and looked out over a tree-lined street which was actually quite nice. I imagine a room on the Ramblas side of the hotel could get noisy. Ours was noisy from the sound of scraping of chairs on the wooden floor above. It went on until about 4 am. The plumbing system was also very noisy. If anyone in the next room flushed the lavatory or had a shower we heard the pipes filling for some 20 minutes and it was VERY loud. The restaurant doesn't appear to exist any more but there is a door from the hotel to the restaurant next door. We had breakfast there - once! It was terrible; the waiting staff were surly and the food was absolutely mediocre and very overpriced. It's a shame as this hotel is in a very good positiion and was probably once a very nice hotel. It needs updating and the staff need to learn something about the hospitality business. We're actually not given to complaining but felt we had to air our views about this hotel. Barcelona is a wonderful city and, if this hotel were up to standard, we would stay there again as the location is so good. We booked a standard double so mabe the superior doubles and suites are better but that doesn't alter the poor hotel facilities. On the whole it was a big let down and very over-priced.

Once locked in my room I discovered the pillows were filthy with eye makeup and hairs and I couldn't bring myself to check the rest of the sheets - ignorance is bliss and with an early meeting the next morning I couldn't afford a sleepless night. The bathroom was standard, the walls and floors paper thin so if you're not used to noise you will get NO sleep and the tv is Spanish only. When checking out the next morning I needed to leave my luggage and was told this was fine, despite my protests I was given no receipt for my bags which concerned me greatly. When I returned some hours later I found them lying in the reception where anyone could have taken them. Barcelona is a fantastic city and I am a frequent visitor, but please don't waste your time in this hotel or indeed in this area. There are some great deals on apartments and hotels in much nicer areas where you're less likely to get mugged. Las Ramblas is definitely somewhere to stop on your trip but take the bus/metro/walk but for heaven's sake don't stay here and certainly not in this hotel!!!", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LisaS069", "ReviewID": "UR19523008", "Content": "Like others that have written a review on this hotel. It has a fantastic location almonst halfway down on the main stretch of La Ramba which is fantastic. I was very relieved that our room was at the back of the hotel not facing the main street as it was the start of the semi finals and finals for the World Cup and I don't think we would have got much sleep. I would suggest that when you check in that you make sure you check things like the air con to ensure it works correctly and that the Trouser Press is not broken. Their website says that all rooms come with an iron but they definiately don't have these. We had to suffer 2 nights without aircon which was horrendous as it was so hot. Slept with the balcony doors open which was fine the first night as it kept us cool but only because there was a thunder storm that night. Trouble is the next night all the mossies came out so my partner got bitten alive - I must have been very lucky that night. We finally managed to get a different room on the Saturday night for the last 2 nights of our trip and slept soundly thank goodness. If you go to Barcelona I would always suggest going around March/April or very early May but not later than that as it gets too hot to walk around and see the sights without having to get into a shop to cool down with their air con! One of the best things we did whilst there was get a 2 day bus tour from the place de Catalunya and did all 3 routes to see all the sites - expensive but boy was it worth every penny! Would I go back to this hotel - probably not as like to stay in other hotels in various locations of Barcelona!", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location.\u201d", "Author": "SwissUK", "ReviewID": "UR15446136", "Content": "Hotel Flor Park is a modern, clean and stylish hotel (more of a travelodge really) situated in the absolute heart of Barcelona's lively La Ramblas district. The building itself is atractive and our room had a balcony which overlooked the stunning La Rambla strip. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the reception service was excellent and professional yet friendly too. The area is lively and noisey which is what you would expect staying in the heart of the city but the double glazing is so good you can't hear a thing with the windows closed. There is full air-con so overheating is not a problem. I would recommend this hotel to visitors who are wanting to be at the very centre of everything but if you wanted a more relaxing and luxurious hotel then perhaps look elsewhere.

The location of the hotel is fantastic, on La Rambla, across from the Gran Teatre de Liceu. The guy on reception (daytimes) was incredibly helpful - full of advice on where to go, where to shop etc. The room was quite big in comparison to rooms I've stayed in in Paris for example. It was also spotless with all the usual toiletries supplied and cleaned every day. Our room faced the front, overlooking La Rambla but, once the window was shut was very quiet.

The room was quite small but had a tv, safe, air conditioner, balcony facing the back, telephone and minibar. The bathroom was very spacious and the hotel provided toiletries, hairdryer and fresh towels everyday. The only thing is that the walls must be very thin as we could hear people talking in the middle of the night from across the hall.
