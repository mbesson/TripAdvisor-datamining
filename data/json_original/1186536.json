Step out of your door and you surrounded by restaurants amd pubs on all sides. the apartments are basic but clean.. They come with waching machines, burners, microwave. The only drawback abt these apartments was that the elevator stop at the middle landing of everyfloor so you either have to carry your bags half a flight of stairs up or down.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHighly disappointing and unacceptable\u201d", "Author": "auckland13", "ReviewID": "UR94314166", "Content": "I have stayed in the Apartments for a 1 month stay from 07th Dec to 10 Jan 2011. The pictures and descriptions do not do the property any justice. It is an awful place, badly managed, badly maintained and barely pass the test for fit for purpose. This is hospitality at its worst and a customer service attitude to go with it. There is a lack of basic facilities ie no drinking glasses, chipped crockery,equipment that does not work, albeit all IKEA, lights that do not work, a long and winding staircase, unkept communal areas, internet connection that does not work and hot water than only last for 3 minutes, which makes showering very limiting. The property is maintained by FriendlyRentals in Madrid and believe you me they are not at all very friendly when you confront them with an issue. There seems to be no standard in maintenance and nothing is maintained, serviced or prepared adequately. I strongly recommend not to use these apartments until they upgrade and refit out the apartments as I found out that the pictures on the internet is totally deceiving and inaccurate. I have complained about them to the Spanish Tourist Authority.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Apartamentos City Center Santa Ana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1186536-Reviews-Apartamentos_City_Center_Santa_Ana-Madrid.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cruz, 22</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1186536", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2b/5c/19/angolo-dell-appartamento.jpg"}}
