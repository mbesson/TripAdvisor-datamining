The place looks clean but the airconditioning was not working. The place felt like an oven. We had a double room. Then we decided to opened the window to cool down the place (since it is winter), we thought that opening the window will allow the cold evening air to cool down the room. A big mistake! The air outside smells of something burning. At first I thought the owner might be burning something in the inner court yard (at 10pm in the night) but after opening the window for half an hour, our room was filled with smoke. We had to shut the window and bear with the hot air conditioning through out the night. In the morning, the breakfast was horrible. A few slices of cold (really cold) bread and expired jam (the expiry date on the jam told us so), tea or coffee. No orange juice, no croissant, no nothing. I would strongly recommend not to stay in this place. For 90 euro, you can definitely get a room much much beter than this one. We moved to another hotel down the street and for the same price, we got a beautifully renovated room and full american breakfast.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR952259879", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ymlee"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d237520-r12559115-Boston-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "237520", "Price": "$107"}}
