The hotel is best described as a Chinese 4 Star, lots of marble, big spaces and absolutely no charm or service. The people recognise you need help but are in slow motion, perhaps because of hours worked.

Aside from the accessibility from the hospital, I did had a really nice time in this hotel. The receptionist upgraded my Superior booking to \"Premier\" room. I was in shock to see how big and chic this room is. There are 2 king size beds in the room, so for a start, this room can sleep even 6-8 people (officially only allow 4). The bed is so cozy, that I slept like a baby. They have a walk in closet and 2 wash basins in the bathroom. And here's why I love the interior of the room: the panelling on the wall is quilted (fake) leather that looks really modern, the carpet is fluffy, polka dot lace curtain, modern looking lounge chairs, and to such small detail in the interior like sleek black lamp. I would advise to not go for the breakfast though, it's just terrible and not much choice either. So you'd rather order a room service, which is cheaper. As for service, well, there was no doormen most of the time, the receptionist and front desk are nowhere to be found at night (also lacking out of smiles at night), concierge not very helpful and seems to be unwilling to help.

Check in went smoothly and the folks were friendly and efficient. Concierge was awesome, checking baggage, arranging taxis, etc. There was a fairly constant supply of taxis outside the hotel but not all the time. Sometimes I walked down to Mt Elizabeth Hospital to catch a taxi there. The Superior room was quite small but clean. The only thing lacking was the bath tub. It was very small, cracked and marked tile around it, and stained. Everything else was very good. We had a queen bed in the room and we had just enough room to walk around it; however there was a sitting couch that could have worked for a second bed (for a small person) so that took up some room. The Family suite was *huge*! Here the bathtub was much bigger, we had one king bed and two fulls that we pushed together. We had 3 children and 2 adults in the room and never felt like we were cramped. I would highly recommend the suite for a family. There was no room division so you have to go to the sleep the same time as the kids, or hang out in the bathroom. It did have a walk in closet, which was enough to stack our 5 suitcases in. Room service was good; food was hot and good (but not great). Skip breakfast! Very expensive, limited Western menu and the food was mediocre tending towards lacking. The staff was nice, but it was S$75 for 1 adult/1child. The walk up to the hotel from Orchard should be a consideration if you have *any* walking issues; limp, sprain, winded easily. The sidewalk is uneven in a few spots, it is a 30% grade -going up hill after a few hours of shopping/walking is notable. You can take a taxi from Paragon (mall at Mt Elizabeth and Orchard) up to the hotel but because of one way streets, it isn't a direct drive. Maybe S$4 - 5 because of the pick up charge (S$3.50). There is a Pizza Hut in Lucky Plaza that is awesome (but doesn't deliver to York) and a McDonalds a little further down; for those of us who's children eat at those places.

After we booked it through our travel agent, I started to become a bit concerned when reading some of the reviews on here. But, it was already booked and paid for, so I just had to hope for the best. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. We were given one of the larger rooms (tip : the rooms on the corner on the floors are bigger - we had room 623), which was nice given the fact that I had to live in one room with my husband and two boys for 12 nights...lol. I agreed with other reviewers that the service is a bit lacking when it comes to the front desk etc, but I believe you do get what you pay for here. The 24 hours room service was very speedy and the menu quite extensive. Orchard Road was an easy walk, with the MRT a couple of minutes further. We stayed at the Novotel Clarke Quay the last time we were in Singapore, and I much preferred the York's location to that of the Novotel.

A couple of deficiencies in our room (safe not working and the drying line over the bath non-functional) were dealt with very promptly. A similar helpfulness was experienced in the restaurant. Here I sometimes wanted a light meal and a request for an omelette (not on the menu) was willingly granted on more than one occasion. Our room (315) was of reasonable size for the grade of hotel, although due for a face-lift around the bath. Housekeeping kept the room very clean. Room 315 is, however, immediately opposite the lifts and we were disturbed one night by a noisy group returning very late (or early in the morning). One area of improvement would be to replace the stained carpet in the communal area outside the lifts - that would give a better initial impression of the hotel.

Orchard road hotels should be better looking. the room had large window but as we were in 4th floor so the view was limited. The children pool was extremely small. Rate was reasonable keeping in mind of other hotels in Orchard road, otherwise the price would be high. On teh day of checkout I asked them for late checkout and they told me that 2 PM is OK. But when I wanted to open the room door at 1PM, the card would not work, meaning they did not update their system. I had to ask the housekeeping to open the door. It was awkward.

Third time, I was told that check in time was at 2 pm.

Eventually was told by another staff that the hotel was fully booked (that was after they checked out a large group of people 15 minutes ago) and she would try to find me a room but if she couldn't find me a room, I would have to wait until 2 pm. After flying for 12 hours with barely enough sleep that wasn't good enough. She did find me a room but I was told they were still cleaning it and told me to wait for one hour. On checking out and asking the reception staff (different one) if they could call the airport shuttle, was told that they do not provide airport shuttle and there is only the taxi. I arrived on the airport shuttle the day I checked in so I knew that the shuttle provides drop off and pick up services. When I told the staff about this, was informed that he doesn't know anything about it and to just talk to the concierge. I don't know where the hotel gets its reception staff but they are the most ill-informed, ill-mannered staff I have encountered.

The photos previously posted here are quite old because the hotel has been completely refurbished - the rooms still smell of fresh paint. (I will update with pics later). We paid $194 AU per night which is quite high because our stay landed during some trade convention. Either way accomodation in Singapore is very expensive for Asia. For this price I was tossing up between this hotel and Rendezvous and this hotel was much closer to shopping. Positives - Very clean newly refurbished rooms and hotel overall. I believe they are doing floor by floor and noticed that the lower floors still had old carpet in the foyers when we looked out of the lift but not sure about the rooms. They had notices that there was refurbishments going on during business hours but we didnt hear anything much. We heard more from the building of the Quincy hotel next door but didnt spend much time in the room to care. - Location: 5min walk to Orchard Rd/Scotts Rd and Orchard Rd MRT(- Near a large hospital if you need medical attention Negatives - Internet access was $SG 2 for 15min, there were 2 computers in the lobby open 24hrs however you couldnt top up until it ran out and there were no warnings so i noticed every single person would get cut halfway through browsing etc and would have to put $2 in just to log out of their email accounts, msn etc. - Lifts were very slow - Pool and Jacuzzi showing its age, needs to be refurbed to match hotel - Bought a small Evian water 400mls from the hotel cafe for $6?! - The steep incline from Scotts Rd - which we didnt notice until the 3rd day of non-stop shopping and our legs were tired so please take this into consideration if you are less mobile i.e. i think it would be hard for older ppl walking up that hill during the hotter part of the day or if you were carrying young toddlers. I would stay here if you are on a budget but still want to be walking distance to Orchard Rd. I would definitely pick this over the Elizabeth even though the Elizabeth looks closer.

The rooms are clean and spacious. We stayed in the tower suites which have been renovated. 2 adults and 2 children in the room fitted comfortably. 1 boy had the sofa bed pulled out of a night and the other had a proper bed, not one of those little fold away beds. The cabana rooms and fitness centre had just finished being renovated when we left. i didnt see the motel rooms though. The pool area is fairly standard and has a childrens pool as well. A lovely man at the bar checks regularly if you would like drinks or snacks. Did not have room service during our stay. TV was fine but some channels recption was not the best. Housekeeping were helpful with any requests for towels soap etc. Our boys loved Omar at the door and he always had a friendly word and smile. The reception staff are plain rude and unhelpful. There was a mix up as we had paid for breakfast AND it was on our itenary but the reception had only a room booked and no breakfast. I spoke to nearly every recption staff member and manager with not an ounce of help. On the fifth day I then rang the travel agent myself, it was quickly rectified that day. This was very frustrating and the reception staff could have fixed it all very quickly if they had of contacted my travel agent directly as I had requested. Breakfast itself was a buffet with a good variety and well stocked. It was part of our package and we had a great deal but if you have to pay the regular price go to any of the food places close by. It is not a long walk to Orchard road. 5-10mins. Go through the goodwood park carpark ( at the back of orchard hotel) this will take you to scotts road turn left and you walk down to orchard road. We found taxis cheap and convenient. The MRT was clean and fast but for price and convenience we used taxis for the four of us. I would not stay here if I had to pay the full price but for the great deal we got (7 nights for the price of 3 with breakfast)it was fine.

We arrived at this hotel around 9am and when we arrived at the check-in (there were lots of customers lined up at the receptionist area), the Indian lady was telling us that check in time was 12 pm, so she just wrote down our room number in a tiny piece of paper and asked us to come back at 12 and she then said \"NEXT\" towards other customers (how rude). As I asked her whether I could get into my room right now, she replied \"NO MAM, ur room is being cleaned\". And she told me again to come back at 12 and \"NEXT\" to the other customer. Meanwhile, I watched other customers (served by other receptionists) that were alloved to check in and were getting into the elevator going to their rooms. I was so mad, as u can imagine, I was having the earliest flight (flight departing at 6, meaning we woke up at 4am going to the airport), plus with an infant that was waken up at 4am....Then, I asked the concierge people (for my baggages) and asked him why I could not get my room and other people could have their room ready, and the concierge guy just smiled and told me to line up again and to get other receptionist. I lined up again at the receptionist section, and this time purposely lined up to be served by other receptionist. This time I got lucky, I was served by the MANAGER. I told her my story, and I told her why I was not let into my room, while there were lots of people who were able to be checked in and to go to their rooms. She apologized and told me that she would have a talk to the lady, and rightaway she gave me another room. She called the housekeeping to make sure that my room was ready and cleaned and to send another rollaway bed. Once I arrived at my room, the phone was ringing, and the manager asked me if everthing was fine now. I told her that everything was fine, and I thanked her and I told her that I would be writing some comments about my experience in this hotel. The room itself is okay, clean and neat. It is small, but it is bearable, the bathroom is tidy and clean. The housekeeping lady was very nice, once she made up the rollaway bed, rightaway she gave us more towels as she realized that there were 3 adults in the room with an infant.
