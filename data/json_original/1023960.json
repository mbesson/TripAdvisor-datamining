We were in connecting rooms and our room is much bigger than other typical hotel rooms in HongKong. So bad that I don't have much photos of it but all I can remember is that the location of Newton Place in Kowloon is quite far from the MongKok area which is the center of HongKong. We hardly find restaurants during late nights unlike in the Metropark and area. I guess, the hotel is near the residential area, that's why. We were not able to explore it since we are included in the tour group. When you are getting tour packages, I suggest that you ask your operator to confirm your hotel. We were advised to stay at Panda Hotel but for some reason, we were thrown in Newton Place as soon as we arrived in HongKong.

There are plenty of Chinese restaurants in the area, but for other cuisines, you have to goto the malls. o) some of the facilities are: hot-water, e-safe, internet (LAN), refrigerator, laundry, restaurant (not presently@2010), 24hrs desk, cable. o) Its mostly taken up by visitor groups (40+ ppl), and is crowded from Jan-Jun. I dont like that part. o) I would nt call is value for money, coz it depends, how much you got it for, I guess a standard double bed room for $600 HKD is a nice deal, but if you pay more than $900 HKD, for it, its not worth it.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Constant Traveller", "Title": "\u201cA Decent, Business-Oriented Hotel without the Frills\u201d", "Author": "PilotMike2009", "ReviewID": "UR59704294", "Content": "The Newton Place Hotel, 165 Wai Yip St, Kwun Tong, Hong Kong is off the beaten track. It's not anywhere near places you will want to go shopping, dine, or visit for cultural purposes. Which, to my mind, makes it the perfect business hotel. All the riff-raff can jam themselves in to Central or Kowloon, while I'll be saving money and being productive far away from the maddening crowds. The hotel is a medium-sized facility, probably 25-stories, adjacent to the old Hong Kong airport. It's three blocks from the MRT station, three blocks from the giant Millenium Center office complex, four blocks from the massive APM shopping center, and one block from McDonald's, if you like slumming. But in the general area there is nothing to see and little to do, so budget extra taxi fares or schedule for some MRT time. But once in the hotel, things work fine. The rooms are smallish and spartan, but certainly clean enough and well-equipped. The view of the harbor is excellent, so be sure to request a water-front view. The bathrooms are small but perfectly servicable. Every room has a desk and free internet. All in all, everything the typical road warrior needs but a full \"business center.\" Service in the hotel is diffident, at best. English is clearly a third or fourth language. Most of the hotel visitors are Asian tourists. The hotel restaurant only serves Asia food, and while it's tasty it's over-priced comparatively. So, hey, it's not the Carlyle. The price isn't either. My room was US$90 a night, which is very fair for a modern, clean hotel in Hong Kong. I have only two complaints, and they're minor. First, the hotel lobby is large and spacious. In fact, too spacious. There's absolutely no place to sit, talk, or wait for your visitors to arrive. It's just a big empty hall that needs a bit of warmth and comfort added. Secondly, breakfast is awful. Do not pay the HK$89 to eat breakfast at the hotel, it simply is inedible. Instead, pop outside of the hotel, walk one or two blocks and enjoy any of the local restaurants with picture-pointing menus, and get decent local food for 1/8th the price. Or walk three blocks to Starbucks, visit my lovely friend \"Shan\" who works there most mornings, and get yourself a very respectable java jolt.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cquite nice\u201d", "Author": "Billbob01", "ReviewID": "UR53147387", "Content": "While on a tour, we stayed here.

This time, due to time restraints, the only available hotel that we were able to book is in the Kwun Tong district. Yes, the Newton Place Hotel is just over a year old...nice facilities for a 3-star hotel but the location is not convenient for tourists. I would not recommend this hotel for those travelling with kids and for those who intend to visit HK for shopping. The hotel is in an industrialized are and is quite far from \"civilization\". We had to walk 15 minutes from the hotel to the nearest MTR station in Millenium City. If you will go out on a day of sight seeing and shopping, you will definitely feel drained if you are to take the MTR and walk all the way to the hotel. Taxi is good but you will have to bear slight traffic and longer travel time plus it's more expensive. The hotel offers a free coach service to Harbour City but then you have to wait for it to be available since they dont have specific schedule for the free ride. Note that we don't mind walking, in fact, we find it a good form of exercise but the daily to and fro walk from the hotel will really put a strain on any active traveller. Should i go back to HK, i will take my time and plan carefully so I could get booking in the area of Tsim Sha Tsui, Mongkok, Jordan or even hotels on the other side of HK Island would be preferable and convenient.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kaiii", "ReviewID": "UR15534776", "Content": "My family stayed there for 3 nites and it was fun.
