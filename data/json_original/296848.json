The staff were quite rude and did not really assist when asking for simple directions. We did not even attempt to eat there due to other people staying there advised us not to.

Our room was a disgrace, the floors were dirty, bed sheets were stained and had holes in aswell as the curtains, dust covered pretty much the whole room especially on the bed when pulling the bedsheets back, wallpaper was hanging off in numerous places, several cracks in the ceiling, furniture was dirty, extra sheets and pillows in the wardrobe which was filthy and very very smelly and musty, the bathroom was falling apart, toilet seat was broken, shower head was coming off the wall and when having a shower it flooded the bathroom which then leaked into the bedroom our solution was to build a dam using the towels provided (which were also stained with black marks and even what looked like blood on one). The staff wasnt very friendly or helpfull as when i went to tell them about the flooding shower the man behind the desk simply said, \"theres nothing i can do\"! Breakfast was abismal, there was a choice of, toast in a packet, bread rolls and croissants with what i hope was icing or something on top, there was a juice machine and that was it. The glasses used for the juice were filthy. The breakfast area stunk of cigarettes as they stood behind the other side of the desk and smoked. Me and my wife stayed out as late as we could so we could spend minimum time possible in the hotel (literally to sleep).

The beds were just metal frames with a spring and wire configuration, but my bed had several springs missing and string had been used to replace them (leaving a big lop-sided sag in the bed); eventually we managed to solve most of our bed issues by using cable-ties. The room was air-conditioned but it was centrally controlled and turned on only in the afternoon/evening for a few hours. The room was also very smokey smelling and we couldn't open the windows due to being right on the main square with emergency vehicles, busses and trucks passing at all hours (v.noisey).

We were therefor required to use the shared shower (a room with the shower head placed in front of the toilet and a sink; don't forget to move the loo paper!). The shower and toilet never seemed particularly clean and were on the other side of the floor from the rooms without bathrooms (rooms 34, 35 and 36 on our floor; according to the fire exit map). As mentioned in another review the maids were up bright and early chatting loudly. However, after our cable-tie rigging of our bed they did make it up as a double.

Breakfast was served in a formally set dining room by a strange little indian man (reminded me of Manuel from Faulty Towers; friendly but odd).
