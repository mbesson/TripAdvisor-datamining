It has improved so much. It is much cleaner and nice and updated. It still has a historical building feel but with flat screen TV's and updated furnishings and a comfortable bed I was very happy. The staff was very accommodating and allowed me to check out late for a small fee. For rooms around $100 in an area where the price is $500 I say it's definitely a great choice.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cYou have to ask for the Good Room.\u201d", "Author": "Kim c", "ReviewID": "UR119232863", "Content": "Yes it is older and interesting.

I had heard about this place and realized it is in an \"interesting\" neighborhood but would try it anyway. Never saw a roach, never saw a bed bug. Never bitten by anything. No mice. No Nothing. Maybe it was a different room. When I first found this place online I decided to ask the staff. They told me there were problems with one or two rooms but those were fixed. The sheets were clean, the rooms were about as good as could be for what the place is. They were even painting the front entrance. Look at some of the reviews. YEARS ago. Would I stay there again?

I can't believe it still exists. I have travelled in 3rd world countries with bare lightbulbs and hole-in-floor toilets but they were better than this place!! I saw cockroaches everywhere- int the refrig, bathroom floor and walls, in the bed, one ran across my face!!! I sat up all night with the light on to try to keep them away and still remember the absurd choices on TV with porn activitiess that I have never seen in my life! (clowns, animals- you name it). It was a hell hole. The front desk said that they would fog for the roaches if I wanted, but then where were we supposed to sleep? You can't inhale that stuff. I agree about the very bizarre neighbors. If you stayed here, you would remember and regret it for the rest of your life.

And him and i are on a budget and i needed someplace to sleep that i wouldnt be broke from. So we chose Senton. Yeah the Sheets were stained but at least the toilet worked and there was a refridgerator that we were able to put some water in. But the only bad thing was that you only can pay in Cash no cred cards or anything, and i loove how they told me that over the phone, NOT!. But the worst was the mouse that was in our room and freaked me out and couldn't sleep because of it uggh. I dont think i will stay here again but it sure is cheap and convienently located near all the happening spots.

It was my first time to New York, I stayed at the Broadway Plaza the first 3 nights but also paid the price. So my husband and I thought for our last night we would switch hotels and stay at something less expensive. Boy was that a mistake!!! We walked in to the lobby and i swear i heard that eerie horror music start to play in the background. My husband assured me it would be okay so we proceeded on to our \"hotel suite\". We walked in the creaking door and there were about 50 smoked cigarettes in the ass tray an unmade bed with cruppled, stained sheets. Luckily a maid was on her way to clean up. So we left to get the necesities- candle and air freshener (to cover the smell), a blanket,shouldve got our own cleaning spray... what a nightmare... anyway...we didnt even stay in the room we left out to get the hell out. when we did come back i needed to use the restroom- klinda embarrsing but i clogged the toliet and no one came to fix it the toliet water flowed out like a waterfall---they Offered us MORE TOWELS....?? we put towels down in the shower and on the floor and i took a \"shower\" in the sink and my husband with the shower curtain open because the back of the shower had a nasty greenish brown mold growing on it. My husband used the rest room and swore he say [--] on the wall but didnt tell me because he knew it would freak me out. we covered the bed and while sitting on the bed i noticed RAT/COCKROACH/whatever else poison in the bag next to the bed and almost fainted but somehow we finally fell asleep to some hardcore porn playing in the room next to us. We slept in our clothes. I used my t-shirt to cover my body up, never took off my shoes...god it was a nightmare...WE WILL NEVER GO BACK and hope that you don't either!", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cDon't go in this hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "Elizabet", "ReviewID": "UR8462753", "Content": "I was in this hotel in July 2007.

I have been there with my boyfriend, because every others hotell didn't have room so we didn't have any choise. Its deffinitly The most disgusting and creepy place imaginable. As many wrote, they only tell you a truth. You can only imagine the worst place that I have been. I must say that in lobby is in one day 5 person who has worked. And the bad was clean, thanks God. In whole rum it was plastic bag with some poison against insects or who knows what. Above our rum in bathroom the pipe is broken and the waste water ran into our bathroom. The poor is on TV all day, and some sound from others rum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a place to be many days, not even a day. This is deffinitly the most frightening experience in my life. I sleept with woollen stocking , I hade my shoos all time on me. But I must say thay hade a clean towel. And thats somthing. But if you need to sleap over ther, just don't look reality.
