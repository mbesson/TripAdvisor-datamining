But as I regularly visit my relatives, I chose it because it's very close to their place. The hotel is very nice, the team always kind. For a 2star hotel, you could not ask for more. The rooms are nice, but quite small. I've been to 4 or 5star hotels with less amenities in the room/bath room! Really very generous! The parking lot is totally convenient and the breakfast is what you can expect from a 2star in this price range. Unfortunately, the rooms are very noisy. You hear EVERY step outside, you hear doors, you hear showers, you hear eveything. I always ask for a room in the upper floors but they always manage to have only one in the first floor available. Big plus: Free Wireless Internet! All in all, a nice hotel certainly worth more than its 2star! I'll be back very soon. A double room usually costs around 110-120 Euros, breakfast included.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Arco di Travertino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529340-Reviews-Arco_di_Travertino-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$73 - $132*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Valgia Silvilla 71</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00181</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529340", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/36/b9/36b97b3bf995b6d60e7f659ba293b7724large.jpg"}}
