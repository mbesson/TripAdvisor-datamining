Last year, my sister-in-law stayed there and had a great time so we decided to go with friends and family for Christmas. The rooms are spacious, supposedly for 2/3 people, but we were 4 and the space was just fine (1 double bed, 1 sofa bed and an extra mattress). It even has a big walk-in closet, great to leave the luggage, a large bathroom and a fully-equipped kitchen. Remember this is not a hotel, you have cleaning service for free one time during your stay, and you can pay extra for additional cleaning services. Also you have to exchange your towels on the lobby. The condo is going through some renovations, it is not 100% modern, but it is very nice overall. The pool is great, and there is a restaurant in the hotel with excellent prices. The beach is not the nicest around, but you can always walk a bit. Location is also good, although it is not located in South Beach it is very near both Miami Beach and Bal Halbour.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Costa Galana Hotel & Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d1637057-Reviews-Costa_Galana_Hotel_Suites-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5445 Collins Ave</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Miami Beach</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1637057", "ImgURL": ""}}
