Any staff we spoke to were pleasant, and the room was nicely cleaned and decorated (not our normal taste, but lavish style in keeping with the hotel's theme and fun for a change), with chocolates delivered in the early evening. Yes, we heard some low-level city noise, but, well, it's in the middle of the city, so....no trouble for us. No view from our room, but we were out too much to worry about that. Big perk: We arrived early in the day and were allowed early check-in by helpful front desk / concierge--- much appreciated (and not expected)! We did not use room service, but the prices seemed quite reasonable. We saw some guests enjoying an afternoon tea complete with harpist. I was originally not going to recommend this hotel because of the $15 daily resort fees. I am not clear what these fees paid for, exactly.... We were told this covered things like the spa, coffee, wifi, etc.--- yet most of these are normally included in the regular daily rate of hotels 2 star and up (in my experience). I didn't see a particularly luxurious spa area (correct me if I am wrong...) that could justify the fee. Coffee in room was barely passable with normal artificial creamers, etc., although herbal tea was nice touch. It would be better, in my opinion, just to inflate the daily rate so guests were clear from the onset what they were paying per day. Alternatively, the hotel could add more to justify this fee. (I'm not certain if this resort fee applies to all hotel guests or just those who had reduced rates - we booked through Hotwire..) We likely would not return as we do like a pool/jacuzzi area, and I don't understand what the $15 fee per day pays for. It reads as a bit of a cash grab...

I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here. It's actually a pretty good hotel. You have to understand the decor is just.. well... tacky, and European, looks like my Grandmother's house haha. Even if they drastically updated, it would still be ugly, it is just the style. It actually seemed fairly updated to me, they had iPhone clock radios and flat screen TV's. It had everything I would expect in a 4 star hotel. It's kind of like it just irked me.. I would rather the clean, plain stylings of a normal hotel. After I won the room I called to see if I could get 2 beds, because we had 3 guests. The gentleman on the phone said Priceline rooms were only King rooms, so I was a little frustrated but he said if there are any double rooms available we could probably have one (if not we could pay $20 for a rollaway). So, at check in not only did we get 2 double beds on the 15th floor, but an amazing view of downtown! The room was clean, again it's just tacky. I kinda liked having the old fashioned \"electronic key\" that looked like a key! The room was very large so was the bathroom and vanity. My only major complaint with this hotel was the fees. I honestly felt nickel-and-dimed. I paid $32 to park, then a $15 resort fee when I didn't utilize any \"resort\" services (and there was no water bottles in our room till they came and turned down our beds), we barely used the internet (and would have done without it had it not been \"free\"), didn't use the gym or anything. Then I thought I might have to pay for the rollaway on top of everything. The fees ended up being more than 1/2 what I actually paid for the room. I guess that is what you get in Downtown. But it was frustrating since we were on a budget. Overall a good stay. The staff was friendly.

I got this hotel through Priceline, otherwise I never would have chosen to stay here. This is the most inaccessible hotel that I have ever stayed at. We arrived by car and circled the hotel looking for the non existent circular drive and entrance. Needless to say, there was none. There were several cars stopped at the main street entrance (and no valet or or concierge in sight) so we had to stop the car a bit further from the hotel to unload our luggage. Then we had to look for parking. On the night that we arrived, there was a wedding at the hotel so we had to drive around several times to find a parking space. Hotel parking is costly at $32 (not the most expensive parking that I have ever paid), but there is street parking -- IF you can find a spot, and IF you are comfortable walking back to the hotel on sidewalks that are occupied by the homeless. On top of that, the hotel charges a $15 resort fee for conveniences that are offered for free in many hotels such as Internet access and water. And there are only so many calls that I can make a day -- certainly not $15 worth. Now for the positives -- the room was clean and the front desk staff were very helpful. Some may describe the hotel as classic and charming -- I call it inconvenient and overpriced.

You will need to enter the foyer which lead to 2 guests room one on left and right. Our room has a king size bed (double bed costs $20 extra), large size room with sofas, chair and office desk. The sliding door to the juliet balcony is not a double pane, so a bit noisy. There are some stains on the carpet, but it was dry and no odor, just for 1 night, i didn't really care. the bed was ok, but the pillow was too soft for my taste. Our room has a tube TV not a flat screen TV. The bathroom was very interesting. Marble wall and floor, square tub, a nice shower with great water pressure. The hotel shampoo and soap were nice and very flowery. We opt out the turndown service by placing the privacy card outside our door. Yes, there is a $15 + tax = $16.88, charge per day for internet, bottle water and gym. We park our car on the street so we did not have to pay extra $32 for valet.

Naturally, we are quite specific when making reservations in that we require a fully accessible ADA room with roll in shower. When we arrived, they had put us in a regular room.

The executive suite was not ADA, but was roomy, and as we were there for just one night, we felt this was a reasonable accommodation, and at least reflected some concern on behalf of the staff.

In the suite, the jacuzzi tub and shower were great. Decor was traditional, but tastefully done.

I attended a two-day class at the hotel... the elevator commute was fantastic!! I booked an early flight from Denver to San Diego with the intention of spending the day in LA. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am and I requested an early check-in. The woman at the front desk was most accommodating and checked us in right away. I'm an Expedia Elite Plus member and this was already noted in my hotel record; so, we received a room upgrade to the 11th floor (Rm #1188). The room is situated along 3rd Avenue facing The U.S. Grant Hotel; an OK city view with one king bed. I don't find San Diego to have a spectacular city view, so a bay view room may be better (it was not available). The room was quiet at night, not much street noise; basically because we were on a higher floor. The light beaming through the sides and bottom of the door to the room wasn't too distracting. It served as a night light of sorts to help navigate my way to the bathroom. (^_^) Maid service was good, as it should be... our class broke for lunch at 11:15 and when I returned to our room on both days, the room and bathroom were spotless. The only thing that was a bit disconcerting (as mentioned by a previous reviewer), is that the maid will knock, then immediately start to open the door. This happened during the day and again at night. One night, around 9:30 PM , the maid knocked on the door to inquire if we liked our turn-down service. Uh, yes... thank you... good night!! The other thing that didn't make sense was having the Afternoon Tea right in the middle of the main entrance lobby of the hotel... As I was heading to the Business Center from the elevator, I had to negotiate tables which was a bit distracting to the diners to say the least. And I had to move through the tables again to leave the Business Center and exit through the front door. Not a well thought-out plan for the flow of traffic for both dining guests or hotel guests. Although I was prepared for the $32/night valet parking and the $15/day resort fees; the parking fee is still pretty exorbitant. I know the GM will say that is standard for San Diego; however, I would expect the valets then to be present 24 hours a day. On Thursday night after returning from dinner, a valet was not outside, so my husband actually parked the car himself (which surprised the valets in the lower level [LL] of the hotel when he pulled in)!! After that, we just parked the car in the LL ourselves. I liked the convenience of printing our boarding passes from the Business Center. The copies go to a printer at the Front Desk, then are delivered to your room. Instead of waiting, I went right to the Front Desk to pick the copies up myself. The hotel is right across from Horton Plaza (the mall hasn't changed much since 1999) and within walking distance of several restaurants in the Gaslamp District. Dinner suggestions: Gladstone's (PCH1 and Sunset Blvd), Vigilucci's La Jolla, and Cafe Sevilla in the Gas Lamp District.

Traveled with 2 young kids. Priceline booking-great rate ($90) just before Comic-Con. Amazing location. Be ready for extra $15++ for 'facilities fee' and don't complain - be prepared for it. But, for a large city, downtown hotel, wired & wireless plus water plus newspaper - the amount is not bad when you are paying a low room rate - many hotels charge this for just Internet. Also, if you have a car, expect to pay $30+ per night. However, many ways around it with minimal hassle. I used street parking the entire visit and spent less than $15 for a five day visit (incl weekend). The decor is truly Europe. Very tastefully done, would not decorate my home that way, but very nice. Rooms were very large, great bathroom with good shower/sink pressure, counter space, closet space, drawer space. Booked on Priceline since Comic-Con made room availability very sparse (and expensive). Got a great rate. After booking, I called hotel directly and placed a request for high floor and double beds, and informed we'd be arriving early and requested an early check-in.Front desk did not promise anything, but included the details as a request and mentioned nothing about extra fees. We checked in on a Friday. Arrived at 11:00am. Was promptly informed the room was not available and a double bed was not a high probability. Stated the contracted room via Priceline is a King Bed only. We traveled to San Diego mainly for the kids. We were busy almost the entire day leaving early and returning after dinner time. So, \"staying\" in the room was not our plan. We knew there was no pool (big negative), but we would not have had time to use it if there had been one. So, keep this in mind for this entire review. We jetted off with good recommendations from the lovely Indian concierge woman (already forgot her name - sorry). We returned to the hotel after 4 PM and the room was ready. The Front Desk CAME THROUGH BIG TIME!! Gave us a room on the 16th floor - not facing much of a view, but no problem. Gave us a room with 2 double beds. Made it a point to inform we with a Priceline booking, the hotel was not obliged to give this type of room without any extra fees. We did not argue and we did not 'fight' for this when we checked in. We were calm and accommodating, and I think this helped tremendously. I parked on the street with a coin operated meter for 2-hr parking. Once Fri at 6 PM hit, parking was free until 8 am. Returned at 8 AM to add coins until we were ready to leave for the day's activities. Street parking is all around (best is off 3rd near A, or B, or Ash streets). Pay no attention to the many homeless who line the streets starting around 7 or 8PM. They were not aggressive in any way, nor loud, nor beggars. The car was parked in street parking the entire stay and never had any problem with damage of any kind. Be sure to read all meter signs for times and days and restrictions. Have lots of quarters ready or visit the 7-Eleven or Front desk to get your change. Yes - an added 'hassle', but to avoid any downtown hotel $30+/day parking, it was well worth the effort. Parking was never more than a 2 to 4 short blocks walk from the hotel (often with less time than the valet to bring it out front). Once Saturday at 6 PM hits, no parking meter fees required until Monday at 8 AM. Add change in the AM and take off for the day, return after 6pm and no fees again. Negatives... * No pool * No real \"action\" inside the hotel (restaurant) * Concierge not 'full-time', sometimes would have to wait for front desk staff Positives... * Great Priceline rate * Great Granny Smith apples all day long * Great cookies in the evening (Choco-chip/ Macadamia Nut) * Great location (downtown/ Gaslamp) * Great housekeeping response * Turndown service dark chocolates :<) Must note** - anything we asked for, they delivered (extra towels, shampoo, water) and quickly and with a smile and with courtesy. Loved the proximity to almost everything (freeway close, Gaslamp Quarter restaurants/ bars galore, central to everything. San Diego is spread out, so no matter what/ where you do, you need to drive some distance - might as well be central. Close to airport. Rent your car from Enterprise (off airport location at W Palm St), use the airport Alamo Rent-a-Car shuttle and walk literally across the street to Enterprise - don't tell them how you got there. Then, use the \"We'll Pick you up service\" for the return ride to the airport. All in all, with many similar circumstances, would stay at Westgate again and recommend it. My wife - who was a huge pessimist before even getting to the hotel - was extremely pleased and wished we had been able to stay here for the entire duration (had Comic-Con not messed things up for us) - poor planning on our part.

Another poor review stated they charge you a fee if you loose a room key...this is false info, they don't charge anything for a lost room key! They do charge for parking separately, but so does every hotel in the entire area! It is not a surprise charge, if you don't have a car you pay nothing extra, if you have a car you pay to park. This is why it can't be included as a charge on hot-wire or others, not everyone needs parking. We did not get a chance to eat at the hotels restaurant, so can't comment on that. The Westgate Hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from all the restaurants & shopping. It is also right next door to the US Grant.

The hotel was nice enough, but they didn't replace the water in the room, the guests next door to us left dirty diapers all over the hallway, the bathroom was tiny and there were no drawers for clothes, there were several other charges and inconveniences that were not major but nonethless irritating.

Check in was smooth and due to me doing some research on fees at this hotel I wasnt too suprised about the addtional fees. 32.00 a day for parking and 15.00 a day as facilitie fee. Personally I think that they take advantage of the client charging such a high parking rate as well as the facilitie fee. Once you are checking in you do not have the option of declining these services so we are stuck paying an additional 94.00 for our stay after we already payed the travel agency for our room and taxes. The facilitie fee is supposed to cover the waters in your room,wi-fi, and something else I guess. We did not drink their nestle bottled waters or use the wi-fi so as far as im concerned it was an unnecesary charge. Why not charge if the services are used just like everyone else or raise the rates even more and keep it included. By the way we booked our rooms with priceline and did get a very good deal through the name your own price program (100.00 a night). The hotel itself is very old and could use some new carpet and plumbing maintenance. The beds are not very comforIable and the sheets are very rough. The rooms have plenty of space and have nice big windows. It was very clean and quiet. You couldn't ask for a better location. With all of that said I would never pay full price to stay at this hotel or even pay 100.00 a night to stay here again.

If you go in already knowing about the daily facility charge ($15per day) and valet ($32 per day), you will not be disappointed. We were very happy with our stay this past weekend. My friend and I had an early check in to the Westgate early this past Friday for a fun relaxing weekend in San Diego. ( I live in SD but was enjoying a Girls weekend sans kids)We wanted to get settle into the hotel before heading up to La Jolla for dinner and sightseeing and there was no problems with checking in at 11:45am. It was quick and easy with little wait. (just the way I like it!) The lobby was decorated in an old world European charm which we enjoyed. Although for others, it might not be their cup of tea. Our room was on the the 10th floor facing the harbor....really wished the NBC building was not in the way of the beautiful view. The room was very well appointed, spacious (probably b/c the double beds were full size instead of queen), with flat screen TV (which we didn't turn on with the exception when the maid turn it on for music during turndown--nice ambiance touch upon our return to our room.), water pressure was excellent---almost felt like getting a good massage which my girlfriend agreed), clean (most important to us), and simply decorated. We never once saw another guest on our floor which was nice and quiet. The noise level can be high from passerby in the gas lamp district. It didn't bother us as it just sound like white noise. However, it you have a lower level room, I can see that it might be disturbing. The facility charge included water bottles, wifi, and usage of the fitness center( which we used on one morning only--nice & standard). For a weekend pleasure trip where you have no need for the business center & wi-fi, the additional fee may add up. However, for the business traveler, it's convenient and an acceptable fee. In terms of location, it's very conveniently located. You can hop across the street and shop til you drop at Horton PLaza where there are plenty of eateries, movie theatre, CVS etc... You are only foot steps to the Gas Lamp Quarters, too. Valet service was very efficient---I usually telephone the reception desk for our car---and each time we arrived at the garage, our car was there waiting for us. It's definitely worth the $32. (although management should consider lowering the fee to $25) We had a brief tour of the Sunday Brunch and didn't have time to partake. However, we would love to come back to experience Sunday brunch in the future. It looked absolutely devine with everything plated so exquisitely. The chocolate fountain would be a sight of heaven for my 5 yo chocoholic daughter if she was there. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Westgate. It's not the Four Seasons Lanai' (where we were greeted daily by all staff by our surname) by any means but satisfactory for Downtown San Diego.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, but rather expensive\u201d", "Author": "aspataro", "ReviewID": "UR113210338", "Content": "So my wife and I took a trip to San Diego for Memorial Day weekend.

My overall impression is that if you plan on using Priceline don't expect too much savings when your staying in downtown San Diego because parking is always going to be expensive.

I told front desk that this is misleading and they should put a disclaimer by the phone saying that customers will be charged 300% more if they decide to use the hotel phone. Very misleading!

The clock radio has an ipod /iphone charging dock. There is no-brainer-to-connect WI-FI (yes, for $15/day as noted by others). The room entrance is a bit odd. Two rooms are accessed from the hallway. You open the hallway door and enter a small hall. We were in room 694. Rooms 694 and 695 enter from then main hallway into this short entry room. From there, you enter your room. It is very private, but initially confusing. This would be a great feature for traveling groups or families. For just my husband and myself, it was unusual. The hotel also uses a magnetic key (yes, an actual key) system (no numbers on the keys) These keys are easily reprogrammed, but I prefer the credit card type of key. I am afraid that if I lost this key it will cost me $120.00 to replace as that is what a locksmith would charge for a replacement key. Arriving at the hotel was disappointing.

My fiance and I took engagement photos in the lobby and the second floor ballrooms and hallways. I would not be exaggerating by stating that the hallways on the second floor look palatial, with china cabinets and porcelain statues and vases on pedestals. Our rooms were very well appointed, although the carpets are a bit dated. Nonetheless, everything was very clean and daily maid service was perfect. Messages were left for us when we had our \"privacy\" sign out, turn down service included filling the ice bucket, it couldn't have been more perfect. We heard the next door neighbors literally and figuratively \"banging\" but otherwise very well insulated from room and street noise. There is a small, but well-appointed gym, but no pool. The location is excellent. Less than 2 miles from the airport and right next to the Horton mall one block away. 7-eleven next door as well for snacks and drinks. One issue though, San Diego downtown is a bit sketchy - there are a lot of homeless and bail bonds places right around the corner from 4-5 star hotels like this and the US Grant. We asked the concierge if walking to Little Italy was possible (at 10 pm) and she cheerfully said yes. After 3 blocks, we had to turn back and get the car. The streets became rough and dark with underpasses and highway crossings. I wouldn't do it and she shouldn't have given us the advice. Now for the bad part - and this is big. Parking now costs $32 per day! And there is no street parking at all in the area (for over 30 minutes). Much of San Diego downtown is like this so you have no choice but to pay. Next, there is now a Mandatory, HIDDEN $15 room fee! This is over and above your Priceline total. So if you think all you're paying is the Priceline total, you are WRONG! Add $15 to it. The attendant told us that this was a new policy and that it covered wireless internet, 2 bottles of water a day, and a newspaper. We could not opt out of it. This is flat out wrong. People use priceline in order to pre-pay and get a total and fixed cost. What's to stop a hotel from charging $50 extra per night when you show up???

Now, the BAD!!! -Over-priced parking (about $30 nightly) -No coffee-maker in room (free coffee is in lounge) -Mini-safe has to be purchased to be used. -2nd night of my 3-night stay was completely sleepless and scary, as a group of completely drunk \"soccer riot\" types blasted into their rooms next to us screaming at 11 pm, then left.

From the exterior the hotel is like any other, but once you walk in, you are transported to another time and place, it is one of the most beautiful lobbies I have encountered in a long time. There are ample elevators resulting in Little waiting to get to or from your room. My room was on the 5th floor, it was very nice. Once off the elevator, you are greeted by a set of double doors that lead to two rooms, one of which was mine. An electronic key grants access to the hallway and your room. My room was very large, a french balcony offered a somewhat limited view of downtown. The room was well equipped with TV (older tube type, not a flat screen) DVD player, clock radio with ipod dock, desk, chair and bed. It also had at least 3 phones, one next to the bed on a night table, a second on the desk and a third next to the sink. The hotel offer free wifi access as well. Off the main bedroom was a large bathroom area containing a lengthy vanity, and sink along with nice bath products, creams, shampoos and soap. Off of that room was a walk in closet, with double doors, and a sliding door led to an inner bathroom with toilet facilities and a large shower/bath combination. The room was very clean, but slightly dated by worn carpet. The room was cleaned in the morning, and in the evening there was a turn-down service, where the comfort and extra pillows were stored, chocolate left on the pillow, and a personalized forecast was left on the night stand, free bottle water and ice was also supplied at this time. The hotel made me feel special, I had planned to attend high tea, but didn't feel that my attire suited the occasion, young women were there in the bright colourful dresses and flowery hats. The hotel is very classy. As I had already mentioned the carpet was worn, the only other downside was street noise. San Diego has a busy railway downtown and the noise can be disturbing. As in many big cities, sirens can be heard much of the night, a fire station is just a little over a block away. Also there was a protest one morning across the street that woke me. THe rooms are not well insulated for sound from the outside, but given the quality of this hotel, these are minor issues.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBe aware of $20 charge per night for rooms with 2 beds\u201d", "Author": "himong", "ReviewID": "UR103342464", "Content": "I traveled with my mom and booked a room through Priceline.com.

We were very pleased when we got a room at the Westgate! However, after we parked our car at the valet and made our way to checkin, we were informed that we did not, in fact, have a room at the Westgate. Despite reserving over a month in advance, our room had been 'overbooked.' They had arranged a room for us nearby at the Westin (which they said is the same star rating as the Westgate, and by the way, they have a pool and jacuzzi which is more than the Westgate has to offer, so we should be happy for the change!), and they were happy to have a bellman walk our bags over if we wanted to leave our car at the Westgate (and pay full price parking for leaving it there). I asked to speak to the manager who said that there was a problem with the way they had received bookings from Priceline, so it was not their fault. I could be assured that this had happened only once in the past 1.5 years, and that it would not happen again. I asked if there was anything they could do for me, but she only reiterated that it was not the hotel's fault that we could not have the room we had been promised, and that, again, the Westin was better given the pool that they have, and apparently we should be happy for the change. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. We had a guaranteed reservation which was not honored, and in spite of multiple inquiries for any semblance of compensation, we got nothing other than the offer to leave our car at the hotel that kicked us out. We would have appreciated at least a waiver for parking, or a discount on our next stay, but no. In spite of asking multiple times, the message was, basically, leave. In short, if you stay at the Westgate, hopefully you pay a lot for your room, otherwise be prepared to be treated like yesterday's garbage.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful under rated hotel\u201d", "Author": "alexanderten", "ReviewID": "UR102587794", "Content": "I loved the Westgate.

I got a great deal on Priceline. We were very happy with the hotel, from the valets, to the friendly, fast service at check-in, to the lovely, spacious room. The bathroom was beautiful and had a great shower with very good water pressure. The room was very quiet....we never heard anyone. Night time turndown was nice with chocolates, music playing and ice and water waiting. The beds were okay.....a little hard, but really no complaints. Great area with plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Our only problem came the next morning. We decided to have breakfast downstairs in the dining room. The menu looked very inviting. We stood at the door of the restaurant for about 5 minutes. No one greeted us. We became a little confused and wondered if we were supposed to seat ourselves. There were only about 5 tables taken by mostly businessmen. Finally, a hostess (I think) came by and wanted to sit us in a dark corner. We pointed to another table for two (not far away) and asked if we could sit there. She hemmed and hawed and muttered that it would take a long time to get another place setting there, but let us sit there anyway. Within minutes, an enterprising waiter scooped a place setting from one of the many empty tables...voila! Crisis averted! And so we sat, and sat, and waited and waited. Ten long minutes later, the hostess came by and asked if we would like coffee. YES! PLEASE! More waiting, waiting..waited for coffee..waited to have our order taken...someone else came in after us and had all their needs taken care of a lot more promptly. We finally decided we had to leave. Things to do & see. When the waiter finally came to take our order, we asked him to just bring us the check for our coffee because we had to leave. He said he was sorry, and disappeared. The (I'm assuming) manager came to our table. His words to us were \"You wanted to sit at this table, we let you sit here. What is your problem?\" Holy cow. He was argumentative and rude. We tried to explain that we had been waiting for a long time, and another table who came in after us had already been served. Again, he argued with us. At that point, we just got up and left.

We got a great rate and we were very happy with this hotel. We arrived around 5 PM on Saturday night and we weren't able to find any valets in front of the hotel and when we continued up 2nd Ave a little bit we saw a couple well dressed gentlemen sending people away and saw signs that the parking lot was full. Not a great way to arrive but we circled the block a few times and eventually found street parking a few blocks away. The ease of parking leaves a little bit to be desired but when we got back to the hotel we saw that a wedding was scheduled at 5 and there were a lot of people to park so we gave the hotel somewhat of a pass on that but at that point we were a little nervous about our hotel selection. We walked in to the lobby and immediately the room and the chandeliers gave us a flashback of the Hall of Mirrors from our trip to Versailles last year. The setting is very elegant and classy and I liked it but was kind of sad that my mom wasn't with us because she would have LOVED it. It is definitely a unique hotel in that aspect. We were able to check in quickly and when we got to the room I had a little trouble with the key (an actual key, the first I've seen at a hotel in years but with an interesting design) but after a few tries we were able to get in our room which was very generously sized. We were on the 6th floor and had a view towards the Gaslamp district and the bay which we liked. The glass door opens to a small balcony where you can step out and enjoy the weather, which was a perfect 75 degrees the day we were there. We had a king size bed which was very comfortable and the furnishings continued the French theme from the downstairs lobby. The bathroom was very large and had a vanity area, a large mirror that my wife loved, a closet, and a separate shower/toilet area. One of our only complaints about the room is that the drain in the shower was slow and the water tended to back up rather quickly. I guess our only other complaint is that the tube TV could use an update but not that big a deal. The entertainment center had a DVD player which we found rather fortunate since we had just bought a movie and we were able to watch it that night at the hotel. We didn't have any meals at the hotel but we were close enough to walk to Ruth's Chris for dinner and then The Broken Yolk the next morning for brunch. The hotel is in a very centralized location close to a lot of restaurants, bars, and a Westfield Mall. The area can get somewhat sketchy after dark and I wouldn't venture out north of Broadway. There were a few panhandlers asking us for change out in front of a 7-11 next door but it's the type of thing you'll see downtown in any large city.

Decorated in a classy 1920\u2019s French provincial motif, it is a great reminder the old style, elegance and excesses of the wealthy from a segment of society that is seldom seen. Upon entering, patrons are sucked into a massive and yet sparsely furnished lobby area. Suspended from 20+ foot ceiling are at least 6 large chandeliers (the size of a small car) and each is ornately trimmed; all seemingly to leave you wondering what would happen if they were to fall. Overall, the lobby is very impressive, but is more designed to show off the large collection antiques and therefore had more the appearance of a museum. The lack of coziness made it difficult to carry on a conversation with anyone in the lobby. This was because the furniture was so spread out and if there was any activity in the background, the noises echoed and added to the problem. However, a real good hearing aid or maybe a bullhorn could easily solve this problem. There is a nice internet room with two computers a fireplace and a few sofas. Afternoon tea was impressive with plenty of snacks and a touch of elegance (for a price). The staff bent over backwards to help in every way possible and the people at the front desk were especially helpful and had plenty of information. The guest rooms were also decorated on a grand scale - My room had a very comfortable bed and clean linens and a constant supply of fresh towels and a fresh bathrobe on top of it. Nightly turn down service with chocolates on your pillow adds to the experience. A large television, large bed, two chairs and spacious shower made for a room that you could truly spread out in. There is a workout room in the basement, but no swimming pool. The hotel also lacks a gift shop, but within three blocks there is plenty of shopping. If you like ice in your drink, be sure to keep a supply of dollar bills on hand because the only ice machine is somewhere in the kitchen so a member of the staff will have to bring it to your room in exchange for a tip.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in down town San Diego\u201d", "Author": "chicagolouis", "ReviewID": "UR80614898", "Content": "I was at a conference at the Marriot Marina, but stayed at the Westgate.

The place was immaculately clean and polished. The staff at the valet were all polite and courteous and efficient. The staff at the front desk very professional. Alexandra checked me in and she was quite quick and efficient. I had asked for a higher floored room than was reserved and she was able to accommodate me with out fuss. The room we were in faced west and from the balcony you could see the bay. At dusk, it was breath taking. The room was spacious and as tastefully decorated as the lobby. There was a sitting chair, a desk with hard wired internet and an armoire with a television and DVD. The bed was large and firm and the pillows fluffy. The clock radio was made for an IPOD. The bathroom was large and clean and the shampoos and soaps were a good quality. Towels were big and fluffy. The floor didn't have an ice-maker and the valet had offered to bring some up for us. The elevators were fast. The bar on the lobby floor was quite small but large enough for a two piece band (that we didn't take the time to listen too). The only drawback to the room was the noise . . . although old and i would assume the walls were thick, there was very little sound proofing when the door was closed (you could see light from the hallway adjoining two rooms).

I finally called this place and they had a room. I took it, only knowing that it was on 2nd street (I'd seen the sign from Broadway). After looking at the website I was a little bummed, thinking I was going to hate it. I like hotels with modern styling usually and typically stay at places like the W. This place did not look like my style at all from the photos. I was thinking it would be a musty old grandma type of place. And then I got there. Walking into the lobby is impressive. It's definitely an old European style that comes off horribly unless opulent enough to be glamourous and elegant. This place pulls it off. The staff at the front desk was very nice. The room was the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in. Big corner tub in the bathroom, HUGE vanity with stool, four comfortable chairs in the room, and wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling window with an AMAZING view (I could see the harbor from my room, along with much of the beautiful downtown area). The photos of the rooms you see on the site don't do it justice at all. There's sliding glass doors and a cute little Juliet balcony. It is a bit outdated (I can't remember the last time I've seen a tube television in any of the hotels I frequent) and the furnishings are older, but very well maintained. The location is unbeatable, walking distance to 100s of bars and restaurants, and about a 15 minute walk to the convention center or Petco Park. While I loved the room, the view, and the whole feel of the place, what really set it apart was the service. Every night at 8, (I was usually not in my room) they'd come in for turn down service. When I got back, the bedspread was removed, leaving a pretty white duvet , sheets turned down, chocolates, dressing robe, and a card on the bed with the weather for the next day, ice, free bottled water, and classical music playing...it was heavenly. The room service was friendly, fast and amazing. The big food portions were hot and delicious and in my room 15 minutes after I called, with all the trimmings and a fresh rose. The staff was kind and willing to help at every turn. Downsides: I mentioned the TV already, and the bed was a bit hard. Not an issue for me because I like a firm mattress, but it's far from one of the best I've slept in. There's a lot of street noise (maybe because of the big window?) but it's par for the course downtown.

They will bring you \"hypo allergenic\" pillows at you're request. Plenty of towels, free wireless internet, free bottled water, and an in room dvd player. All great amenities!!! The hotel is VERY quiet. It's one of those things that if you didn't know it was there, you'd never know it was there. This section of downtown is quiet on the weekends because it's near office buildings, and the civic center (unless something is going on at the civic theater, which is right behind the hotel) It's across from Horton Plaza and the gaslamp is 2 tiny blocks away, so it's the perfect distance away. You don't hear the riff raff from the gaslamp, but are close enough to walk there. The trolly station is right behind the hotel, and if something happens, sometimes you can hear it, but it's very very faint and not bothersome in the least. The hotel is located downtown....which means you deal with downtown issues. San Diego is a large urban area with urban area problems. In walking downtown you will encounter homeless populations, and junkies. That's the city, and has nothing to do with the hotel. I would NOT advise staying here with small children unless you are planning on driving in and driving out. I tend to want to shelter my little ones. Parking is under the hotel and so technically unless you go walking, you will never interact with the undesireable aspect of the city. However, it's totally safe (we walked around after dark with no problems) as long as you're aware of your surroundings. Be prepared to pay handsomly for parking, but then again....it's downtown.

We were in San Diego for a family wedding. Many activities were planned all over the San Diego area. The Westgate, located in downtown on the edge of the Gaslamp District, proved to be a very convenient starting point for all of them. I never had to drive more than 15 minutes to get anywhere. Our room was just beautiful. It was large, really large. I loved the dressing room that was separate from the bath. The shower had a seat, which is always a nice touch. The 2 queen beds were comfortable, the turndown service included two bottles of water and a full ice bucket as well as the usual chocolates on the pillow, the furnishings were well upolstered and plush. We could open our sliders and step out onto a narrow balcony (big enough to stand on but not big enough to accomodate a chair or table) with a lovely view of downtown, with the harbour visible in the distance. I found everything to be very clean. Another poster commented on the interesting \"suite-like\" configuration wherein there is a main door from the hallway that opens onto a foyer for two rooms across from each other. It certainly helps keep things quiet. Also, there was free, high-speed wireless internet in the room, which is something upon which I am becoming increasingly dependent when I travel. I had no problems with service. Check-in was smooth and we were directed immediately to our room in spite of having arrived several hours prior to the posted check-in time. Upon arrival in the room, I found that the airconditioning was not working. I called housekeeping and a repair person was in and out of the room within half an hour, and we had no further difficulties. I have never stayed anywhere with more efficient valet service. Even on weekend evenings when there are events at the hotel, I never waited more than a minute or two to take the car out. Rather than pulling up in front of the hotel, I always just drove the car down to the garage and left the key with the valet so there was never a wait at drop-off. The Westgate's style is definitely on the old-fashioned side in terms of style and furnishings. It is not in any way faded or run-down, but there are crystal chandeliers and gilt and embroidered upolsteries...think French Provincial. If modern, streamlined, less-is-more surroundings are more to your taste, then you may not like this much. Other family members (male) who also stayed there found it, while comfortable, a bit \"stuffy.\" The hotel is not quite a luxury hotel if the Georges V is your standard. There is the little something extra that the very best hotels offer mising here, but at $179/night for three (Thurs., Fri. and Sat.) nights and $209.00 for one (Sun.) night, it felt pretty darn luxurious to me! I should mention that there is a $28/night fee for parking. But even with the parking it was cheaper than many less well appointed properties. In all honesty, it was a steal! If I had a tour of the accomodations in advance and was asked to guess the price per night, I would have guessed in the $350-$400 range.

The front desk promised to send some up but no one ever came by. The second day after housekeeping came and went still left us with no soap. We had to make a run to the local CVS/Rite Aid to purchase our own. Our shower drain was plugged the first night so we notified the front desk when leaving the next morning. It was mostly cleared by the time we returned that evening. The full length windows and sliding door was nice to have and the view out of our tenth floor room was better than I've had in a long time.

It cut down on ambient hallway noise I assume since I heard nothing but our neighbor come and go.

Our Next night there, June 2nd was great. the Westgate is right next to Horton Plaza, and within walking distance of all the Gaslamp Quarter. We walked everywhere. There were a lot of couples like us about as well as many business people. The downtown area is home to many homeless, but I was very happy to see homeless assistance squads interacting with them. It was not like they were forgotten by the city. This really impressed me. I have traveled a lot and have never seen this much assistance in action. That night we stopped by the bar at the Westgate during the happy hour and I got a wonderful Kir Royale for $7. The service was friendly and professional. Every time we passed by the front desk we were greeted with our name, with the staff had went out of the way to remember it. That night we ate at about 10:40 PM in the bar from the restaurants menu. I ordered the tortilla soup and my husband ordered the prawns. It was presented well and had the great flavor. Again, great service. That night the television had perfect reception. maybe it was a sign that I should have not been watching so late the night before. ;) Our sheets were lovely, and overall I would love to go back. Since we were leaving for a cruise, we were treated to a 2 PM checkout and we had the perfect amount of time to go eat and pack. Overall I would say that this is one of my most favorite places, and I have stayed at the St. Regis and The Ritz Carlton. I wish I would have had time to enjoy their award winning brunch or have High Tea there. Lastly, the overall design of this location is Palatial to say the least, and the Ballroom is the most beautiful in all of the Southland, and is named Versailles, and I would definitely say that name is fitting The only thing thi hotel is missing is a pool, but it is more than made up for in many other ways. I am very picky and give this hotel a solid 4.5 stars.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but trouble with billing\u201d", "Author": "EastCoastersinOnt", "ReviewID": "UR31087939", "Content": "The Westgate was a very nice hotel and we were happy with the location and ammenities.

The parking is expensive $28 for valet and there is really no alternative if you have a car. We ended up paying cash for the remainder of our bill on check-out - which was supposed to be for parking only. Since it was early when we checked out I didn't catch that they actually billed me for 4 days of parking instead of the 3 that we stayed. Plus they charged me over $8 for a toll-free number call (to reach our car rental facility) saying that it was long distance. When I tried to explain to the desk attendant they told me to call accounting when I returned home and they would refund the charge (which they now will not credit my card since I paid cash). And I found through my online banking that they charged me for another $28 parking which I didn't even sign. They did agree to refund me the 2 extra days of parking - we'll see how that goes. The free-high speed internet was a bonus but it was very slow. Overall the hotel is nice and close to Gaslamp District but if you're going to California for the beaches, stay closer to the water!

Trust me \u2013 if you haven\u2019t had European service, you cannot judge outstanding service \u2013 where being a waiter is a career worth doing well, not a job you have during college because you can make good tips but if you get fired, no worries, you\u2019ll get another job. That is the difference and it seems the Westgate hotel recognizes this, and perhaps that is why they have an international staff. After valeting our car, when we arrived at the front desk, it was obvious the valet corresponded with the front desk as they called us by our name before my husband told them who we were. When we checked in, the clerk told us where the opera house was and told us about the pre-opera dinner at the hotel. This would normally not sound important but it means that when I booked our reservation, the call operator took a note of why we were visiting \u2013 to go to the opera and stay downtown afterwards. A note that the front desk clerk read and made mention of during our check in. She also asked us if she could walk us to our room, another simple service not frequently found in the US, except at the best hotels. While we don\u2019t need someone to take us to our room, it was a nice gesture. The room was beautiful, and the marble bathroom compliments the antique decor. I mention this because sometimes in hotels or bed and breakfasts that use antique decoration, cleanliness sometimes suffers but this is not the case at the Westgate. It was very clean. The food was, by far, my favorite part. We decided we will make the trip again just for dining. Again, service was five star and the food was perfect. While I like trying different things, my husband was so impressed with the food that we had breakfast there in the morning. I learned the difference between homemade juice and fresh juice.

The carpet looked like it had a flood in the room and was severely discolored. I had to see if it was just discolored or really wet because it looked wet. It was dry but I think it was overly shampoo'd because my feet were a bit sticky from walking on it. The bathrooms are nice with marble but the grout is dirty. Caution! The tub is very slippery. It has those non slip strips on it but it is still very slick. There is a step out balcony which was nice. Wouldnt leave it open if you have a child there. The A/C Heater is not very functional, the room was always too hot or too cold. One thing we found weird was there is a hallway door to get to your room door and the room door is not marked once you get though the 1st door. It's a nice feature since you don't have to hear people walking up and down the halls outside your door and adds a bit more security but I think they should mark the actual rooms a better. We stayed on the 6th floor. There is a lot of noise from the street. But hey, you can't beat being right in the middle of the city. With that.... parking is expensive $28.00 a night!

The staff gave us a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 17th floor overlooking Horton Plaza, the NBC building, the bay and Coronado Bridge. BEAUTIFUL! When we got to the room, I was at first surprised by the decor. I felt as though I had stepped back in time into my grandmother's house that was still decorated in a very old school style. In defense of the hotel, the decor is supposed to be an older style. As I spent more time in the room, I realized that I actually liked the decor. It was very soothing, elegant and comfortable, and the colors were quite lovely - all except for the ridiculously hideous bed comforter. As it turned out, I was mostly bothered by that and not the rest. It was ugly and didn't properly match with the rest of the very nice decor. The room was also very large, spacious and bright. It had a very nice overall feel. Anyway, the bathroom was a nice size, but had some downfalls. First off, there was only one sink, and the vanity looked and smelled like it had been there for a little too long. It definitely needs some upgrading. Also, the sink area was carpeted. Yikes. The carpet looked clean and appeared to be in good shape, but seriously - carpet in ANY part of the bathroom is just not a good idea. Period. The shower/toilet area appeared to be old school marble, but the shower was a good size. The showerhead was far too low for my 6' husband, but was just fine for me. It was all very clean and was comfortable overall, but definitely not the Ritz or St. Regis. Some updates and changes would be good. Some other great things about the hotel stay were that the staff was always willing to call us a cab or help us with anything we needed in a very prompt manner.

They don't have free internet, but they have a cable you buy from the mini bar for $10 and then you're set for the duration of your stay. Better than some hotels that charge $9.95 a day.

If you are looking for a chain property that is cookie cutter or cutting edge this isn't for you. Yes, some of the fixtures look a little worn and, no, they don't have flat screen TVs, but with everything else going for them we didn't miss those items a bit. Old world charm abounds from the lobby's ornate marble, amazing wood work, furniture and fixtures through to its unusually large-sized rooms that you just don't see anymore in the chain properties. Marble in the bathrooms, glass doors on the showers and a huge king bed made this a great experience. I'm a stickler for the staff/customer service component and this was a memorable experience in that regard too. Everyone greeted us pleasantly and even looked us in the eye whenever we came upon them in the lobby, elevators, front desk, etc. They actually held the front doors and elevators for us. You just don't see that anymore. Only hitch, my wife needed Internet access and due to a problem with their SBC connection she couldn't use her laptop for the Web. We ended up in the business center where a wonderfully friendly staff person, Linda, let us use one of the desktop PCs without cost and continued to push the property's IT dept. to fix the problem for us which they did. The lower concourse has the gift shop/business center, gym and parking. Gym was nice-sized and quiet so no trouble for me getting time on the equipment. We didn't have a chance to try the bar or restaurant, but would definitely do so on our next trip. The hotel caters to high-end receptions and has a great roof-top deck with fountains that our room overlooked. As for the hotel's location, it's right downtown so great to venture out and see the sights.

Though personable enough, they did not seem to be very experienced in hosting a large event. The hotel restaurants are fantastic, serving upscale California fare, and room service was impeccable. The location is not a great one for the tourist, as it is in the business district of the city. I was able to find some excellent restaurants and nightclubs nearby, though.

I booked a hotel through Hotwire, based on star rating and location in the Gaslamp quarter, and was pleased to find out we were staying at The Westgate. Despite a bland outside appearance, the interior architecture and decor of The Westgate has a European, and distinctly French, charm. The location to Horton Plaza and the restaurants/shops of the Gaslamp Quarter is certainly one of the main attractions to this hotel. (We even walked about 15 minutes to Petco Park for a baseball game). During check-in, we found the desk staff friendly and helpful. They upgraded us to a room on a higher floor. I was initially excited, but disappointed to step inside and have the NBC building directly across the street blocking much of the harbor view. The room itself was comfortable. Our bed was plush, with soft down pillows and a comforter. Two nightstands with marble tops were adjacent to the bed. In front of the sliding glass door to the balcony was a leather-topped work desk with complimentary Internet access. (Wireless is only available in the restaurant and bar). Also in the room were a chair and ottoman, television, DVD player, minibar, and phone with 2 separate lines. A bucket of ice was left during turn down service and a morning newspaper was delivered. The bathroom contained a vanity and an over-sized square-shaped marble shower/bathtub. ***The sides of the tub were very high and may not be suitable for those who have difficulty climbing in and out of a tub.*** Gilchrist & Soames toiletries were available as well as a hairdryer, two robes, an ironing board/iron and a vanity. The bathroom, although clean, felt run-down. The hotel really should repair the peeling wallpaper and consider better lighting. Valet service was quick, but the $24/night garage fee was ridiculously high, esp. for a hotel of this caliber. The other drawback to The Westgate is the traffic noise. Despite being in a room almost to the top of the hotel, the traffic noise on the street below was constant.

We were there on Monday and Tuesday nights, September 3rd and 4th. I am writing to tell you that our stay with you was the most pleasant we have ever had at a hotel. When we were first greeted we were told by the very lovely young woman at the front desk that we were upgraded to an upper floor (our room was 1689 I believe). When we saw the room we were floored! It was so elegantly decorated - with a beautiful bath and dressing area - and very roomy. The rooms were very quiet and the beds extremely comfortable. The maid responded very quickly to a request for a few additional pillows. As soon as we were settled in we had drinks at one of your bars - and - again - were greeted and served by a very sweet but professional young woman. We felt totally comfortable and decided right then and there that if we could have we WOULD have booked an extra day or two. We were thinking about going out for dinner - but opted on having dinner at your restaurant (the cafe) because the menu did look very good. The wait staff was great and so was the food. Breakfast the next day was also a delight. People say that your hotel room is not a big deal because you don't spend all day in your room. You are out sight-seeing most of the time. This is not true for us. Even though we spent the entire day at the zoo - and also visited Coronado in the short time we were in San Diego, the hotel and the hotel room are VERY important to us. The hotel can make or break your vacation time. Again - from the bell man who took our bags to our room to the young man who retrieved our car for us on the morning we left, we were treated with extraordinary courtesy. We will probably not be back to San Diego - but I almost feel like visiting the city again JUST to stay at the Westgate. Thank you once again for the wonderful two days we spent with you.

If the remote control to the television set was placed at the foot of the bed before we went shopping. Why on earth was it at the head of the bed on the floor where it could not be reached. I had to forcibly place my arm between the bed and floor to retrieve it. 2. Why did the maid know where the remote was on the floor at the foot of the bed. Answer: My Chargers backpack was in the vicinity. 3. Most travelers know, when a remote control is found by the maid in the room. They place it back on the entertainment center, not the head of the bed on the floor. 4. The investigation by Law Enforcement standards was weak. The fact that they (management) were more concerned about not being liable than locating my backpack was really disappointing. In all my medication, camera, jewelry, passport, address book and other miscellaneous items were taken without consent. No question in my mind the Hotel is beautiful and quaint.

In hindsight, we realize the modern vibe at some of the other downtown hotels is a better fit for us (we're in our 30s). The Good: Very nice, clean, spacious rooms; great beds; lovely welcome tray (chocolate truffles!); small balcony (see below); good bathroom amenities; strong water pressure; eager turn-down service. Rooms are set away from hallway by a door, so hallway noise is minimal. Had a decent bay view. Great location; Horton plaza is right there, quick walk to Gaslamp and other great restaurants. A few blocks from convention center, easily walkable. Free airport shuttle. The bellman (Sergio) was super-helpful. The Not-So-Good: While no hotel is perfect, the small annoyances at the Westgate would have been more bothersome had we been paying the full rate (often more than $400). Downtown San Diego is loud & our balcony doors did not lock! We heard lots of street noise by 6AM and were kept up by an outside hotel party into wee hours of morning, despite being on 11th floor. Small gym is fine, but hotel was fully booked, so the 5 cardio machines were not enough. Our towels and robe were not replenished one day. Desk staff was very polite, but not particularly effective. The gilded lobby is small, with most of the space going to an area of tables where afternoon tea is served. Lastly, we were charged for something from minibar we didn't use (they said they'd reverse the charge). For one night of our reservations, they charged us a few dollars more than quoted. It was only $6, so we didn't care & didn't mention it. But, combined with the last-minute minibar charge, we were left with a bit of a bad taste in our mouths.

Our package included a harbor view room, one breakfast in bed, and one dinner at Le Fountainbleu, the hotel's 5* restaurant for a four night stay. While we enjoyed our bay view room we would not pay standard rates (approx. $395) for the lodging. Since the hotel is located a bit away from the bay there were a lot of downtown buildings that obstructed our view. From our room #1695 we had views from 12 to one o'clock and 10 to 11 o'clock. If you stepped on the balcony (no seating, just a small space to area out) you had better views from 8 o'clock 11 o'clock partially obstructed by buildings.

I should point out our first hotel was very overrated and expensive and the stay was unsatisfactory. We decided on this one in a hurry - and based our decision largely upon the reviews we read on this site. We arrived shortly after 12 noon and were immediately able to check into our room. It was clean and and roomy and looked exactly as the pictures on the website. At check in there was an emphasis on eating facilities throughout the hotel. We found the bed to be comfortable and the bathrobes were plush and a bonus (not provided at the first hotel). There was more than enough room in the dressing room. Decor was tasteful and traditional (almost renaissance style). Our room way at the rear of the hotel overlooking the trolley lines and initially we were a little concerned as we had stayed near the rail lines in the other hotel and it was horribly noisy. However, we found we never heard the trolley at all - it was actually quite peaceful - apart from hearing our neighbour open and close his door without consideration for others. The light in the shared foyer between rooms also kept us awake the first night - but we thought outside the square and made sure we turned it off when we went to bed the following nights. The hotel had advised of a function on one of the nights and indicated the elevators may be slower than normal between certain hours - the music for the event could be heard and it was horrible - however the function ended when the hotel said it would. The hotel offers a shuttle from to and from Balboa Park and Sea World at specified times - we used this and it was very convenient and puntual - as was the complementary shuttle to the airport. At check out the desk attendant could have been a little warmer - she was very effiecient but almost cold in manner - we considered this to be European efficiency - as indicated by her accent. She said we had mini bar charges - we did not use the minibar at all. She was very brusque! The conceirge was useless and was very confused about how and where to get to places. The one we dealt with spent time checking her text messages whilst tearing off a map and passing it to us - yet we had suitable maps and simply wanted to ask questions. We thought this was dreadful - a concierge should know virtually everything about a city and be willing to assist! Our biggest criticism regarded a package we were expecting. At checkin we informed the desk that this was expected. We double checked on the last business day of the week and were told this had not arrived - we had already been at the hotel for 2 days. We followed this up with a phonecall to the relevant company which had closed for the weekend. We were then travelling on to San Francisco on the Sunday. As a result we had to make repeated additional follow up calls to the business and to the hotel to find out where the package was. This is where the hotel lets itself down very badly! The package was received and signed for by a hotel employee prior to our checkout. We were told that the package was misaddressed and had the last letter on our surname missing so they assumed we were not guests. We asked that they forward it to us at our San Francisco hotel and were told we needed to call UPS ourselves. Instead we contacted the dental company and asked they sort the problem. When the package finally arrived in SF we checked the address label and whilst on one side the last letter of our surname was left off, our name was complete with hotel details on the flip side of the parcel. We feel this showed a clear lack of initiative and effort on the hotel side, particularly when we had said we were expecting the package. This cost a considerable amount of vacation time as well as money in long distance calls sorting out something that we should not have had to ourselves. This hotel also needs a coffee machine in the room - it wouldn't cost much to set each room up with one, especially when the coffee shop next door closes early and is not open at all at weekends.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Just a Bedouin at Heart...", "Title": "\u201cSumptuous (but Expensive)\u201d", "Author": "wagnersh", "ReviewID": "UR5774307", "Content": "The Westgate Hotel in San Diego is everything its website says it is, and more! It is classy, elegant, service is impeccable and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The location (across from Horton Plaza and within a block of the north end of the Gaslamp Quarter) is perfect. The only drawbacks I found to my stay were how expensive all of the restaurants in the hotel were (even a light, late-evening snack will set you back $20-$25) and their \"high-speed internet\" was not wi-fi, but an ethernet line in every room. Had I known this in advance I could have brought my connector cord with me and saved the $10 on the ethernet cable available in the mini-bar. All in all, though, it was a truly great hotel.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tucson", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing\u201d", "Author": "wildcatgary", "ReviewID": "UR5727146", "Content": "What a wonderful place. Not perfect but wonderful. Not new but very elegant. Service effort was spotless. Everyone did everything they could to make you feel like a true guest. I never touched my luggage once I got in the limo / van from the airport. Room service brought the biggest bucket of ice you have ever seen. In 20 mins. Everything took 20 mins. Picked up at airport, 20 mins. Ice, 20 mins, luggage to room, 20 mins. Wait for ride to airport, 20 mins. That's the only down side. Accept check in and out was instant. The view and room are perfect. Plenty of room. Yes a little noisey, but your downtown. Stayed facing north, 17 floor. paid about 190 on expedia. Slept with balcony doors open and heard the usuualy downtown noice. No problem sleeping. I WOULD stay again. Location is the excellent for walking to dinner out and a evening in gaslamp. Best bang for the buck downtown.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing stay at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5434468", "Content": "After switching rooms four times, first-no king size bed, second-t.v. not working properly, third-traffic on Broadway too loud, fourth-18th floor facing third street, awesome room. Fourtunantly my husband and I have a sense of humor. Large rooms, beautiful decor, marble counter tops, marble shower and great water pressure. Turn down service at night which was awesome! Shuttle service to and from the airport, zoo and Seaworld. We were lucky to even get one of the bellman to take us down to gaslamp district one night on his reccomendation to Taka. Good food. (Japanesse) Location is terrific. Close to trolley which can take you to old town. The bus is close also, we took it to Balboa Park to the museums one day. When at Balboa Park, eat at the Prado Restaurant. Awesome food and price is just right. The Westgate Cafe was elegant and perfect. Ate there two times for breakfast and once for dinner-one word, deliicious! For all of you ladies, go to tea which is served in the hotel lobby from 2:30pm-5pm. Fun, fun! The hotel is decorated so elegantly, but far from stuffy. The staff all make you feel at ease. Hope you enjoy your stay!
