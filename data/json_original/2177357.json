My single room there was of a decent size, quiet and comfortable, with a good firm bed and en-suite bathroom. It was kept clean at all times by the hotel's friendly but inconspicuous cleaning staff and contained a TV, safe deposit box, mini-bar and coffee and tea-making facilities. The free wifi was both entirely reliable and fast. A buffet breakfast with a good selection of a few hot and many cold options was served downstairs in an attractive breakfast room. However, what really makes this hotel is its exceptional customer service. Right from the outset, when I received a warm welcome, cup of tea and informative orientation chat on arrival, nothing was too much trouble for Ersin on the reception desk. Every morning, he was full of suggestions of places to visit, good locations for photography and photographic tips. Throughout my stay at the Sultan's Royal Hotel, I had the impression that all of the other guests staying there were very satisfied with the hotel. It is, therefore, without hesitation that I would recommend the Sultan's Royal Hotel.

The chefs at both hotels refresh the omelets and other hot items continually. My favorite was this roasted tomato and sausage dish, not so much for the sausage but the tomato was excellent. They had corbasi or shepherd's salad (tomato, cucumber, parsley salad with lemon and vinegar dressing), green and black olives, different types of bread, a spread of cheeses including Turkish white cheese, shortbread cookies, good coffee, and tea. Their simit (sesame bread) was a little stale, but the nearby simit shop had delicious, fresh simit for cheap (two for ~65 cents). There are small inexpensive grocery shops nearby for snacks and drinks. Also, the AC was convenient when it was especially humid. Our room's LCD TV wasn't working, but we never got around to mentioning it to the staff because we were so exhausted from sightseeing and we were happy with the free wifi.
