As we were falling asleep at 10:30pm, we heard the sound of two diesel truck engines right outside our window. Soon, we heard mechanical noises and work crews shouting to each other. I went outside and found two High Desert Communications boom trucks working on a cell tower 20 feet from the building. I asked the crew foreman how I was supposed to sleep through this, and he said there was nothing I could do because they could work there anytime, but would be finished by Midnight. Instead, the work continued all night with shouting, truck engines and boom noises right outside my room. I complained (loudly - my bad) to the Motel manager and I got credit for a free night's stay - thanks. Shame on High Desert Communications for ruining my stay and that of others. The Motel 6 manager said High Desert never contacts Motel 6 before starting work, even at night. I recommend you not stay here until the cell tower gets removed.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cgood bargain, decent rooms\u201d", "Author": "CaliforniaJacks_man", "ReviewID": "UR114695122", "Content": "stayed here for several nights and found it to be a very good buy. The room was clean,and comfortable.It is a Motel 6 , so if you are expecting the Ritz you will be disappointed. I have been to some awful Motel 6s and this one is far better than the average. I found the staff friendly and pleasant, the lady in charge of the desk most mornings was charming and friendly. I really have no complaint other than the unpleasant night security guy who is obviously way more impressed with his authority than anyone else is, I found him rude, needlessly unpleasant and his Barney Fife attitude is hardly a credit to an otherwise nice motel.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFacilities good, staff lacking\u201d", "Author": "Roaddogg800", "ReviewID": "UR113704930", "Content": "A clean and convenient property. Great value for the money at under $40 a night. New mattresses and quiet AC units made for a good nights rest. The two factors which were a disappointment were both related to staff not having the knowledge they needed and making false statements. I had only two specific requests at check in. First that I needed internet access. Second that I wanted to leave my suitcase after check out so I could attend a nearby meeting without dragging my luggage along as I was using public transportation. They said yes on both counts. However, the internet wasn't working and evidently hadn't been in some time. At check out , the manager in duty said in fact I could not leave my bag which created a huge problem for me.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGood value- pleased with stay\u201d", "Author": "dishpan22", "ReviewID": "UR87391344", "Content": "Property seemed fairly well kept.

It was a good connection convenient to the highway. The room was at a very reasonable rate, cheaper than other budget properties in the area. I had no problems with \"people hanging out\" in the parking lot, we asked about the no guests after a certain time period, they told us that was to prevent younger crowds from having parties and is common at motel 6s to have a sign like that. Are room was cleaned daily, and had all needed items, the hotel front desk was able to get us extra towels when we requested without a hassle. All in all it was one of the nicer motel 6's I have stayed at. I would suggest this hotel for anybody traveling in Phoenix and needs a cheaper place to stay.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cHorrible experience\u201d", "Author": "lonaldp78", "ReviewID": "UR8474273", "Content": "My wife and I arrived in Phoenix after a 10 hour drive from Northern Utah. We arrived late at night and were looking for a cheap \"reliable\" hotel to sleep in before waking up the next morning for our flight out. We figured that since we'd heard about Hotel 6 we would be comfortable with the arrangements. Little did we know, but the hotel was the most appalling hotel I'd ever been in. Besides being in what seemed to be in a bad location, the staff was rude, the hotel room smelled of something rotting, and the sheets and floor were stained. We both agreed that there must be a better room in the hotel, so we went to the front office and asked for another room. When we entered the next room we experienced much of the same thing and decided to ask for a refund. I know one thing is for sure I will NEVER stay in a Hotel 6 ever again and they should be paying people to stay there, rather than individuals paying money to stay at such a horrible place.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cGo to Prison instead\u201d", "Author": "Yomson", "ReviewID": "UR7427954", "Content": "This is a dungeon.
