Yes, the exterior halls show signs of wear, and yes, the room has older furniture and carpet.

I read reviews on here and prepared for the worst, and was surprised when it started off well: the clerk on duty (Graciella I believe) was kind and welcoming. The hotel looked pretty nice. The room was kind of dusty but it's Manhattan, right -- I mean, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room anyways with only 24 hours in New York? When we returned after a fun night the trouble began. We asked for a cot to accomodate an extra friend in the room, and were curtly told \"No -- it's after 11.\" The three people on duty then immediately resumed ignoring us. We went up to our room and tried to turn the TV on: not only did we spend 15 minutes trying to open the armoire that was falling apart and had no handles, but the TV itself did not work. So we thought we'd phone downstairs, until we discovered that the room's phone, although plugged in properly, did not work. The wall outlets did not work, and our phones weren't able to charge for our trip home. To top it off, our room was not properly ventilated and had a broken wall air conditioner. We had to keep the window open all night to have some proper air circulation, which meant we were forced to sleep with an open window in Manhattan in February. I had to sleep in my jacket and jeans I was so cold. I went down to complain about all of this at 2 AM (since of course we couldn't phone down) and was shocked to find that there was nobody at the front desk. I waited 10 or 15 minutes and nobody showed up, so I went back upstairs. In the morning, I went down around 8 and asked the person behind the desk (wearing torn jeans and a sweatshirt) if he was the manager. He sarcastically replied the manager would be in at 9. When we did speak to the manager at check-out he apologized, although it seemed half-hearted because he was typing at the time and not really listening to us. I guess he doesn't care that his hotel has safety hazards like no working phones, malfunctioning outlets, and improper ventilation in dusty, dirty rooms. On the plus side, none of us got bedbugs, and they didn't lose our bags that we checked with them before our one day in New York. But other than that, I wouldn't stay here again -- I got youth hostel-style accommodations for $100 a night. Rest assured I am calling (have already called) Days Hotels International to register an official complaint on behalf of our whole party. I hope they do take it seriously. It's too bad I'm writing this because this hotel has the potential to be a great cheap stay in New York: they have a great location with the subway literally at its doorstep (and two stops to Times Square on the 2/3 express lines).

Count 'em, SIX times. You can scroll down for my initial review, which I posted after my first two times. Since then, every experience has taken a nosedive and I can no longer positively recommend this hotel. It is STILL a \"value\" for NYC. I won't get into what a ripoff NYC hotels are, and how awful they all are and how much they overcharge. It's terrible, and as much as I like NYC, it is not worth what hotels overcharge. Given that Days Hotel averages about $150 a night, it's considered a \"bargain.\" But it's still a craphole. Yup, a craphole. Since I've been staying there, the wear and tear on the motel is just getting worse. A lot of it has to do with the fact that, because it costs less than most hotels in Manhattan, you get a large crowd of big families or tourist groups. The hotel is just not doing its part keeping up with the amount of people who stream through here. The biggest issue is that the rooms are so hit and miss. On my last stay here, I had a big, spacious room but I got NO cell phone or Internet reception (I don't mean their WiFi, which is a joke because you'll never find a signal; I had my own broadband card). I couldn't get a 4G signal, which had never happened before. So I asked to move to a room where I could get better signal. They moved me to a room that is facing the street. So I did find out that the rooms that face the street (Broadway) get some Internet reception. The rooms that face the back do not. However, the street-facing rooms are incredibly small. The size of a closet. And the heaters that they attach to these particular units are so loud and constantly banging throughout the night. So in the end, you have to choose between Internet reception or a bigger room that doesn't have banging pipes. That they can't figure out a happy medium between these two is the Days Hotel's downfall. If you're a business traveler, you'll have to suck it up and shell out the bigger bucks at a better hotel. It stinks but you won't get any work done at this place.

A door guard greeted me & held the door open as I wheeled my case in. The lobby was really clean & I managed to go straight to the check in desk without waiting & the staff were very friendly. My room was quite old fashioned but I wasn't staying there to judge the decor so it didn't bother me! I was really pleased with how big the room was with a good king size bed for just a single person. Wardrobe was a decent size with plenty of hanging space & there was a chest of drawers for more clothing storage space. There was a dressing table, chair & mirror & 2 bedside cabinets. The TV was good with plenty of channels (despite there not being a remote controller so you had to manually change the channels & volume). Even with all the furniture, the room still had plenty of space. There was even a coffee machine with supplies of coffee, creamer & sugar. In the wardrobe was a iron & ironing board. I was really impressed as there was a free good-sized safety deposit box in the wardrobe to keep my personal expensive items, & it was so easy to use by just entering your own 4 digit code to lock it. The bathroom was a decent size, clean & presented well. Plenty of towels with mini shampoos, conditioners, soaps, shower hair cap, extra toilet rolls, drinking plastic cups, & a hair dryer. The shower was easy to use tho you'd have to let the water run for about 5 minutes before it got warm. I was lucky to have a room with 2 windows so got plenty of daylight into the room & the views were good to look out onto the streets of the city. The only things that let the room & my stay down were... one was the AC/Heat system. At night the room got so cold & when you put the heating on, the heater would blow out this air which would make a really loud whistling noise. It was actually too loud to sleep thru so I would have to turn the heater off after a couple of hours & hope that warm air would stay in the room till morning! Also 2 of the light bulbs busted so was left with 1 dingy light. The worst thing was that house keeping would knock on the door early every morning, sometimes before 9am. If I was sleeping they would continue to knock on the door until I answered them. Or they would even just walk into the room, so I ended up locking the door, tho that didn't stop them trying to bash the door down to get in. The location was fantastic, a subway just down the street which was only 2/3 stops to Times Square & Penn Station. My friends I was visiting live in Harlem which was only a couple of stops away. Central Park was just a 5/10 min walk up the road. It was nice staying slightly uptown as it was quieter & less commercial. There was plenty of places to eat & a few shops around, & my saviour at 5am was the 24hour Deli! After 6 nights I had to move to the Pennsylvania Hotel to stay with my friend, where I had THE WORST stay, I just really wish I'd stayed at the Days Hotel for the whole duration of my trip.

However one thing I will say straight away there was NO EVIDENCE OF bed bugs at all. The lobby is great, and alas that's where it all ends. It seems that any money spent on the \"renovation\" is only done in the lobby area. The lifts are okay and small, however one of them I was in constantly kept self adjusting its self and took longer than normal to get up to my floor. So I used the stairs. The stairs are tacky and unclean. Complete with tumbleweed on them, I kid you not. The so called Gym, is just three machines. 1 Bike, 1 treadmill (that wasn't working) and another machine. They have a business centre, wow! Its just a machine selling overpriced telephone cards and overpriced paid internet access. The free wifi, only works in the lobby area, and is slower then a 56K modem. You'd be better popping up the road to McDonalds or Starbucks. Other guests were complaining about the speed as well, but the staff didn't seem to care. The rooms can be hit and miss based on the past photos. We got an okay room. It wasn't great. The carpet was dirty. The radiator leaked on the carpet to the point where a bit of the carpet had been ripped (not cut) away. The pipes constantly clanked all night. The bed wasn't made correctly and had short sheets which didn't completely cover the bed, oh and if you want a duvet, tough you don't get one. The bathroom had missing caulk and there were black marks in the bath itself. The towels were small and they didn't have any 'bigger' towels. Asked about the transfer to the Airport. Was told it was $65. I asked why, and was told \"that's the price take it or leave it\" by a rude member of staff who was sitting on the 'tourist desk'. Considering the taxi cabs that you hail from the street have a maximum fare of $45 between Manhattan and JFK someone is making a fast buck here. It has a great connection to the subway (metro) and is on 1 (local stopper) 2, 3 (express) lines. Its just a couple of stops to times square and 34th street.

Then I peaked in the bathroom and saw brown around the toilet. At that point- stay or not? We \"won\" the room on Priceline but there is a bottom threshold and this sure is no two star hotel. I don't think it even should have one star. The next thing I do it pull up the bedding to look for bedbug evidence. I found none, but what I did see was that the bottom sheet was more than a foot short of the bottom of the bed. Aw gee. Where did they get the deal on too short sheets? Then I looked at the bathrooom closely. It was clean so I decided to stay. But I noticed when I took my cold shower (it never got hot) that the caulking was missing from around the tub then looked up and saw leaks in my ceiling. This is basic maintenance 101.

When I suggested a room change the girl reacted aggressively raising her voice and not looking me in the eyes and after I stressed for the second time that it was impossible to sleep in a room with a malfunctioning AC and needed the Internet connection to work she reluctantly switched me to another room, scolded me and told me that \"if I had any other problem I would have to suck it up.\" It is unfathomable to me that I'm being chastised by an employee for asking for something that I paid for and thus have the right to. In this second room the Internet connection did not work either and another employee told me I would have to go to the lobby with my laptop if I wanted an Internet connection. This problem was, of course, not exclusively mine as there were other guests in the lobby (poorly taken care of, I must add, with old, worn and torn furniture and few seats) trying to use the Internet.

I chose this hotel based on its location, price and the fact that it offered private, rather than shared, bathrooms that seem to be common in hotels in this price range. I booked this hotel months in advance, as hotels on marathon weekend book up early and at some pretty outrageous prices! I held my breath and hoped that I wouldn't be arriving to find a dump. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this hotel was located across the street from the 96th St. subway station, as I was traveling with several bags and the thought of hiking down busy streets in cold weather for blocks on end did not appeal. (I later discovered a 2nd subway entrance just outside the hotel's entrance.) I had flown into JFK and taken the A train, then transferred to the 1 Uptown train. (This was a HUGE money saver -- about $7.50 vs. $45 cab + tolls + tip. Took just over an hour, not bad!) Check-in wasn't supposed to be until 3pm (I think), but the nice young man at the front desk said he could let me go ahead and check in, and he even upgraded me to a king! He even told me the best way to get down to midtown, where I would be headed later. He was really friendly and helpful. I got up to my room after managing to make my way out of the narrow elevator and find my way around the maze-like hallways. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got inside the room. Lovely king-sized bed with lots of extra pillows and extra velour blanket. Nice view of surrounding apartment buildings, as well as an overhead view of the city streets below. Coffeemaker, complete with extra packs of coffee and necessities -- super nice, when one is trying to travel on a budget. (Saved me from having to hit up Starbucks for my caffeine fix and was nice to know that I could have coffee on my early morning race day of 4 am!) Now came the make-or-break part of the room -- the bathroom. Much to my delight I found a nice, large, bright and CLEAN, modern bathroom. Tiled floor, granite counter-top and roomy bathtub, with overhead shower. No moldy grout, no yucky-looking toilet -- everything looked like new!! Whew!! No matter if the rest of the trip went sour, I knew I would be able to get a good night's sleep and be able to enjoy a nice soak after the marathon! I deducted one star for the condition of the carpet - it looked worn and a bit dirty. No matter as I never walk around in bare feet in a hotel room, anyway. I always pack flip-flops for this purpose. The rest of the room and bathroom were sparkling clean. Now to my one true complaint -- more an annoyance, really. I could not connect to the internet from my room, even though wireless internet is offered, free of charge. I called downstairs and the clerk told me I shouldn't be having any problems getting connected to their network. I spent over an hour of frustration trying to get online and finally gave up and went downstairs to address the problem in person. I was told by another clerk that I would need to bring my computer to the hotel's lobby, as the signal wasn't accessible from the hotel rooms. OK. I just wish the first person I'd spoken to would've told me this, and saved me the hour I wasted trying to connect from my room! I had plenty of company in the lobby, as at least a dozen other people were also working from their laptops. I was able to stay connected but the internet speed was a bit slow. Still, it worked and the hotel doesn't charge extra for it, so I was very happy about that! I spent 3 nights here and for the price I paid -- $169/night -- I considered it a real value! I knew other marathoners who were staying in midtown who paid at least twice as much per night as I did. I didn't bother to check whether this hotel offered any sort of room service, but when you've got so many food choices just outside your door in NYC, why bother? I don't think the hotel had any sort of restaurant. Not sure about workout facilities. I knew I would get plenty of exercise just walking around the city, not to mention the marathon I would be running during my stay:=) All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great value in a nice location! Hotel is situated at 94th/Broadway, so a walk of a few blocks will put you near Central Park West and there are all sorts of great places to eat, drink and people watch! If any future marathoners are looking for a great, convenient place to stay, this hotel is easily within about a 10 - 12 minute walk, once you've crossed the finish line in Central Park. Lots of places to grab a brew and a burger in the area, too!

There was an interesting mix of families and foreign tourists at the hotel, and some common areas so it seems like you could meet people if you wished to. There's a business center, as well, though I'm not sure what services it offers. When I asked about a take-out place nearby, I got directed to a diner around the corner that is definitely charging sit-down prices I'd say were fair but not good, and I especially didn't want to take out from there. If you're not looking to blow your money at every meal, scout around a bit to find somewhere cheaper. There's a Europa Cafe down two blocks that's reasonably priced for take-out (around 5-7$ for a made-to-order sandwich or breakfast) and a pizza place one block over and two blocks down that charges about two or three dollars for surprisingly good New York slice, called Famous Famiglia. When you're tired and cranky from arriving, I'd recommend that. Take a left when you leave the door of the hotel, turn left at the corner onto Amsterdam Avenue, and it's number 734 on the left a block or two down. All in all, I'm glad I stayed here, and I'd do it again if I wanted a night back in the city without imposing on friends.

Location: The hotel is on 94th Street, a few steps off of Broadway. There's an entrance to the subway in front of the bodega (\"94th Street Blueberry Farm\") across 94th from the hotel. Most of the prime tourist action is around Times Square, which you'd take a downtown train to get there. You have two choices: if you pick the express side of the platform, you're there in two stops, and it's very convenient. If you pick the local side, you'll still get there, but you will stop every couple of blocks. Pretty much every subway line connects at Times Square and that gets you anywhere in the city, so once you remember to take the express train to Times Square, you'll love this hotel and understand why they say that they're close to all the action. The Surrounding Neighborhood: You're blocks from Central Park, so if the weather is nice, grab your camera and take a walk. Turn left out of the hotel. You'll cross Amsterdam, Columbus, and then you'll be at Central Park West and the park will be across the street. We entered the park at 96th and Central Park West and found ourselves in the North Meadow, which is used for youth soccer games. There's also jogging trails, a nice children's playground, and benches to sit down and take a break. There are some nice places to eat off of Amsterdam, and some friendly pubs to grab a drink that are reasonably priced. One of New York's iconic deli's, Barney Greengrass, is within walking distance. It's not cheap, but if you want a real Jewish deli and not a \"concept\" restaurant, it's worth walking over for breakfast or lunch. (You'll also find a cheaper deli on Broadway with a good breakfast if you turn right out of the hotel and walk about a block past the Duane Reade.) If you grow tired of paying too much for a hamburger around Times Square and want to spend an evening living like a local, you're staying in a pretty nice residential neighborhood, so you have the option of hanging out with New Yorkers. The hotel itself: As with most New York hotels, the building is old and the elevators are tiny and slow. (I found the same size elevator at the Marriott East Side. The difference is that the Marriott's elevator looks nice inside and the Days Inn looks like someone went to Home Depot, grabbed some cheap plastic that you might use to line a bathroom wall and lined the elevator with it.) The carpet needs to be replaced. If you're in a room across from the ice machine (we were) you're going to hear noise. However, the important basic stuff is A-OK. The bed was comfortable, the pillows were thick and supportive, and hot water was never a problem. There is free WiFi. I couldn't get my phone to connect to the WiFi, but I did see people in the lobby with their laptops, so it did work for some people. There is a business center where you can pay by the minute to use a computer. You will pay for all phone calls, even 800 numbers. There is a tour desk where they'll hook you up with sightseeing or airport shuttles, although I opted to skip that because I've been to the city enough to know where I'm going (or use HopStop to tell me how to get there).

We booked this hotel last minute for a graduation and we liked the location. When we arrived, we checked in and went to our room. The room was dark, dingy, with old nasty carpet and a nasty smell to it. The mini fridge in the room was broken. After taking showers to freshen up (the showers had low pressure and not great). We decided to deal with the room and just enjoy the city. The location of the hotel was the only thing about this hotel that is a plus. Right in the Upper West Side at Broadway and right next to the subway. We arrived back to our room late at night and got ready for bed.......and this is when the real disaster begins. The toilet started overflowing and overflowing and overflowing, we could NOT get it to stop, it took up the entire bathroom and room (several inches of water), we kept on calling the front desk, who kept on saying \"our cleaning and maintenance people are gone for the day, so why don't you call back tomorrow.\" We finally went downstairs and stated that we could not walk in our room, since the entire floor was flooded, they offered us towels and told us we need to clean up the excess water in the room, so that it does not spread to the downstairs room. We insisted we needed help, and this was no fix the problem with a few towels matter, they downgraded us to a smaller room, which was even nastier and dustier. The next day, we spoke with the manager about our issues, and how we had our feet in several inches of feces contaminated water, and how no one would lend us a hand, and we had to practically force them to give us a new room, and he offered no apology and no compensation. We had pre-payed for 3 nights and wanted to get a refund for the remaining 2 nights, so that we could go stay someplace decent and clean (without feces and toilet water floating around), and of course, he refused. So were forced to stay in our smaller, downgraded room for the next 2 nights. Lucky for us, we love Manhattan, and we spend lots of time in the city and took advantage of the loation of the nasty hotel and barely set foot in the hotel, other than to get some minimal sleep. After this experience we will only stay at hotels with a solid 4 star rating, and we will be sure to read reviews on tripadvisor before we book a room. Our mistake for just blindly booking with today's internet resources available. We still managed to have a great time in NYC, but the Days Hotel is a filthy dump, with nasty carpet, and dirty interiors and a horrible plumming system (I met people in the lobby who had toilet issues as well), and the manager who is also likely the owner is as real jerk, who would not even think of helping or doing the bare minimum to satisfy his customers NEVER EVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!

If this is likely to bother you, I strongly recommend looking for somewhere else to stay during your trip. We had a couple of issues with our room. Firstly, a pressure nozzle in the radiator would occasionally release, leaving steam hissing out for a time quite frequently. Colourfully described by my roommate as sounding like 'two mice having a fry-up', the noise was initially irritating but eventually became white noise. Secondly, the provided hair dryer broke after giving off a pitifully weak blast of lukewarm air. I could not, however, impugn upon the cleanliness of the room; unlike some other reviews posted here, every sheet was clean, as was the floor, bathroom, and the rest of the room. There were certainly no bedbugs. The decor of the hotel and rooms is rather dated, and although the lobby is made to look impressive it rather fails for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are books on tables that create a good look until you realise the books are glued together, which makes it look tacky rather than classy. The elevators broke down several times during our short time there: if you choose this hotel, work off the basis that you will need to haul your luggage up the stairs. The location is not in any way ideal, though the area is relatively safe. There are some good places to eat nearby, but a subway station on the same block as the hotel means that location becomes more or less a moot point unless you're looking for views.

There were alot of hotels that would not book me because I was not staying for more than one night and it was \"not acceptable for someone to occupy a room for one night that another person could occupy for up to three nights\" (i.e we need the money) I went onto bookings.com and found the Days Inn on 94th street.

We came back to the hotel at 3pm and they processed us and gave us room 515. We went to the elevator (which is a tiny little death trap) and got off on the fifth floor. The floor was VERY confusing as towards were to go. It reminded me of the Shining. We got in the door and entered the room. The room is very small. You have to remember the hotel was built in the 1920s. The bed was very comfortable. The closet was huge, but I thought it could use more hangers for people staying longer. The TV didn't get that many channels and every once in a while the sound would disappear and then come back. The heater made strange sounds, but it was nice and toasty in the room. The bathroom like most hotels is not made for tall people. I am about 6'3 and the shower didn't have that much room in it. Plus if you stepped out the wrong way, your foot would wind up in the toilet. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, towels, face clothes, and even a small tube of toothpaste were in the bathroom.

There were four of us in one room (husband, son 7, daughter-18 and myself). My husband was there for a convention and the kids and I tagged along for a vacation. We were a little skeptical with this property especially after all the negatives reviews it had received. But we had no choice as this was the hotel my husband\u2019s employer booked. This stay was booked on hotels.com for $149 a night. But we were surprised at how decent the hotel was. CHECK-IN: Pretty simple, fast and easy. We arrived at 1:30pm and of course our room was not ready. The staff was polite and advised us to come back at 2:30pm. They recommended we leave our luggage (10 pieces) with the bellhop, David, while we went to get a quick bite. David took our entire luggage and secured it with a metal cord in the lobby area and our 2 laptops were safely secured in their office. We were a little hesitant, but we had no choice. We were really hungry since we left Miami at 7am! We came back an hour later and our room was ready. David delivered all of our belongings to our room and we tipped him for his hard work. ROOM: Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking 94th Street. The room was small but in NYC all the rooms are small. But were able to accommodate ourselves perfectly and the size of the room was never an issue. As a matter of fact, I did see a queen size room and that room was extremely small. So we were actually pretty lucky. The room was very nice, two queen beds with typical hotel (polyester) comforters and pillows, and pillow top mattresses. We all slept VERY well. I have to say that the best thing about this Days Inn (rm. 418) was the incredible bed. It was unbelievably soft. Not typical of this kind of hotel. The bathroom was in good shape, there were plenty of fluffy, white towels for all. Some no name brand toiletries were provided, as were a hairdryer and coffee maker. The bathroom was very clean. I loved the curved shower rod and it made me determined to include one in the upcoming renovation of my kids' bathroom. Elevator: We did not have a problem with the elevator, as had been reported by some. It was always right there when we wanted it. But the elevators were terribly small and very old. Area Restaurants: Tips for dinners: there various Italian Pizza Shops on every corner. As well as Japanese, Subway, McDonalds etc. There is a Sushi Place right across the street and they deliver. We order from them almost everyday we were there. Right on the corner of Broadway and 94th Street (as seen in pics) there is a 24hr Drug store called Duane Reade. We bought snacks and water from there to keep in or room. Oh one important note. They have an ATM inside that only charges $.99 fee for a transaction. Everywhere is $2.00 -$3.00 per transaction. Transportation: There are 3 Subway stations in a 2 block radius that can get you downtown. The station on 96th St will put you on the \u201cONE\u201d train and that goes all the way to Canal St. (China Town shopping) and the World Trade Center area. They had a special for $10 you were able to ride 6 times. So 3 people could ride twice or 6 people could ride 6 times etc. Taxi fare into midtown (40th) was $13 and downtown (St. Marks & 14th ST) was $16-$17. The train is the way to go but it was hot but not too crowded. Overall: I did not encounter any bed bugs or roaches what so ever. No strange characters roaming the floors or the neighborhood. This is a great area. Central park is 2 blocks east the hotel. The staff was great. My worst complaint was the noise coming from our next door neighbors. They were out of the room very early (we like to sleep in) 7am sometimes and they would let the room door slam continuously! Very annoying. But we dealt with it.

Despite the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door, I heard the housekeeping staff shouting to each other across the floor around 9am each morning. This was not simple work conversation, but out-and-out shouting. The elevator situation is dire. There seem to be four elevators, although I cannot be sure how many work. They are incredibly slow and very small (two or three people with luggage would be the maximum load). One morning opted for the stairs; the windows in the stairwell had been left open, and pouring rain was covering the stairs with water. Needless to say, I fell down the first flight of stairs I encountered. I decided that the 10-minute wait for the elevator was a a small price to pay to avoid the possible injury those stairs could cause.

After checking in we walked to the elevator and what we witnessed was shocking, dirty air vents, peeling tile, peeling wallpaper, dust & debris everywhere. While stepping out of the elevator we encountered a nasty, dirty, dusty, and just plain unclean lobby. It looked as if a tornado of renovation (that had been there for 20 decades) went through it. Opening the door to our hotel room was like opening the gates to another portal called: Dumpoland! It was repulsive.. the carpet was worn and dirty, the wallpaper was stuck to the wall with thumbtacks, the hot water didn't work (in fact the bathroom was horrendous.. with dirt,grime,and dust in every crease and crack), I do not want to go on, but so long as I am preventing another living and breathing human being from checking into that hotel. The window view was of a beautifully built brick wall. The sheets were dirty and greasy, and my Mother did not get a wink of sleep that night. It was her dream to go to New York and see the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade, she was almost in tears that night and the next morning, she could not bear to see her family stay in that filthy hotel. The next morning my brother and I were woken up very early by my Mom and Dad, we changed and called a cab. We stayed at that hotel for only 4 1/2 hours (if you still aren't convinced it was that bad), we found a Holiday Inn for a much cheaper price. The Holiday Inn was nicer than any ounce of that hotel.

We used the subways alot, & there is a subway station just across the road, I would recommend that you purchase an all day hopper pass for just $7.00 per day, these are excellent value for money, and the number 1 train takes you from the top to the bottom of the island so you don't need to get of and transfer. The hotel is quite far up, but we liked to walk up through Central Park then cut across, you will lose so much weight by the end of this holiday with all the walking. A taxi to Times Square cost about $10.00, not bad. I can't forget please check out Keywest resturant, the food is fantastic!!!

I can only say I wished I'd heeded the majority advice and changed hotels. It appears that the hotel has changed hands and become part of the Days Inn chain and boy, have they got some work to do. The foyer is generally ok and check-in was swift although I wasn't happy to be told I couldn't use the room phone as I had pre-paid. It meant all local & national calls had to be made using my mobile (cellphone) and as I'm from the UK, that has cost me a bomb. Why couldn't they take my credit card details like all other hotels do? There are 2 sets of elevators: don't use the ones on the right of reception as they never seem to arrive. Our room had to be entered via the stairway (filthy) and there was no aircon in the halls and corridors so waiting for the elevators was like being in a sauna. The room was reasonably sized considering we would be spending the minimum of time in it and the aircon worked really well. That's the end of the good points. We only had 1 thin pillow each on the double bed; on our first night there we asked for more, they eventually arrived 4 nights later after 5 more requests. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the net curtains were filthy as was the small cupboard over the sink (I refused to open the one under the sink for fear of what I might find.) The carpet was also filthy. The shower and toilet worked fine but the bath plughole was obviously blocked as it filled up with about 4\" of water before draining. Again we reported this on the first night; their solution after 3 days was to remove the handle for lowering the plug. Genius! Towel replacement was erratic; initially we had 3 bath towels (not particularly big though) 2 hand towels and 2 flannels. Over the next 4 days these numbers fluctuated form 1 bath towel and 3 flannels to a mix of everything. Overall, I suppose for the rates we paid things could have been worse.

The single seat was stained and unuseable, the room phone did not work and thebedding looked suspect. We stayed one night, sleeping fully dressed on top of the bed.

Did not feel 100% safe. We may be too choosey however stayed there four nights (1 - 5 Dec) and found 3 cockroaches, one escaped capture... Room, well OK except alot of things were broken or kind of fixed. Corners of room had not seen a cleaner for several months. No hot water one morning. TV reception was poor. Most things worked Ok however the room was very tired. I know NY is not cheap, however could have found a cheaper / better hotel in London. Bellman was helpful and had a good sense of humour. Mexican food next door I would recommend. Subway very close on 96th. Good good places to eat breakfast close by.

Each visit has been for a full week. Our first stay was in April 2002; our second stay in late September/early October 2004 cost almost exactly double--an encouraging sign, I suppose, that New York tourism is prospering once again. We feel that the Quality Hotel is worth every penny even at the higher rate. Rooms small but clean and comfortable. Had small frig both times. Bathrooms shiny and new but be careful on those darn tile floors. 94th Street sounds remote but in practice not a problem at all. There are bus stops and an express subway stop almost at the door--you can be anywhere in no time--we made it one day to the Staten Island ferry in just 25 minutes. There is a real neighbourhood feel to the area that is a refreshing change after a day in the more boisterous tourist-clogged areas. Safe walking area even at night, people sitting out on the boulevard benches at midnight. Good, reasonably-priced restaurants abound in this area. Key West Diner on ground floor of hotel open all hours and has intriguing Manhattan staff and clientele, excellent, cheap breakfasts, though other meals more variable. Also a Tex-Mex place right in hotel but we didn't try it. People often complain, in particular, of two things at New York budget hotels--lousy elevators and lousy windows/views. Here this place shines: there are four elevators (we have never had to wait more than a minute) and both our rooms have had big windows overlooking not a neighbouring wall or air shaft but a sunfilled street view and a beaut of a view, too, Broadway at its Upper West side widest, with a boulevard full of trees and flowers. Staff seemed reasonably courteous and efficient: wakeup calls made as requested, early morning cab call made as requested, and a plugged toilet fixed one morning between time we left for breakfast and our return.", "Date": "October 9, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Days Hotel Broadway", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d142114-Reviews-Days_Hotel_Broadway-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$154 - $911*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">215 W 94th St &amp; Broadway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10025</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514546", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/10/33/1033bd37393144a66e952975c11178b82large.jpg"}}
