This is a new hotel in western area of HK island, not that centrally located, but well, HK island is of that size, it cannot be too inconvenient. We got upgraded to a suite, you cannot expect too much of a HK hotel because the size must be small considering the city's limited living space, but the suite is quite well-equiped, a bedroom and a living room with fridge and sink and cupboards and a small dining table, TV-set and sofa. Quite decent. The only shortcoming is that the water flows a bit slowly in the shower.

Tiresome if you are going to be ladden with heavy bags of shopping. So it may be more convenient to hitch a ride on the trams or buses, which stop a block or so behind the hotel. The suites have a decent size, good layout and nice decor. Still a bit of a squeeze here and there, but fine for a couple. Bathroom amenities like shampoo, hair rinse and body wash are of good quality, and come in adequate 60ml containers refreshed every day. You get a big bottle of water and two small ones with compliments daily, adequate for making tea in-room (sadly no instant coffee packs, sugar or milkmare supplied; only peppermint and camomile tea packs). The hotel is generous with an open pantry when you can help yourself freely to sodas, snacks, fruits, Nespresso coffee and a small continental breakfast every day. There is also a small selection of DVDs, CDs and books you can borrow without having to sign in and out. The free usage of two laptops in the pantry is also much welcome. Overall, service staff are efficient and cordial. Don't expect any warmth or personality from them. A pity, because that may have induced us to return more assuredly, rather than contemplate trying the somewhat similar but 50% cheaper 60 West located at the tram stops behind (although the latter took a whole week to respond to our enquiries and was thus passed over this time).", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing, China", "Title": "\u201cVery good experience, def a recommend\u201d", "Author": "Yonghui W", "ReviewID": "UR127856350", "Content": "Like the hotel a lot, not too much room, as most of the hotels in Hong Kong, but definitely enough.

The rooms were great but we had to stay in two different ones due to our extended stay - the executive room on the higher floor had a little lounge area and kitchenette which was a nice bonus.

A small coffee shop which serves amazing hot breakfasts every morning to free wi-fi in each guest room. The staff is very polite and accommodating. Initially I thought the price was high but it is really good value for money at around USD 120/night inclusive of taxes. They do not have a room service restaurant but the location is filled with them around. There is a super market, chemist, photo lab, metro and the main busy downtown street is just around the corner as well so there is nothing to complain about. The rooms are nice, moderately sized, fitted with amazing toiletries, hair dryer, lcd tv and a very good view of the sea from some rooms. Almost everything you can ask for in a good hotel.

It's a short walk to the Sheung Wan station on the Island Line and a HKD20-25 ride from Central/Lan Kwai Fong area. Overall, the rooms are very clean and newly renovated - looks like they have a corporate discount at Ikea and/or West Elm. The beds are firm and rooms are pretty well insulated against noise. The bathrooms are compact but very efficient. Water takes a minute to warm-up, but it'll get firey hot if you like an especially toasty shower. My complaints are few if any. The hotel shares the building with other offices, so you have to go thru a general entryway to get to the lobby on the 4th Floor which can be a little confusing, especially when you're meeting people in the \"lobby\". The immediate neighborhood is nice and safe, but you have to walk a few minutes to get a coffee, sandwich, dinner, etc. Therefore, you are very CLOSE to the happening neighborhood of SoHo/Lan Kwai Fong, but you're *in* said neighborhoods.

So glad we did this instead of getting a regular room, as even this was on the small side. Still, it was nice to have a separate space with a small dining table and a kitchen area. The kitchenette could have done with a microwave, there was certainly enough space for it. The bedroom had excellent black-out curtains, which I wish was standard in every hotel room, but isn't always. The bed was nice and firm. The layout in the bedroom was slightly odd, as the bedroom door opened onto the closet door, and they were always clashing. The full length mirror in the bedroom closet was smoked and dark, so although it looked nice, you couldn't really use it for make-up or getting dressed as you could hardly see in it. The bathroom was tiny and functional, with frosted glass windows and doors. A bit of a gap in the door. I'm not sure how comfortable I would be sharing this room with someone I wasn't very familiar with. The rain shower wasn't powerful enough which was a shame, and the drain was on the side of the wall instead of on the floor, so the water wouldn't drain properly. I'm putting pictures up of their nice comfortable breakfast room which had a simple but effective spread of fruit, toast, tea, and coffee. Overall, the room was well sound proofed, which is a big deal to me. The best thing for me was that you could walk to the MTR quite easily. It took about seven minutes to walk there. I timed it one morning. However, if you're the type who gets totally bored waiting for the elevators to arrive, then don't stay here! We're usually quite patient, but because this hotel is in a mixed-use building (there were offices and residences, I think), we waited quite often, and quite long for the elevators. Not a deal breaker, but something to consider. They had free wifi in the rooms, which we used. Oh, and they provided complimentary Hampstead Tea bags from London, which are organic and fairtrade. We got chamomile, peppermint, and ginger and lemon. I know it sounds lame, but I love getting the same type of tea that I drink at home!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taiyuan, China", "Title": "\u201cAffordable, contemporary Hong Kong hotel\u201d", "Author": "travellevret", "ReviewID": "UR121701406", "Content": "I selected this hotel mostly because it was a busy weekend, and this was by far the best price I could find. I was very pleased, though it will not be the place for everyone. Cons: -Rooms are very small--hardly any place to put a suitcase. -Shower entry is small--a very large person might not be able to get into it due to narrow entry. -Lobby is on fourth floor, hotel are on a few floors of high-rise--not your typical hotel layout. -No MTR (metro) close, though I think new stations are being built, and there is a tram and buses nearby -Taxi drivers not so sure of location -Wait for elevator could be long Pros: -My room overlooked a garden--not another building! (This is kind of a big deal in Hong Kong) -Very clean, modern room. Small, but upscale -Nice extras--a box of quality shampoo, conditioner, etc. -Boutique feel, small but upscale -Free wifi -Great neighborhood -Check-in service was outstanding. Generally good service. -Really feel like you are in Hong Kong--locals live and work in this building -Free (though simple) breakfast. Nice deck. -Nice, comfortable bed. I really like the area, which is now my favorite to stay in Hong Kong. Hollywood Road is the oldest road in Hong Kong, and has lots of antique shops and Western bars and cafes. It is a nice walk to soho and not far from the harbour and Sun Yat-sen park. Hollywood park across the street is small, but very nice. Overall, I really enjoyed this hotel. Another guest complained about the shower not draining properly and also was having trouble with the key card not working on the elevator. I don't think I would have wanted to share my small room with anyone, but as a solo traveler it was almost perfect--if only there was a suitcase stand.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again.\u201d", "Author": "DanielHOz", "ReviewID": "UR121573943", "Content": "Modern inside.
