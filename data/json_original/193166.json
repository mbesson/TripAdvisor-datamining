We complained at the reception and we agreed to a move whilst leaving our re-packed luggage at the reception for the day. Arriving back at about 6pm we were allocated another room, similar to our original room which we also described as shabby. The double bed springs had gone and there was a noticeable divett in the matress. The ensuite door had a hole in it. The wc cistern handle was heavily corroded and it was brown nearest to the cistern. We complained again and the receptionist visited the room. He agreed that it was poor and said that he was unable to move us all to another room as the hotel was full. However, the extractor fan did work! Breakfasts? Well, what can we say?

The beds had covers that belonged to a different era and would benefit from a proper wash. The so called bed settee had a cover on with black stains and no bedding was supplied until having a shouting match with the ignorant unhelpful muppet on the desk. Washed my hands and while drying them realised the towel was damp with blood stains on. The overall appearance of the room was very tatty and patched up, chipped walls, ceiling and doors all dirty. Breakfast was such an unhappy experience-no juice just very weak squash, cold toast, with cheese, eggs and jam all of which tastes as cheap and rubbery as possible. There is no room in the dining area to either get food onto your plate or to sit and eat. As a result of the free for all fight they inadequately named breakfast, mine ended up on the floor, we decided to go out to eat. The carpet on the stairs leading to the dining area was stained, dirty and threadbare. The whole experience was so grim and depressing and not sure what the people employed to clean do but it sure isn't doing their job well.

My husband booked this hotel for its location if nothing else, as we only needed a bed to sleep on for one night. I had very low expectations, and still this hotel (it doesn't even merit the title of a \"hotel\") managed to disappoint and disgust me. I've been to over a hundred hotels and hostels and inns in my lifetime so that's saying something. I suspect the place got a 3-star rating because the owner (cleverly) invested all their resources in the lobby area, because I cannot imagine how it could have gotten the rating with its old, grubby rooms. So, here's the list: tiny room, broken window, tiny TV with poor reception, could barely stand in the bathroom (was actually surprised the shower had hot water), disgusting mattress and blankets (wondered if they had ever been washed in their long lifetime), crappy breakfast (toast, basic cornflakes, boiled eggs and bad coffee) At first, the toilet wouldn't flush, so we told reception on our way out to eat dinner. I guess, looking at some of the other reviews, we're actually lucky they actually fixed it. My husband tried to make a call using the hotel phone but it wouldn't work, so he called to ask reception and they actually told us \"that service is no longer available, because some of the other guests had misused that service\", whatever that means. Also, we got a call from reception to come down, because they'd charged our hotel stay to somebody else's credit card, which is a totally different and serious problem as it really got me worried about the safety of our credit card information as well. The misery of the hotel followed me even after I checked out and left, because I fell sick a couple of hours after eating the crappy breakfast, which I strongly suspect was from milk that had gone bad, because toast and milk at the hotel was the only thing I'd eaten that morning. In short, this place has NOTHING to offer in terms of cleanliness, security, comfort, health and even location (you can easily find other much better accommodations at similar distances from the tube station; I know because I've stayed in one, but I won't mention the name).", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it!!\u201d", "Author": "Genie18", "ReviewID": "UR43087609", "Content": "I read the reviews after booking the hotel through Lastminute.com and so was dreading staying there (really wish I'd read the reviews first).

It was probably ok as a hostel and certainly wasn't even a 1 star tourist class hotel in my view. I actually booked through the hotels own website where the photos looked decent and the description inviting. They also had an unfeasibly good deal on the week I wanted to stay...I should've twigged that this was too good to be true! I booked for 4nts for about \u00c2\u00a330 per night in a single ensuite. Which for a well-located hotel is excellent. However, I didn't get value for money or the service I was expecting from a hotel listed as 3star. A palace it aint and calling it a hotel is stretching it, more like a backpackers hostel. First of all you have to find it. The pictures make it seem that the entrance is facing the lovely square but it isn't. It's on a wide street where it's Princes Sq on one side of the street and Leinster Sq on the other. Confusing and annoying when you've got to trek your luggage in sub-zero wintryness. First impressions weren't great. The reception staff were brusque and made you feel like you were disturbing their telly watching. I was given a card key and hoped that this would lead me to a clean, comfortable, quiet room. Luckily they had a small lift and I was on the 2nd floor. I got out and the carpet was worn out in places and alarm bells in my head sounded. Passing through the narrow - one person at a time - corridor I saw that some room doors had obviously been broken into before. My room had two single beds with large sash window looking out onto the square which was nice. Except the windows were old and dirty. The room was a riot of multicoloured patterns from the carpet, curtains and bedspread. It hurt my eyes to look at it all, so I ripped off the frilly flowery nylon bedcover. To my horror, there was fluff and hairs all over th underside of it. I flung it on top of the wardrobe and there it stayed. The pillows were flat and rubbish and the bedding was cheap and nasty. No duvets just fleecy blankets and sheets. I wasn't looking forward to sleeping on it. There wasn't much heating on and it felt very cold. The bathroom was ok, some mould on the tiles. But you could tell that they try to keep it clean but the fixtures are old and worn out giving further bad impressions. The shower worked ok but there was no bath plug (NB to work the shower just turn the large middle knob on its own). The towels are old and frayed and not as fresh as expected. I thought that the single toiletry - sliver of soap - they provided was too funny. I later went out and bought a bar of baby soap from Boots for 57p so that I could compare them. I expected to have tea/coffee making facilities in my room but nothing was evident. When I asked about this they said that it was available only from the reception lobby. The TV worked ok and there was a pathetic little hairdryer in the dressing table drawer. There was hanging space but not enough hangers or any shelves. My door had a huge gap at the bottom where the whole floor was on a slant. I had to open my bathroom door across it to obscure it. Don't expect to get much good sleep or any possibility of a restful lie in. Get earplugs. The floors and doors creak and you can hear the person next door or above you snoring, walking, flushing toilet. You don't have the option of not being disturbed in the morning because the eastern european maids must be paid by the number of rooms they clean and they're very persistent. They'll knock loudly from about 8am and keep on. They probably think that everyone likes to get up early and have breakfast on holiday! I don't eat breakfast so I can't comment on what that was like - I can only guess. I suppose the maids being persistent is a good thing as the rooms are cleaned as well as possible and at least I didn't get bitten by any bugs (first thing I did was look for signs of buglife!) Overall, the hostel is shabby and staff are abrupt and verging on the rude. The beds, bedding and towels all need complete change. If it's not hotel whites it must be hiding something? I left a day early and went home. I couldn't stand it anymore. I'd spent the whole day out touring lovely London and meeting friends in the evening but hated knowing that I wasn't going to get a comfortable and restful sleep in that place. The ONLY good thing about the hostel is the location. Being so close to Bayswater and Queensway tube, restaurants, shopping and several good bus routes. Walking distance of Kens' High St and Portobello. If this is your only criteria then good luck but I would strongly advise you to budget more.

The bathroom was a complete joke - some old shower probably still in there from when the house was built which, no matter how hard you try floods the bathroom floor - and overflows the stand that you are in - causing a little pool in your bathroom. The sink was off the wall and the toilet was filthy! The bed was rock hard - probably would have been comfier laying on the wet bathroom floor, and the bed was disgustingly full of stains over the mattress and the pillows. There were also bug remains on the walls and ceilings! As we were staying for one night only we thought we would tough this night out and get out of that hell hole as quickly as possible in the morning. The nights sleep was almost as terrible as the room. The door down the hall squeaks so loudly when people use it and slams even louder.In general it was pretty noisy throughout the whole night with people slamming doors, banging on the walls, leaky taps, and being in the basement you got all the noise from the staff at some unearthly hour!

There's just enough room to maneuver around the room. Our four suitcases had to be left vertical. The mattress looks like they been used for a very long time. The pillows looks yellowish. The view of the outside world was limited to looking into neighbouring pipes and drains with just a hint of sunlight and the greenery which fellow travellers have mentioned further below. Arrived on a thursday with the plans to depart the following thursday. Viola, the receptionist expressed SURPRISE that we were going to stay that long. Truth be told, we didn't. We asked for better rooms but were told nothing available until Sunday. Jose! We handed the keys back straight away once the reception guy confirmed that we will incur a 2 day stay penalty. This I accepted. I called the booking agency and they said they'd liaised with the hotel for my refund. Over the next few days, the hotel played hardball. Example..receptionist will say they have no idea where their manager is. My booking agency called them on numerous occassion to be told the same thing. I showed up at the hotel for two consecutive days to be told the same thing. Am still waiting for my refund. My advice to all of you fellow travellers is to read the above again if you're even half thinking about staying at Pembridge Palace Hotel. Bayswater is a wonderful place to stay. Few minutes from Whiteleys shopping arcade. Marks and spencers and Tesco supermarket nearby. Central Line at Queensway which is a minute walk from Bayswater station served by both the Circle and District Line. Great Chinese restaurant especially Hung Tao for their roasted duck rice. Fantastic Italian meals at Bella Italia. I shifted to Grand Plaza at 42 Princes Square, Bayswater, W2 4AD, London. Cost me 40% more but got 3 times the space and ten times the cleanliness.

Our stay was surprisingly pleasant as we had been getting increasingly worried after reading the bad reviews. We booked through (--) and the price for a double room was GBP 55. The staff, all of which spoke excellent English, was helpful, we needed a ligthbulb and it was changed right away and when we asked if we could borrow a wine opener they saw to it right away and brought it to our room. The room was on the 3rd floor next to the elevator and was small but clean. The lobby was really nice with beautiful chandeliers. We had some problems with the TV's antenna and could only watch one channel. The bathroom was in mint condition, and the water pressure in the shower was REALLY good, with as much hot water as we wanted. We had expected some bed-bugs and that scared us as we don't have any in our country, Iceland, but didn't encounter any. Maybe we just got lucky, who knows, but everything was to our satisfaction and we would definately stay in this hotel again. If you come there by taxi tell the taxi driver that the entrance to the hotel is on Leinster Square, which is a one-way street, as it is not that easy to find, and our taxi driver cruised a bit trying to find the hotel. If you come by train then Bayswater station is a 5 minutes\u00c2\u00b4 walk from the hotel, just take a left turn when you come to Whiteleys Shopping Center, walk to the end of that part of Prince's Square, turn right and then immediately left on Leinster Square and in the middle of that street is the hotel. Once found it is easily found again :) Bayswater Road is just a 5 minutes' walk from the hotel where you can catch buses to Oxford Street and the ride takes about 5 minutes. One of the buses takes you directly to Piccadilly Circus so it is easy to get back to the hotel if you want to spend your evenings down-town. The ride back at nights takes about 18-20 minutes.

When I checked in at 4am, the receptionist was clearly annoyed by this. He gave me the room key, and one more key, saying \"You will have your own bathroom\". Really? So I had to go out of my room to get to the bathroom. Well, well. It probably wont kill me, I figured. Then, when I came to the room, no 213, it was freezing cold. They had left the window open, so the room was like a refrigerator. The radiator on the wall didn't work, but the room was equipped with a small heater that turned itself off all the time. The room itself was tiny, as well as the bed. I could not fit in there lying on my stomach, and I am only 180 cm. And the bathroom. If you like broken tiles, dirty floor and toilet, a shower cabinet that has been glued several times, this is the place for you. It also had two cranes for cold and hot water, placed so far off each other that you either had to use ice cold water, or boiling hot. There was no way of combining the two. All they provide for guests is towels and some crappy soap bars. No shampoo, drinking cup or things you normally find in a hotel. I did not sleep well that night. I froze all night, and the building is so old, you can hear anyone move. The only positive thing is that there was little traffic noise. I asked the receptionist if they had a hotel safe in the reception. The answer was \"for documents only\". Which user of this crappy hotel carries around documents? So the answer would be no. The hotel does not rent or lend out travel adapters for foreign electrical equipment, which I think is an obvious thing for a hotel to have. I paid 100 pounds to stay here three nights, and if I knew what I know now, I would never ever go here. I guess someone may think this is a \"charming\" place, but I don't.

The walls were marked up with numerous areas of plaster peeling off. The place was filthy. The beds were uncomfortable and the bottom sheet was directly on the mattress with no covering inbetween-- and my sheet had holes in it, so God knows what I was exposed to.

The neighbourhood is fine in the day time, but at night, especially on the weekend, that particular block seems to be a hang out for young people who are quite drunk, urinating in the street, shouting at all passerbys. The tiles on the walls in the bathroom were broken and the there was water damage and mould on the bathroom ceiling. The rooms are very cramped, so you really have no place to open your suitcase. I could fill up pages and pages with more, but I'm sure you get the idea. The one positive thing I can manage to say about the place, is that the water pressure in the shower is great, and so we enjoyed nice showers.

They only provide 1 on each bed and they ran out of extra pillows on the 1st day. 2. Take bug spray and spray yourself good before you go to bed. We found huge spiders in our room every day. We did not however see any bed bugs. 3. The elevator is scary. We were on the 4th floor and were contstantly being stuck in it. If your not claustrophobic, you'll survive. 4. The bathroom was actually not bad at all. We always had clean towels...but, we never had hot water in the morning. Take your showers at night if you can. also, they do not provide Kleenex, an alarm clock, or any type of radio. Bring your own because it's EXPENSIVE in the stores. I bought a $3.99 travel alarm to bring with me. 5. They provide coffee and tea on the main floor 24/7 which is nice. I brought a travel mug with me so that I could bring up to my room without any spillage as they only provide little take-out cups. (I never went to the breakfast, so I can't comment on that). 6. Google the area!!!!! All the buildings look the same and it is very confusing if you don't have a good map with you. It took us 2 days to get our bearings. Overall. The hotel was satisfactory. The owners do not speak very good english though and they are not very pleasant either. But.....I wasn't there to socialize with them anyways. They were though happy to give me an adapter for my video camera to use since \"Source One\" sold me the wrong one!! That was nice of them.

No problems here with smelly towels or bed bugs etc, so I guess they have sorted out those problems because everything was clean.

My husband and I stayed here for a week in August and had heard previously not to expect too much from London hotels, however we were surprised with the state the hotel was in. The lobby is quite nice with staff that do their job but don't offer any friendlyness. The lift is very old but pretty spacious compared to others i've seen, although it can be fairly tempremental and not move at all sometimes. We worked out the trick is to not push any buttons until everyone is in the lift, then it doesn't get stuck! The hallways are a good indicator of the state of the hotel; the walls are covered in scuff marks and paint is chipped off. Our suitcases only just managed to fit down the hallway, and the floors are very sqeaky. Our room was very, very small; 2 single beds (when we'd booked a double) squished together, a cupboard in the corner that could't be opened fully because the bed was in the way and a TV on a stand. Absolutely no room for our suitcases so we had to jam them behind the door! The bathroom was not too small; a shower over a tub (which is a bonus because most hotels don't even have tubs), toilet and basin. There's no plug for the hand basin so ensure you don't leave ur jewellery anywhere near the sink! The buffet breakfast is quite adequate and filled us up til dinner on most days. It consists of toast (very, very old toaster that takes around 10mins), warm eggs, jam, cheese, 4 kinds of cereal, coffee, apple and orange juice. The staff are good at replenishing the food although they don't seem to know the words 'excuse me' because they tend to push to get past you. Overall, in my opinion, the most important thing when staying in London is that the hotel is clean because it's main purpose is a base to sleep at night. This hotel is at least clean and serves that purpose, plus we got it for $80 AUD per night so no complaints with the price! After travelling the rest of Europe, we stayed at this hotel again on arriving back in London because it was clean and central to the city.

Though the hotel was a bit small, and the triple room very cramped, it seemed clean enough superficially (except perhaps the towels, which smelled awful), but then I was to discover that there was more to the hotel under the surface. On the night of Saturday 10th September, I went to bed in a perfect state of health and nothing to report in terms of dermatological problems. When I woke up on the morning of Sunday 11th September, my body was absolutely covered with bites that appear to be consistent with bedbug or flea bites (as my dermatologist has also told me). This is most probably the source of the bites, because I was clothed with pajamas and the windows were closed entirely due to the cold (thereby excluding mosquitoes, which could not get into the covers of a bed and through the pajamas anyway). I woke up with dozens of bites, the majority of which were located on a straight line going all up my right arm, starting at the elbow and leading all the way to the middle of my back. Besides these terribly itchy bites, I also had many other isolated irritating bites on both hands, my other arm, both of my legs, both of my feet and even two on my face. Whatever was inside the Pembridge Palace Hotel room that night practically ate me alive and made the whole rest of my stay in London an itching nightmare. I have photographs showing the huge number of bites I had all over, and shockingly the marks from them have not completely disappeared more than two weeks later. When I attempted to complain to the management that morning, the receptionists at the front desk, though they were polite and allowed us to change rooms, never let me speak with a hotel manager. On Sunday, they claimed there were no managers available on that day of the week, and then on Monday when I repeated my request, they said there were no managers that day either. According to them, a chambermaid inspected the room and \"found nothing,\" but anyone working in a hotel should know that bedbugs cannot be found through a quick visual inspection. I am hoping that your Health and Safety Team staff can check the place out. We were staying in room 110. My reason for writing to you is to formally complain that the hotel room which the Pembridge Palace had provided us with was completely unfit for human use. Either the bed or sheets on the single bed were obviously infested with something that needs to be fumigated (it was a triple room with a double bed and a single bed). And it would have been nice if the hotel could have offered something more than just a change of room and an apology from a lower-level employee to make up for the fact that my last two days (or in other words half of my stay) in London were a miserable nightmare of itching, scratching and bad moods, since I felt awful and looked disfigured on half my body. My whole arm and back looked as if I had some terrible disease, and I was very concerned that I might have caught something. I have written an e-mail letter to the hotel, as well, and they have not even bothered to send a response or an apology. I hope that you can investigate their premises and keep any other guests from suffering the same fate that I suffered at this disgusting, cramped hotel.

My request was honored, and after I arrived home that same staff member was very responsive to my follow-up email inquiries. There is no evidence of the card being misued; I completely trusted that it was indeed destroyed and my credit card company has already replaced it. Upon a budget return to London, I would definitely consider another stay.

I found the man on the front desk (I can't name him as I can't be seen to be personally insulting anyone) rude and unpleasent. His maner and attitude to me as I checked in made me feel unwelcome and ill at ease. Once I got to my room, I found myself to be on the ground floor backing onto the patio where guests sat outside to talk and drink etc. This ment I had to keep my curtains drawn almost all the time as a matter of privacy. I also had to keep my window shut at night as the noise was preventing me from sleeping. Not ideal on a hot July night. Upon reporting this problem to the same man at the front desk i again found him rude and unwilling to be of any assistace whatsoever. Indeed he seemed more concerned with his staffing issues than my own comfort. Not what I would expect from a three star hotel. Generally, my room was shabby. It had mould on the ceiling, no tea or coffee making facilities, there were no plugs in the sink or bath and the TV reception was terrible. My stay at this \"hotel\" was a terrible experience and one which I would not endorse to anyone. There are much nicer places to stay in the Bayswater area for the money.

The Bayswater tube station is also about five minutes walk away, which can get you anywhere downtown, to the main attractions, to upper scale shopping and restaurants, and directly to Heathrow (will save a bunch on cab fare). Although Queensway was pretty loud during the night time, the hotel was always quiet all the time. Even though there were dozens and dozens of US university students on a class trip staying at the hotel while we were there, it was always quiet and pretty well organized. We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet - breads, jams, eggs, juices, milk, cheese, cereal, etc. - better than the continental breakfasts at most US hotels. The tea was great. We spent very little time in the hotel after breakfast though - we were more interested in the attractions in London than in the hotel, which is likely what most budget-conscious people touring London are looking for.

But it was totally OK. We've stayed in the triple room on the 4th flour, northern side overlooking the street. The room was indeed small, but this is a very well known fact for most of low budget (and even not so low budget) hotels in London. The heating worked fine, the noise was not unbearable (the only annoying thing was that our room was just next to the swinging door in the hall and each person passing them made quite a loud BANG!). The sheets were stained a bit but they were fresh. The towels seemed to be clean but they did have a smell, as if they were stacked in a very damp place. I always use my own towels, so it didn't bother me that much. The bathroom was nice and clean, water was hot, we did have some problems closing the shower with wet hands, so the only way to close it was from outside after drying ourselves. Breakfast was good and sufficient, there was plenty of food even if we came down later towards the end of it. There was always warm toast or a toaster to heat - reheat it, eggs, cheese, ham, butter, jams, cereals and beverages. The staff is quite a problem, especially women in the breakfast room who don't speak english. But as much as we needed to contact any of the staff at the reception (which was actually only once when the key to the room didn't open the door), they were kind and they sorted the problem out. The location is good, there are two tube stations nearby (5 and 8 min walk) that cover 3 lines( two of which are Circle and Central, which are most useful to take you to the most important places of interest in the center). To summarize: The hotel is quite ok for a short stay in London, especially for the price you pay.

Immediately I checked upon this site and I was shocked and appalled by the reviews. the best I could do was to go with an open mind, and i was still constantly disappointed. It took stepovers to reach the hotel on the tube (much more inconvenient that you might think) and even then it was quite a walk to the nearest station. upon arrival we were largely ignored by the staff, who infuriatingly simply stood and stared at us. after 45 minutes we had checked in, and our party were inexplicably spread across three floors (6 people for 3 rooms). The rooms were far smaller than I could have imagined. It was virtually impossible for two people to pass each other in the room. there was no room to place and / or unpack our cases, and anything of that sort meant taking up the bed. we decided to not unpack them because of this, yet on return to the hotel on the evening our cases had been opened and examined, and various garments and belongings strewn about the room. The bed was firm yet manageable, with irregular moleskin sheets that wreaked havoc with all of our parties skins. The sheets were very thin and no match for the winter cold. the pillows were unusually stained, and this seemed to be fresh. we decided to use our clothing as a pillow until they were cleaned - which never happened. Satellite TV was in fact 3 channels - BBC 1, 2 and ITV. wardrobe held 3 hangers and various rubbish bags and dirty linen. the shower was a simple fitting above a well used bathtub. once turned on, we fought for about 30 minutes to turn it off. we were lucky enough to have hot water in our room however. A bath of any sort was out of the question due to the lack of plugholes in the bathroom, which was coincidentally tiny. the Towels supplied were ragged around the ends, and had a terrible, sickening smell to them - they smelt as if not washed for a very long period, were damp and very dirty. (luckily i brought my own towel). The largest problem we found was that of the temperature - the heating in our room was non functional, and combined with a single glazed window leading onto a public park, coated with barbed wire and hotel rubbish, the room was constantly at a very low temperature. My mobile phone incorporates a thermometer, and at lowest point the room reached 2 degrees celcius. Sleeping in these conditions was unbearable. I attempted to complain numerous times, but the staff replied 'I will go and get the manager' and did not return. our party also had problems of the same nature, but that their room was too warm, and the heating would not turn down nor off. Breakfast was disgraceful. Only small amounts of food were supplied for a large amount of people, which soon ran out. Being first into the restaurant (which remained open for 2 hours per day) there were 10 slices of bread, one carton of tesco milk and 1 bowl of sugar. the staff made our stay unbearable - upon an attempt to purchase a soft drink, the staff stood and watched one of our party wait for about 15 minutes, finally coming out and being abusive to that person, stating that there is a supermarket about 10 minutes away, and that we should stop relying on the staff. upon checking out, most of us had numeric locks on our cases, as they were to be left behind the reception counter. as we returned to collect them, we found that attempts had been made to either decipher the code, and in some cases physically remove it. One case had been blatantly unpacked and repacked in a hurried fashion. Complaints were made but we were told that they had been left at our own risk. This hotel was like a scene from a bad movie - everything was wrong about it. I am in no way being melodramatic.
