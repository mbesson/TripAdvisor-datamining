We hopped on the Roissy bus from terminal 2D at Charles De Gaull direct to Rue Auber/ Rue Scribe, right opposite the Ballet school ( around an hour journey traffic permitting). The hotel is a stones throw from here. On entering the hotel, we were greeted by a friendly member of staff, and everything ran smoothly. Our room was on 4th floor, and as previous review mentioned quite small, but very charming and cozy. We loved it! There are plenty little restaurnants close by and walking around you will see some lovely little streets and lights at night. On walking down Rue Tronchet just before turning right onto Rue Castellane, you will see L'\u00c9glise de la Madeleine at the end of the street, which is a beatiful buillding. We used the Open tour bus to discover the city and thought that it was excellent value. You can get on the bus at Rue Aber, again very close to our hotel. The breakfast room was spectacular and the continental breakfast was amazing. Great selection, and lovely fresh food. Started our days perfect.

The last time was June 2009, and I posted a review then too. This time it was just my 12 year old daughter and me. We arrived at Gare St Lazare from Bayeux and left the next day for CDG airport using the Roissy bus. It was about a 15 min walk to each. The hotel is very nice, with more character than you would expect from a Best Western but less than at a B&B, where we usually prefer to stay.

The room had 2 twin beds and not a lot of other space, we basically sat or lay on the beds and our 2 22 in roller suitcases took up most of the free floor space, although we could still walk around them. There are blackout blinds on the windows which worked fine (automatic metal things). We had the breakfast included in our rate as I didn't want to deal with finding breakfast before we left for the airport.

Our request to have adjacent rooms was honored. The hotel is so small that you really need only be on the same floor and you will be close to everyone else on that floor (important to us as we we were traveling together and with teenagers.) Rooms and beds are very small, but that seems to be the norm for Paris.

There is no in room coffee which I guess is also typical Paris. The free wi-fi worked well. They did provide washcloths. The elevator was small and dangerous to slow-moving people, but it was functional during our entire stay.

This is the 6th time we have stayed within a two block radius of this location but the first time at the Folkestone. This was our 10th visit to Paris. The 8th Arrondissement close to the Madeleine Church is very central in terms of transportation and sightseeing. The hotel is one block to the Madeleine Metro station and the Number 42 bus route which goes to/from Gare du Nord and to the Eiffel Tower. It is 3 blocks to the Auber RER station which is handy for getting to/from CDG airport (30 minutes) and Euro Disney (40 minutes). It is a 10 minute walk to Gare St. Lazare and 5 minutes to the major department stores on Boulevard Haussmann. There is a small grocery store on the street and a very good bakery across the street (the hotel gets it's bread and pastries from there). There are a number of restaurants in the area and the Gourmet Lafayette supermarket is in the department store and there is a Monoprix with a supermarket in the basement behind the Printemps store next to the Galeries Lafayette. I had originally reserved a Deluxe room (185 Euros) with a queen bed which I had thought was a larger room. Upon checking in we discovered that these are small rooms with a wardrobe, desk, and a bathroom. I asked if one of the large rooms shown in their brochure and website was available. They only have two of these large rooms, one of which we were able to have for an additional 30 Euro/night. See the photos. These rooms on the first and second floors facing the street (which is very quiet there) have two twin beds pushed together, a desk and chair, couch, stuffed chair, coffee table, cabinet with mini bar and flat panel TV, wardrobe, , and with a much larger bathroom. There was free wireless internet in the room which provided unreliable connectivity in the evening when many seemed to be using it. There is also a computer in the lobby but if you want to print from this one you have to transfer you files to a USB key (they have one at the front desk to use) and print them at the front desk. There were only about 13 TV channels, which is typical for even 4-Star hotels that we have stayed at in Paris. They have CNN and Euronews (in French) plus the major TV channels as well as Eurosport, Arte, and TV5 Le Monde. The breakfast room is in the basement. The breakfast was excellent, the best we have had in Paris, especially for a 3-Star rated hotel. Not just a basket of rolls. There was two types of freshly baked cake, a flan, two types of meat, cheese, fruit, French bread, raisin and chocolate au pain, croissants, juice, coffee, tea, etc. All self-serve. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English when I tried to speak poor French. The only problem occurred on the Saturday morning we were there. The single elevator stopped working and they not going to able to get it fixed until Monday morning. Fortunately we were on the 2nd floor and they have two spiral staircases serving the 7 floors and the basement breakfast room. Overall we were very happy with the larger room that we were able to get. There was no way we could have spent 7 nights there in one of the \"Deluxe\" rooms. The 4-Star hotels that we have used in the past around the corner were considerably more expensive for a similarly sized room (275-400 Euro/night not including breakfast). The only other comment about this room was that I noticed a portable radiant heater on the window-side of the beds. The forced air heating and cooling system unit by the door didn't put out that much air in the large room even when the fan would infrequently run on high speed. So the portable heater provided some additional heat for the window-side of the bed.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sf", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Location, Super Friendly Staff - Highly Recommend !!\u201d", "Author": "verypretty", "ReviewID": "UR58161890", "Content": "I was traveling for work and decided to stay here.

Croissants which were as good as any bakery, pain au chocolat, baguette, butter, jam, and of course coffee with hot milk! They had other things too like cereal and cold cuts but who would choose that over croissants? On the street you have a variety store, a little fruit place, and 2 bakeries that provide a great lunch option. Department stores are just around the corner so after a day of power shopping you only have a short walk with all your bags! Even at night walking in this neighbourhood was very safe.

This was our 3rd trip to Paris together, however our first stay at the Folkestone Opera. Overall, we were very pleased with the Hotel. The Hotel represents itself as a 3 star and we would agree (I would even go as far as placing it at the very top end of this designation.). We selected the Hotel primarily for its location and what appeared to be (from the website) fairly up to date d\u00e9cor and it did not disappoint. Room: We paid 115 Euros per night for a standard room (#603). We were very fortunate upon arrival to receive one of the 4 rooms on the 6th floor that have a balcony (sure is a nice place to wind down after a full day of sightseeing). The room and bathroom were tiny by American standards but fairly average by Paris standards. Furnishings were in very good shape and up to date. I was impressed by the flat screen TV. All hotel guests have access to free wireless internet. Aside from the balcony, the room didn\u2019t have much seating other than the bed and a small desk with chair. Another hotel guest pointed out that the rooms without balconies appear to be about 4-5 feet wider. We spent so little time in the room that size didn\u2019t really matter to us. The bed was comfy and the electronic privacy shade on the window kept the room very dark and quiet at night. Amenities: The hotel offers a breakfast in the basement for roughly 15 Euros per day. We never tried it. There are too many inexpensive breakfast options near the hotel (i.e. pastry shop in Madeleine metro station). Our room did not include an iron & board, but the front desk was happy to provide it to my wife upon request. We found all of the front desk clerks to be both friendly and helpful (all spoke at least some English). At night, the Hotel offers a small bar in the lobby where there are a couple of seating areas for guests to relax and a computer where guests can use the internet for free. Transportation: The hotel is within a short walk of a bevy of metro and RER stops. Madeleine (exit Rue Tronchet, walk a block or so, and Rue Castellane will be on your left) is arguably the closest; however Auber (RER A), Havre Caumartin, & Haussmann Saint-Lazare (RER E) are also very close. Honestly, the Hotel is close enough to walk to a lot of the top tourist sites (i.e. Concorde, Tuileries Garden, Louvre, etc.) however we generally chose to use the metro wherever possible to save the wear & tear on our feet. Airport: We used the RER to go to/from the CDG. RER B runs to Gare du Nord where you can transfer to RER E (direction: Haussmann Saint-Lazare). Follow the exit signs to Rue du Havre, go right out the exit, and keep walking until you see Rue Castellane on your right. (Note that Rue du Havre becomes Rue Tronchet at Boulevard Haussmann) Neighborhood: The Hotel is arguably in the epicenter of Paris shopping. Les Galeries Lafayette and Printemps (major department stores) are within a 5 minute walk as are a plethora of specialty stores (including a GAP for those of you who just discovered that Paris is pretty cool year-round and you didn\u2019t bother to pack any jeans). We always felt safe walking to/from the Hotel, even after dark and late at night. Food: The immediate area around the Hotel is fairly residential and isn\u2019t exploding with cafes and other food options. There is a brasserie just down the street however it seemed like it closed very early each evening (i.e. 20:00). Galeries Lafayette has a great food hall with about 5-6 eateries, various specialty restaurants (including some not so special\u2026McDonalds!), a self-serve caf\u00e9, and a reasonably priced supermarket (great for cheap bottled water and Coke!) Finding food near the Hotel was seldom an issue for us as we sightsee from sun up to sun down and often ate wherever we were at during lunch/dinnertime. Overall we were very pleased with this Hotel.

I was able to get a signal about as strong on a network called \"radiolitec\" and surf for a few minutes at a time for free.

The laptop did not have a cd burner, so I tried their desktop computer, which they charge 7 Euro per 30 minutes to use, and couldn't connect my camera or burn to a cd. I also used that computer to check-in to my flight home via the web.

We stored some of our luggage on top of the tall and narrow closet to save space (careful as it's a bit dusty up there). The air conditioning worked well and there were big windows that opened fully for fresh air. We asked and received upon check-in a coffee making set - kettle, coffee, tea etc. The room and bathroom were spotless. Toiletries and the comfortable towels were replaced daily. The beds were very comfortable as well - important after walking for hours and hours! Two minor complaints - the mini bar didn't really cool well. On the second day we brought some ice up and put it in with some food we bought which helped. Second, I would have liked stronger water pressure in the shower but that issue didn't bother my partner. Breakfast was wonderful. The room is decorated very nicely - yes it was basement level but it didn't matter a bit. It was clean and well lit as well. The food was great and there was a large selection. The croissants were out of this world in my opinion, as was a sponge type cake as well that I loved. Along with the many pastries and cakes served there were also baguettes, cereal, fruit cocktail, ham, cheeses, granola, cornflakes, jams, honey, butter, juices, yogurts and hard boiled eggs. Internet use was pricey (7 euro for 1/2 hour) so we didn't use it but I was glad to have the option. We are two women and we felt safe in the area, and it is in walking distance (if you want) to the Champs Elysees. Haussman and Tronchet streets for shopping are right there. The famous Fauchon gourmet food store is at the Madeleine square (go in for a look!). There are two metro stations nearby as well, along with cafes and restaurants. The Roissy bus (to/from Charles de Gaulle airport) is about a 10 minute walk away. If I may sum up, the location is great.

I must admit, I was very pleasantly surprised with the hotel and our experience there. The Best Western Folkestone Opera is a wonderful hotel for the price we paid which was 114 Euros/night for a double room, including breakfast. I booked it directly through the BW hotel website. The hotel is in a great location, right around the corner from the Metro Station Madeleine and very close to other metro stations as well. The hotel is located on a quite side street off of La Rue Tronchet which is a bussling street with many stores, shops, brasseries, and cafes. On the same street as the hotel are a few great restuarants...a Thai restaurant, an Italian place and a few others. There were also a few small market stores where you could buy fresh fruit, water, juices and snacks to have on hand in your hotel room at night. Across the street is a great Patisserie where they had fresh pastries and baguettes everyday. The front desk staff was very friendly and very helpful when I checked in. Check in was very quick and smooth without any problems. The elevator to our 4th floor room was a bit small, but this is quite normal in Europe. There is a lounge in the lobby where you can have cocktails anytime, there is also a sitting area and a computer for internet access. Our room #403 was great. It was very very clean, cozy and very comfortable. Again, rooms in Europe are usually small so this was what I expected. The bathroom was extremely clean as well as the shower facilities. The shower was a good size, the normal by Canadian/USA standards. The shower head itself was a handheld but you were able to have it on the wall so you could shower without having to hold it. I've been in other hotels where this was not the case and you'd have to hold the shower in one hand and clean with your other hand. Our room overlooked la Rue Castellan where the hotel is on and it was very quite. The windows could open so you were able to get fresh air into the room and at night, there were automatic shutters...all at the press of a button. We had a double bed...which was a real double bed, and not 2 singles stuck together like other hotels in Paris do. Breakfast was served every morning in the breakfast room in the basement. It was amazing, very clean, quaint and a large selection of foods....different breads, pastries, croissants, cheese, hams, eggs, juices, coffee, tea, yogurt, cereals, fruits. The ladies working in the breakfast room were very nice, you got to know them after your first morning there. The location of the hotel itself is in a quiet and safe area. We would return each evening very late and to be greeted warmly by the front desk person. Everyone spoke perfect English and everyone was very helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris. I will definitely stay there again. I'm glad I read the reviews on here first before booking this hotel.

We could not believe it, could not understand the logic of it, especially since we stayed there 3 days earlier, and at no time we were told there were any problems. So I think this treatment was not only unacceptable, but inconsiderate of the circumstances and of the stress we were in. It was inhumane and illogical. ( other than the fact that the rooms were very small, one room 503 had a bathroom so small that one's knees were hitting the wall while sitting on the toilet and the breakfast room in the basement was so hot that you could barely stay for 10 minutes to eat while sweating)", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cJust as Expected\u201d", "Author": "Traveling Fool 2", "ReviewID": "UR5493921", "Content": "Thanks to Trip Advisor, I had researched fairly extensively the moderate-priced hotels in Paris. The B/W Folkestone Opera was precisely what we expected, as a result...a clean, safe hotel in a good area of Paris. This hotel was easily accessible by Metro, and the evening staff was most helpful in assisting with calling cabs for the next morning or making recommendations to us. The highlight was the complimentary breakfast. The breads were incredible, the cheese and ham delectable. The bathrooms were immaculate, the amenities what we would expect back in the USA, and the room size was of little concern to us since we expect this in Europe. We found the lobby computer to be fast and easy to use with the prepaid card. (The French keyboard, however, is another matter!) It was a perfect situation, and we are so glad we stayed there!

They were very accomodating when a relative wanted to come along and they were fully booked- so they arranged her stay in the next door Opera Royal hotel (which seemed to be very clean as well but didn't have A/C). The rooms & bathrooms are as usual in Paris small; but tiptop clean; airconditioned, and I enjoyed the geraniums on the outside of my window. However the best thing about this hotel is its location - it is not on a boulevard, so there is less noise from the street. There is a bakery accross the street, some restaurants and small food stores are located in the street if you don't feel like walking anymore after a long day visiting the city. It is so near the Madeleine metrostop; and the bus stops off rue Tronchet.

The company my husband works for had booked us in at a hotel closer to Champs Elysee, but having read terrible reviews about the hotel we were booked at, I insisted we stay somewhere else. So, booked this hotel based on the above reviews, and I must say we were not disappointed whatsoever. Yes, small rooms....but other than the garbage pick-up every morning, it was very quiet. Probably the cleanest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in....spotless.....great linens. Very enjoyable breakfast (croissants were \"to die for\"-- don't let their appearance fool you!) Wonderful location....we walked almost everywhere.....short walk to shopping, Louvre, Orsay, longer walk to Eiffel tower, and Notre Dame, but still walkable, if you're used to it. Don't shy away from the metro-- it's very handy from this hotel, and be sure and purchase the one day pass to Versaille which includes your train cost.

We booked using the Best Western website and got a great rate that included a very good breakfast. The hotel is near many of the big tourist sites, and there are two Metro lines within very close walking distance. Also, lots of shopping at Au Printemps and other stores.
