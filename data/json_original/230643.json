The room was fantastic - spacious, immaculately clean, comfortable and modern with a large bathroom with plenty of complimentary toiletries. The only couple of minor negatives were that the hotel is on a busy street and therefore the room was noisy - even at night and especially early in the morning with car horns beeping, sirens blaring etc. It was loud enough to wake me up a few times during the night and meant it was impossible to have the windows open. The other negative stems from this - the air conditioning was set at a minimum of 25 degrees which was much too warm. We contacted Reception about this and they turned it out - to 19 degrees but it was a bit annoying that you couldn't just control the temperature yourself. Other than that we couldn't fault the hotel - staff were extremely helpful and polite, the small swimming pool and rooftop deckchairs were lovely, the location was great and it was good value for money. We didn't have the breakfast as you are spoilt for choice in the city centre so preferred to choose something ourselves later in the morning. I would highly recommend getting picnic lunches/breakfasts/snacks from the market near La Ramblas - great value and delicious. The only other thing is that I think there were probably nicer areas to stay in - it was fine but a couple of the streets near the hotel were a bit rough with some dodgy looking characters hanging about. We never had any bother from anyone, but I think the area round Rambla de Catalunya is probably nicer (though no doubt more expensive!).", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JueD", "ReviewID": "UR128346595", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel at the beginning of February 2012, we had two double rooms on the fifth floor (508 and 509) these are at the front of the hotel, the hotel is on a main road and it can get quite noisy but this wasn\u2019t enough to stop us from sleeping, what did was the noise from other hotel guests coming back to their rooms and not having any respect for others that maybe sleeping.

The room was large, beds comfortable& I got great nights sleep all week. The double room my other friends had was on the 2nd floor& had its own patio out back which was great. It was warm when we visited the city& the patio was shaded out the back letting us keep cool. There is also free WiFi all over the hotel. We checked out the pool up on the roof but its not heated so is pretty cold!, but we relaxed for a while up there 1 day, its got awesome views aswell from up there!. As most reviews say, there is a Metro stop (Para-lel) right outside the main door to the hotel& can get you anywhere in city. An excellent note on this is that the metro was on the same line that the RENFE Airport train from Barcelona Airport to Sants Station stopped at, therefore it is easy to get from Airport to Hotel in around 30-40mins (depending on train times) with 1 change. There are many little cafes, restaurants& fast food outlets near the hotel. We had breakfast once& was pretty good, not a massive choice, but by no means scarce. La Rambla is 10min walk away& its worth while walking up this street as it\u2019s full of stalls& shops. There is also an excellent Tourist Information booth towards the top of the street, you will notice the red \u2018i\u2019 sign.

We were able to rebook our flights for Easter weekend but on checking the hotels website the rooms were more expensive than the weekend we had originally booked for. After emailing the hotel to explain our circumstances they were very accommodating and honoured the rate that we had agreed for our initial trip. This was fantastic as it cost quite a bit to get the flights changed and would not have been feasible to pay more for the hotel. On arriving at the hotel we were amazed at how close it was to the metro station, literally right outside the door. The hotel itself is very modern inside, clean, cool and professional. Our room was very well laid out and the little touches such as a shaving kit and dental kit showed that a lot of thought went into the service provided. The rooftop pool was amazing and the view from the roof is just something else, we could have spent a day up there quite easily. We didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to experience authentic Barcelona food so cannot comment on the food but we had a few drinks in the bar each night before going out and it is 5 star. One thing that summed up the Universal Hotel was when I approached reception as I was having trouble printing tickets that I had pre booked for the Camp Nou Experience (no need to pre book as they have to be printed out at cash machines that don't work. Just buy tickets at the stadium itself). The man at reception let me log onto my emails to print out the confirmation, he even phoned up the ticket providers to try and sort things out. In the end we were able to get tickets at the stadium using the email confirmation and it just shows that the staff really do go the extra mile.

The Breakfast was included in our deal and it was good, there was plenty of selection however i am aware that the price is usually between 9-15 euros i wouldnt want to pay that for it. the staff throughout were polite & friendly. the hotel is 10 mins walk from marina/ la rambla and 45 min walk to nou Camp..we did do a lot of walking as we prefer to see the city that way howver we did get a T-10 metro ticket which gets you travel anywhere for 10 journeys each of which last 75mins this INCLUDES to the airport! it cost just short 10 euro. the nearest Metro station is Paralel and is right on the doorstep of the hotel.

Room: the room was clean and spacious. We asked for a room with a \u201cview\u201d at the back so the view was inexistent. The benefit (and the reason for asking for this) was the balcony and the lack of traffic noise. The hotel is on a very busy boulevard. Food: Breakfast is great with plenty of food. The diner menu it\u2019s also great. They have combination of buffet dinner (15 euro) and, if you chose you can have two meat menu options at 19 or 21 euros. The buffet is plentiful including deserts. The quality of the food, both buffet and the meat menu was great. The hotel has a small (very small) pool on the roof and a solarium where you can do sun bathing. The only negatives were the fact that there were no tea-making facility in the room and there were none available upon request either. On the first day the room was not cleaned and at 4PM we had to ring the reception. The room was after that cleaned within the hour. They explained this was caused by a very busy day.

We decided to take the train because our research told us that even though there were buses that went to city center; there was a strong chance that our large pieces of luggage would be a problem. We followed the signs which lead us to an area with platforms and proceeded to try to figure out the Spanish self serve ticket machine. There was a help/information desk, but because it was so early in the morning, it was closed. By the good graces and kindness of a stranger, we had two tickets for the train at a cost of 6.50 Euro each. Unfortunately, getting back home and looking at the metro, train, and hotel web sites; I\u2019m all confused as to how we managed to get to the hotel. I do know we got off the train at what I thought was Placa Sentri. We bought metro tickets for 1.50 Euro each and headed for the L2 Blue line as directed by others on the train. Turns out, there is a good chance the train tickets possibly included the metro. Anyway, we followed directions for the L2 blue line and found our way getting off at Parallel. We found that once you were in the metro system, like others, they had maps of the metro system and you were able to easily follow. In fact, Barcelona had two advantages-at each platform, there was a L.E.D. sign showing the arrival time of the next metro train, plus where it was headed. Additionally, in each of the cars, in addition to the customary map of the metro system on the wall, there was a follow along type system showing by light were you were along the route and where you were headed. It really helped one unfamiliar with the system to reassure one self if you were on the correct train, and going in the correct direction. Upon arriving at Parallel station, we headed for the exit. A bit of a note about the metro. Although it was inexpensive to take the metro from the train station to the hotel as opposed to a cab; we found ourselves lugging our luggage up and down stairs. Once in a rare moment we would find an elevator, but for the most part, like many other metro systems, there were a lot of stairs to climb or go down. As we exited the metro system, it split left and right with signs showing what street or something or other. Not knowing, we took a guess and headed right. We pulled our luggage up the stairs and came out onto the sidewalk. After asking for directions, we headed north and after about a block or two, we came right to the front door of the hotel. It would seem that had we headed left out of the metro system, we would have ended up on the other side of the street, although in front of the hotel, just opposite from the entrance. Check in was efficient and handled by caring staff that spoke English well. We found our room to be the typical European room with the hard flooring, firm bed, and well stocked bathroom. We had no problems with maintenance issues and found the water pressure for the shower to be adequate and did not run hot/cold. We found the room to be clean and the other parts of the hotel to be clean, modern, and inviting. We walked around looking for places to eat and shop and this is what we found: Upon exiting the hotel, if you turn right and walk up Parallel, you come to a street off to your right. We turned right and walked for about one half block. If you would continue going straight on this street, you would come to the Las Ramblas in about 10-20 minutes depending on your speed of walking. Instead of continuing straight, we crossed the street and found a small grocery store. We headed along the street back to Parallel and upon coming to Parallel, we turned right and continued heading up Parallel. Within a very short distance, we came to a medium sized grocery store. We continued up Parallel until it intersected with a street from the left creating sort of a point of a triangle. We crossed Parallel and continued walking down Parallel until we came to an intersection that allowed us to cross on a light. We then turned left and walked up Parallel until we reached our hotel. That route we took was approximately 20-35 minutes and had about 20-30+ bars and restaurants along the route. We found many of the bars serving their appetizers called tappas, which for the most part were all the same skewered beef or lamb, grilled prawns, and other fish dishes. The majority of the places, (bars and restaurants) had their menus with prices and pictures of the dishes posted outside for you to take your time and study what was available. We found for the most part, the prices didn\u2019t vary much from one place to the other. So for the most part, the area was close to Las Ramblas, the cruise port, and had a lot of restaurants and bars in the area. When picking a hotel to stay at in Barcelona, due to the number of hotels, the task seemed daunting. What I learned was that if you wanted to stay on or very near the Las Ramblas, you should expect a lot of noise from people until the wee hours of the morning. The farther away from the city center, the less expensive your room; but transportation and it\u2019s cost became an issue. We chose this specific hotel because of it\u2019s proximity to Las Ramblas, (close but not too close for noise), the convenience of having a metro stop, and it\u2019s extremely short distance to the cruise port. However, as it turns out, that 3 minute cab ride to the cruise port still cost us 20 Euro. My guess is they show you their kind of hospitality and take advantage of tourists and charge a flat rate regardless of the distance. Not surprisingly, there never was a shortage of cabs in front of the hotel. So, for it\u2019s location, cleanliness, English speaking staff, and amenities; we were well satisfied with our stay and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "monantia", "ReviewID": "UR126761607", "Content": "A group of us just went to Barcelona for a Barcelona Marathon 2012 and all stayed in Barcelona Universal.

You shouldn't be spending much time in your room anyway, so don't worry about it. We stayed here the night of Carnaval, and we couldn't hear anything from the street. Overall this was a great hotel. I would stay here again in a second. One tip though: If you use hand soap to wash your body in the shower, ask for a couple \"extra\" bars when you check in.

We stayed at the Universal for 5 days as a birthday treat, and were not disappointed with the trip, or the hotel. On arrival we were allocated an excellent 9th floor corner room, (thank you Daniel) with a huge terrace, at the front of the hotel, which afforded good views of Montjuic. The room was superb, tasteful decor, clean, plus a really good size bathroom, and the only niggle was as is the case in many hotel rooms, low lighting, but we had panoramic balcony windows/doors, so this wasn\u2019t an issue. The hotel is on a busy city road, yards from the Paral. Lel metro stop, so as some reviewers have stated, there is traffic noise, but it\u2019s not intrusive; if you do not want any noise don't stay in a city hotel! We found our own way around Barcelona purchasing T10 Metro tickets, so apart from check in and out, we did not bother the reception staff during our stay, but they had provided us with all necessary information. We found all the hotel staff to be very courteous and professional, the doormen always willing to help with cases, taxis etc. Breakfast was the usual buffet fare; juices, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheeses, hot food, pastries etc, and there were always sufficient, adequate choices. There is a small lobby bar, which also offers bar snacks, meals, we did not encounter any of the previous complaints over bar staffing, and enjoyed excellent service from the barman Josef, who despite being busy, was unstintingly friendly, (and a brave soul, being a Real Madrid supporter in Barcelona) and he was a credit to the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, so close to the Metro and Funicular to Montjuic. You can also easily walk to Las Ramblas, Gothic, the Harbour areas and other sites. We were wary of the area based on previous reviews, but did not find this to be an issue when walking around even at night. There are numerous restaurants, cafes, and tapas bars close to the hotel, we tried a couple with mixed results, i.e. the August restaurant, (really good meal and service), and Los Cachitos, (very poor service, tapas), both were yards from the hotel. Overall this four star hotel provided an excellent base for an enjoyable city break, the staff were all courteous and helpful, I would recommend this hotel for Barcelona visits and would stay there again.

When we in our room (317), it was like walking into a blast chiller because the air had been turned off. We managed to get the heat up after a while to warm up. Our view faced the back of the hotel to peoples' home that had laundry hanging out. it wasn't exactly scenic. The room is a good size room with plenty of closet space, and I had no complaint for the size of the bathroom either. There were toiletries provided, but they were very strong so it was not something that I could use. The plus is that they had a towel warmer which was great for doing a little bit of laundry and having it dry quickly. All in all we were satisfied with the room and the hotel, but we weren't necessarily blown away by anything there. Also we didn't try the bar or the restaurant on site because it was fairly pricey and there are many many restaurants around.

The range of cereals was poor (three types) and often taken away early. The hot food selection (only four choices) never varied in the four days we stayed and was greasy, tepid, and unpleasant. The range of pastries was limited too. We have eaten far better breakfasts in unranked B&Bs than we got in the 4* Universal Hotel and my advice to anyone planning a stay is to save your money and eat breakfast out. We were so put off by the quality of the breakfast, we avoided having dinner in the hotel.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kendal, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel central location\u201d", "Author": "Suzpea", "ReviewID": "UR123830657", "Content": "The hotel was clean, fabulous hot power shower easy adjustable air con, plus central and easy to reach all Barcelona has to offer especially on a quick week end break, the price was far lower than the over priced La Ramblas hotels for an extra few minutes walk that got you to La Rambla, take a left outside the hotel and walk the street with Palau guell rather than a right especially at night.

The rooms have wooden floors which usually make rooms feel a bit cold, but this had very nice lighting in the room and so had quite a cosy feel in the evenings. The time that housekeeping arrives is a bit haphazard, as on a few days we returned for a rest about 3pm, before going out in the evening, and the rooms had not been cleaned and then on two occasions, after late nights, we had a lie in to around 11am, and the housekeeper would be knocking to clean the rooms. Oh well may have been due to staff shortages etc. We did not have breakfast, so could not comment. On one occasion during our return to the hotel late at night, we were approached by a very questionable young man, who started to to get very aggesive with us as we ignored him, and he ended up sort of wrapping himself around my husband, in what we thought was an attempt to either pick pocket him, or bring him to the floor. My husband is a large chap and ended up just throwing the bloke off him.

We got a great rate from Booking.com. On arrivel the receptionist was brilliant, very fast check in and then proceeded to ask if we had been to Barcelona before, we hadn't, so he grabbed a full street map and highlighted all the areas of interest, including where is the best places to eat both during the day and in the evening. So much information explained so easily by him. Our room was on the 5th floor, looking out onto apartments, not a particulary nice view but we didn't pay for this hotel to enjoy the view. The room was very spacious, good sized bed, 2 large wardrobes, small seating area, large en suite bathroom with shower gel etc included.The weekend we were there, the weather was perfect, very warm so we didn't use the heating in the room, in fact we stuck the air con on which was very effective. Where we were was very quiet, even though our room was opposite the lifts, it was very quiet. Oh yes, free wi-fi in the room also. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, so take a kettle, we did and it was great, room service supplied us with mugs and spoons and we also asked for a bath robe for my wife, which they delivered promptly. Breakfast was good enough for what we wanted, though the cooked breakfast was not up to much, but lots fresh fruit, cereal, pastries and tea/coffee and fruit juices. The one thing that makes this hotel stand out is the location in respect of being so close to the metro. I mean, you walk out of the Metro station, and the hotel is only 10 short steps away. From Place Catalunya, get on the green line, head for Zona Universitaria end stop. Get off Metro at stop called Paral-lel and head for exit, when you have gone thru the ticket machines head for exit called Sortida Rda. de Sant Pau. Go up the stairs and there is the hotel right in front of you. Perfect. Opposite the hotel are many bus stops too, if you want to go down to the beach, these are perfect as they take you right there, but be careful, make sure you know where you want to get off and try to count the stops, though all the bus stops are also named. Within a 5-10 min walk is a really good supermarket called Consum. Really well stocked for any provisions you may need. Directions: turn right outside of hotel, to large crossroads(only about 2 mins) and head up Ronda De Sant pau, the supermarket is about 10 mins up on your left hand side. La Ramblas is within easy reach from the hotel too, takes about 15 mins from the hotel on foot. We were warned about pickpockets, but we didn't have any trouble. There are lots of Police on foot around the area and you do see many police cars too, so we felt safe. As far as getting to the hotel from the airport is concerned, we caught the metro from the airport to the hotel, which was ok but with luggage, its a bit of a nightmare in rush hour, and down there in the metro it gets very hot. For the return journey, we used the Areo Bus from Place Catalunya. It was 5.50Euros each, it stops at two other stops and then goes right to Terminal 2, perfect for our EasyJet flight back home. All in all, a great weekend trip to Barcelona, and the hotel was fab.

The hotel is modern, clean and conveniently located with a Metro station just outside the door, within walking distance of La Rambla. The metro station also serves the funicular to Montjuic Park. Plenty of small, neighbourhood restaurants and tapas bars around. The surrounding neighbourhood is quite mixed though, with some rough areas - best to stick to the main streets rather than the smaller alleys, particularly on the way through to La Rambla. Our room was comfortable, but was on the inside of the hotel, so rather than an outside window had a frosted glass window onto a light well, but this made for quiet nights as we weren't disturbed by the traffic on the street outside. The bed was especially comfortable, the bathroom was clean and well equipped and the heating/air conditioning system worked well. The roof terrace has great views over Barcelona, but, despite the info we got on booking, the pool is closed during winter months (our booking said it was open, but unheated). Our only niggle was that the cleaners didn't reach our room until 3-4pm in the afternoon, just as we tended to be returning from a day's sightseeing for a few hours' rest before heading out for dinner. On 2 days we decided we needed a nap more than the room needed a clean so put the 'do not disturb' card on the door. Unfortunately, that just meant that the reception desk phoned the room to check whether we wanted it cleaned so we were disturbed anyway! One morning we had to report a slight leak from the bathroom ceiling, presumably from the room above and this was sorted out before we got back in the afternoon. There was a good range of food for breakfast, including a selection of fresh fruit, and we enjoyed eating in the restaurant a couple of evenings.

The room was very nice, cleaned to the highest level every day, fresh towels etc. Excellent shower in the room and very comfy beds. We were staying at the back of the hotel on the 8th floor, so had great views over Barcelona.

If you are looking for a centrally based (10-20 mins walk to most major attractions), comfortable, clean hotel with staff who speak English and are more than happy to help I would highly recommend the Hotel Barcelona Universal. One point to note - the rooms do not have a kettle so if like ourselves you need a nice cup of tea at the end of the day, I would take a travel kettle and a few tea bags (dont forget the adaptor) I looked through dozens of hotels and reviews when booking this short city break as I wanted it to be perfect (being a birthday present)... some reviews have commented on the area around the hotel, the noise, the temperature in the rooms etc... I would like to reassure anyone thinking of booking this hotel, the area is absolutely fine, no worse than any street in any town in the UK. We felt safe walking back to the hotel late into the evening.. our room was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet, we had large windows which we could open, but didnt feel the need as the temperature was perfect. For a short city break, this hotel and its staff are perfect. If like us you are visiting Barcelona to see and appreciate the many amazing sights you will not be disappointed. We crammed in as much as we could, all the Gaudi sights are just spectacular, we would HIGHLY recommend Casa Bitlo, it really is an absolute must, if you are going to see any of Gaudi's works, see this place.

I was a bit concerned about the possibility of noise from the road so e-mailed the hotel and requested a room at the back which they obliged. The room was in the corner of the hotel at the back, overlooking some quite rough looking residences but there was absolutely no noise from them. The only noise we experienced was from the room above us. We could hear noises of furniture being dragged, the toilet(!) being used and shower. The sound proofing between the floors really isn't great but wasn't really a problem. Luckily the people above us weren't up all night disturbing us. The room was modern with a huge bed (a bit hard but just my preference). Everything was spotlessly clean. The wifi was OK - intermittent and weak but let us do what we needed (look up restaurants etc.) The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with excellent English (puts us Brits to shame). The location of the hotel is excellent. It cost around \u20ac30 for a taxi from the airport. There is a metro station right outside. I recommend getting a T-10 ticket for the metro - It costs a little over \u20ac8 and gives you 10 trips on the metro, bus, trams etc. (each trip can last up to 1hr 15mins). The ticket can be used by multiple people too so you can pass the ticket back to someone else to use. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from La Rambla down a very dodgy looking street. Wouldn't like to walk down there on my own at night... about 10 minutes from Port Vell. Lots of warnings about pickpockets everywhere including in the hotel. I would recommend using the hotel safe to lock up your valuables instead of carrying them with you in the streets of Barcelona. We found some nice restaurants in the vicinity (thanks to the wifi in the hotel and the trip advisor app on my phone). There are loads of options. The Japanese restaurant next door is OK. There was one which was particularly nice a 2 minute walk away: http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d1850248-Reviews-Restaurante_August-Barcelona_Catalonia.html.

For those who are finding a hotel which isn't that expensive with an average pricetag, this hotel suits you dearly! I arrived in Barcelona with my family for an 8 days trip. To be honest, my expectations for this hotel was way lower considering the price but I was utterly wrong. Firstly, it has the best location if you're getting anywhere by train, mostly because the metro station's situated directly outside, not even a 1 min walk away from the main door! Also, every tourist attraction such as La Rambla, Catalunya or even Park Guell takes only 15 minutes AT MOST to get there! Fantastically convenient. Secondly, we were greeted by a staff at the front desk who had the friendliest personality. His service gave us the most comfortable stay throughout our 8 days in Barcelona. Thirdly, and most possibly the highlight, would be the room we were given. Not to mention the acoustic music playing in both our room and the bathroom, it had a small living room plus a cozy-sized bedroom easily able to accommodate a family of 3. I guess 4 wouldn't be a problem as well! If you're looking for any internet services, you can easily find 2 computers readily available a few steps away from the lift. It's that convenient. Finally, if you're the type of traveller who grabs a late dinner after completing all your sightseeing for the day, i guess this hotel suits you the most provided it has 2 supermarkets just a stone's throw away and along the street, you can easily find 5-6 restaurants selling Spanish local delicacies. We were really thankful when we found out those restaurants actually opened till 2am in the morning, and trust me, those restaurants had a fantastic service as well! I guess I haven't touched on any bad points of this hotel because there's absolutely none to begin with! A complete family hotel fantastically suited for your choice and I am really thankful for without it, my trip to Barcelona wouldn't have been that enjoyable as well~", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent friendly hotel.\u201d", "Author": "CasperUk", "ReviewID": "UR122220296", "Content": "This is a fab hotel for visiting Barcelona. rooms are clean ,modern ,spacious with all the facilities you need.

Understandably, because of separate bookings, the cleaners must have thought we had checked out of one of two of our rooms and before they realised threw away some sundry belongings and opened the safe and left it open. Nothing was missing from the safe, including cash, but we didnt get the sundry items (toiletries and magazines) back, nor did we get an apology despite raising the issue with the front desk twice.

For 2 main reasons - the first being the hotel itself. It is neat and clean and large enough to accommodate even a family of 3! The staff are friendly and very helpful in giving directions and so forth. And there is easy access to internet services just down on the reception level (though the room does not offer). And ther price is decent for a europe hotel (note: Good hostel cost almost as much)... only around Euro60 per person (we have 3 persons, all family members in the room). If you are NOT looking for major facilities like spa in the hotel etc (don't believe there are any but i may be wrong cos i didn't fiind out, and btw, we also didn't use their breakfast so no comment), all the other above reasons are good enough to make this hotel great! ... And the 2nd MOST IMPORTANT reason is the locale. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT! Regardless of what others might say - trust us on this...the hotel is very conveniently located. Seldom in europe will you have such great location for hotels. The subway is just a few steps away from the hotel, and so are the restaurants (till 2am in the morning!!! And no prob eating there cos no worry for safety or pickpockets as the hotel is like just next door!). No doubt the location is not the most 'upper class'...it is nonetheless the MOST accessible, to everthing and everywhere in fact. By walking - no problem to the main streets like Rambla or Catalunya. And if you take the subway, it is just a few steps away as i said. It is so convenient as it is central to all the major attractions as well as to the train stations to take to the outskirts of Barcelona. As long as you are careful (alert etc), pickpockets will not have any advantage. We came close to 1 or 2, at the stairs of the station outside the hotel. But cos the hotel is so close to the station and there is security just at the entrance 24 hours a day, we merely hopped back to the hotel from the station as if nothing mattered. So, as long as you are careful and alert, no problem at all. It happens in all Europe countries or even Asian countries. Luck also perhaps play a part. So just be careful and you will be fine! But in terms of hotel wise, this is a GREAT HOTEL!!! They even have music and songs in the bathroom!!! Don't miss it when you next visit Barcelona.

This was my first time in Barcelona and was excited about it. It seems there is a real pickpocket problem and true to form this was found to be the case within 2 hours of check in at the hotel. In spite of knowing the potential problems and my partner only using a small shoulder bag that was worn across the body, it still went missing during a walk, presumably the strap cut and away they went. Fortunately the handbag contained only mobile pphone and a camera, both, relatively, easy to replace. Back to the Hotel. First impressions, very good. Used the Airport bus from terminal 2 and got off at PL. Espanya, straight 20 minute walk down Av. Paral.lel to the hotel. Check in, straight forward and easy. Room well laid out and all amenities\u2019 to hand. Apart from breakfast, we did not use the hotel for much else, but the breakfast options were comprehensive and of good quality. Service was good, pots of coffee for Breakfast was a good sign, and all people polite and friendly. One minor point, when I mentioned at reception about the theft I was merely pointed to a sign explaining that Barcelona pickpockets are the \u2018best in the world\u2019 Gee thanks! The surrounding area, is a little rough, but generally seemed ok. I am sure though that single woman might feel a little wary. The low light of the trip was a drunk woman, deciding that the middle of the street was the ideal place to have a wee! The Rambla is 10/15 minute away and the Rambla del Mar, by the Christopher Columbus monument is about 15 minutes away also. We did walk to Sagrada Famila, not for the faint hearted as it took around 90 minutes each way. It was really worth the walk. In fact we did plenty of walking including along the beach and water areas and to Port Olympic. Plenty of food options around, Starbucks seems to have set up camp here, not such a bad thing, as I love a \u2018bucket\u2019 of coffee :-) But all restaurants and cafes we used were very good.

The room had 2 single beds which were seperated by a small table which was perfect for a girls trip. The room was large and very clean with wood lamanent floor and a tile bath. The beds were very comfortable with cozy bedding. Housekeeping did an excellent job with cleaning the rooms using steam cleaning to clean the floors. There is a restaurant on the 1st floor which had a good breakfast spread of hot and cold offerings, juices, and coffee/tea for 15 euros. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and spoke good English. The only downside was the poor internet which often didn't work. The hotel is a short walk to many places with the Metro stop right out front. A great location to get anywhere you want to visit without dealing with heavy tourist traffic. Would certainly recommend to others and stay again.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in Excellent location\u201d", "Author": "dupshall", "ReviewID": "UR120466871", "Content": "We stayed at Barcelona Universal hotel for 6 nights in late September and found it to be quite satisfactory.

The metro is right outside the hotel and the reception staff advised us of the best value deal for our requirements. We also booked our tickets for the Sagrada Familia Cathedral using the reception computer and printer, this saved us having to join a very long queue when we got there the next day. For pre-printed tickets you go to the box in front of the place selling tickets and just scan the bar code on your print out ticket and go straight in. Whilst at the Sagrada Familia it is also well worth going down into the crypt which is like a type of museum displaying the history of the cathedral.There are many bars and restaurants around the hotel at reasonable prices, and a few supermarkets within 5 mins walk. You can walk to La Ramblas and the Gothic Area in about 10 minutes. The Port Vell is also close by and we walked to the beach one day which took about 30 mins.

We did not go to the hotel restaurant so I have no review of that. The location of the hotel is great in the sense that you can get to anywhere pretty quickly. We had already spent a day in Barcelona earlier in our two-week holiday and Google Maps was absolutely perfect for getting around on the train. The hotel is close to the train so venture! Las Rambles is also a close walk, though we had enough of Las Rambles by that time. Location aside, I must say the neighborhood is a bit iffy. It\u2019s very easy to accidentally start walking down a street that doesn\u2019t seem safe. My guy is a pretty big guy so I very rarely feel unsafe, but if I had been with my girls I would have been a bit concerned. Also, the caf\u00e9\u2019s around the hotel aren\u2019t great; we ended up yelping and finding a great restaurant not too far, but we never would have found it just walking in the neighborhood. I must also note that we got a deal on the hotel, which could mean I\u2019m a little biased. We purchased it as a part of our flight package (yes, just for one night) and paid $30 for the night. I love a deal! Just to add the staff was great; there are definitely English speakers on staff.

We are a same-sex couple and asked for a \"couples bed\" (a double instead of two singles pushed together).

We worried about the street noise, but Herve suggested we try it and if the noise was really bothersome we could move to another room with two singles towards the back of the building. The noise turned out not to be such a big deal because (1) we are city dwellers and are used to some street noise at all times of the day(suburbanites and light sleepers will be challenged), (2) we were exploring the city for 12 hrs everyday and were so exhausted that we slept through everything.

The room was very nice, beds very comfortable and very clean. We were on the street side of the hotel about 5 stories up and while you could hear a little noise from the outside now and again it was not a problem. There were people out walking on the streets at all hours in this area and we actually felt very safe walking the streets at night in this area. The front desk staff spoke English and were very helpful. We asked them where the locals ate and they gave us a couple of choices and the one we ate at was a very good restaurant, about a 5 to 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The food was very good and reasonably priced. When I asked what was the best or quickest way to get to the Picasso and Chocolate Museum they said take a taxi.

I guess that is the reason most TA reviewers have said the hotel is well-located, especially for tourists on a cruise. The truth is that the location is a bit dubious however, with a porno club a block away (I don't read Spanish but I guess \"porn\" is \"porn\" in Spanish or Catalan, the large naked lady neon sign not withstanding). Kind of like Market Street in San Francisco, where there are many tourists but also nasty types as well. This working class area certainly had none of the upmarket Paseig de Gracia feel here, and I did not feel comfortable walking outside the hotel at night (well ok this applies to much of Barcelona too). My main beef with the hotel was the noise though - over the weekend there was the constant din from the party crowd along the streets (we were on the 7th floor). When we woke up at 6am to leave for the airport there were still plenty of people on the street just ending the night. The rooms are not sound proof at all, so you will also hear corridor noises very distinctly. We paid about \u20ac230 a night, and frankly expected better. Would not stay here again.

Get your tickets online and print them out at the hotel. We did that and then went to the cathedral, and saw the HUGE line to buy tickets to get in. We were able to go around the line, to the window where you check-in if you already have a ticket. That was a great relief! Also, don't forget to check-in online for your departure flight.

The outside was rather non-descript, and so were were unexpectedly surprised and pleased by the hotel's lobby when we walked through the double doors. It was clean, modern and well staffed (many spoke English). Although they were unable to immediately accommodate us (the normal checkin is 2 PM), they stored our luggage in a locked room, and encouraged us to use the pool locker room to freshen up. We took a tour of the hotel's public areas, and strolled around the city for a few hours. When we returned at 1 PM our room was ready. What a room! Based on a previous review, we had requested a quiet room away from the street side. The front desk clerk said he was sure that we would like our quiet room. We've heard that before, but it was never a truer statement. Located on the 9th floor, it was essentially a suite, with a living/dining area, large bedroom area with four large closets, and a bathroom with a huge whirlpool tub, hand-held shower, heated towel racks, sink, toilet and bidet. As if that were not enough, when we pulled aside the curtain in the living area to see what view we had, we discovered our own private deck, with a grand view of the city including (in the distance) the waterfront and the Sagrada Familia. The hotel offers free Wifi, including the computers with which to access it. We'd seen that in the lobby, and were pleased to find that additional computers also were available just a few steps away from our door. The hotel is located about 3 blocks east of Las Rambles, and has easy access to the metro system. We found it convenient and an easy walk to restaurants and the Columbus monument.

Streets appeared safe for walking around 8 -10pm. We took the airport bus downtown Plaza Espana (excellent service, no luggage problems) and cab from there saving about 10 - 15 EU on cab fare.

Yes the beds are 2 single matresses pushed together but I didn't notice until I commented how massive and comfortable the bed was and my partner pointed it out. I wish I could have taken the pillows home with me. The mini bar was typically expensive. Flat sceen TV, desk, safe, lounge chair, large wardrobe, airconditioning and opening window. Fantastic (and again spotless) bath/shower with great water pressure. Bright overhead lighting perfect for tweezers! (No full length mirrors in rooms.) Stayed on 2nd floor in corner room and wasn't bothered by traffic noise with window shut and a/c on. Buffet breakfast was (very salty) scrambled eggs, excellent bacon, tapas stuff (3 x hot), cold meats and cheese, bread, croissants, cakes, yoghurt, cereal, fruit, juices...all very fresh and acceptable in a nice setting. Roof area is a great spot to getaway and have an afternoon drink...fabulous view which is pretty much as good as you'll get anywhere in Barcelona. Pool wasn't huge but still a bonus. There is a bar on the rooftop plus a small but clean, modern adequate gym and a \"solarium\" which is a relaxing lounging area. The location of this hotel is as good as any.

Walking to and from day and night and catching the metro, we felt very safe but obviously kept our wits about us at all times - common sense prevails! The hotel bar is ok for a night cap and the bar across the road is a fantastic little local (picture attached). There is a supermarket nearby which stocks everything you could need. On the last day of our stay we happily left all our bags in the safety of the hotel luggage room for the entire day, returning throughout the day to use facilities and add to our luggage with last minute shopping. Negatives of the hotel are....there are no tea/coffee facilities in bedroom. Was also a little shocked that a few of bottles of water weren't supplied in room, not even upon arrival.

I believe we were able to get it for a bid of $120 ($~140 after taxes/fees) for 1 night. The price was only slightly lower than what was being offered on the hotel's website, but we were fine with it. We arrived at the hotel after disembarking our cruise ship around 9am. Check-in was usually around 3pm so they did not have any rooms available for us but offered to store our luggage in a locked room. We stayed in the lobby to take advantage of the free wi-fi and to figure out our plans for the day and after about 30 minutes, we were notified that our room was ready. We got a room on the first floor (1 level above street level) facing the main street. The room was very clean but small. The bed linens were crisp and clean with fluffy pillows, but the bed was no larger than a full size bed. We didn't really take advantage of the room's amenities (TV, mini fridge, etc) because we were out and about in Barcelona and had to check out of the hotel at 4:30am the next morning to catch our flight. The street is quite noisy and lively...even into 3am so if you have trouble sleeping with noise, request a higher floor that doesn't face the street. Here are a few other noteworthy things about the hotel: - they offer discounted tickets for the \"hop on, hop off bus\" that takes you all around Barcelona; normally they are 23 EU if purchased on the bus, but were 21 EU when purchased from the hotel - the free wi-fi was accessible from the lobby and rooms and had a strong signal; the speed of the internet was faster than other hotel wi-fi's that I've experienced - the hotel reception staff is very friendly and helped us schedule 2 taxis for pick up at 4:30am - it takes about 8-10 minutes to walk to Las Ramblas; I almost got pick-pocketed while on Las Ramblas when by brother caught someone reaching into my half unzipped bag so because of this, we didn't want to risk walking back to the hotel late at night in narrow alleys so we were back in the hotel soon after sunset at 9:30pm If we ever go back to Barcelona, we'd probably try to get a room right on Las Ramblas street, but would go back to this hotel if the price was right.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lightwater", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable, would return.....\u201d", "Author": "RickCLightwater", "ReviewID": "UR112007017", "Content": "Had a 3 day visit to Barcelona, staying at the Universal, there were 4 of us, my wife, my daughter and her boyfriend.

You take the exit Avda Rue de Sant Pau exit and the hotel is literally right in front of you. By the way be careful on the underground as someone tried (unsuccessfully) to lift my wallet while I was getting on the underground train.

There are plenty of cafes just outside the hotel selling good breakfasts at reasonable prices. The room has 2 large single beds pushed together, A/C, a safe (free of charge), a fridge, a TV with some English speaking channels, bathroom with shower, hairdryer and enough wardrobe space for 2 people. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. The window unfortunately opened up onto an interior quadragle, so no view but at the price we paid it was fine as all we did was sleep and get cleaned up. The hotel has a roof top pool which is clean but very very very small, do not be taken in by the hotel photos it is miniscule, 3 large adults would fill the pool. The hotel staff were fantastic and were very helpful. If I had one complaint it is this; on our last day we ate breakfast in the hotel as we needed to be out fairly early to get our flight. The breakfast is buffet style and has a lot of decent things to eat but I had the cooked breakfast and it contained way too much salt so watch out. Would I stay here again; yes without hesitation.

The terrace on the top floor is a real selling point as it was a great place to relax in the heat of the day. The only negative comments I have is that we ordered breakfast one day and it wasn't very nice and very overpriced. Also watch out as when we got a cab from outside the airport it was only 30 euros but when we asked the hotel to call us one for a return journey, the cab driver tried to charge is 65 euros - it was exactly the same difference.

Had a standard room, was advertised as a double, but this translates to twin beds ina lot of Spanish hotels. This was fine although trying moving to the middle and you'll slip through the gap! :-) Hotel price was reasonable, and our price included breakfast which was fairly substantial and sorted you for most of the day. The buffet was very varied, toast, scrambled eggs, cereals, cold meats, cheese, fruits, yoghurts and juices. If i had any complaints (extremely minor), the toast sometimes needed about three gos in the toaster, but on the last day they seemed to have adjusted the machine, and also even it would be nice if the juice jugs sat on ice. Like I say very minor. Room was fairly sized, clean and loads of room for storage. Room also had a safe which I recommend using. Bathroom was more than adequate, large sized , toilet, bath shower combo, bidet and large wash basin area, which is great, particularly when you have a partner like mine who takes over the sink space on most holidays! Room enough for two. Not an issue for us but our room didn't really have a view, we had a frosted window which only opened out into the centre not to the outside. It never bothered me as we were rarely in and views from my room don;t really bother me. If you're a natural light fan be warned there isn't any in certain rooms. Quite thick drapes which is great but has its downfall when you think its still night and its actually 930am! :-) Pool was small but ideal and perfect on rooftop - sadly never had time to use it. Location is where this hotel excels, right next to, literally falling into the metro station; Parallel on the L3 line. When you get off metro, take the Rda Sant Pau exit to be in front of the hotel. Also recommend buying a T10 tube ticket (7.80e) bargain at the price and covers zone 1 which encompasses all the major sites. The hotel is also located to many local bars (not touristy ones) and a number of restaurants literally next door. For some small tapas Los Cachitos round the corner is really nice. Because its on Avenue Parallel , there are so many shops and supermarkets if you want to pick up anything for your room. Staff were also great (contrary to other reviews) when we dealt with them and our checkin at 1030 at night was efficient and quick and they gave us maps and a guide book. It took us 30min from the airport, which incl the bus to Placa Espanya(5.1 or 5.3e one way), and then a 3 stop metro ride (easy as pie). Way back we just took a 4 stop ride to Sants Estacio and caught the airport train (3 E) - as easy as arrival I did read in other reviews that there are 'unsavoury' types hanging around in the area or near the hotel....ummm no more so than most big cities and to be honest we were never bothered or approached and really wasn't an issue. In fact one of the cafes nearby seemed to be popular for food and coffees by the local police so no issues really. I can say that in 4 days I never felt in danger etc. Basically just act as you would in your own home town and obviously after midnight or when its dark just be as cautious as you would at home. Because its a busy area, there are always loads of people around so I wouldn't worry. Also people say be aware of pickpockets, again this is my 4th trip to Barca, and I've never had any trouble in that dept either - touch wood.

The marina is about 10 minutes away and the Paral'lel underground station is right outside. The only thing to be aware of is that some of the rooms don't have windows with views. Our room-for-three had a window but it was frosted because its view was just into a kind of enclosed inner \u2018courtyard\u2019. The only view was other rooms\u2019 windows that did the same thing. I think this was only a problem on the higher floors which had communal balconies around the top of the building.

In all things this is mostly true - however there are a few rare exceptions out there and Hotel Barcelona Universal is one of them. Hotel Barcelona Universal is one of these rare cases where you get so much more than what you pay for - you get true value for each penny spent. I cannot even begin to list how impressed I was with what this hotel provided. We felt truly cared for; and while this is commonplace at hotels such as the Waldorf in New York, the d'Angleterre in Copenhagen, the Mamonia in Marrakesh it was not what I expected from a fairly cheap hotel picked by more or less chance on a vague recommendation from a friend. The Hotel is located a few minutes walk from the Rambla. A few minutes walk from the Port Vell and the Rambla del Mar, and a mere second away from the closest subway. A walk to place Catalunya takes about 10 mins at a slow pace looking at the shops in the backalleys and is quite a charming experience. The Barcelona Universal gives you the opportunity to experience life in Barcelona by making you take a short walk through a few genuine, \"untouristy\" blocks before landing you smack down in the middle of the Rambla. Or you could simply hop on the metro outside the hotel and go where ever you like. Inside the hotel itself we were greeted by the doorman every time we came or went, and the staff were always very helpful no matter what we asked for. The rooms were meticulously clean and tastefully decorated. Minibar, TV with USB (Just bring what you want to watch on a USB stick, plug it in on the back of the TV and use the remote) and bathtub was standard as was WiFi albeit it was a bit shaky and up and down at times. The breakfast buffet deserves special attention since it was on par with the most exclusive hotels I've visited (see above) although somewhat smaller. Several kinds of bread, including rye and darker breads, eggs, bacon, sausages (worth trying, they were excellent) quiches, juices, yoghurts, fruits, croissantes, and more where aplenty. Worth mentioning for those of you with a sweet tooth is that at each buffet were atleast two kinds of cake and several kinds of doughnuts and muffins. ;-) As for other accommodations worth mentioning one cannot forget the rooftop pool and the astroturf garden / sundeck on the top floor together with the small but clean and well stocked gym also on the top floor located next to the pool. The surrounding decked area is stocked with comfortable lounge chairs and as made for bringing your own beer and taking in the panoramic view over the city. All in all - this hotel gives you the most bang for your buck I've ever come across. Friendly and helpful staff, clean and tasteful rooms, freedom to move around and simply enjoy the city and your accommodation to the fullest. Four stars in the guide - I'd give it Four+ and a half :P Enjoy your stay as much as we did! H.

The only negative I found was that I didn't love the location - it was located about 10 minutes from Las Ramblas - a really easy walk during the day when it was light out but a little sketchy and harder to navigate at night (due to the smaller, winding streets).

Everyone that works there was friendly and the front desk staff went out of their way to make our visit to Barcelona a good one.

I would recommend for the Gothic quarter, Gaudi Parc Guell, Olympic, the shopping district (e.g. El Corte Ingles). The market off the Ramblas is nice, our favourite was the refreshing fruit juices, watermelon, orange, coconut, you name it, on a hot day,mmmm. We took an airport transfer bus (outside the terminal) from the airport in a short time we were in the centre shopping district(20-35mins).

The check-in was seamless. The desk clerks were eager to please and answered every question we had. They provided maps, directions, recommendations for tours and restaurants. The bell hop jumped at the opportunity to help with our bags from the taxi to check-in and our room, which was simply but nicely directed with plenty of room and closet space including a wall-safe. The room was spotlessly clean and the chambermaid immediately responded to my wife;s request for extra blankets. The bathroom was equipped with a wonderful shower, good towels and a bidet. We were fortunate to have a room which faced an alley in the back which was absolutely quiet both during the day and at night for sleeping. Our friends had a room on the same floor which had a nice view of the street, but with the attendant noises. If you want quiet, request a room facing the back. There is a nice, albeit expensive buffet-style restaurant for all three meals; however, there are also several local restaurants on the street which offer american breakfast for 7.50 euros. There is a metro stop in front of the hotel which is convenient for travel to and from the airport and throughout Barcelona. La Ramblas is a 10 minute walk. Ask the desk clerk for the best streets to navigate as some are better than others, Venture onto the wrong street and you will find more ladies of the evening than tourists - even in the morning. Don't miss the Boqeria - a large food market just off La Ramblas. Great selection of fruits, segetables, meats, cheeses, baked goods, etc. We were constantly warned about pickpockets, especially in the metro and crowed streets. Don't wear backpacks or carry valuables in back pockets. The hotel desk clerk will sell you discounted HOHO (get on get off bus) tickets, which I recommend as the best way to see the city unless you take a guided tour, which is unnecessary. There are two bus companies. One has two routes. The other has three. Buy the two-day package. The orange route includes four stops on Montjuic. We spent several hours there at Poble Espanyol, which was built as a recreated midieval community with dozens of restaurants, shops and artisans. There is a small admission, which is surprising since you go there to spend money, but it is wel worth it. If you plan to shop for souvenirs, do it there. The ambience and quality of the merchandise is delightful. Also, plan to have lunch there at one of the alfresco places in the large quadrangle just inside the entrance or at the small restaurant which sports a classical guitarist to the left of the quad.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Marina84036", "ReviewID": "UR85815728", "Content": "The hotel is next to the metro so is convenient for getting around and only few minutes walk to the marina and Las Ramblas.

The pool was a definite necessity as it was soo hot. This is both a curse and a blessing (I will come to this later). The staff were helpful and the breakfast very good and varied. The rooms were very comfortable although why they need a bed on wheels that moves away from the wall when you sit on it I'll never know. Anyway back to that pool.... Totally out of character with the hotel there was several large male only groups. Who seemed to just want to get paralytic by the pool all day and be loud and obnoxious. I'm sad to say they were all british although there were also some very loud Americans who were very rude to staff and moaned about everything. This is my only complaint really that a load of fat tattooed chavs are able to blast their music out loud by the pool without the hotel staff doing anything.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA lot to offer at a good price, at a convenient location.\u201d", "Author": "gbosquez", "ReviewID": "UR69730940", "Content": "This modern hotel gave us a great rate ( we stayed 5 days).

We also had an early drink here and were not overcharged as we had been elsewhere. Whilst our room was on the 7th floor at the front, there was indeed some noise evident on the first evening because of the football game: Barcelona won the last game of the season. I think overall the noise was commensurate with any city and whilst we could hear it on the 7th floor it was muted and although I am not the world's best sleeper it did not disturb my sleep. Also, the only sound we heard in our room was occasionally water running when we were not running water and we were quite near to the lifts and did not hear any other noises.

The hotel is located at the Paral-lel street, less than 10 steps from the hotel entrance there is a metro station (called also the Paral-lel station) in which 3 lines meet: L2, L3 and a funicular (a tram that connects between Paral-lel station and Park de Montjuic station). It is advisory to buy a T-10 ticket if you are planning to use the metro for several times. You can buy the ticket from a machine located virtually at all stations. The T10 can also be used by more than one person at a time. (Once you use the ticket to open the gate pass it back to your buddy). And note that you only need to use the ticket to enter the station, but you don\u2019t need to use it again to switch between different lines within any station. Step out of the hotel and turn left, in less than a minute you will reach the famous Bagdad club on your left hand side, and Apollo Club on your right hand across the Paral-lel street. From Bagdad club if you turn left you will reach the famous La Rambla Street in 5 \u2013 7 minutes. My recommendation for a full day plan (might take more than one day) is to visit the Montjuic which is a hill fully loaded with must see attractions such as castles, museums, theatres, parks, a magic fountain and the Poble Espanyol. To reach the Montjuic from the hotel take the funicular from the Paral-lel station to the Parc de Montjuic station, at the roof of the Parc de Montjuic station there is a teleferic (cable car), buy a 2 way ticket, visit the Castell de Montjuic located at the top of the hill, then get back to the Parc de Montjuic station and walk down the remaining of the Montjuic to enjoy the attractions one by one, if you wish to visit everything at the Montjuic you might need more than one day, in fact the Poble Espanyol itself might take a full day if you want to stop at each corner and know about everything while listening to the audio guide. I guess that the above gives a good idea about the hotel location in which you gain an easy access to attractions and at the same time avoid the noise from being at the centre of busy streets such as La Rambla. Regarding the view, our room was located at the rear side with the ugliest view I ever had; however I had no issues with that; since I did not came to Barcelona to stay at the hotel for long times. The 15 Euro breakfast was not that good, especially if you don\u2019t eat pork like me, but there are better and cheaper option outside the hotel and at the La Rambla. The hotel and rooms were clean and quiet. I did not deal with the hotel staff much, but I guess they were fine, when I asked for a map they gave me a map, when I asked for directions they guided me, when I asked for an electric adapter for my cell phone charger they gave me one, they smile at my face and they speak English \u2026..

The ramblas and la catalonya is the place to be to either eat, shop and take in Spanish culture but not so much to stay since it is constantly bustling no matter the time of day. Our travel agent booked the hotel but do remember getting a quite a good price.

There is also a small bakery on the street behind the hotel where we got croissants to eat. There is wifi in the hotel but didn't seem to work to well when we were there but there are 2 computers in the lobby which guests can use complimentary to access the internet. The rooms are a good size for European standard while the washroom were HUGE! The beds were so so for comfort but managed. As other reviews have said the windows do not keep the sounds from the street out, but once you are asleep its fine (and we were there during the uefa soccer game when Barcelona FC won).

Recommend: Buying a hop on hop off bus pass to see the city (27 Euros for 2 days) and if you are staying here to board a cruise take a taxi! since the actual cruise terminals are quite far from the waterfront in Barcelona (I actually remember seeing people dragging their luggage which seemed like a good hour walk and having to stop along the LONG bridge quite a few times on the short ride there, they must have felt like they were walking in the dessert), but the taxi fare is still fairly cheap.

There is also a Metro outside the hotel with 2 main lines running from it which will take you to most of the main attractions, but I will add that the best way to see Barcelona is the Hop on Hop off bus tour. We had a top floor room, and a balcony with a good view. The room was very spacious with a great shower and a bath with a jacuzzi. There was also a safe in our room which was very handy. The bed was huge!! And bedding changed every single day. Are room was situated at the front of the hotel, many people tend to be put off by the noise of the traffic but it wasnt a problem for us, you get the odd siren now and again but that is to be expected when staying in the city. We even slept a couple nites with the sliding doors open. Hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful when needed. WiFi was also an added bonus, with 2 computers on our floor and others in the lobby. Everywhere was spotlessly clean!! There are a couple of convienience stores just up the road, i would recommend a quick trip to one of these at the beginning of your visit, just to stock up on water and maybe some nibbles to keep in the room as the mini bar is quite expensive, but again that is to be expected.

Only minor fault was the breakfast, cold table good but the hot food not as high a standard.

My husband had the misfortune of being sprayed from the back of his head to his legs with a brown liquid (turned out to be cold coffee) by a scammer in the upscale neighborhood where Gaudi's Casa Milau is located (not near the hotel). This happened in broad daylight on a pleasant residential street. The perpetrator then offered to help him \"clean up,\" but disappeared when my husband said \"no\" and walked quickly away. We had to return to the hotel so he could wash his hair and change clothes. We sent the soiled slacks and shirt out to be laundered. When we checked out a few days later and went to settle our bill, we discovered that there was no charge for the laundry service. The front desk people had been sympathetic when the incident occurred, but this was really a nice gesture -- it saved us about 9 euros, or $13-$14. We booked this hotel though Hotwire -- so the price was very reasonable. We did not eat their breakfast, which like most hotel buffets, was very expensive. We ate most mornings at Pepe 2 (there are 4 restaurants owned by Pepe on this block, 2 on each side of the street), where a genial manager named Sam, who once lived in the Bronx, presides. Instead of 15 euros/person, we paid about 8 euros for both. One ordered the full Amer. breakfast, which we shared -- it was enough for 2 -- and the other just a coffee and pastry. The only drawback to this hotel is its location, a good 10-min. walk from Las Ramblas through dark and pretty deserted streets at night.

We had a tub, a seprate shower, dbl sink and even a built in sound system in the bathroom (seprate from the sound system in the rest of the room and living area) TERRACE: has amazing views of barcelona. Pool looked good. (to cold to get into it) INTERNET: they have wifi, but have laptops downstairs you can use free of charge. This was a great help to check work emails since my blackberry didnt work for some reason! STAFF: Ok this is a topic that ALL hotels in spain have negative reviews about. So if your smart...and put 1 and 1, you can tell this is the way they are. And by they i mean Europe as a whole. I have been to other parts in europe and they are \"cold\", \"rude\", or \"not helpful\". How ever you want to call it. This is how it is. So the best thing you can do is NOT expect Customer Service and you wont get upset. :-) Example: we went to eat and when i got my Credit Card recpt notice no where for a tip. I asked out server (who was dry, cold) where do i put the tip...and he explained that they do not work on tips. They get paid a salary, period. So if you put this puzzle together, it explains everything. And we found this to be the same way in all parts of biz in Spain. So again...let it go...or you will be frustrated ALL day long and loose focus on the beauty that Spain has to offer. AREA: This is another subject on this hotel. YES it borders and area called El RAVAL. This is not the best area and so if you stick on the main avenue the hotel is on...and walk towards the Port....you will run into the Statue of Colon. Thats where Las Ramblas begins. Thats an area of food and shops. Its about 4 big blocks away...but a nice walk. BEDS: Hard as a rock. but all hotels in Europe is this way. So as i said before...its the way of life in Europe and we need to adapt to this while where there. if not...you will have a horrible time. We loved Barcelona. We did the on & off bus which is great to take you to all the tourist locations you need to see. Its a dbl decker bus. MEN: have your wallet in the front pocket of your jeans.

One issue is that we found that this part of the city was not as nice as others (it was our first time) and therefore in the evening when coming back we found certain routes back on foot to be a bit uncomfortable when you come back from say the Ramblas and for that reason alone we gave the hotel a 4 rating although there is little they can do about it. On the positive side with regard the location the metro is literally over the road including the funicular up Montjuic hill toward the Olympic stadium and Castle. Barcelona was superb and we can recommend it as a break. If taking a small child bewrae some metro stations do not have lifts and some do. Also recommend buying a T10 metro ticket at the airport (7.70 Euros) as you can travel airport to city as one journey and then have 9 more journeys to use which we did around the city and our return to the airport.

The hotel and staff are very nice; rooms are super clean and modern. It is centrally located so it\u2019s easy to get anywhere in town and to all the popular sites. Rooms are small and lacking drawers so if you are there for a while with a bit of luggage, storage is a bit of an issue. There is a closet with several shelves and room to hang 12 or so items easily. The front desk staff all spoke (at the least decent) English and were always cordial and very helpful with directions, advice etc. There is no concierge but all the staff were knowledgeable. Or if they weren\u2019t sure of something would find someone who was. The location is great, you can walk to many sites and neighborhoods easily or use the Metro to get almost everywhere in a few minutes. The beds were not the most comfortable we have ever slept on but quite adequate. Bathrooms are also a bit small with 1 sink, but the facilities all worked well with good water pressure and very hot water. Shampoo and soap provided is not great quality so bring your own. We used room service for coffee in the AM only. It was lightening fast to arrive, the coffee strong, really good and plenty of it for 4 euro\u2019s. The hotel is in the center of town so street noise can be a problem; but you will hear the noise in any centrally located hotel. Barcelona is a late night city so the traffic and people are about and carousing until quite late. But when in Rome\u2026.we stayed out late as well. If you need to get to sleep early the noise can be loud so be sure to ask for a room not facing the main street. But I am sure you will still hear some noise. The high speed Wi-Fi internet is free but it was not so high speed most of the time. This was not a big issue. There is a pool and fitness center on the roof. The view is fantastic from up there. Though we did not use those facilities they seemed more than adequate if you really need to work out. (Sorry there is just too much to do and see in Barcelona and we got plenty of exercise walking!)

Though the food prices can be somewhat pricey at some places the drink prices were amazingly low. Most places have Cava\u2019s or other wines for under (sometimes well under) 12 Euros for a BOTTLE!

It started on friday, we checked in at 7pm, check in was quick and easy. We went up to our room (819!!) and were pleased that we had a wonderful view! Within seconds of putting our bags down, there was a knock on the door. The hotel had sent us up a bottle of champagne as we had said it was my boyfriends birthday when booking. We thought this was a lovely gesture and were very happy. The location of the hotel is great - as other reviews have said it is only a 10-15 minute walk to the ramblas and all other sights are in easy reach. Turn left out of the hotel and you are pretty much able to go everywhere! There is a metro stop outdside the hotel which is fast and easy and extremely cheap. We didnt use any other method of transport as this was so good for us. The pool on the top of the hotel is lovely, altho we didnt use it, we were only there for 3 nights and had so much to cram in! It is a lovely place to sit and watch the sun go down which is beautiful. The view is 360 degrees and well worth it! Im already planning my summer evenings for when we return!! We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but if you turn left out of the hotel there are some great cafes which are cheap and do great food. We had breakfast at Pepe's (yellow sign) and for 4.50 euro we had bacon, eggs, toast, fresh orange and a coffee - well worth it!

My first impression: Lobby was clean and nice. Reception offered a free drink upon arrival. Check in was late 3pm, but they offered a nice secure luggage hold. Entering the room: The Pros: The room appeared clean. The room also had a mini fridge and a little bowl of candies. There were lots of booklets, menus, and guides .The bathroom was also clean and came with a travel kit. The cons: The room was clean, but smelled like cigarette smoke covered with an obnoxious perfume. The booklets, menus were very worn, and finger printed... if you don't like germs, you won't want to touch these. The key cards they gave us were also used, and dirty with finger prints, and some substance on them. I found this a bit gross. I give this a 3 star because there were small details on cleanliness that a 4 star would have taken care of, and the fact that my husband and I's sleep was greatly reduced from the noise, and the exercise room was pretty skimpy and the machines were almost primitive looking for this day and age.

The hotel is rated 4-star, but as with all star-ratings, you never quite know what you're going to end up with. As locations go it is pretty good. Right next to a metro station, and only 30 mins from the airport (costing 70 cents if you get the 10-journey ticket, amazing value!) Most places are easily accessible by the metro but, as we discovered only 2 days before we left, it's better to get the bus to the beach, a number of which go from directly opposite the hotel and take about 15 mins. As hotels go it is clean and fairly smart looking, but clearly business orientated, indicated not only by the \"corporate\" feel to it, but the steep price of breakfast (17 Euro) and the lack of drinks facilities in the room, which was a shame. Our first room was a twin, at the front of the hotel. When I called down to be asked to move to a double (which was booked) there were no other rooms left, so the receptionist told us that we would be moved while we were out the following day, a minor inconvenience but acceptable. When we returned to the hotel the following day I was \"reprimanded\" by the receptionist for not clarifying my request that morning. Sadly, a case of one person saying one thing, and another doing another, an unfortuantely memorable event which could have easily been avoided. Our \"double\" room, was 2 twins pushed together. The beds were hard and uncomfortable, but thankfully our new room was at the back of the hotel, which was quieter and had better views. Housekeeping at the property is acceptable, but inconsistent. New towels one day, sometimes not the next day, bed made up one day, turned down the next. Although the bathrooms were spotless! Food & Beverage at the hotel should be avoided. The breakfast buffet and other menus are uninspiring, and the bar is so lacking in atmosphere that we only dared have one drink there, and we were the only people we saw all week in there. Much more could be made of both of these outlets as there are few other \"nice\" places in the area. And a word to the wise: if any restaurant has pictures of the food outside, keep well away. It is definitely the \"tourist food\"!

On the first night it rained very heavily which forced us to stay at the hotel bar since we were dressed for the sun, this suited us because we were quite tired. The only thing we found about this was that the bar service was quite slow and infrequent. The girl kept walking away from the bar leaving people with empty glasses, this happened on a few occasions during the two hours that we stayed there. Then as soon as the clock struck 12pm the bar was closed straight away without announcing last call as if it were going to turn into a pumpkin or something! The hotels location was excellent, literally only a five minute walk from Las Ramblas. I would recommend doing the hop on hop off bus tour as we found it the best way to get around.

We did the open top bus for a day (20 euros) we did see the major sights but from a distance. Best to do your homework before you go and do your own thing. A word of warning on the first night we went local for a meal in a well lit and populated road, we were walking back when out of a side road a boy/man ran out and attempted to grab my bag. Before I went out I had shortened the strap and it was across my shoulder held tight under my arm. A struggle took place and my husband was knocked to the ground. I managed to hit the boy several times in the face while trying to hold the bag. My husband got up and came towards him with clenched fists. At this point he decided to run empty handed. The frightening thing is there were lots of people around and no one came to our assistance, it's as though it's an every day occurance, which it is, that they have become used to as part of everyday life. I went into a hotel next to were it happened and asked them to call the police. They asked if anything had been stolen when I said no they said why call the police, did I want t o spend time in the police station filling in forms.

The weather was extremely hot 34 degrees when we were there and we were very pleased with the airconditioning in our room which worked superbly to cool us down after all the sightseeing. The only negative I could find was the pool it is more like a hot tub than a swimming pool I was very dissapointed when we arrived after a long walk from the bus station I was really looking forward to a swim but it was so small and already full of people scambling for space on the roof, I didn't bother so if you are booking the hotel because it has a pool don't! but the roof has some superb views of the city. Don't bother eating breakfast at the hotel unless you have it included in you room price it is very expensive and to be honest we found that 'Pepes' cafe just outside the hotel and turn left a little down the street very reasonable at 4.50 Euros for 2 slices of toast, 2 eggs, 4 rashers of bacon, glass of orange juice and tea or coffee. Please remember that this is a city centre hotel so it is a bit noisy at night we found the ambulances were the most annoying thing thay have an extremely annoying siren!

The breakfast is quite expensive, so make sure you check to see whether you have already paid for this.

Our room was large, clean and the bathroom was great. We were high up and facing the road at night and YES there are ambulances and police going past at night but this is a CITY and not the countryside and noise is to be expected. I never had trouble sleeping as it was not loud and intrusive. On the contrary I found the views from the hotel window exceptional and overwhelming in a city that never sleeps. Our Room had a large double bed, mini bar and satellite TV however the only English Channel is Sky News!! MTV Deutschland had occasional American TV programmes. The room had complimentary bathroom accessories and maps of the city. The room was cleaned every day and was spotless. The Hotel was also very clean and the rooftop viewing point with swimming pool and mini Gym was amazing you can take some fantastic pictures from up there. We opted for the continental Breakfast and it was well worth it as the city can be expensive to eat and drink in. Bars and Restaurants on La Rambla can be really overpriced and it is often better to choose the cafes and restaurants off the main road for better quality food, price and service if on a budget. La Rambla is really good fun and although quite pricey for food and drinks it is really enjoyable to sit and drink and watch the street performers and the world pass by. On our last night we went to one of the most amazing restaurants in Ravel called Casa Leopoldo. The food and atmosphere was incredible. A true Catalonian experience.

It would have been nice if they were more courtious about not disturbing people and shouting down the corridors to one another at only 9am in the morning when people have had late nights and/or are trying to get showered to go out. I have to say, apart from the Gaudi interest I really dont see what the appeal is about Barcelona - we were stared at constantly all weekend, the locals were very rude, there were prostitutes at night lingering the streets in intimidating groups, lots of homeless, pick pocketers (a man in our hotel had \u00a3300 stolen from his pocket on La Ramblas), the locals forced us into the road off the small pavements because they weren't prepared to compromise or give way and it was VERY expensive and I had 2 men approach me within a five minute period the first one running his fingers down my bare arms and making suggestive comments, when told to leave me alone I was greeted with a mouthful of english swear words, the second one just a few minutes later aimed straight for me trying to kiss me and touch me - both of these men were dirty, unkept, dodgy and very frightening and the unsafe feeling I got stayed with me all weekend. I smiled at everybody I made eye contact with in the streets and not one person smiled back, I met some American girls who said they had been told there was times in the day which are sociably acceptable to look at them and make eye contact, whether or not this is correct I'm not sure but I definately felt like we weren't welcome. There was old women begging everywhere for money and even whilst trying to get money out of the ATM in the bank opposite the hotel there was homeless people sleeping on the floor. The only good thing I have to say is about the Gaudi church which is still being completed, it was lovely, however, I wouldn't recommend Barcelona as a place to anyone and I would NEVER step foot back in this city!

They asked us to wait till 2 PM b'coz our room was not ready then. They offered to keep our luggage in their cloak room (they gave a receipt of this, so pretty reliable). Staff were courteous and helpful. The hotel has a swimming pool in the terrace, the views of the city from the terrace are good. Rooms were clean, spacious, comfortable and had a safe. The rooms facing the main road were slightly noisy if you were to keep the windows open, but the heavy curtains are easily able to stop those noise from being a nuisance. Moreover, the rooms are air-conditioned, so you don't need to open the windows. The bathroom was clean and big. There was NO tea/coffee making provisions in the room. For a supposedly 4-star hotel, I thought this is a basic must-have in rooms. The minibar was stocked with a variety of snacks, but it was very expensive. The hotel is 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas, the main touristy place of Barcelona. However, it is in one of the \"not-so-good\" areas of the city. The hotel's surroundings do not portray the best things about Barcelona. The road from the hotel to Las Ramblas is slightly deserted and not very comfortable to walk by after 11 PM. However, we did not find any issues although we used to walk through these areas to the hotel by 10 PM. The thing to remember is, just be careful of your belongings and people / things around you and you will be fine. The hotel sells tickets for external service providers as well which is very helpful. We booked our tickets for a Flamenco show through the Front Desk in the hotel. They also gave us a city map which was very useful to explore the city. The hotel certainly is value for money. The surprise element is, the VAT amount was not indicated in the room's price in the hotel's website, but it didn't pose any issues as such. They do accept Credit Cards.

The metro is superb for getting to places quickly but we also did a huge amount of walking and you do get to know the city very well that way. A straight walk of 10 mins to the centre of the Ramblas. We loved the Ramblas with its constant entertainment & it's market 'pet shops & aviaries'. At night the lower end has all sorts of entertainment from flamenco to michael jackson impersonators & frogs playing the piano. Also a 15 minute walk to the harbour & maritime museum & a 15 minute walk to the montjuic area - we loved the miramar panoramic bar there it's by the entrance to the cable car to the world trade centre. there is also a cable car that funs from the funicular (funicular can be caught from the metro outside the hotel) to the montjuic castle. All metro/funicular fares are 1.25Euro per trip to anywhere within 90 minutes. Another 10-15 minute walk to the placa d'espagne & magic fountain - only make sure it is going to be on before you hang a round for a couple of hours waiting in the dark only to find that it has be cancelled due to a trade fair or whatever! Again as previously said the area that runs directly between the hotel and the Ramblas is slightly run down but not at all threatening even late at night.

If you stay in other 4 star hotels in the UK, America, or other places in Europe, I would expect certain items as Tea/Coffee in your room. The only \"freebie\" you got was internet access and a safe We arrived as a party of 8 on Monday 17th September, and left on Saturday 22nd September. On arrival hotel looked OK but the area is very run down, dirty and very noisy. Yes I agree with others that it's location is great for Las Rambla and the Metro, but I guarantee there are better hotels in a more suitable area than this one The room I stayed in was fine, can't complain too much about it, but 2 of our 3 other rooms had hardly any/no view (except a brick wall), again not great considering the amount of money you spend for a 4 star hotel room On Tuesday night, the toilet continually dripped water into the toilet bowl, told reception the next morning and they said it would be dealt with. Great I thought. Was out until early evening, came back to room and the room was left open. Totally amazed, so much for security. Luckily nothing was taken, informed reception and they were very apologetic. We got a bottle of Champagne \"on the house\", but only because I asked for something from the hotel The worst was yet to come though. In our party we had 2 special birthdays, 40 and 16. We decided to stay in the hotel for a celebratory evening meal on the Friday -the night before we left. What a mistake!!! The service was dire, food average, the chips were cold. When the champagne was delivered, it was not put into an ice bucket, and not even \"poured\" by the waitress/waiters. This I hope does not sound snobby in any form, as you get this sort of service in standard restaurants. I asked for the air conditioning to be switched on and the smell from it was vile. It smelt like urine, and these fumes were blowing onto the salad buffet bar. My clothes, by the end of the night, smelt very badly, imagine what the food was like As it was 2 birthday celebrations, we got the hotel to bring out a cake with some candles. They did so, we then asked for a knife to cut the cake. A butcher's carving knife was brought out, and only when I was about to cut the cake, it was noticed, by one of our party, that the knife had blood all over it. It was absolutely disgusting, I could not believe my eyes. Reception was immediately informed, and again were very apologetic, kept the knife for evidence to inform the hotel manager the next morning. We were given some extra champagne as a \"sorry\", along with a large apple pie. After seeing what their utensils look like, did they think we would eat it? To make matters worse, when I returned to my room, I met 2 other guests who had eaten out and had had a great meal. I told them about the night's events, and they were told by the \"man on reception\" not to eat at the hotel and to definitely eat out - says it all doesn't it? So the following morning, I expected to see the hotel manager, but he was not due in, even though I was told he was going to be. Instead we saw the duty manager, who again was very apologetic. We did not pay for the meal, our drinks or any of the champagne. I asked the hotel to write to me via e-mail but nothing is yet to arrive. I will be sending this report direct to the hotel as I thought I at least deserved a response from the hotel, but then again, do they care? Would I go back?? Most definitely not. Would I recommend it, again most definitely not. If you want to eat food that is been cut with cross contaminated utensils, then go to this hotel. But if their own staff state not to eat their food, then trust me - Don't Don't get me wrong, the room was very clean, most of the staff were helpful, especially Veronica, but certain members were very snooty and were quite unhelpful So, not a great review for the hotel, I agree, but I believe in honesty.

The reception was pleasant even though the guy on the front desk was a little snooty (but I came across a few snooty people on my short visit to Barcelona - is this just my bad luck?). Anyway, being a 4 star hotel I expected a reasonably nice room but it was quite small and reminded me of Travel Inn room - cheap duvet, cheap furniture. The whole feel of the room was a disappointment as it felt very worn out and bland. The location was also a let down for me as the streets we had to walk down to get to the tourist areas were very smelly and quite seedy. It takes around 15 mins to get to Las Ramblas. There is a tube stop close by though. The buffet breakfast was nice. There was a small unused heated pool on the roof - which is worth the visit for a panoramic view of the city. After a long day sightseeing we didn't want to have to walk miles looking for a nice restaurant so asked the front desk (which has always worked out well for me on previous holidays) - they recommened the L'Amphere - which was a 10 minute walk away. It turned out to be a 20 minute brisk walk uphill - further along the less than picturesque Avenue Parallel. I'm ashamed to say but once we got to the restaurant it was a huge let down (I had asked for a nice restaurant with good food) - we didn't stay long enough to order food as the place was a dump! We ended up going to Basilica which we passed on our way. This was a beautiful place with great decor and food and was unbelievably half the price! Maybe the receptionists brother owns L'amphere? Who knows!!

Lots of nice restaurants in Barcelona- I recommend going just of Las Ramblas for great value and go to the Fairy Bar at the bottom of Las Ramblas beside the wax museum just for the novelty factor.

We live in Paris(where living costs are usually higher than spain), with 100 euros two people can have a very pleasant meal in a decent restaurant.

My wife and I visited Barcelona for a few days to explore Barcelona for the first time. Before booking I had read a lot of the reviews posted here. We were in a 4th floor room at the front of the hotel. Before travelling I had tried to get us moved to the back where it would be quieter, but the hotel was fully booked with conference delegates. There was a bit more noise than we would have liked from the traffic and the seemingly endless sirens from emergency vehicles, but both of us are heavy sleepers and this didn't cause us any problems, nor did we experience any problems with noise from within the hotel, although some rooms are located next to the restaurant and the lift shafts and would probably have been noisier. Our room was a typical good business class standard, although tea and coffee facilities were a miss, the mini bar fridge was very useful; we were not discouraged from using it to store our own bottles. The real plus for us was the roof top terrace. After a morning and afternoon of exploring it was great to get back to the hotel to go out and lie in the sun for an hour or two and read a book and lap up the rays before getting ready to go out for dinner. The area around the hotel is not the greatest; a lot of dodgy looking folks hanging around and the ladies of the night were around, although this is really confined to one street between Paral lel and Las Ramblas. However, we made sure that we didn't walk through the streets between Las Ramblas and Paral lel after dark, we used the metro at night. Despite the issues mentioned above, the area around the hotel seems to be undergoing some redevelopment and in the future I think it will improve as the location is really very very good in terms of locality near to the main tourist areas of Las Ramblas, the Marina, the Metro system, etc, etc. Never tried the restaurant in the hotel or the restaurants near by so can't comment on them too much.

Clean, well presented but lacks facilities such as trouser press, tea/coffee making materials and also a lack of information regarding internet access (in my opinion, it should be \"in your face\", i.e. a little card or similar near the phone ports etc) and hotel facilities. The pack was presented in a clear plastic container on the desk which I was not too impressed with. I'm used to leather bound etc. I think that makes life easier. I've stayed in four stars all over europe and parts of the world and its fairly standard. All that said, I would recommend the Universal to any would be visitor. Also, its about 500 metres to Las Ramblas from the hotel. Exit left and take the next turn left.

When in your room you can check your bill on the TV but it does not tell you about the VAT so had a bit of a shock when they give us the bill.

We had breakfast included so we enjoyed a nice continental breakfast each day, although the \u20ac13.50 it would have cost otherwise was a bit expensive. The staff at reception were helpful and gave us directions to the Ramblas and advice on walking in the area.

Barcelona itself is a great city with so much to see and do, but tiring ourselves out all day we were glad to have such a comfortable place to come back to. The people were absolutely lovely and couldnt have done more for us. I advised them of our anniversary when we booked and we received complimentary champagne on arrival which was heavenly once we got to sit and relax. We had some hassles with one of our credit cards and they were a great help to us. Always smiling and wanting to help. The rooms where lovely and clean and spacious enough to sleep or just sit and relax in. The bathroom has everything you need and it was great to be in a place where they think of giving you things like make up remover, shavers and shaving cream and toohbrush and toothpaste. The mini bar is fully stocked but there werent any tea and coffee making facilities and by about day 3 i was hanging for a cup of tea! Down the road are a few adult places so perhaps not a place for a family, although there were a few when we were there and they werent bothered about them. Dont opt for the breakfast as you can get just as good for much cheaper. However ,if you decied to pop in one morning at least you have the option instead of beng locked into it. Its a buffet so you can fill yourself up with as much as you like and there is a great range of things to choose from, but i still dont think 13 Euros worth.....maybe a man could pack a bit more away! The roof top pool is small and tends to feel quite crowded around it however you can cool off and go up another flight of stairs to the solarium if you want to get away from the folk around the pool. Most people forget its there. The beach in Barcelona is disappointing so we were quite happy to have somewhere to go to cool off after exploring during the day. But as it is a small pool this isnt the type of hotel you would choose if you wanted to lay around the pool all day. If you get the metro (the paral-ell stop is right out the front door of the hotel...very handy) up to where the cable car is, on the walk down to it you will pass the public pool and this was the location for the diving and some swimming during the olympics. There is a small entry charge but it will give you so much space to swim about and no crowds, because everyone else is packed onto that awful beach. You also get amazing views of the city from there so take a camera! We had a wonderful steak dinner in the restaurant and if it fits in your budget you should give it a go, but again there are plenty of great places within short walking distances from the hotel. If you do go to Las Ramblas head off the main street for food and drinks as the price will drop dramatically. A 40 Euro bill for 2 sandwiches and 2 beers or a 50 Euro bill for 4 people tapas dinner and drinks, and there are some lovely places just off the beaten track. Also if you fancy a good old burger head straight to the Hard Rock Cafe, not too badly priced and servings so big you will only need a main!!

We did have trouble getting change one day and were told they couldn't give us change for a 10 euro. Skip the breakfast. It is 13 euro and not very extensive from an American point of veiw for a buffet. You can walk down the street and find a few places on the same block that serve breakfast for around 9 euro. If you are staying with kids, be forewarned that there is a sex shop down the street and a burlesque shop around the corner on the street to Las Rambles. Also, a street off of the street to Las Rambles is a hooker street. We were traveling with teenage boys, so it wasn't a problem for us.

The location of the hotel, in my opinion was ideal. Situated partway up the Para.lel road it was only a 5-10 minute stroll down to the lovely Port Vell area and the same distance to La Rambla. There are a wide variety of restaurants all within a couple of kilometres walk from the hotel and examples of stunning contemporary architecture all around; as close as directly across the road from the hotel. The small rooftop swimming pool was really lovely and although the temperature was in the mid thirties when we visited, we were able to swim in relative peace and were also able to find a free sun lounger.

As soon as I got home I called the hotel...well, the first call of many more that would come...I gave the exact information about the location of the sweat-shirt and even pointed out that was a rather expensive piece of clothing (more expensive that all my stay at the hotel) and also with emotional value. Despite all the calls, the staff was unable (and not willing) to solve the problem, I didn't have the opportunity to speak with the manager, and they revelled an arrogant and not concerned attitude towards my issue. In sum, in less that 24 hours a client's personal article was \"lost\" and no one ever took any responsibilities for it. This is an intolerable situation in any hotel. So, I don't recommend this hotel to anyone, mainly because it doesn't inspire me any trust. In my case, it was a piece of clothing, in any other case, it could be anything much more valuable. Any person can forget anything in a hotel room, so think about going to this hotel twice. Because I am totally certain that shirt was in the room.

When we checked in at noon and requested a room on a high floor facing the back, we were told at reception that we could have one if we were prepared to wait until 2 pm. We waited and got room no. 819, which was perfect with regards to noise and view. It was a reasonable size but not exactly spacious. It offered what most travellers look for: a huge bed (a bit hard), safe, clean bathroom, hair dryer, air conditioning and TV with some international channels. The view was great, we could even see the Sagrada Familia! One complaint that I had, was that there was no electrical socket near a mirror, so I had to use my hair straightener using the reflection in the television. Even though it was a busy street, we had no noise in our room at night. However, the cleaners were quite loud in the morning so you could not have a lie-in beyond 9 am. We had a problem with the electricity in our room the morning after arrival, but it was fixed promptly. The breakfast was good and varied (although I missed normal fresh croissants), but expensive if not pre-booked. The small pool and sun deck on the roof were nice and usually very busy. The view was spectacular and we used this area to relax in the early evening on a couple of occasions. In some reviews it was mentioned that the neighbourhood is a bit dodgy. Well, the hotel is on a busy main road, so no safety issues here apart from the traffic. There are so many directions that you could go, that you can avoid walking through El Raval if you want to. I actually quite like this barrio, which has a lot of character with some nice shops, restaurants and bars, and I felt perfectly safe during the day. One observation: there were some prostitutes lined up at Carrer Tigre and on Sunday afternoon families gathered on benches nearby to watch them going about their business. Great free family entertainment for grandparents and their small grandchildren! Anyway, at night we would avoid this area and took a taxi to the hotel. The shortest walk to Las Ramblas was about 10 minutes and the metro was right outside the hotel. (We saw a lot of people jumping over the turnstiles here as the station is unmanned!) Overall, we can recommend this hotel as it offers clean and comfortable accommodation in a convenient location. We also got a very competitive price through Expedia. Good restaurants: Elche (near Hotel), Crema Canela and Bilbao-Berria. The renowned Ca L\u2019Isidre is just behind the hotel, but it was shut for holidays when we were there.

I'd arranged the trip as birthday surprise for my boyfriend, and 5 minutes after getting into our room a complimentary bottle of champagne arrived, the lovely Maria who works on reception had arranged this. The hotel is situated perfectly, it's a 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas, so close enough but not right in all the noise. Lots of comments have been written about the road you have to walk down to get to Las Ramblas, to be honest yes it's a shabby road, but you're in the middle of a city, what do you expect. And the main police station is on this road so i wouldn't worry too much. Just be careful like you would anywhere. Yes it's a modern hotel, quite business like and contemporary, so don't book it if you want character, but to be honest if you're spending that much time in your room or hotel, you're in the wrong city. The rooms are a good size, the \"double\" bed is huge, more king king size. The Bathroom is very nice, good little treats left for you. And it was cleaned every day. We did have breakfast on the last day as a treat and it was very nice. but personally I wouldn't pay the extra for breakfast as there are a couple of restaurants outside which do a great breakfast for 6-10Eu (you'll pay 14EU each in the hotel). The road outside is busy but we honestly didn't take any notice as we spent our time just enjoying the city. We certainly didn't notice the noise as being an issue. The pool is small but nice, and there are great views from the roof. The Metro (Paral-lel) is literally outside the hotel, and reception were so happy to advise on everything from which stations you needed to get to all the sights to good local restaurants. We were given a map of the city and Metro on check in, which was very useful. Buy a 2 or 3 pass for the Metro. the 2 day one cost 8EU and you can use it on Buses and Trains I'd book this hotel for the treatment we received alone. Tips - Obviously visit Sangrada de Familia, beautiful, But DO NOT miss Park Guell, amazing examples of Gaudi, but beware the walk from Metro is LONG.

It\u2019s big tourist spot but nice place to people watch.

The rooms are lovely, cool, nice bathroom with little nick nacks etc. The traffic was a bit noisy but hey you are right on the main road so what else can you expect!

The waiters/waitresses do keep an eye out for you - in this case the boy was confronted and chased away empty handed.

Leaving the hotel we always used the first street to the left to walk to La Rambla area and although there was a distinctly seedy feel to the place, we felt relatively safe due to the police station and numerous police in the area - the sheer number on view must say something about the nature of the area. The last reviewer remarked on the ease of travel using the Metro system. Our trip to Barcelona was one of a medical matter rather than a holiday and on the last but one day, we needed to cross the city and decided to take the metro from the Paral.lel stop which is immediately outside the hotel to avoid the huge traffic jams. Here we were physically attacked when getting on the train by two men of Arab appearance and my husband lost his wallet and contents but thankfully suffered no injuries. Within 5 minutes of the attack, large purchases totalling nearly \u00a32000 had been run up on his credit card which seems to indicate that a very professional operation is being run with regard to stolen credit cards. We do speak Spanish and thankfully were able to cancel the cards within 15 minutes to prevent further loss, I was told when making a report at the police station that this area, and this station in particular, is one of the worst (ie dangerous), if not the worst, in Barcelona and when my husband explained to his dental surgeon why he had arrived late, the surgeon was horrified to hear that we were staying anywhere near the Raval District and, in particular, had ventured onto the Metro there.

Do not hesitate in making a reservation at this place... we cannot fault it at all. My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of the month. We were only on the 3rd floor and overlooked the street and the traffic didn't bother us at all so I can't understand how people on the 8th floor were troubled by 'noise'. Ok, so it was a busy street but I didn't think it was that bad... some morning's we even slept through until 11 having tired ourselves out the previous day exploring what Barcelona has to offer. Admitedly there always seemed to be police/ambulance sirens going off but working in the centre of London from Monday to Friday, it's something you become immune to and so it didn't affect us. The hotel itself was amazing - our first impression was that we'd walked into the wrong place as it seemed so grand for our 'budget city break'. The rooms are very spacious with great air conditioning and facilities. We tried breakfast at the hotel one morning but as someone else has mentioned EUR13 was relatively steep for what you got. In a cafe just a few doors along to the left you could have an 'american' comprising of 2 fried eggs, sausage, 2 bacon, toast, tea or coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice for EUR8... that kept our stomach's full well into the day. Regardless of where you go exploring, there's plenty of mini supermarkets and bakeries so if ever we felt peckish at lunchtime we simply popped into those for a freshly baked french stick and cheese. Right outside the hotel doors is the entrance for Paral.lel station which offers great links to almost anywhere. Their train maps are very clear so you'll never get lost. Go one stop to Drassanes and you'll find yourself down by the port and Mare Magnum shopping centre, where there's plenty of restaurants on offer. If you are a fish lover, one of our faves was Emperadors where a three course dinner with wine, water and coffee for two cost us \u00a345. Another, situated actually within the shopping centre, was Mandongo, an oriental-come-spanish mix where, again, the food and staff were delightful. We didn't even bother with cabs to and from the airport. A 5/10 minute walk from the terminal along a signposted route brings you to the train station where a journey of 20 mins costing EUR2.5 takes you to Sants station, which in turn is only a few stops on the underground to Paral.lel. Their underground is also airconditioned (unlike London) so travelling around on that is great, especially if you want to escape from the daytime heat. We didn't bother with tour buses or anything as our 5day Barcelona Card for EUR30 got us literally everywhere. We purchased our card once we reached Sants station. It entitles you to discounts and free entry to many attractions so it's a great money saver. We hopped on and off (normal) buses and trains to our hearts content and explored so much. All in all, we'd say Barcelona is a top place for a city break. Plenty to see and do and for a reasonable price if you plan wisely. There's plenty of websites with constantly changing deals on hotels (we booked through hotels.com) plus flights with Easyjet lower your overall cost too (we got return flights for \u00a390 each).

In fact, the street is quite interesting with small shops and plenty of people. Don\u2019t let that put you off. The hotel is less than 100 metres from a metro station, which will connect you to the whole city. We didn\u2019t use the tourist buses at all but instead bought a 3 day travel ticket which can be used on the metro, trains, buses etc. This was much better value (\u20ac12.50) as opposed to \u20ac21 for two days on the tourist bus.

It took a while for our baggage to come through but once we had it we decided to take a taxi to the hotel. Loads of Yellow & Black taxi's just outside the airport which cost around 25 euros to the hotel. Took the advice of the people on the website and asked for a room on one of the higher floors. It did mean us waiting for another hour past the booking in time, but well worth it. We had a room on the eigth floor (no.811) and were upgraded to a superior. The room was very spacious, very clean and modern. However we were at the front of the building which did get a lot of loud traffic noise - but not unbearable. Whist we were there the restuarant was closed for refurbishment, but they still did breakfast and room service. Both of which I would stongly recommend not having. The room service meal was quick to reach us but cold, and I didn't think it was much better then what you would get in a fast food restuarant. The breakfast was OK but massivly overpriced at 13 euros each. If you turn left outside the hotel and walk about 100 metres along you will see a cafe which is just as good but half the price. I strongly recommend the Bus Tours, you can buy a ticket on the bus or at the ticket box at Port Vell, just outside one of the bus stops. It cost 17 euros for a one day ticket but you can buy a two day one. It is a great way to see the city and find your bearings. You can get on and off the buses as often as you like and there are loads of bus stops scattered around the city, they will provide you with a map and more details about what you can do when you buy the ticket. The Sagrida Familia and the Nou Camp are amazing and not to be missed. If you like a bit of home comfort then there is a great Irish pub down La Ramblas - just down a side road past Burker King, called Flaherty's. They do great pub food with a good atmosphere. All the staff are Irish (which was a nice touch) and really friendly. Take the advice on the website and don't take the side street just outside the hotel on the left to La Ramblas. It is a bit seedy and didn't look to safe. Take the longer route past the Maritime Museum. Be aware of pick pockets, I had an over the shoulder bag that I kept in front of me the whole time. Just take the same caution as you would in the centre of London. There were some beggers down La Ramblas, oftern women with babies that come up to you whilst you in one of the outside cafe's eating. We only saw one or two and if you ignore them they do go quietly. In conclusion we could not fault the hotel staff or room on the whole trip. The location was the problem for me and although you are close to nearby attractions it would put me off staying at this hotel again. The road itself that the hotel was on did make me feel uneasy especially at night. The fact that there was no decent food within the hotel was also disappointing.

I was certainly not disappointed. Just returned from a 2 night stay with friends and was very pleased with this hotel. The first thing that strikes you when you walk into the rooms is how clean they are. Everywhere is spotless and the decor stylish and modern. The hotel staff are very friendly and they will give you advice on where to go in the city of you ask them. They all speak very good English too. We had a room on the 3rd floor and 2 of our rooms were overlooking those shabby looking apartments (my advice would be to just keep the curtains closed as you'll not be in your hotel room for long!). Our other friends room was one of those with an internal view (facing the air shaft). It did make the room a little stuffy as there was no natural light but there is air conditioning. We didn't bother trying to change the rooms as we arrived late and the hotel was full so we figured it just wasn't worth the hassle. If you think this would bother you, I would suggest trying to get there early so you can ask to be moved. Seriously though, if it's a clean, modern, reasonably priced and ideally loacted hotel you are after, then this place is for you. (We booked our hotel through EasyJet and got a mega discount! \u00a376 each for 2 nights) We didn't bother with the Metro after reading all the scary stuff on here and we just got taxi's (very reasonable - around 25 euro from the airport to the hotel) and used the tour bus (10 minute walk from hotel...just ask the staff and they will point you in the right direction) to get around the city. A day's ticket for unlimited use on the tour bus was (I think) 17 euros and I'd say it was well worth it. Try and get on the top open air deck though as it's a totally different experience! You get to see all the wonderful architecture around the city, you really won't believe your eyes. We didn't see half the sights we wanted to as we were stuck for time but the highlights for us were the breathtakingly beautiful La Sagrada Familia and Nou Camp (even if you don't like football, this place is pretty special!). Be careful on your way to La Rambla (10 minutes walk from hotel). There is a street with a dodgy peep show type place on the corner and this street takes you to La Rambla. We went down there fairly early in the evening and stuck together but we saw some very dodgy looking characters hanging around here. I would advise either taking the main road or just jumping in a taxi. We went to the Port Olimpic for our night out and there are lots of bars and night clubs there staying open till around 5am! Don't bother getting there till at least 11.00pm as you'll never last the distance!

We were on the 4th floor -not a single problem with noise and certainly didn't hear neighbours doing anything. View was of shabby apartments on the back but seeing as we were out most of the day seeing sights of going for leisurely walks this was not a major problem. BEd was huge but only because it was two twin beds joined together. Bathroom is basic but pretty decent and goes well with the room. Ample storage space and pulg points for essentials such as mobile phone charge, girlfrineds hairdrier, girlfriends hair straightener and girlfrinds iron!!!! Pool is small as is the gym - one cardio machine of each type! But you must venture to floor 10 as the views are breath taking...from Sagraga Familia to the Olympic Stadium and from the Columbus Statue to the cruiseliners and yachts out at sea. Never had breakfast as is pricey and not great variety but do use the cafe on the left under the neighbouring hotel - excellenct food (all day american breaksfast!) and service! Staff was some of the most helpful staff. I had researched the restaurants prior to travelling and had decided to book a table at Barcelona's top rstaurant - and the staff took over and booked me a table at Tragaluz. Amazing food at a cost - but certainly worth it. All in all the Hotel cater's for everyone's needs. But do be careful with the back streets as they are not safe. I didn't even feel safe walking down them with my girlfriend and I am a martial arts expert. Do keep personal belongings safe when walking in the immediate area - there seem to be a lot of foreigners who just look at you and 'eye up' what possessions you have in your hands. In-room safe in hotel provides great peace of mind as passports and other items were totally safe there. Would I recommend it? YEs - but to those who don't mind walking a bit to the key sites.

We loved the hotel and had a very pleasant stay. The staff is lovely, they are helpful and give great tips for tapa restaurants (cannot judge their english as I spoke Spanish with them), the hotel is very good situated, with good acces to public transport. The subway entrance is just in front of the door. Make sure you have a room on the higher floor to overcome street and subway noise. If you are used to live in a city, floor 3 should do already. If you come from a village, you will always be annoyed by noise I suppose. People who complain about noise in this hotel are just not used to any sound while going to sleep. The area around is very safe, with the same city/village comment as for noise. We had a great room (702, yes, seventh floor (out of 10)), the biggest of the floor (which was clearly shown on the escape route map) and were offered a splendidu bottle of cava (for those who don't know, cava is similar to champagne, but only available in Spain as it comes from a different region) on the house because while booking I wrote our stay was part of our honeymoon. I also requested a room on the higher floors, so they indeed took my remarks into consideration. The bedroom was L-shaped and very large, having an extra sofa and table in the lower part of the L. The bathroom was large too, equipped with two sinks, a bidet, a toilet, a shower and a bath tub. Having this marvellous bathroom including a loungey music system from the hotel, we enjoyed a bath while having the cava. If they offer you a room with only a view of the shaft, do refuse it. And if they cannot give you another room, then they should at least lower the price (see below what I paid) as rooms are not equal. Indeed there are no alarm clocks, but any soul with a mobile phone should be able to overcome this 'problem'. I did not notice any air conditioning so maybe in summer it can get hot in the rooms. In that case, opening a window would indeed add noise if you stay at the front side of the hotel as the traffic goes on all night. The breakfast is good (but not the coffee!), but defenitely not worth 13 euros. For this price you can have dinner in a tapas bar! So, go outside, walk 50 steps, sit on a terrace and have a breakfast in the sun, not only 70% cheaper, but also including personal service and fresh *good* coffee/espresso. I booked this hotel based on the comments of this website. It did meet up the expectations very well. Oh yeah, the rooftop swimming pool is indeed nice, but not heated, so in November no chance to swim!

The hotel was fantastic, we did have a bit of a wait when we arrived but was very pleased to see they had a locked room for our luggage and a very helpful concierge. The staff at the desk were very helpful and got out a map and showed us places to go to eat while we were waiting for our room. Once we got to the room I was pleasantly surprised on how big the room was, unfortunately we got the short straw and had a room with no view but it didn't spoil anything. The room was very clean, and well maintained. There was everything that you needed a mini bar, a free safe (very easy to use) little accessories in the bathroom. We went to the outdoor pool which is on the roof WHAT A VIEW!! The location is great with La Ramblas only about 10 minutes walk and the metro outside. It was can a bit confussing coming back from La Ramblas because you can end on roads that tourist shouldn't go. I had one small problem which was the Satellite TV which was all in Spainish (I speak no Spanish apart from Thank you). Overall had a fabulous time, I would recommend this is a great place to stay.", "Date": "July 26, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Barcelona Universal Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d230643-Reviews-Barcelona_Universal_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$119 - $417*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avda Paral.lel 76-80</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "230643", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2a/37/90/rooftop-pool-free-of.jpg"}}
