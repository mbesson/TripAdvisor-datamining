It's an area where there are bikers and skaters and surfers (fun!) mixed with homeless junkies (not so fun). If you are a surfer you will love the waves here. The hotel itself was okay. We were traveling with our two dogs so our options for hotels were limited. The staff was very nice and the courtyard was pretty cute. However the room was super basic and bare and the towels are made of sandpaper. The pictures on their website make it seem like a much nicer place than it actually is. We got a room with a patio and it was $195 which, it was not a nice enough place to justify that rate. You can hear everything through the walls. It sounded like the people upstairs were moving furniture all night. And at about 6 am we discovered that we were in the airport flight path and I was woken by low-flying jets sounding like they might just land inside my room. So I really couldn't sleep past 6 in the morning. Another reason why we chose to stay in Ocean Beach was for the Dog Beach. The dog beach is actually a very very long walk from the hotel. But the dog beach (when we finally got there) was great and huge. There was a disturbing sign posted saying \"Warning! Run-off\" which we really didn't quite figure out what that meant. But no one else seemed disturbed by it (and I guess we are sheep so we just did what everyone else was doing and ignored it.) BUT the dogs had an excellent time!

I was a little sceptical at first about staying at the Ocean Beach Hotel thinking that it was going to be \"a dump\" like what some other reviews has said...but it was the opposite!!! It looks just like shown on the website but make sure you get the right room because the pictures on the site ofcourse are going to be the suite rooms with views...not your basic standard room. Oh and the pictures on google earth are terrible pictures of the garden...it doesn't look that dumpy, those must have been taken in the winter, garden looks just the way it looks on the website. Ocean Beach is a \"beach town\" not a luxurious resort so if you want luxury, go somewhere else. If you want a nice place to relax, that is romantic then this is the right place. It had a more antique european style look. The room we stayed in had a shower no bathtub...which is fine because I don't want to be bathing in sand after I just came from the beach. As appose to what couple negative reviews said below there are FUN bars with pool tables, GREAT food dives, and CUTE antique stores. There WERE hippies hanging out all over the place but isn't that what you expect from a beach town?? By no means though does that mean there were bums around because we looked and we never saw any. As a matter of fact there wasn't one car in the area that wasn't made before the year 2008 at the Motel or the beach parking lot. There were very few people staying at the hotel there and we were there over a weekend. The Rooms did not smell BAD, the garden area smelled a little \"musty\" because it's on the inside of the Motel and if your room faces the garden then chances are that your room will have a musty smell if the window was left cracked open by the staff that cleans the room. The floors were very clean and I have high standards...I stripped the bed to look for bed bugs ( there weren't any), I checked under the bed, in the drawers, the whole room was spotless...I was actually surprised that this motel was cleaner then large Hotels that I have stayed at in resorts. The one negative to the room was that where we went in, it was a little warm and the towels felt a little damp...even though we could tell they were clean by the way they were folded. As soon as we turned on the air conditioner, it was fine. The lady at the front desk told us it was very secure and that has someone on guard 24 hrs a day. You can't enter the Motel Garden without a key. As far as it being roudy at night, The town does get a little packed but we were able to eat dinner in 20 minutes and get back to the room without any problems. This Motel was Exactly what we wanted. The room was little and cute which was what I wanted. It's right across the street from the beach...but not \"across the street\" as in far...it's literally 84 ft away from the beach. It has a beachy and california look atmosphere. The service at the hotel was excellent! We asked for an extra blanket because it gets chilly at night and they brought it to us right away. oh and someone said that they don't have heaters?! The heating temp unit is right on the wall!!!!!...idiots. Oh and the Doggy beach is about a half mile away, the walk through the houses are pretty. If you bring dogs with you I recomend it, they will love it and there are many nice dogs around...just beware of the aggressive ones because we saw a few. We stayed in the pet friendly room that faces the garden so you can take them right out. O would recommend asking for the pet friendly patio rooms so that way they can take care of their business their and not in front of a couple trying to see the beautiful scenery!! There is a great view into the garden from our window and the view from the garden to the beach was beautiful! Watch ot for the noisy people upstairs who like to stomp---if you don't bring pet I recommend getting a top floor room. Oh and we couldn't really hear the ocean because the water fountain outside was loud...but you can hear it in the garden We are definately coming back for sure!!! I will be posting videos on youtube so if your interestd in seeing what the rooms look like and if they're for you. look for videos posted by Ladykennyg1.

This place looked decent on their web site. First we drove through the strip..packed full of grungy shops and food dives/bars. Young dirty hippy wanna bees hanging out everywhere. I looked at my sister and thought we better eat early and head back to the hotel. I can imagine it gets roudy at night. So at the end of the strip is the hotel and beach. We checked in and walked up a lot of stairs to our room...not impressed at this point...kind of scared to be there. I did not feel comfortable with the crowd staying there. We stood in the room for 2 mins before deciding we need to leave. Did not feel safe - it smelled BAD - no way was I sleeping in that bed or taking off my shoes for that matter. We took our bags back down all the stairs and the NICE lady at the front desk EASILY gave us our money back. Thank God we did not have to argue that one! Bummed out....we just wanted out of that area altogether. Headed north back up to Santa Barbara where we had a room the night before. Unless you do not care about being safe and clean do stay here.

I am sure the clerk was untruthful that the prepay had to be refunded through Orbitz, ( I didn't even book through Orbitz!) because as a privately owned hotel OF COURSE they couldve refunded all or part of my money!

Not only is there no elevator, there is no one to help you with your bags to your room. There is no closet in the room, the hangers are right in your room. This place has a nice location. I think it would be fun for a surfer or someone but if you are a surfer with money, you would stll probably like a clean place with a sincere staff and maybe even heat in the winter.

We had just driven over from Phoenix with our dogs and thought it would be hard to find a dog-friendly hotel last minute, so we checked in (bad mistake #2) without first looking at the room (bad mistake #3). (Also, we fortunately discovered that most hotel chains are dog friendly these days.). At the promised price of $150, we would have tolerated the disgusting room conditions to take advantage of the Ocean Beach charm. At $220, this was robbery pure and simple. The supposed recent 2 million dollar renovation didn't include this room. You might ask what was wrong? 1) Paint peeling off the walls in several places. 2) drawer handles missing from the furniture. I guess handles weren't really necessary since the drawers were cracked and didn't really close anyway. 3) I put on white ankle socks which were filthy in 10 seconds. I realize that it's hard to keep things clean at the beach, but that was just gross. 4) Baseboards cracked and didn't come together with the door jambs. I guess the dirt was keeping them apart. 5) The \"patio\" had a table and four chairs, one dead plant, empty planters, weeds, and a chunk of concrete missing from the wall. 6) Missing faceplates and exposed wires on electrical outlet. We checked in and tried to get on online to find another place, but couldn't connect to the free wi-fi. After about an hour, we told the front desk clerk (in person because the phone did not work) that we preferred not to stay, and were told that they would be keeping the money for the night ($245 after taxes). No curiosity about why we were dissatisfied. We checked out the next morning (2 days early), and the same person who checked us in did not even asked why we were leaving. When looking on Trip Advisor when we returned, there was a positive review from some other people who just walked in off the street without a reservation less than a week before and paid only $130, a much better price. Why were we, with a reservation, charged almost $100 more? Bottom line, unless you're a college kid looking for a beach flop with your buddies, find somewhere else to stay.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "switzerland", "Title": "\u201cfantastic place right on the beach\u201d", "Author": "serena99", "ReviewID": "UR36603913", "Content": "we arrived about 5pm in san diego from phoenix and were tired from the drive. coming off the highway we arrived at ocean beach by chance, and were glad to get out to stretch our legs. as we needed a hotel we asked at this place, the only one we'd seen along the beach. it was in a sort of luxury garden behind a glass wall - looked so appealing! they said there were rooms available for 132$ per night - more than we had planned on but we decided that we would book 2 nights so we could take advantage of the beach across the road. we were not disappointed. room was lovely, spacious, with big tv, dining table &chairs, kingsize bed and fridge. only thing wrong was that you couldn't make coffee (free coffee in the reception in the morning) we also had free parking during our stay which was great. definitely good price-quality, and quiet during our stay", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SoCal", "Title": "\u201cGreat accomodations and service with ocean air and beach views!\u201d", "Author": "ndmzoo", "ReviewID": "UR33525162", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed our four day stay at the Ocean Beach Hotel in Ocean Beach, CA.

I would recommend to bar hoppers. This is a great hotel for friends and couples to stay at, very romatic and very beachy. A few downsides - rooms are small, a little bit bigger than a dorm.

First my trip setup: Was on a San Diego sightseeing trip with my wife and 2.5 year old. Planned to see the San Diego Zoo mostly. Arrived by car from Orange County, CA. Length of trip in San Diego planned 2 nights 3 days, actual 3 nights and 4 days (The Ocean Beach was the add-on night). Stayed for 2 nights at a Comfort Inn near hotel circle (the one next to a steakhouse). Room was nice, but called a queen size bed a King, free breakfast, free internet; ask for coupon deals for local sights. So we did the Zoo thing despite the rainy weather for that 16/17th Feb. Was paying 80.00 per night for a room/TV/fridge/no micro/view-hillside and train route. This being the scenario, I was ready to make the family happier. I searched for hotels by the ocean as I got word I could extend my trip and came across the Ocean Beach Hotel. The attraction was, close proximity to the ocean, and nearby Pier to walk out on. The posted pictures of the hotel were hard to visualize, and seemed out of date after the fact (good thing). Seemed like they might have had a recent renovation to Room 301, which was the one we stayed in, \"By the way is the best suite in the house\". For the Splurge traveler or ocean lover it's a nice spot. I did not view any of the other rooms so cannot comment on that. Room 301 is the closest to the pier and ocean, with balcony on the Newport ave. side(not so appealing), but (2) double French doors facing the Ocean(no balconies)(To be able to hear the ocean before sleeping, and waking in the morning was worth the low season rate of 200.00/350.00 high season). Keep in mind this is a beach community and not a Major hotel, as you will climb 3 flights of open-air stairs to get to your room. Room amenities were complete and other reviews were pretty accurate, but maybe did not apply to this room (this is the best room in the house). Toilet paper was as reviewed by another reviewer, but his solution was good by using a local store up the south side of Newport Ave. I have a feeling the garden view and partial ocean view rooms were not as clean or updated possibly. Air conditioner was a portable unit and no cooling was necessary. Small table with 2 chairs, a couch (could serve as a bed although not a sofa sleeper); armoire with TV / remote no pay per view etc., another table for 3 near foot of bed (perfect for relaxing/wine/sunset/internet research/etc.). Portable, faux fireplace electric heater (seemed out of place but functional, and impromptu romance prop with imagination)(came in very handy), King size bed comfy enough. The garden patio area is nicer than the photos, the archways at the ocean end are covered with Plexiglas to prevent intrusions and has a room-key access door to the beach very handy oh yes and the shower so you can rinse off before going to your room or relaxing in the patio. Handy as the beach showers are a fair distance away to rinse off. Nice not to be nicked for parking like most other places. Did not look for ice machine or soda etc. but did see a laundry area which would be nice for the extend stay. If I could afford it, I would stay in that room for every San Diego trip especially during the summer. I would say try it for a night during low season to see how you like it if finances is a factor. There could be other equals or better but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the time as this was on the fly...I just wanted to relax, hear the ocean and take the family on the pier for the sunset which we did. Note: 2 things re: the pier: There seems to be a small element of hippy type or housing challenged that were in the vicinity of the stairs to get to the pier level but appeared not to be a problem. Across the hotel/Inn/motel from Newport Ave is a public parking for the pier/beach with a police building in it (hours of operating is unknown). The other thing is if you have a young child walking out to the end you might want to have a stroller of some sort to pull rather than carry them back...your shoulders or back will thank you. There is also a nice spot ON the pier for drive in/diner food-unknown quality...They also rent fishing tackle by hours or the day kind of nice for the closet fisherman. Again I would've tried this but we had other things to do...If you're very flexible with your travelling plan on being there for a Wednesday afternoon/evening as they have a farmer's market type of street fair which closes off a portion of Newport Ave. Very walking distance for a 2.5 year old...there was even an inflatable jumper thingy for free that gave us a break. Ample restaurants and bars to keep a variety of ages entertained. We ate at a Mexican restaurant on the north side (forgot name), but had gotten very full eating and sampling foods along the street. It did provide for breakfast the next morning, which worked out very well with the micro and frig. I urged my wife to take our son for a walk along the beach (about .7? mile each way to the far breakwater) I needed to plan the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities so unfortunately I did not make the morning walk (this was a Thursday morning and no weekend crowds if there are any?). Cleanliness gave it a 4 since I always wear flip-flops in any room I book, but that room did appear clean. Service I gave it a 2 since I did not use any besides checking in and checking out, nor did I use the maid service. I did make my reservations over the phone (as I knew I wanted to book this special room not available over the net booking) and did not have any problems. Rooms was a 4 since I was unable to rate other rooms. Location a 5 for the beach across the street / above average pier even compared to Newport and Huntington beach / short walk to bars, restaurants, convenience store for supplies, and Wednesday street event / And last but not least is the sound of the soothing ocean sounds!...relaxing and priceless! If you expect your full money value to be in the room alone you might be a little disappointed, but overall value is there. Would have liked to's: Walk to the end of the southern part of beach to see tide pools at low tide. Fished of the pier. Eaten and had drinks at the pier diner (no rating on food sorry). Explored more of the general area for other hidden gems or hotspots. And last but not least is too sleep with the French doors open to fall asleep and wake to the sounds of the ocean (Didn't do this due to temperature and unknown bug/mosquito problems for my son).

From the noise levels to the musty bathroom, this place brings back fond memories of college. To be fair, though, one has to anticipate that certain type of energy from this place, located steps from the shore in the heart of San Diego's surfer-dude village. My boyfriend and I checked in on a Friday in July, not expecting the Ritz based on reputation, but hopeful that the very-friendly, helpful staff was a positive indicator that the facility might just surprise us in a fun, carefree San Diego kind of way. Nope. We arrived at our third-floor room and our jaws hit the floor when the stink hit our nostrils: eau de must, mold and cigarettes (in a non-smoking room). The bathroom was a stall-sized cell containing a stand-up shower (wear your flip-flops), toilet, sink (upon which one could rest their chin while enjoying a session, if one felt so inclined), as well as the most sinister-looking dust bunny ever seen peering down from the ventilation fan (see photo, though it does not do justice). The carpet was scary (wear your flip-flops). The a/c was portable, and though we could technically see the ocean from our awkward screen-free window, we could also see the back of a crummy condo, ample bird pollution, broken furniture, and two thankfully retired commodes (see photo, this one does do justice). The real fun started at 3am when the frat boys arrived to their room next door, though it could have just as easily been our room, since the walls are simply a formality possibly formed by wall paper over, evidently, nothing. \"Who's up for beer pong?!\" Not us. Though we were up. For the next six hours.

We stayed at the Ocean Beach Hotel, which looks like it's been around for a long, long time, judging by some old pictures we saw (including pictures of the hotel before a street separated it from the beach). The front desk staff and cleaning staff were very professional, accommodating and friendly. We stayed on the second floor with a partial ocean view; rates for each of our days varied between $140-160. Our view also included colorful local characters (as one reviewer has noted), who hang out near the POW/MIA memorial across the street. The \"local color\" also attracted the S.D. police three times, who twice hauled away people. The third time appeared to be some kind of \"contact\" visit by cops to talk to the homeless, the skaters, other rough characters and the well-dressed people attracted to them (drug sales?). That said, we walked around day and night and never felt threatened -- no aggressive panhandling (and little panhandling in any case), no need to watch wallets etc., like we might have felt elsewhere. The vibe was good. Ocean Beach has done a good job of deflecting chain stores (although the fought-over Starbucks up the street from OB Hotel easily had the biggest crowds of the coffee shops we frequented). In fact, our find was that one should hit a local coffee shop. Besides the lines being shorter, folks are remarkably friendly and open, the coffee is excellent and the pastries are local and better. Hit the same place three days in a row and you'll be shooting the breeze like you've lived there a year. So while the anti-corporate mentality may be a bit militant, it makes for a pleasant main street to wander up and down. Now to the hotel. The room smelled musty and the carpet had that mildly-wet feeling from high-humidity climates. Our bathroom sink faucet swiveled left-and-right, though not by design. The toilet was constantly on the verge of stopping up (did the previous tenants through a baggie of dope down it?). There was a table on the patio, but the patio had some kind of half-worn off macadam covering that made it uneven (repairmen were working their way down patios sanding that stuff down, which was very noisy during the day). The room had two chairs on opposite sides; we used the bed for sitting and as a table. There was a fridge and microwave. The wall had been torn and repaired (badly). There was a new door to the bathroom, and while that was fine, the frame around it was unpainted. An attempt has been made to spruce up the courtyard -- box planters on the 2nd and 3rd floor railings, container plants below, strings of lighting overhead, and so on. Some of the lights were burnt out, and the fountain in the middle was bone dry. Indicative of good intentions that are not well-funded. A good cable TV selection and free wireless internet were bonuses. As others have noted, the rooms are very noisy. From newlyweds on one side (they'll learn, I guess) to a guitarist practicing his heavy metal riffs (presumably for a local show one evening), to drunken screeching in the courtyard, to the sound of Harleys being revved, to one fight on Newport Ave outside our room, to revelers at all hours (including nine a.m. one morning), to a pretty good ad hoc music jam session (think three of the talented players were sailors) at the POW/MIA memorial, to fire trucks, to a thumping bass from a nearby bar, to the occupants above us daring walk to the bathroom, to people yelling at their buddies across the street -- the joint is NOISY. We've lived in 24/7 congested areas of several large cities abroad and in the US and never had noise like this. So, if you want a quiet weekend by the beach, this ain't the place, by a long shot. We enjoyed the town and its free-wheeling environment, but hated the hotel -- save the staff. We figure for the annoying noise level and the run-down condition of the hotel, it's worth about half the price we paid per night.

My room was partial ocean view on the third floor. Yes I could see the water, but one troubling thing is that the windows don't have any screens on them. I wanted to listen to the ocean as I went to sleep, but that would have meant leaving the windows wide open and they are big enough for someone to just slip right in.

It was the perfect place for our family to stay. It has a big beautiful flower-filled courtyard where the youngest kids could play safely during the day and where we had big family dinners in the evening. And it is right on the beach, so the older kids/young adults could spend their days at the ocean. Everybody who came from out of state had all these plans to see the other San Diego sights, but once they settled in, they realized how wonder it was just to stay in Ocean Beach, enjoy the beach, go to the Farmers Market on Wednesday night, enjoy the shops and restaurants of Newport Avenue, and spend lots of quality time with their cousins, etc. from all over the western U.S. Another important feature of Ocean Beach, especially for young families- or big families, is that the restaurants are very reasonably priced, including the wonderful family restaurant on the pier. Breakfast and lunch were inexpensive and then we would order take-out and have big family dinners in the courtyard of the hotel, making our own salads and having our own sodas and beer and wine. More time to spend with family and friends and much more affordable for everybody. The staff at the Ocean Beach Hotel is friendly, courteous, and incredibly helpful.

I emailed them the website, but had them make the room reservations through me. Once again, the hotel staff helped immensely. It was great to see the reactions of the Pittsburg visitors. They said \" I know you said it was right on the beach, but it is really right on the beach!\" Once again, they had all these plans to see all the San Diego sights and then hardly left Ocean Beach.

The hotel courtyard was nice although I would prefer non-smoking there as well. Our stay was pleasant other than a few minutes one night when a new tenant became irate outside our window because she couldn't get the keycard to work. (Another tenant finally assisted.) The beach is family-friendly. Newport Avenue (the strip which ends with the hotel) is busy. There is a laid-back vibe, but watch your children closely. Do not develop a false sense of security.

It is somewhere between a a transient stop and a biker town, and the restaurants are far from the advertised \"world class.\" If you're looking for a cheap hotel in a shady town for a cheap price, stay here.
