Clean sheets, clean bathroom, comfortable bed. Friendly competent and helpful staff. Low cost for rooms. Negatives: Aircon in one room did not appear to work.

(And if you want the latest marble finishes go pay at least three times the price elsewhere.) Preferring to sample the local atmosphere we ate out, including breakfast, but one round of drinks at the hotel's La Rambla cafe cost \u20ac40 for two large beers, one sangria and a water. Some rooms face inwards and should be quiet (they overlook the glass-roofed restaurant). We had a room on the third floor facing a brick wall. Not the best of views, but it was private and quiet. La Rambla is an area that attracts pickpockets, and we saw some of them, so sensible precautions are needed, but we never felt threatened. We also saw a lot of police who appear to be on top of the problem. The main irritant are the hawkers who come out at night, and 'entertainers' who offer gratuitous songs in the Placa Reial and then expect tips. The ability of one dreadlocked minstrel to remember the words and strum the correct tune did not match his ego. We ate most of our dinners in the Placa Reial, opposite the hotel across La Rambla.

First impressions, I thought the hotel was clean, approachable staff but maybe a few steps up from a nice hostel. However, the hotel was clean and that is one of the most important things for me! The hotel just needs a few cosmetic upgrades such as the corridor walls repainting, the walls cleaned in the rooms etc. I have a feeling this was being done up ahead of peak season as there were patches on the corridor walls where dents had been filled in. First impressions of the bed, it felt hard and starchy.....but it was actually great and very comfortable! Overall, I think this is a perfect place to stay in Barcelona, great location, clean and great value for money. Few things to note - the hotel doesn't have an iron or an ironing board. If you need something ironed, they have an onsite laundry facility. We requested for something to be ironed, when we got back to the hotel room it had been ironed but then folded instead of arriving on a hanger. So it was just as creased as when it went away! The hotel staff were great about it and gave us the option of having it removed from the bill or the housekeeper to do it again. Secondly, you will occasionally hear a rumble. Couldn't quite figure out what it was at first but it appears to be the metro going directly under the hotel!! We were on the fourth floor so I found this surprising, however it was hardly noticeable after a while and didn't go on through the night. I'm an extremely light sleeper but it didn't bother me at all, I think it was the unlucky positioning of our room! Thirdly, the cleaner on the 4th floor. Beautiful singing voice but not so nice to be woken up to when you're trying to lie in from the night before! This only happened during the week though, the cleaners come round a lot later at weekends. Fourthly, our breakfast wasn't included but on check in we were offered breakfast at the cheaper rate of 9 euros per day instead of 13. We didn't take them up on the offer, however I have to say the breakfast looked lovely in the mornings. Instead we opted to go to the food market 10 minute walk up La Rambla where they had the most amazing fresh fruit and juice drinks (turn left out hotel, 10min walk up on the left). I highly recommend going here. Also along the same way is a beautiful little cafe/bakery where we got croissants. You'll hear a lot of people talk of pick pockets. Yes it is rife there apparently particularly during peak season. But these people are opportunists, they aren't dangerous so it's a case of being sensible. You'll notice all women carrying bags which go across their bodies for example. For example, we heard of someone providing a distraction for tourists which will provide the other perfect opportunity to pick pocket. Just have your wits about you, it's nothing to overly worry about :) I felt incredibly safe by the police patrols round La Rambla. Oh and lots of 'lucky lucky' men down La Rambla and the beach area trying to constantly sell you all sorts of wonderful rubbish... Note from the airport you can get a bus then on the metro to get to La Rambla, this would be the cheapest way. It cost us 30 euros from the airport to La Rambla and 40 the way back to the airport as it was a Sunday?! So bear this in mind when you're planning. You can pick up passes from the airport for day passes on the buses and metro, it's worth doing this if you tend to travel round the city a lot. However, as the hotel is central, a short walk from the gothic quarter, the beach etc the only place we walked to was Sagrada Familia cathedral (took 45mins) so I don't think a pass would be beneficial with the hotel being so central.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "hegarty_12", "ReviewID": "UR125203337", "Content": "staff were very friendly, well situated in centre,have to been very careful of pickpockets.police excellent always around watching everything, felt safer here than some cities in uk. some restaurants very expensive, ask for price of drink before you buy, bought half bottle of wine cost 22 euro, they will rip you off if you don't ask price. downfall was no bar in hotel and sometimes there was a smell but i think you get this in old cities cause shops and streets also smell at certain time. clothes shops excellent and we love barcelona football club,great weekend.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zagreb, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "justtrippin18", "ReviewID": "UR125117475", "Content": "The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the heart or barcelona.. everything is in a walking distance from hotel :) i stayed there while i was on a school trip, and we were all very pleased. even though husa is on rambla, we didn't have trouble sleeping (even during daytime). the food was good, as in any other hotel. rooms were always clean, and the service in general was great! if I ever go to barcelona again (hopefully, I will), I'll definitely stay there again :D", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent central location\u201d", "Author": "ands_11", "ReviewID": "UR124745498", "Content": "The hotel is situated centrally on la ramblas and provides an excellent base for sightseeing.

Our room was marginally bigger than the bed which was hard and creaky. The room did contain a safe which was good since the security was awful. The rooms in our wing all have key locks, so there's no way to tell how many keys are floating around. When you leave the hotel, they have a slot to leave the key (ideally so that it doesn't get stolen while you are out?). The problem is that they just hang it up in plain sight behind the desk so that anyone can tell if the room is empty or not. And you just ask for a room key by number with no verification so anyone can just pick it up. The carpet in the hallway was absolutely filthy and the Wi-Fi was as good as non-existent. If you tried long enough you could connect and sometimes even exchange some data, but it was totally frustrating. We tried multiple devices which work flawlessly elsewhere so they have a definite problem. We couldn't even get to Tripadvisor to find a good place for dinner!

My boyfriend and I had been very much looking forward to a trip to Barcelona and the Husa Oriente looked like a reasonably comfortable, suitably located place to stay. Unfortunately, within 3 hours of arriving in the city, I'd been attacked and robbed by two men on a motorbike. I'd read the safety advice regarding the city and had taken precautions. Nonetheless, the incident happened and the fact that an attack like this could happen at 4pm in the centre of the city was a shock - I've lived and travelled across Europe for years and have never experienced anything like it. Somehow we made our way back to the hotel, to find out about the location of the hospital and the police station. We also needed to find out contact details for my mobile phone company, so my phone could be blocked from use by the thieves. Unfortunately, the staff on duty at the desk were entirely unhelpful and uncaring and we received no aid. As a result, there was a considerable delay (hours) in being able to get treatment , report the incident to the police and to have my mobile phone blocked by the mobile company. I was in a great deal of pain - my arm had to be strapped up and I am unable to return to work before September. We were both in a state of shock. In spite of all this, while the incident took place at 4pm, we were unable to stop and try to recover until after midnight. The following morning, we checked out. Different staff were on duty at reception. The young man at reception my boyfriend spoke to clearly knew about the incident the previous day. He said how sorry he was, said to let him know if there was anything he could do to help. The charge for the few minutes I had needed to phone the Card Protection company, which I was able to do by 11pm the previous evening, was waived.

There are no signs or staff in the dining room to advise you and the desk staff didn't bring it up - so don't assume - otherwise it's a big hit on your bill. A complaint brought no satisfaction. We won't make that mistake again.", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff in Wales", "Title": "\u201chusa oriente\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4123387", "Content": "Stayed at the above hotel and although it was very central, I was a little dissapointed.

The hotel room we had was fantastic. It proves cheap rates don't give you the worst room. When booking drop them an email and ask them for a 1st floor room overlooking Las Ramblas. The rooms are newly decorated and furnished to a high standard. I would have paid twice what I did for that room. The staff were friendly, they offer breakfast at 12 euro each, which we missed in favour of the restauants at the top of Las Ramblas, where bacon eggs toast and coffee will set you back a whopping 5.5 euros. Ching Ching. The hotel is great, get there on an early flight and ensure the best rooms! The hotel is located 2/3rd's of the way down Las Ramblas on the right, walking distance to Barri Gothic, Port Vell, Placa Catalunya. Some tips now for you eager barcelona travellers to ensure a good stay. a) Get the AI bus from the airport. Far cheaper then a taxi, runs every 10 mins and stops at the top of Las Ramblas. Air conditioned. 1) Las Ramblas is home to may entertainment artists. Make sure you keep your valuables out of reach when soaking up the atmosphere. Any city will have pickpockets, don't get distracted. 2) Las Ramblas is also home to a spot of con trickery in the form of cup and ball games. Min stake is 50 Euro and you are guaranteed to lose. Dont get tempted. The crowd must be in on the con, either that or they have been betting for the past 8 visits to Barcelona. Dont get sucked in! 3) I had a pleasent pizza/pasta dish at the Pizza (express) place on the top of las ramblas. There are some cracking little places to eat. For the budget conscious, steer away from the ramblas pavement cafes. There are plenty of asian people showing you an empty table, but a drink can cost a whopper, so be careful and check prices. Much cheaper prices can be found in the side streets. 4) Next to the hotel is a restaurant that serves fantastic tapas and Paella. You will easily spot the restaurant for the amount of hanging hams on the ceiling. Worth a visit. 4) Plaza Real, just be careful of men selling beer cans and shady types on the fountain in the middle. They sell drugs and its not an ideal place to get your wallet out!! 5) Fancy a day at the beach? Just outside the hotel on the left up las ramblas is the Metro. Sitges is a wonderful town where they have a great sandy beach, lovely shops and good eateries. Just take the green L3 metro line from liceu to Sants Estacio, then at the other end head towards the main railway station, to catch a connecting 30 min train ride to Sitges (look for Via 5 or 6 to St Vincec as it can be daunting initially!) Well worth a few quid for a great day out of the city! 6) Poble Espanol is not my favourite place, the taxi there can be as much as 10 Euros, the entry is 7.5 euros each. I dont like paying to shop!! The shops were mainly closed when we went, but if you like a bit of architecture, then by all means go, but dont kick your self if you miss going. Get a taxi from Espana metro stop. Its a 2 min ride and should not cost much. Finally if you get a room overlooking the Ramblas, pop acrosss in the evening to the Italian ice cream shop and bring it back with you. Its a great way to people watch from your room. Finally, Barcelona is a great place - you will enjoy it, but remember to keep your wallet and valuables hidden for that unspoilt trip.
