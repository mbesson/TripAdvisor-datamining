Their bathroom is top notch though. We had to change room because all of the sudden, the room had a strong cigarette smell coming thru the aircon and we have two young kids. They did provide us an extra fridge to store milk as you can't put anything in the bar fridge. I thought that was nice. Location is excellent with the shopping complex inside. Very handy especially travelling with young kids. The light n water show were pretty average (only because we just saw a similar thing in week ago somewhere else and it was a lot better).

By fully availing ourselves of the offerings of the Club (breakfast, afternoon tea/ late light lunch, evening drinks and canapes), the full use of the magnificent Sky Park, a daily workout in the gym to try and work off some of the excesses, we barely had to leave the hotel. Our plan was to enjoy the hotel and to relax, rather than sightsee, although we did go for a walk each afternoon. But really, we just wanted to enjoy the magnificence of this wonderful hotel, with its friendly and caring staff who did everything to make us feel as comfortable as at home. Unfortunately, we had no luck in the casino to help us pay the bill and the shops were wonderful to look at and dream. The bus to and from the airport made transfers a breeze.

All this combined, it ends up being a zoo :) Being a hotelier, i was shocked at the level of service and the lack of standards applied in that property. The room was very basic, to the standard of a 3 star hotel. Furnitures chipped, bathroom amenities pathetic, TV channels limited, no welcome amenities, no welcome letter, no turndown amenities...This hotel clearly could not care less who you are and how much you are paying to stay in this \"so called\" iconic place : THE supposedly \"place\" in Singapore....Well, think twice ! The service at reception and bell desk has been nothing but irritating. I will spare you the details as it would take numerous pages. Asked for the General manager to call me, I was told there was NO General Manager, only a Hotel Manager. Fine as long as he or she calls...Up to today, and after my return, i still do not know whether the hotel manager is a \"he\" or a \"she\" as i am yet to have received any calls...Well done for \"customer satisfaction\".. Oh, and remember : you need to be OUT by 11 am. Their check in time is 3pm...4 hours to turn over a room is a very \"productive\" number...NOT ! Too bad the hotels were all full in Singapore due to conferences, as i wanted to check out and leave. also, your room key does not need to be inserted in order to access your floor. Just go in with someone else and press the floor you would like to get to...as simple as that ! my key would access all floors and all towers. I then decided to check on the new Ku De Ta and the \"talk of the town\" swimming pool. Wow, the most crowded area of the hotel with A VIEW !! Thank God there was a view or i would have wasted my 3 minutes in the elevator all the way to the 57th floor. Overall, a highly overrated hotel and probably the poorest value for money that i ever encountered in Singapore. This is really sad and i would never recommend for anyone to stay there. I travel to Singapore once a month, and will ensure i stay at recognized branded hotels at cheaper prices yet amazing standards. Guess you cant go wrong ! Don't know why i stayed there at the first place. I guess that as a hotelier, it is always good to see what's out there...This stay was definitely an \"experience to remember\".

Ask for a high room if possible - the lifts are excellent and you'll be spending a lot of time on the 57th floor anyway - in the incredible rooftop infinity pool. The pool over tower 3 is kids-free, which is more relaxing if you are travelling without children. Be sure to have a swim at sunset, it's an amazing experience. Breakfast was great, the choice was almost excessive, and everything was top notch. The bars were good if expensive, and service was courteous and efficient. In the same complex there is an excellent theatre, where we saw Wicked, and an arts/museum facility were we saw a Titanic exhibition, both were really good. Every night there is a sound and light show just outside called Wonder Full, do make a point of seeing it at least once. Downstairs is a hug shopping mall filled with high cost brand name shops - fun to window shop, too bad if you want something useful like a handkerchief or a hat. However the resort includes a station on the MRT, and in a few minutes you can be anywhere in Singapore. Go to Dhoby Ghaut and do your real shopping there :) The concierge staff were very helpful, and organised tours and tickets for us wherever we asked for assistance. The river cruise was fun, as was dinner at Boat Quay, a short taxi ride away. If you are travelling with friends be sure to all be in the same tower as it's quite a hike from tower 1 to tower 3.

It was so sad that he got disallusioned so quickly. Firstly checkin - we were early (12pm) but they said that our room was now available. All good so far, until I was shown what was going to be debited to my credit card account. Expecting the usual $500 credit card deposit, it was nearly $2500.00. When I asked what was going on, they said it was to pay for my room. It then took nearly two hours and 5 staff to convince them that my room had been prepaid. I showed them my voucher, my receipt from them, my credit card statement when I paid the accommodation in full etc etc. But they still would not beleive me. Luckily I then found an old email from their guest relations manager confirming my booking, payment, specific room request etc etc. This manager was located and quickly verified on their booking system that i had paid in full. Yet 4 other staff could not locate the same detail? Things then went from bad to worse when we were escorted to a deluxe room instead of Premier deluxe - luckily I knew the difference. Was then told no premier deluxe rooms available. I went straight downstairs again to the guest relations manager and told her that the hotel had buggered me around already, now they were trying to downgrade me? Demanded they either give us what we had paid for (nearly twice) or refund immediately in full as we would be going elsewhere immediately (i would have preferred if they had done that). A premier deluxe room was found pretty darned quick after that. From that point on usual hotel experience where the hotel is big, impersonal, totally crowded with onlookers etc. I will stil give cudos to their buffet tho - it is a wonderful experience. I hate complaining. I believe that suggestions work better, but when you have no other avenue but complaint, I try to remain cool and calm. But as far as Marina Bay Sands goes, my calmness deserted me and put a bitter taste on the stay.

You also get a separate dressing area with these rooms. Arrived at 4pm on a weekday (cheaper/quieter than weekends) and there were was no one else checking in so no queues and ot my room straight away. No chairs in the lobby (not that there would be any free with the number of tour parties brough by coach to see the building). I knew that the resturants were expensive and breakfast crowded and with little choice compared to other 5* hotels - so didnt sample any of them. There are cheaper eats inclding breakfast in the attached shopping mall. Internet is now free and there is no extra 'Resort fee' like when the hotel first opened. Pool staff and food was good and I considered the prices reasonable for the convenience of eating by your deck chair (~S$20 for a burger and fries). The quietest times for the pool is between midday and 4pm (Checkout/in times) and the pool is open till 11pm. The hot tubs by the edge were nice and not crowded. Rooms in Tower 1 and 3 have direct lifts to the Skypark. If your room is below Floor34, you will have to change lifts to get to the Skypark.

We are 2 adults and 3 children, 10, 7 and 3 years old. Already the booking was quite an experience - we booked in April to make sure to have a large enough room with 2 extra beds for the older kids. At the time, reservation told us that they cannot guarantee extra beds as they depend \"upon availability\" - when we asked where our kids were supposed to sleep should there be no extra beds available, they could not give an answer. We found that ridiculous- surely when you reserve months in advance they should be able to get hold of 2 extra beds? Still, we decided to go ahead and try our luck, as we had fallen in love with a picture of the infinity pool and observation deck in a magazine. We used the shuttle from the airport which was convenient. The hotel is huuuge - although we knew it was big - make no mistake, this is a factory. The check in took at least one hour, during which they managed to \"loose\" our luggage which reappeard hours later. the kids were obviously tired after a long flight, but there is no seating in this huge lobby, and unless you are happy to go to the restaurant there and pay for a full meal, all you can do is stand and wait. Then we were shown our room, which was nice enough - we had taken one of the rooms situated ont he lower floors, biut I am sure that the ones higher up are even nicer - and - surprise - there were no extra beds. So we started an endless round of calls about the beds etc - this and the wait for the luggage took ages and was really annoying as all we wanted to do was to go up and have a swim in the pool. No extra beds were provided after all, and not enough bedding, so we shared pillows and duvets, one son slept on the floor and the other one in our bed. Not what you would expect for that price. The only redeeming feature is the truly magnificent observation deck and pool. This is really good fun and the kids loved it.

Fresh, super yummy dimdums! Try the ones that have soup in them with pork. Out of this world! 2. Mozza pizzeria is a fancy pizza place. I first thought this place would be snooty. But it is far far from that. Try one of the huge variety of pizzas. They are freshly baked right in front of your eyes! 3. Carnivore is a brazilian restauant with unlimited servings of meat! What else do i say about this place! Go for a jog the next morning! 4.punjab grill is a fancy indian place. Tried the chicken and lamb kebabs and had the lunch set menu, which gives you a bit of everything worth trying! 5. Todai is a korean buffet place. It is a massive restaurant where you pay about $40 per person and then feast on an unlimited selection of cuisine from different regions - asia, western and great desserts. The hotel is great too! The staff are smiling all around. I also saw some of them carrying a smiley card with them which said \"smile and greet\". Guess it works! Cute. The room itself is a little smaller than i thought. There could have been more furniture. What's the point of having a great balcony without any chairs or coffee table. Also the television was boring. They had HBO and some sports channels. Nothing compared to the 2 star hotel i stayed at in little india last month. Sad. The hotel main restaurant was not too fancy.

Overall you get what you pay for, so if you can spend the money on the hotel it is definitely worth staying there. And if also like me if you are deciding Marina Bay or Raffles, both have positives, but on the balance i would stay at Bay Sands and definitely trip to Raffles for the sling experience. Marina Bay offers complimentary shuttle service every 30 mins to and from airport (about 35 mins to hotel). Check in was quick and easy with a reception desk at each tower (I arrived at 7pm. I did notice between 4-5:30 throughout my stay it was busy so could be more of a wait). The room i stayed in was a city view, it was spacious, offered excellent views of the Singapore river and the Merlion and was very clean. The bed was comfortable, overall it was an excellent room. The infinity pool is nice, but if looking at the hotel i am sure you are aware of this. Across from the towers were rooms are situated is the shopping and entertainment area, boasting luxury shops, celebrity chefs (excellent quality restaurants, not tv personalities who cannot run a kitchen), the casino and theatres. With designer brands and quality restaurants, staying at Bay Sands can quickly become a very expensive experience. It really will come down to the individual, and the hotel does an excellent job of catering to everyone, with a food court, a small store for soft drink and snacks and some cheaper alternative restaurants. One of the cheaper alternatives is excellent quality asian cuisine and cheap, on the bottom floor, it is always busy but worth dining in. The location of Marina Bay is away from the main action of Singapore i.e. Orchard Rd, China Town and little India, but a taxi to orchard rd is $10. I would recommend staying here as everything is accessible in Singapore, and as a hotel it does offer everything you need if you wanted to stay at the hotel, the only caution is, if money is tight be careful as things can get expensive quickly.

With it being my birthday we were treated to a fantastic upgrade to the most beautiful huge bedroom with lounge area, the bathroom was gorgeous with a roll top bath and walk in shower big enough for ten! I was presented with a stunning birthday cake and a beautiful bouquet of flowers. Just when i thought it couldn't get any better, we were then invited for a free evening meal in the Rise restaurant ( will do a seperate review, beautiful food, buffet, live cooking stations). we went to Rise on our last night and had a bottle of wine, water etc thinking we were going to pay for the drinks and when we asked for the bill, we were told the whole bill had been taken care of!!!!!!

It has an enormous entrance hall resembling an airport terminal with high ceilings, three different places to check in, and tons of shops and cafes. You will get quite a bit of exercise walking form one place to the next while dodging the crowds. Getting to the observation deck on top involves taking two different elevators and the whole place feels like there is a constant coming and going. If you\u2019ve come for world class shopping, this is the place to be, as the adjacent shopping centre (there is also a casino) offer pretty much everything you could wish for, and more. However, I can\u2019t whole-heartedly recommend it. For the kind of service you\u2019re getting, it is overpriced. We are from Africa and spoiled by stays at warm, cozy, luxury game lodges in the bush, where a total of sixteen guests at any one time guarantees lots of individual attention and personalized service. Granted, you can\u2019t compare the two, but the service at the Marina Bay Sands was nothing more than average. You didn\u2019t get any turn-down service, for instance, and we also didn\u2019t like the way we were nickled-and-dimed in such an exclusive place. Like having to pay for the water taxi to take you across the bay, or an early check-in. Or the fact that they still found a way to wring more money out of you by cordoning off a section at the Sky Bar, where the nice comfortable sofas were, and only allowing you in if you purchased two entire bottles of spirits (standing room only for the \u201cregular folk\u201d). We had club level rooms and I have to say the club level breakfast wasn't all that great. Not bad but just not good enough for all the hype and the price tag. The most striking two features of the Marina Bay Sands hotel are the look of it from across the bay and the view from the top looking at the magnificent Singapore skyline. Both can be had for free or a very modest fee, so why not go there for the view and stay somewhere else? Get a day pass to the observation deck on the 57th floor for S$19 to take in the view, or have lunch at Ku De Ta or the Sky Bar. Or you could come up specifically for the nightly chocolate bar in the club lounge. All this can be had without paying what I consider to be a ghastly overpriced room rate. You won\u2019t get to lounge by the (admittedly spectacular) infinity pool as part of that, but still it will be very worthwhile. Whether you end up staying at the Marina Bay Sands or just visit the Skypark for the day, one thing is true: You won\u2019t get such a nice breeze anywhere else in Singapore!

There was NO SEATING. They were fixing the seating -- installing green plastic \"ocean waves\" art ON THE SEATS. On the other hand, even if the seats were available, they still aren't enough for the number of guests. So people were just standing or sitting on their luggage and the floor. If you want to be able to sit, you have to go to one of their restaurants installed in the lobby. You'd have to order food or drinks so you can sit. They need to add MORE SEATING and make the guests more comfortable especially since their rates are really expensive. Finally, after 20 minutes of standing and waiting, we were checked in. We got a room at one of the higher floors. Upon entering the room, the electronic curtains part and reveal the most BEAUTIFUL view of the city and waterfront. It looked especially, especially spectacular at night! The view itself made up for the crappy lobby. :) The room is huge. Unfortunately, the beds are not. The single beds are that -- single beds and quite small. Nevertheless, the sheets are fresh and clean. The room, itself, smells good. The bathroom is also huge. They have a beautiful modern bathtub in the center. They provide his-and-hers sinks. The toilet and shower are enclosed separately. (It would've been more fabulous if they provided a steam or overhead shower.) They give enough towels and generous toiletries. AND, the bathroom is very clean -- every nook and cranny (I checked). 5 stars alone for the beautiful bathroom. ;) My kids absolutely loved the infinity pool.

Having booked into a Premium City View room I could not wait to the get to my room after a delayed flight resulted in a 3am check in. We are taken to our room by a porter who stands there waiting to be tipped. After he leaves I go out onto the balcony to quickly take in the view before going to bed & see that I am on the wrong side of the hotel, our room is facing the ocean, not the city. I ring reception who tells me that I did not book a city view. Luckily I had a printed copy of my reservation which clearly stated Premium City View & insisted that we be moved to the room we had booked. The guy on the phone didn\u2019t seem to care less and tells me that all the city view rooms are all booked anyhow. I ask to be reimbursed the difference as we were now staying in a lesser room & was told that this is impossible as we had booked through a third party website. The best he could do was give us a $100 food voucher to make up the difference. I was told I can use it in certain restaurants and it the charge would be taken off my bill. Finally getting to sleep at 4am, we wake in the morning to rush downstairs to use our $100 food voucher before having to check out. Breakfast for two pretty much covered the $100. We then quickly went up to the 57th floor to check out the pool then had to head straight back to our room to get packed and out of there for check out. Upon checkout we had to wait in line for ever as everyone before us seemed to be arguing about their bills. When we finally got served, our breakfast was still on our bill we were told that they had to record of us being offered a $100 food voucher. By this point I was beyond livid. Another 20mins later and we are finally told begrudgingly that we are free to go without paying for the overpriced breakfast. Will not stay here again & will not recommend it to friends.

Take the free airport shuttle if you are not on a tight schedule. The bus leaves every 30 minutes. Be sure to print your confirmation letter to show to the driver. It is a free shuttle, so dont complain :) 2. Free high speed internet! The last time i stayed in singapore, the hotel charged me per device! This is a real freebie! 3.

Again the bus leaves every 30 mins from the basement to all the airport terminals. The bellman brought my luggage straight down the bus. Downsides: 1. TV channels were very limited. For such a prestigious hotel, they had a poorer channel selection than most backpacker hotel i have been to. They had nly about 25 channels. Guess they want the guests to spend their time at the casino and not watch TV in the hotel. But any hotel where iu pay over $500 for a day, should not be so stingy. 2. There seemed to be too much security everywhere. And pretty intimidating security at that. I always spotted them in groups chatting away and the least bothered about guests. There was even security at the swimming pool. Really!! Why do you need so much security at a swimming pool and the lobby of a hotel?

At the moment this building certainly is THE landmark of Singapore. The rooms are huge, furnished in the best of taste, the same applies to the bathroom in light brown marble, free standing bath tub, separate shower and WC, a scale and, small but important detail: a discreet lighting at night. Negativ: just 1 towel and 1 bath towel per person. Considering the size of the hotel, the service was very good. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle bus from and to the airport. During the 25 min-drive the driver pointed out to us the best spots to make photos. Inside the hotel he lead us to the Club/VIP check in. Check in was quick with a short information about where to go and which lift to use. We also got a password for free WiFi. The card key is necessary to use the lift which I think should be standard in every hotel for safety reasons. A call to housekeeping asking them for an extra duvet was settled within 5 minutes. Other staff that we asked to show us the way or for certain explanations was very helpful and friendly. We missed a map of the hotel complex including ways to the museum, certain shops, how to use the different lifts ect. The mini-plan they have is by far not sufficient. The spectacular swimming pool is, of course, always very much frequented, best time to enjoy this pool and make good photos is just after sunrise. The club lounge is directly beside the pool, very open, very busy, it has nothing of the usual intimate club atmosphere and would be better positioned at the end of the roof. The offer of food and beverage was good and generous. The service very attentive. Check-out-time officially is 11:00 am. We asked whether we could stay a bit longer and could use the room until 12:30 pm.

It turned out that the access cards given to us did not work, which was actually lucky: we booked and paid in advance for a Premiere room on a high floor, but we were given a room on a low floor. I realized this only while returning to the reception to complain about the non-functional key. After I complained about this they upgraded us without any fuss to a Grand room in the correct zone - I guess no such Premier rooms were available. The Grand room was really nice. There was a large double bed, a couch that could be opened up to be a double bed for the kids, plenty of space, a huge TV, and a view to the sea. The nicest surprise was the large bathroom which had a bathtub, a separate shower cubicle, and after fiddling with all the switches it turned out that there was also a really nice view directly to the Merlion once the motor had rolled up the curtain. My only complaint is that the actual bathroom does not have any drains on the floor, so things got a bit messy when our youngest child decided that also Daddy should get wet when I was giving him a bath. :-o As we had expected, the hotel restaurants and bars were shockingly expensive for a family man, so we ended up eating all our meals elsewhere. We had all breakfasts in the food court of the shopping mall located across the road, which possibility had been a big factor when we were selecting the hotel. Access was convenient through a tunnel, although the route was rather twisty. The rooftop swimming pool was quite nice. However, it was not deep while being quite busy with people enjoying the view. The pool is not that convenient if you are focused on swimming as exercise. Early mornings might be different, though. Our room provided bathrobes and slippers, so you could change in the room and take the lift to the pool. There is a security check when the enter the roof, since it is an attraction for which entrance tickets are sold to people who are not hotel customers. Towels were provided in the pool area. There are deck chairs for sunbathers, but the number is extremely limited compared to the size of the hotel. However, I suspect most people come to the hotel to do something else than improving their suntan. In the middle of the roof is a restaurant reserved for guests staying in the Club rooms - the public restaurants are at the ends of the roof. I could not see any ATMs inside the hotel. There were a few Bank of China cash machines in the tunnel connecting the hotel to the casino and the shopping mall. There were also very few shops inside the hotel. My wife bought some cookies from the delicatessen, and interestingly enough there was a booth were you could buy a short tour of the Singapore streets in a Ferrari - with a driver or with yourself at the wheel, if you paid more. The hotel is not really convenient for the MRT. The Promenade station is almost 1 kilometre away, although you can reach it easily enough by taking the bridge across the bay and following then the footpaths. We ended up using a taxi, since it was the overwhelmingly convenient option with two young children. The taxi drivers crank up quite a few mysterious extras into the meter on top of the basic fee. I believe they were for the toll roads required to access the area. Overall, our hotel experience was actually \"very good\", but only due to the free upgrade to a better class of room. Otherwise it would have been quite mediocre, but I will still consider this hotel if I'm looking for family accommodation in Singapore. At least over the Internet is was hard to find hotels that would have been as classy and cheaper while providing in a single room enough space for a family of four. If your main objective is not gambling at the casino, or if you do not need a room for more than two persons, then it will be quite easy to find better accommodation even at a cheaper price somewhere else in Singapore.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGreat property, horrible service\u201d", "Author": "Ajmba06", "ReviewID": "UR126961259", "Content": "As such the property is quite iconic and beautiful It really had all the ingredients for success!

Also, it was awesome for the first 10 minutes, but after you got over the view, there was nothing spectacular about it anymore and it was just like any other hotel swimming pool.

Although it is luxurious and elegant in its own way, it doesn't have the same vibe like how you would get at the Ritz, Raffles or St Regis. The MBS is definitely a more 'modern', 'state of the art' type hotel. I would say, go and experience all the hype for yourself at least once. It is worth it.

I have to admit that while I thought that the crowd noise would be a problem for the hotel dwellers, I was surprised as to how quite the rooms were. The breakfast buffet has a lot of options, but it is very pricey. The food court in the MBS campus has good options that are affordable. Every room has internet cable and wireless access, although the wireless is very spotty. The check-in/check out process is very slow although the staff is very friendly. There is an express check out you can use - you will get an email of the receipt. One advice to travelers if they use the express check out is to validate your bill the night before you leave - you can get that at the front-desk, or in the TV in your room. My colleague had an error which took him 3 weeks to fix after he returned from Singapore. Cabs are easily available outside and the SMRT station is right at the base of the hotel (Orange Line). Changi airport is a good 30 minute ride away and shuttles only operate from 6:30 AM, which is a shame as most international flights leave in the AM from Changi. There are shuttles throughout the day from Changi to the hotel also, which is very convenient. After you collect your bags, follow signs to the Marina Bay Sands counter. Overall, I really liked my stay at MBS and the amenities there. It did almost feel like the hotel is an afterthought - the casino, the infinity pool and the high-end shops are the main attractions, but it worked out very well. After a long days work, I do like a relaxing, quite room. I would go back and stay there for sure next time, if I am traveling on business - otherwise, the rooms are a bit pricey for my liking :)", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cworth as \"once in a life time must do\" ...\u201d", "Author": "JUW65", "ReviewID": "UR126830903", "Content": "... not much to say: the unpampert Germans (Europeans) do simply expect another class of service idea in ASIA generally - but this spot is something worth to save the money for.

Booked a deluxe room with 2 double beds. Was charged S$100 extra, presumely for extra guest. Arrived early around 1:30pm, wife checked in was told that our room is too small for 2 adults & 2 children. wanted to upgrade but was told that superior is full. (s$ 30 more than a deluxe), was told to wait till 3pm to collect key. After a long walk from the car park, i arrived at the hotel, was not happy at all after been told that double beds means large singles. Why dont they call a spade - a spade instead of calling a spoon, a spade. Talked to a different guy at the check in counter, he apologies for this \"problem\" they have with their room reservations and checked us in immediately in to a bigger room with a large sofa bed. We have deliberately check in to this hotel to stay in one of the most iconic hotels in the world but must say I did not like it. 1. SKY PARK - first look was very impressive but after 20 minutes I really start to dislike it and starts to see the flaws in it. It is always crowded, 2 feet away from you there is always a person on the deck. The only time it is nice is between 6:45 till 8am, after which the crowds will return. It seems like fake plants were used on the Sky Park. Tore one piece of leaf and rub it in my palm and it doesnt feels right. 2. Security - We were in tower 3 which is the lift access to the sky park, there is so many non house guest sneaking in using the lift and the key card once you have touch it allows you to access all the floors. Anyone could have followed me to my floor and room. Imagine if you have just hit a jackpot ! Tower 3 feels like a public hostel and you are in your bath robes coming down fr the pool and sharing lift like some non house guest who are in full battle gear. 3. Carpark - the carpark entrance near tower 3 brings you all the way across the road in to the mall parking. It is a very long walk from there to the hotel. Luckily they offer valet parking at the rate of S$12 per 24 hours, mutiple entry. But the valet area was chaotic at times. Saw one of the valet hitting (gently) on to one of the guest who have just alight from a taxi. 4. Ambience - there isnt any. Its crowded, full of people in lobby, in lift, on sky park, in restaurants. Feels like a giant processing plant and the hotel staff is always busy onto something. There isnt a relax atmosphere to it. 5. Advance service kiosk - web check in suppose to help you for a smooth check in and was told to check in at the ASK after we have done our web check in the night before but we were ASK to use the normal check in counter. There seems to be a disparity between what the web says and what has been implemented in the hotel operations. The only thing I like is the act of the chap who has given us a room that has a large sofa bed which was kind. Would l come back? No, only if the rates drop to below S$ 150 per room night for 2 adults & 2 children.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, null, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cReally 'shop, dine, play' experience\u201d", "Author": "Wendy Y", "ReviewID": "UR126818218", "Content": "Room was very spacious and decor contemporary.

To give you some context I spent 13 weeks out of 52 in hotels last year and when on business I'm used to 4*/5* hotels, when on personal travel I tend to stay in the lower end of the market!\u00a0 My boyfriend and I have been on a 2 week holiday starting in Singapore then on to Malaysia and then back, I decided as a treat and an end to our holiday I would spend some of my air miles and book this hotel - like others I was enchanted by the infinity pool and architecture of the hotel.\u00a0 We initially booked one night although ended up being in Singapore for an extra night, we couldn't get an additional night at the Marina Bay Hotel and ended up staying at the holiday inn - Orchard City three times less in price ten times better for service!! What was good about the stay? The rooms are big, even our crappy motorway running through it room (more on that later) Fantastic amenities you could leave your toiletries at home and you have everything you need.\u00a0 Free wifi!!!! THE POOL IS AMAZING the views breath taking and plenty of awesome photo opportunities - even when the storm came in this gave us some fantastic photos with the heavy clouds and contrast of the sun! We didn't queue for check in, I guess we got lucky as we did see lots of queuing going on especially after 4pm. Now this is where my good list ends and my what isn't great about this place starts! We arrived early since we had to check out of the holiday inn at 12 we figured we would try our luck and worst case store our luggage and do some shopping. We were greeted speedily and told there was no room available but we could still access the pool and we would be contacted as soon as a room become available - I was impressed, this is great service I thought and we headed off......well I continually checked my phone, no call it got to 3:30pm (check in advertised as 3pm) still no call we went back to the desk and were informed we have a room for you (why didn't they call us) we were at the lobby in tower 1 so dragged our luggage to tower 3 (our choice from the reviews I didn't want to wait 40mins for our luggage I wanted go go swimming) The lobby is rammed with people and a description I read of it being like a bus station with better toilets is accurate, there is no personality, I've had better service at other huge conference/exhibition hotels this hotel could learn a lot from the Westin! We arrived at our 2nd floor room in the third tower I have to admit I was gutted and knew our view would be terrible but sucked it up since we were insistent we checked in, as we made our way to our room we realized it was still being cleaned, I can not stress enough how polite, efficient and friendly the cleaner was, she apologized a hundred times and speedily finished up so we could move in. This was a better prospect than trudging back to the check in desk through the lobby again! Our room was big but the view was of the motorway running parallel to the hotel, lorries, buses, cars all day and ALL night the window sound proofing is not adequate AT ALL!! We had no sleep not only because of the 24 7 traffic but because the pillows sink to nothing once you lie on them we don't fly until 11pm and we are shattered already and sleep deprived and I paid a lot for this privilege! We spent a lovely afternoon around the pool, if you are looking to relax this isn't the place for you, whilst the view is breathtaking there is a constant stream of guests coming and going taking photos etc we were like tourists so I'm not complaining about this but worth knowing if you want a chilled out private stay. Dress code is strict here and I was constantly confused about what is/isn't allowed where they are trying to set a \"standard\" yet there are tourists \u00a0everywhere and it is enforced inconsistently. I called the priority line to check where we could eat our breakfast I was told the club on the 57th floor - I was concerned about dress code so called again to be told I was not able to eat there I needed to eat in RISE in the lobby in tower 1, either was fine with me, however this demonstrates previous reviews about lack of staff knowledge, training and inconsistent service.\u00a0 We headed to RISE I can only describe this as a rugby scrum breakfast experience. If you're lucky enough to not need GPRS to find your table then look forward to constant traffic around your table. There is no refresh of coffee or tea, long lines for eggs, my partners beans, sausage and hash brown were cold. We had a better choice and better quality at the holiday inn the day before. Not enough staff to clear and serve, our dirty plates were left on our tables, this is the worst buffet I have experienced in all the hotels and countries I've stayed in! TV choices are rubbish - no Star TV mainly news channels, no DVD player or iPod docking station so you can plug and play movies! I've written so much and still have so much I could say that is wrong with this hotel and we haven't even checked out yet! But my final bullets are these: This is a Vegas style hotel trying to be a 5* luxury hotel if you want luxury, decadence and service DO NOT STAY here if you want to experience the pool then you will have to!", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cImpressive place\u201d", "Author": "aandlinphx", "ReviewID": "UR126810831", "Content": "I was pleased with my stay, the room was beautiful, the pool in the skypark was amazing and the service was good.

Asian, Western, Cold Cuts, Cereals, Noodle Bar, Eggs, etc etc. Yummy. Lots more tour groups wondering around downstairs (both Asian and European) as the casino is now in full swing. Shopping mall and the celebrity restaurants are now open. Good if you're on a corporate budget but very expensive if personal tab. The other great thing is that there's now a subway stop underneath the hotel. An additional choice as taxis can be expensive. One thing to note is that - do not be afraid if there's a long line at the taxi q. The hotel gets a lot of customers so it moves pretty fast.

(My room was the corner unit) We were totally shocked at the poor and inconsiderate design of the hotel! Most importantly, people could have seen us when we were happily soaking in the tub! This is ridiculous! What is the point of designing such a bathroom when there is totally no privacy? Best of all, when we were totally oblivious to the invasion of privacy because we couldnt see the corridor from the bathroom. From the corridor, we could also view the bathroom that was 1 level below us. OMG... How did they get awarded 5 stars??? The facilities were supposedly good. The infinity pool, gym etc. But the pool especially, was way too crowded and looked more like a public pool and there was no way that you can swim. But I cannot deny that it offers a really good view of the city, and lying at the beach chairs to read, suntan, or just to enjoy the breeze is really enjoyable, except that most of the chairs are taken up anyway. In short, it's a good place with nice facilities but the crowd makes it less enjoyable. And we left the place feeling pretty troubled about being seen from the corridor, because each of us soaked in the bath for quite long.

Being there a few times before, but not recently. Our reservation was at 8pm but we arrived there slightly early at about 7:45pm. as usual, I took my friends for a walk around to enjoy the view. To our surprise, we were stopped by a few young chaps wearing orange color T-shirt with the word \"Security\" printed on. One of them was a skinny guy with very short hair, who told us that we need to produce the receipt of the restaurant before we can get access the viewing deck one level lower. I argued that we had a reservation but 15 minutes earlier, which was verified by the restaurant staff on the spot. However, the security guys insisted that we can't access that area without producing a restaurant receipt. I have no clue why they implement such a rule that causing trouble for their guests, the person who came out with such a \"brilliant idea\" must be out of his mind - I guess he/she joined the wrong line, should work somewhere else instead of a service industry. Anyway, i started to fell frustrated with the way those securi guys behaved and talked - as if they were treating us like a bounch of thefts trying to sneak in and steal their things way. My friend told them we might be finishing our dinner late at 10-11 pm, they told us too bad because the area would be closed then! I told the short hair skinny security guy and the restaurant staff that if they insist we would just order and pay for a glass of water and will never come back again! The guy called up his supervisor and a finally allowed us to take a walk around. But the restaurant staff told us that we could not come by by the same way but had to come back from 56 level, which we didn't argue any further, thinking that it should cause too much trouble since it was just one level lower. However, to our surprise again, we were stopped by the staffs at 56 level lift lobby, telling us that the lift would only transfer guest downward and we were not allowed to take any one of their 3 lifts going upwards! But they told us that we could go back to the restaurant from the way we came. So we did, but then we were stopped by the same gang in their orange t-shirt again, this time with their supervisor, a slim middle aged guy wearing glasses. It was the same short hair guy came to accuse us from breaking their rules - we should not come back there, though the restaurant entrance was right there! We explained that we tried to come back from 56 floor but the lift staffs wouldn't allow us. Then the supervisor jumped in and said,\" you should take the lift to ground floor and then take the lift to come back to 57 floor\". I told the guy that they were out of their mind and we were not going anywhere else. The short hair young chap thenshouted to us: \"go! go! go!, while waving his arm to us as if he was asking aus to get lost! His supervisor also started to shout to the restaurant staffs saying that no more breaking of their rules! At that moment I was so angry, I didn't expect to say such a bad attitude and behavior at that kind of place - supposingly an expensive and classy place?! So I walked towards the security supervisor and asked his name, he asked me for my reason and I told him straight that I would fire a complain agaist him! To everyone's surprise, he turned back and walked away, I chased after him for about 10 meters and asked him to stop, they guy just kept running away and pretended deaf. So I went back to the short hair young chap and asked for his name, again, he ran away just like his boss did! I will never go back to that place again unless they damp such stupid rules, frankly speaking, the food there is so so and the price is high. The only reason I want to go there is to bring some visitors who have not been there before. But now, i don't think I want to see those guys any more, especially with my foreign visitors! It's so ashamed! With the price that they are charging there, no one should be treated like that!! I think both the restaurant and MBS had made too much money already and they don't seem to care about their customers's feeling at all!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Akashi, Japan", "Title": "\u201cI had been transferred 5 times when calling this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "ajcph", "ReviewID": "UR126393546", "Content": "I was given a recommendation to view the promotional rates shown on their hotel website.

Then they told me that the room is not available for that rate. Even if that is promotional price, the rate is still pretty ridiculous to me. You can get much better hotel services with that price. I then booked my room through Agoda since that was available. Upon check in, I made my complaint to the Front Desk and they apologized. They upgraded my room to a junior suite which was better than I expected. That very evening, when I came back from dinner, and slipped my hotel card in, all the lights went off. No power! I called the hotel to get someone to come and get the power back on. We waiting for 40mins. 2 guys came and got the power back on but not all the lights were working. They told me if they wanted to troubleshoot, it will take probably the whole night. This would be a waste of time for us but at least it would be nice if the hotel can change our room.

We arrived at the lobby and our luggage was taken away quickly we were shown where to check in and it was smooth sailing,we were given our room straight away and it was about 11.30-12.00pm we had our room which was lucky I guess because we were also on our honeymoon. We were told our room was in tower 3 and we were on level 36, you get given a swipe card and this would be needed when you went up in the lift to get to your room level. You get given 2 swipe cards. Also this card ables you to get past security on the level up stairs where the pool is which is in level 57. Our room was a deluxe and was quite big the bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. Amenities provided where slippers and robes to use,tea and coffee making facilities and wine and champagne glasses also. Shaving mirror located in the barhroom,and hair dryer is located in the cupboard,there is plenty of cupboard space and draws located in thetv cabinet. Extra pillow located in top of cupboard.Shampoo and conditioner,soap,cotton wool and cotton buds,nail file and sewing kit,toothbrush toothpaste,body wash and body moisturiser. The hotel itself is every beautiful but beware it is very busy and the pool area is very very busy, it is not really relaxing but if you can block out the noise then go for it! 3 nights was not enough and would of liked another night to enjoy the restaurants and casino. We dined at Ku De Ta on the top level and it was very nice,our meal was $100 which consisted of 1 entree and 2 mains. Our room cost was $1385 for the 3 nites and when we checked in they wanted another $300 to cover for room charges if you did have a meal or something,which I am glad because it saved the hassle of paying it in cash every time. To check your account you just click on the hotel menu on your tv and it will tell you your bill charges,which is great,you can keep track of what you spend. Internet wifi is free they just give you a password which consists of your surname and your room number. We ate breakfast at Rise and the selection of food was amazing and multiple choices for all,breakfast cost is $38 per person and is worth it! Very busy but it is a very big hotel and I dont think it will ever be quiet. You need to experience this hotel for yourself and say yes we have been there. We would stay again maybe for 2 nights to try the celebrity chef restaurants and go to the casino. The shopping in Marina Bay is amazing and is expensive depending on what you buy,there is a music shop there and you can get 3 latest music cd's for $49 sgd which is pretty good. There is some exy label shops and is definitely for the shopaholics! The design of this hotel is truly amazing and the view to die for. Go and enjoy a amazing stay even if it is only once in your life.

By accident I found a check-in counter and after a reasonable time in line was on my way to my room. That\u2019s where it gets impressive. Large, spacious rooms with all the amenities you could ask for. And a stunning view of the harbor. Of course the first thing I did was head up to the pool. It almost takes your breath away; both because of the view, and the sheer number of people crowded into it. I never did get to take a dip; there simply was never a time when it wasn\u2019t completely full. But it is worth the stay just to be able to walk around up there. The rest of the property is pretty average, and if it was moved to Las Vegas it would just be another mega-resort and not the best in town. All the trendy shops and restaurants are there along with a great museum, an ok casino and lots of other things to do. Everything is very expensive, even by Singapore prices, so be prepared to spend around US $75 for a dinner that would be $30 anywhere else.

A kind gentleman saw us with our cases and directed us to the hotel reception. The reception was busy and absolutely huge.. very overwhelming. Check in was prompt even though we were earlier than we should have been. We had booked just a standard room for one night before flying to KL the next day. The receptionist was very friendly and offered us two doubles or a king size if we wanted to wait another two hours so we chose the two doubles. The room was very high up with a view a good view although we would have preferred a view of the city i expect we would have had to have paid a lot more money for this. The room was huge with a lovely bathroom and toiletries, bathrobes and slippers. The beds were small doubles but it didn't bother us, we had just spent the week in a budget hotel with a really uncomfortable bed. One of the main things that attracted us to the hotel was the famous infinity pool and it didn't disappoint. we were lucky enough to get a sun bed but it got very busy later on. most people had their bathrobes and slippers. the pool was very cold but warm up when the sun came out and the views were magnificent. The pool bar menu was reasonably priced but the waiters/waitresses were extremely slow and we had to ask twice where our food was, which is not very good service at such a luxury establishment. you can stay in the pool until 11pm which is an added bonus. we didn't eat at the hotel but we ate in the shoppes and you get a discount at a lot of the shops and restaurants by showing your key card. the casino is also worth a visit. we had drinks at the ku de ta bar which again were ok priced for the type of place and again the views were incredible. Beds were comfy and we were able to use the free shuttle service to the airport the next day. The only thing i would say to be aware of is that when booking your room, they do not include service and tax so we ended up paying over another 100 pounds on check out. The same is for ordering drinks or ordering food so just be careful and check your bill. Getting from the different towers is also slightly confusing but it is an amazing hotel and i would certainly stay here again.

I have had several busines meetings at Marina Bay Sands and when my company offered to accommodate me there for my next trip, I was looking forward to my stay. I was extremely dissapointed. Check in was an excruciatingly slow process with the area filled with tourists.I wasted an hour while the booking was searched for in vain. Staff looked great but were too few to manage the amount of people wanting to check in. I was booked into the club room in tower 2 and after finally getting to my room, had to wait 40 minutes for my luggage to arrive. When it did arrive, I had somehow been given someone elses laptop. Fortunately for the person involved, I am honest and called reception to have it collected. It took staff another 30 minutes to collect the laptop. The room on the 38th floor was a good size with large windows and great city views. I turned on the television and found it would not work. I finally found a wire was disconnected. When I poured a drink the glass had lipstick on it and there was dental floss on the floor. I would expect in a five star hotel that these basic things would be checked as a matter of course. The hotel was a lovely meeting place with clients although it was very difficult to get away from the daytrippers who weren't actually staying at the hotel. Service was slow in some areas and some staff could not assist with directions and would pretend to not hear you if you said excuse me. Other staff were fantastic. In the time I had to myself, I found breakfast to be a nightmare. It was so busy it could only be described as frantic. The gym was great and the business facilities good. I realise the pool area is a major attraction but it was disconcerting to have the public troop in at certain times to the obsevation deck, I felt like I was an animal in the zoo. The shopping and casino were wonderful but I almost dreaded going back to the hotel. Checkout took so long I was late for check-in at the airport and was forced to get a taxi. I had intended to return to MBS later this year for a private holiday but for the price I am not sure it is worth it. It is such a shame as the hotel is an architectural wonder. I can only suggest that more care is taken to make patrons feel the are getting what they paid for. I could have stayed at a hotel with better service and just visited MBS like everyone else.

The staff in general are polite but you do not get the feeling that they will go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. The housekeeping staff, however, are more professional. Response was faster and they try their best to please. The view from our room which overlooks the bay was good and of course the view from the skypark is not to be missed.

We stayed for 2 nights. When we checked in I was asked to pay a deposit for the 2 rooms, the deposit was the same amount as the total charge for the 2 rooms for 2 nights. I paid by AE card and I was reassured by the staff that the deposit will be refunded upon check out. On the day when we checked out, there was a long queue at the check out counter. While we were queuing a female front counter staff approached me and told me that she could assist me in an \"express check out\", she asked me to hand over the rooms' keycards and she assured me that the deposit will be refunded into my AE card. We were in a hurry and she looked trustworthy so we gave her the keycards and left. I waited for 2 months for the refund and sure enough it didn't come. I made a long distance phone call from Australia and a front counter staff told me that she wound look into it and confirmed with me by email, the email didn't come. I called again after 2 days and another front counter staff promised to check and return by call, she didn't. At the end I was so worked up that I had to escalate the matter to the manager and yell over the phone to get a proper response. I was then told that it might take up to 2-3 weeks for the process to finalise. By this time I was so dejected I wasn't sure I could trust any of the staff anymore. I am so disappointed with this Hotel. The staff are so unreliable and I was let down repeatedly. I felt utterly helpless and angry with all the \"lies\".

Upon entering the room, it turned out that the room faced a busy express-way and a construction site across the express-way.

Now this seemed quiet strange given that they have 3 towers of 55 storeys each!! On being asked which floor the new room shall be, I was again curtly told that the floor# can't be shared as if it was against the national security interest of the country.

I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights to attend a conference. Always throngs of people in the lobby and the connected shopping area. Food is very good but at very high prices...then again, food in any 5 star hotel in Singapore is expensive. Had a deluxe room in Tower One and had a pretty amazing sea view from the 40th level. However, I think the rooms with view of the river and financial district would have been more amazing. The room was very spacious and had all the modern amenities. However, the one glitch was that after placing my personal stuff in the room safe, the safe would not reopen because the batteries (on the secret code keypad) gave up on me. Alhough they sent someone to fix the problem, this, I thought, was not good enough. The hotel should have done a pre-check before guests check-in. Another bummer I thought was the check-in system. After getting from the airport, who doesn't look forward to a speedy check-in? Instead, the check-in line system was divided into 4 or 5 separate lines each with about 2 service staff behind the counters facing the respective line. The problem with such a system is that in a place like Marina Bay Sands, the profile of visitors is going to be varied e.g. some lines had vacationers, groups, families hence some counters took much longer to check the guests in. As a result, there were several guests who were checked-in quicker than me (at least 4 different guests) even though I was in my line before they were in theirs. I think this system definitely should be improved on in particular guests who are there for business or conferences will be annoyed at how on occasions, the check-in lines can move too slowly for their liking. Other aspects of the hotel's service were good. The waiting staff that served room service (food) appeared very polite and genuine about whether there was anything else I wanted.

I would like to share a story of an even that would make MBS in particular and Singapore in general proud of. I and my wife were at MBS on Sunday March 4th 2012 to watch the show at the Sands Theatre and also did a stroll of shopping at the MBS mall after that as usual. We went out for dinner after a couple of hours and several big shopping bags at around 1930hrs , only to realize that we have left a paper bag from Banana Republic (BR) somewhere along Sephira outlet and the elevator. I came back to Sephira shop and several ladies in there were being very helpful and finally helping me to check on the CCTV whether I was coming to the shop with the BR bag with me and it showed that I entered Sephira outlet without the bag! Feeling despaired I felt that there was nothing we could do about it that and we went on for dinner before my wife suggested me to try to go to the Concierge nearby to check whether anyone have found our bag. There was nothing harm trying I told myself and off we went to the Concierge and being served by a young lady by the name of Marilyn where she checked on the Lost and Found Dept \u2013 they have found nothing we were told. When I was asking the possibility of checking the CCTV she then called her supervisor and asked us to come back to her for another 10 minutes waiting for his supervisor to arrive. I knew it all that even the CCTV shows someone has taken my bag away there was nothing we could do \u2013 but I told myself that at the very least we could get to know who took our bag away. Ten minutes waiting and there Marilyn\u2019s supervisor came, his name is Mr. Chiah Chih Wen (#810885) as per attached picture and he attended to me friendly and asked me to show him the location where I thought we have left our bag. Upon spotting the camera nearby the spot he then called his team and office to track where I was 2 hours before that and he asked me my mobile so that he could call me if there was anything at all. To my biggest surprise \u2013 within 30minutes \u2013 he did call! He told me to go to elevator nearby Sephira and to go up 1 level, I did that and upon meeting him he took me to an outlet where my bag was there! He told me that the CCTV showed 2 young ladies have found my bag and has passed the bag on to the outlet\u2019s manager to so that he could return that to the Lost and Found Dept. when I asked Mr. Chiang how would he want me to thank him he told me he was only doing his job and he was happy for being able to help! Herewith this email \u2013 and I believe this is the least I can do \u2013 I would like Mr. Chiang\u2019s team and superintendent especially and MBS and Singapore generally to be proud of having someone like him on board. He could have just told me that he would try his best but then just forget about it as the chance that the bag could be found was extremely small especially in the public place like that, but he chose to really try the impossible! Apart from having met someone great like him I would like to also tell everyone that I am really impressed with the technology ( as in CCTV ) and the protocol and mechanism MBS have for being able to track the bag! As a frequent traveller businessman that have been to almost everywhere in the world I regard Singapore as my second home for its reputation for the safety and efficiency but now I proudly add the sincere and honesty and great mentality of most of the person to the list \u2013 please keep up the good job and I wish all the best for Mr. Chiang and all the persons above \u2013 God bless you all!

At the reception counter, we have to wait due to the queue. I do understand that I have to queue when this hotel accommodates 2000 rooms. But, there is a but, I was unlucky with the receptionist which was the worst in all my traveling experience. It was all messy, the communication not clear. Then she told me it was fully booked that they have to change my room type which I don't mind so I wait 10 minutes, then she told me no sir u don't have to change coz we got your room. I said fine, after typing for 15 minutes more on the computer she told me again sorry we cannot find your room. Its almost 45 minutes that I was in front of her. I asked if I could talk to a manager, because I was tired, and want to rest. she told me sorry sir the manager is not here for the moment. I just had a quick look at the reception and I noticed that other staff with different uniform where standing behind the counter and to me were managers. I asked her who are those people there? She even didn't reply. I was really upset and I couldn't talk to her anymore and let my friend handle this check-in. At the end ( 1hour 25 minutes) i got the room that I had reserved. Tower 3, 6th floor the worst room location, not the tower location the room itself. Close to the other side of the building where you can 24hours car traffic. I was so happy to staying and it turn as a nightmare. I was expecting that in such establishment promoting themselves all around the world as the \"place to be\" in Singapore would do something. Nothing. Have been traveling a lot in asia, worst service ever, even guest houses have better service in Singapore. Either recruitment is a problem or the management, I won't blame this young receptionist that seems to not receive any training. Room was ok, I found some hair in the bathrooms and mini bar.

We booked our Club City View room direct with the hotel. AIRPORT TRANSFER - We were collected from the airport by hotel limo, which was not there when we arrived. We had to wait nearly an hour at the airport, very bad start. CHECK IN - Arrived at the hotel at 19-00 where we had our bags taken from us and told to make our way to the check in desk. This was very, very busy, but no problem as we had VIP check in lounge access, so we headed there. Our room was supposed to be ready for 15-00 hours but the receptionist couldn't find our room and it was not ready at 7pm!!! After 15 minutes checking in we were given our key card and told of our room. Very poor check in and collection. ROOM - Our room was on the 49th floor out of 57 in tower 2. The room cost nearly \u00a3500 per night and was large with superb views of the harbor. But it had no style and the interior was modern with no finesse. SWIMMING POOL ON 57TH FLOOR - WOW!!! Absolutely amazing. HOTEL LOBBY - Like Billy Smarts Circus. Talk about chaotic, it was pure madness, like being in a shopping center over xmas. HOTEL BARS - We used the hotel bar located opposite tower 2. For 2 draft beers and 2 diet cokes it cost nearly \u00a320 UK money. Rip off or what!! FACILITIES - The hotel has a museum (Titanic exhibition), Theater, exhibition center, shopping mall, food courts etc etc. It is truly massive. OVERALL - I was disappointed with this hotel because it lacked any personal touches. It just seemed like every person through the door was looked upon as a cash machine and the hotel did everything it could to encourage spending rather than making sure the customer was happy. The hotel is a great concept but just went a bit too far. TRANSFER FROM AIRPORT - I was told at the hotel reception that I would receive my 120 SD back because the car should have been there to meet us and we had to wait nearly one hour. I have paid this 120 SD on my card and am waiting for it to be refunded. At the time of writing this review I am still waiting for my refund which I was told I would get.

No other real option. We needed a room quick as we had plans for the evening and need to get ready so we had the room with 2 single beds pushed together. The best they could do was to give us champagne and strawberries in chocolate. We were really not impressed with the long wait and still not being able to get a king bed. However, the room and amenities were indeed fancy, very nice and clean. It was a nice view toward to city side. The bed was snuggly and so comfortable. The other nice touch was that the individual personal service of the bell boys were excellent. They came with our luggages very quickly and gave us a short explanation of how to work the room. Even on departure, we had a bell boy come to collect our luggage, store it until we were ready to get to the airport via the free shuttle- that was indeed 5 star service. The pool was over crowded and noisy but I guess we expected that from previous reviews. The view was nice but it was nicer from the privacy of our room. Doubt we would return again.

Photographic lovers would love to take picture on this spot since it will be a great challenge for them to be able to take a sharp object with a great city view as the back drop. If you want to pamper yourselve even more you can go to the massage spa parlour which is so unique that you can see the beautiful view of the city while your body is being treated; however, this service can be quite costly if you are in a tight budget. Across the hotel, you can spend your dollars either by shopping branded goods or having fun in the casino. The mall is quite huge with an old town of Singapore interior setting. There is a river inside the mall which you can take a boat ride just for fun along the straits. As usual, if you are a high roller, a special room rate is always available, and if you are a Sand's platinum member, a hotel room will always be available for you. The room is quite roomy, and has state of the art amenities like a touch of a button curtain, auto coffee maker (for the suite room), separate shower room , tubs, and toilet, and a personalized phone answering service. Yes, the lower floor room heading the freeway might get a bit noisy; therefore, it is recommended that you ask for the nice room direction when you reserve it. The hotel is about 30 minutes away from the famous Orchard Road (the shoppers' paradise road) if you take a taxi.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHard to fault\u201d", "Author": "sammurphy", "ReviewID": "UR124517691", "Content": "We stayed for 2 night\u2019s end of Jan 2012.

First impressions were a bit off as we waited for over 15 min to check in \u2013 it was 7.00am and there was an exhibition so the delegates that were checking out took priority- once we got to check in it seemed a real long process which took another 10 mins!. We were given a room on the 47th floor. The room was massive and the views to the city outstanding. The bed was lovely and comfortable. We had been advised not to use the mini bar and to not even move anything in there as you get charged. We were able to hook up to the hotels free WI fi. We decided to get breakfast in the hotel as most of the shops outside do not open until 11.00. There are plenty of dining options to choose from- w chose the buffet breakfast, which had everything you could want \u2013 but it was quite expensive at around $35.00 per head. We then asked for directions and the concierge was fantastic, recommending the tour busses and providing maps and timetables. Service in this hotel is first class. We ventured up to the pool and it is as impressive as it looks in the photos...its cold though be warned! We chose to eat at the hotel as we had a very early start in the morning- there are a number of fine dining options to chose from and we chose Ku de ta (i think that\u2019s how its written) - we were lucky to get a table as it get really busy- the food was great, service very attentive but again on the expensive side \u2013 Wine in particular is very expensive.

I had just finished my stay at the Conrad, which was amazing, so I'm gauging my review from that. The arrival and check-in process went pretty smooth, but the wait in line was a few minutes due to the sheer amount of people staying at this hotel. The room itself was a great size, and the bathroom was amazing. The view of course, from the room was almost as great as the view from the Sky Park. I stayed in Tower 3, on the 38th floor, room 3827, which was at the end. The infinity pool, of course, is the the main attraction, aside from the entire building itself. Entrance is met with a card scan, so just remember to bring your room key. The view from the pool is amazing, of course. Unobstructed views of downtown Singapore, coupled with the infinity pool, make for one of the most unique views in the world. That aside, I believe, does not make up for the hotel's sheer amount of tourist traffic. I think that's what takes away from its character, is not being able to better cater to each guest, unless of course your are a staying a in a suite or you're a high roller at the casino. It's a great venue, the rooms are great, the views are amazing, but that unique flair that smaller 5 star properties have that allow them to cater better to the traveler is what this property is missing.

The bad experience start from the moment of arrival at the airport. The hotel provided the free shuttle service from the airport. It took us more than 1 1/2 hour to go to hotel as the shuttle stopped every single terminal to wait for other guests, whilte it took us only 1/2 hr when we took the cab to the airport. The shuttle bus dropped us off at the basement carpark. We had no idea where to go, no staff or signs to direct us.

No porters were provided, and we had to drag our huge luggages, looking for the check-in counter. We finally found the check-in counter at the tower 1. Check-in was done, but then our room was appointed Tower 3! The lady at the check-in counter even did not ask us for porter service. Again, we had to fight in the trafic with carrying huge laggages all the way to Tower 3... We were so exhausted that we did not want to communicate with any staff.... The swimming pool was great, but I would not want to swim there as the place has become a tourits atraction with lots of non residence taking photos. The hotel provide great view, and shopping area.

Anyway, the swimming pool experience isn't any where nice... but that's not the hotel's problem.. more a cultural shock. The group of chinese tourists spit into the pool water and around the seats.

Quite a spacious room, especially the toilet. Comfy beds and comfortable lighting.

I was on a conference so paid SGD300 for a \"special rate\". My \"special treatment\" (read on) was probably a result of this. I was initially told when I reached the hotel at 11am (checkin time is at 3pm) that I would get a \"full sea-view\" and that they would try their best to get me a \"higher floor\"; when I got back at 4pm to get my room, I was given the one facing the city, on the 18th floor. The hotel has about 55 floors or so. So neither condition was fulfilled. I took consolation from the fact that the sea-facing view is actually not very nice - the sea is a little bit of a distance and the intervening space is taken up by construction of the new marina area. On the sea itself, you have the view of container ships. The city view is a lot nicer and dynamic, though busy for the eyes. And apparently, I was \"upgraded\" to a city view since they told me they charge more for that view. The room was huge, well-appointed and modern - curtains (both day and blackout) opena dn close at the touch of buttons. Usual flat-screen tv, huge king-sized bed (that I had asked for - so I guess I did get one thing that I asked for). The bed was comfortable. The room had its own coffee tea facilities, iron and board, sitting area with a divan and work table. All expected at this sort of a hotel. bathroom was huge but no bath tub, just a shower area. It surprised me there was no rain shower and just a head extending out of the wall. The hot water regulator was tight and would probably require you to have significant muscle mass to turn. The usual \"Paiza\" amenities were available. So, in summary nothing special. The breakfast was crowded; first time in my life I actually had to queue up to get a table. But to their credit, they have an army of hostesses who will take you to your table. The spread was ok - both local and international fare. Service crisp. Cappucino ok. Freshly squeezed juices. Forget about the hot eggs line...you could probably lay an egg yourself waiting for your turn. In summary, nothing special. If you really want to eat something nice, take a walk over to the foodcourt in the convention centre across the road where I was told the food is good (and a lot cheaper!). The hotel complex (it's 3 towers) is huge, busy and buzzing. There are at least 3 ways to get to the other side (the Casino, Convention Hall and Mall). The closest is from Tower 1 - where you can just walk out and cross the road. The other ways are underground - slightly longer walk. In case you take the train (MRT) to the hotel from the airport, there's a station right underneath the hotel - so very convenient. It enters the hotel between Towers 1 & 2. Taxi lines - outside Towers 1 & 3, with the former being the busiest. Tip - if you have booked in Tower 3, no need to get off at Tower 1 and check-in. You can get off in Tower 3 and check-in there, though the counter is smaller and lines likely to be longer. The walk between Towers 1 and 3 is say...150m. It takes 3-5mins. The star attraction is of course the top deck (known as the Skypark). There are some lifts that go direct to the 57th floor and others you can change/transfer on floor 34. Access is by key card once you reach the top i.e. for hotel guests only. It wan't as crowded as I thought it would be. It does take your breath away the first time you see the infinity pool, seemingly disappearing over the top of the building, with a view over the Singapore skyline. The pool is long - it stretches over almost all of the 3 towers so there's ample room. It's open from 6am - 11pm. The other side of the building has heated jacuzzis looking out over the sea and the sunset. There's a children's pool above Tower 1. Some eating options although you need reservations - I went on a Monday night at 8pm and they were turning people away. Tip - go at sundown and sunrise to get some really scenic views of Singapore's skyline...but be aware the pool is not heated so it can get a little cold at that time. Would I stay here again - I might. It's really not my kind of hotel. It's big, busy and you can never seem to get anything done without getting into a queue. However, just for the infinity pool and views, I would recommend a night's stay; it seemed a lot of people and tour groups had the same idea. On another note, their key cards were super-sensitive and kept getting de-magnetised. And every time I had to get them re-done, I would get 2 or 3 in return (i.e. the staff knew the problem with the key cards). In short, I now have the largest collection of key cards from a single hotel ever. Tip - you can also get your key card re-done from the business centre (there was one in Tower 3 where I stayed) which had nobody...as opposed to getting in line behind 15 people at the checkin/checkout counter. The staff - really nothing great at all. There was one guy who very helpful when I checked out - he came to help with my bags. He showed me how to check-out using the TV remote in 2 simple steps. (Yay! I skipped the queue downstairs!!) Of course you need your credit card to be registered with them and be comfortable with the bill coming in on email (which it did immediately). Other than this guy, other staff seemed \"busy\". I suppose they could not help it.

As a birthday gift to my mother, I wanted her to stay in what was supposedly the best hotel in Singapore. That being said, it was EXTREMELY disappointing to find the room as ORDINARY. I have paid for better quality hotel rooms in Europe for less than a third of the price. Even their sister hotel The Venetian Macao was leaps and bounds better at a much lower price. The room even had a vandalized desk which had not been cleaned, and the hot shower handle was difficult to manage. The pluses were the soft beddings and pillows, and of course the use of the infinity pool and the views. But since I can get the views by paying entrance fees to the Skypark, that would still not justify the cost of an ordinary room. But what I am truly shocked was their low level of customer service for such a pricey hotel. I have stayed in some hotels with less (but still) overpriced rooms, yet they made up for it with excellent customer service. Marina Bay Sands did no such thing. I had made it a point to email my preference for separate beds way beforehand, because as an adult male I did not want to share a king bed with my mother. I know such preference is still subject to availability, but upon check-in the front desk representative said that my booking was still lodged under a king bed -- which meant my previous correspondence with them was totally disregarded. They tried to put us in a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed, and just transfer us next day, which I declined due to the inconvenience. To be fair to them, they did offer to upgrade us to a suite -- but still with a king bed and a sofa bed. Some might think I'm stupid for refusing, but at 2am I did not want to have paid that much to sleep on (and possibly even assemble) a sofa bed. Then voila! -- miraculously there was an available deluxe room with separate beds -- which made me wonder why they made us undergo such a hassle in the first place. They must have found my email the next day, because they tried to compensate by leaving a birthday cake in our room. But the damage to our holiday was already done, and the cost of the cake does not in any way compensate for the hassle during check-in and the overpricing. Moreover, their free shuttle from the airport was also problematic. There were no signs regarding its pick-up location. The information counter people at the Budget Terminal had conflicting info on where it was (in fact, a number of airport personnel didn't even know where it was or if there was one), so we barely missed the hourly shuttle. And to top it off, the next shuttle was even late. We noticed that it did not wait more than a couple of minutes for passengers, so it will pick you up only if you are there EXACTLY at the irregular time when it passes by. Also, I guess late check-in guests do not get complimentary drinks the same way as during the daytime. When you pay that much money for a room, you expect to get a really good experience (and not just rely on the views and the pool) -- which is something my mother and I did not get, even though I had notified them beforehand about her special occasion.

This was all OK. Trouble started in the next morning when we went to breakfest. There is a dining area in the first floor ( lobby hall ) of the hotel, first of all you have to wait untill a place is free and then you get seated somewhere in an area which is the total opposite of being cosy, it is horrible and not suitable for a 5*-Hotel at all.

The Skypark and the pool on the 57th floor offers a stunning view over the city, but thats it, food at the resaurants is overpriced and the pool over crowded which is no wonder as the hotel has 2000 rooms ( as far as I know ) so again it is more mass tourism than a 5star-feeling. Now to the very anoing point: the rooms are - even if the hotel is very new - already shaby and the building materials used are cheap, they only look good on the first view, the rooms are not cleaned properly, we found sauce on magazings in the room, the carpet was dirty and the desk full of ink, couch was dirty as well, so this is digusting.

It was chosen purely for the amazing rooftop infinity pool and boy that didn't disappoint. Of course when booking we said it was the most expensive pool we had ever paid for but it was worth it. Do note if you are only stopping one night, to ensure we got use of the pool during the day, we had to book late check out otherwise you cant enter the pool area and this would be a big disappointment. Not only that but the SkyPark is closed at night so you cant get up these on a late arrival. We were a little concerned after reading many reviews that the service and the rest of the hotel would be a big let down, definitely not the case. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and professional whilst still being friendly. The enormous 3 tower lobby, shops, outside areas were all jaw dropping and the camera was certainly busy. The breakfast was so amazing and there was too much choice and not enough stomach room. Although we always intended to stop and drop we couldn't help but explore Singapore seeing as it was my partners 1st visit and well over 10 years since my last time there. It was a short stroll over the pedestrian Helix Bridge (a beauty in itself) into the main centre so location gets the bug thumbs up. Please note the hotel offers a courtesy transfer service to & from the airport, as you walk out into the arrivals hall the desk is just by the exit. We arrived quite late so we did have a wait as they are less regular during the night, and we could have got to the hotel quicker if we had got a cab but seeing as our purse strings were a bit tight after the rest of the trip decided to wait for the transfer and it wasn't too long, maybe 15-20 minutes max. They also offer a service of being able to check in your luggage for certain flights at the hotel so you can wave goodbye to your luggage earlier in the day, enjoy the hotel and Singapore without worrying about your bags and then they'l take you back to the airport when your ready. The only negative is the room keys have a habit of not working, bearing in mind we were there less than 24 hours we went through 4 sets of keys. This was a little inconvenient but not to the detriment of our stay and the staff were always very apologetic. I wouldn't say this is a check in problem more of a technical issue and they are probably even more frustrated having to go through it each time as I've noticed many reviews commenting on the keys.

After landing at Singaore Changi Airport, we decided to take a cab to facilitate our trip to the hotel. We're a family of 4, and I was travelling with my parents and older brother. We booked 2 rooms, one king size bedroom and a two double bed bedroom. There were a lot of check in counters, everyone seemed well groomed and friendly. After a short line up we gave our hotel reservation reference and online receipts which clearly states what we have booked: 2 rooms. One with a single king size bed, and the other with two beds. For some odd reason, they couldn't find one of our rooms. It took them a good 30 minutes of 'checking the system' to finally 'find' our missing room. The first room (king size bed) was located in Tower 1, 40th floor while the second room (2 beds) was in Tower 1, 30th floor. We decided to go the the 40th floor together first to check out the magnificent view. Unfortunately, the magnetic key cards were not working. We tried both key cards, and the little light on the doorknob will just flash yellow and remain locked. We decided to use the service phone by the elevator and explain our situation. After 10 minutes, a hotel staff (hotel porter I assume) comes out of the elevator and walks us to our room. He tries our keys (and of course they weren't working), he inserts the new key and opens the door. However, he walked in with us and just stood there. I might have been extra sensitive, but the 4 of us (entire family) felt quite uncomfortable and it definitely felt like he was expecting a tip from us. There was NO WAY I was tipping for a service that was originally the hotel's fault for giving us faulty keys! If anything, I would have expected the hotel staff to apologize on behalf of the hotel for causing us this trouble and wait time! The room itself was nice, surrounded by brown and beige tones. All amenities were fully equipped (a digital locker, complimentary coffee and tea, bathrobes, plenty of towels, all bathrooms amenities full. etc). The bed was cleaned and even though the carpet (being light brown) looked a little dirty, complimentary sandals were provided. We then head down to the 30th floor to check our second room. This time the magnetic keys worked, BUT it was somehow locked from the inside!!! What could this mean??? The only explanation we had was that there was already somebody in our room!!! Confused and upset, we walked over to the service phone by the elevator and explained our situation. The person on the phone asked if he could send someone upstairs to do an ID check. I was baffled by this, since this will not solve anything! She checked the room reservation and of course the names didn't match, meaning that there was probably a mistake by the check in staff where they gave us an already occupied room! I was getting quite frustrated by now and extremely tired since I traveled over 10 hours prior to landing at Singapore. The phone staff tells us to go down to the check in counter again. I was perplexed as to the level of inefficiency this Hotel has. I asked if there was somebody in specific we should talk to, but was told to explain the WHOLE story again to the check in staff. Seriously?!?! Fine. We go down again, and of course the lady who checked us in was off duty. We explained our situation to a new lady and after 10 minutes of 'checking the system', she could not give us any explanation of what exactly happened! Not even a 'sorry'!!! She then tells us that there are no more rooms in tower 1 and she could check us in at Tower 2. We explained how this will cause an incontinent, since we wanted to travel together as a family and our parents room are in Tower 1. She couldn't help us with that and just waited for us to agree to take a Tower 2 room. Fine, reluctantly we accepted since I was mad furious and deadly tired. All I wanted to do was to lie down. We receive the key and guess what? Our room is now on the 13th floor! From 30th to 13th! We walked in and realized that the room size is the same as my parents' 40th floor, but when we opened the window, all we could see was the mall's rooftop from across the street. Horrible view. While I was about to drink some water (they had 2 complimentary bottles), I realized that there was a half empty bottle of water on the desk with a different brand. I asked my brother if it was his, and he said no. This could only mean that the housekeeping staff 'forgot' to take away an open bottled of water and left it right in the middle of the desk! Upon further inspection, the cabinet sliding door where the digital locker was located was damaged and it would not open and close properly. I called the hotel again and asked them 'why is there a open bottle of water left by the previous occupants in our room?' I also made sure that they knew the sliding door was broken, so they wouldn't charge it on us as damaged room fee. How could a hotel of this caliber miss on so many level??? check in staff was unfriendly and unapologetic. They were extremely inefficient and could not accommodate us in the simplest terms. Housekeeping staff leaving used bottle of waters behind. Phone operator also extremely inefficient. Hotel service staff showing attitude for a service that should be tipped free and apologetic towards. The hotel itself looked marvelous. The hotel amenities were superb (swimming pools, viewing deck, restaurants, food courts, shopping, casino). But PERSONALLY when I pay this amount of money for a room in a hotel, the most important factor is the room and where we will sleep. The rest (swimming pools, viewing deck, restaurants, shopping) are extras that makes the hotel even better, they are secondary issues to reinforce what a comfortable environment they have to provide us with a care free, comfortable night rest. This point was entirely missed by the hotel so no matter how great their secondary and supportive activities and amenities were, the entire feeling of Marina Sands Bay Singapore was simply terrible. Just terrible.

Obviously i stayed around October 2011 and only have the time to write the review now...I wouldnt go back to that hotel again ever.The staffs werent friendly at all. Upon checked in, I actually find the hotel lobby so huge that we dont know which way to head up. After check in we headed to the left side of the lobby asking for help and without finishing my question, the \"Front Office\" guy I would say would just point me to find help to the person next to him. I find it very rude, as all i was asking was where are some ATM that I can withdraw from? WHen I was checked in to the room-finally, I found out that the fridge couldnt be opened, hence I phone the operator to check it out. I was told nicely that it will be fixed in 5 minutes...after 10 minutes i called again as it was still couldnt be open and the telephone operator promised to send someone over which obviously noone came. The next morning we went for breakfast, and were wearing our ITB tags, the waitress at the breakfast area told us \"Mam, your ITB colleagues were at the lounge at the back, if you want to join them.\" then I replied \"nope its ok, as im a hotel guest and I want to dine privately here\" then she came replied\" thats fine, then your friends will be at our lounge and you will have to charge to eat here\". I was like, my accommodation was included with breakfast! I assume she would have my room numbers ready to be called and just cross off our names! Its really unprofessional! The good points are, the hotel views is good and the bell boys were really friendly. The front office person were really terrible! I complained to my friends whom then told me what do we expect, where they are a casino hotel where they only pay attention to players who pay much more than us. I was treated badly there, all the complains I had was not new to the taxi drivers whenever I got to suntec and back. I would say the locations is not that good, we wanted to experience MBS at least once and we ended up taking more taxis more than ever just to get to places to shop and dine. I would have chose other better hotels, its was a bad experience and choice!

Contrary to some of the comments posted on here previously, here are some facts & my own subjective views:- This hotel is a tourist attraction in itself - it is always busy. If you do not like crowds do not go!!! Try the Mandarin Oriental - about the same price for same room but a lot more restrained and quiet. PAY - for a high room to get the view. If you do not pay - do not moan if you are not upgraded free. We stayed in a city view club room & were extremely impressed. Breakfast in the club lounge on 57th floor truly excellent. The service for the size of hotel is excellent. This place is the size of a large Vegas hotel and for me the service is far superior in Singapore than in Vegas. We found the staff cheerful & obliging - every one of them. The views from the Skypark/ pool are unbelievable and worth the 20 dollar price even if you are not staying at the hotel. Taxis from MBS and in Singapore generally are plentiful & amongst the cheapest in the World - yes the World - although there are small supplements to be paid on Sundays, at night and at rush hour. A 35 minute taxi ride to Singapore zoo cost us 23 dollars (about 11 pounds or 15 us) You can also get a water taxi to the merlion - 4 dollars or walk over the double helix bridge (reached via the underground passage to the 'shoppes' & reach anywhere in the city on foot. It is however very, very hot!!!!! Went into the casino - its free for foreigners presenting their passport. Did not recognize some of the games but roulette, dice & slots are in abundance. Incredibly busy at night. Even if you dont bet go to see how much money some people have to lose. Free water & coffee. The one disappointing part of MBS was the foodcourt, attaching to the 'shoppes' - Without a shadow of doubt the worst and most expensive foodcourt we have been to in Singapore. In a city where good food is everywhere even a foodcourt in a large shopping centre needs to be better and cheaper than this. Suntec city mall has a far superior and far cheaper foodcourt than this on its ground floor. For the authentic local eateries try the foodcourt in Bras Basah complex - even though its accross the road from Raffles you rarely see a tourist in there. More touristy places to eat at a foodcourt would be Lau Pa Sat or Peoples Park Complex - both cheaper & better than the one at MBS. The high end restaurants in the 'shoppes' may well be ok but we did not try them. Whilst of course bad experiences can arise anywhere a lot of the negative stuff is because people are not managing their own expectations. This is by no means a cheap hotel - so if you are going to go - great go with an open mind - but do your homework & decide whether it is for you.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Daziz_91", "ReviewID": "UR123250685", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights recently and admittedly, I didn't have high expectations. However, I was amazed to find that the service has improved drastically and the hotel is making a genuine effort to enhance its guests experience. The hotel has a 'priority service' which basically allows you to request for just about anything. Complained that my room had not been cleaned although I was out for 3 hours and within 10 minutes, someone was at my door. 30 minutes later, the reception called to check if the room had been cleaned to my expectations and if they could assist me with anything. I truly felt that my needs were taken care of. The infinity pool, as many have said...is absolutely breathtaking!! And it's great that only hotel guests can access the pool. The biggest issue with the hotel is that the long lines at the reception is still a problem. There's a staff offering mineral water to thirsty guests, but really, all that is needed is a room after a long flight. However, do note that this is not a hotel for everyone. If you're not a fan of a 'lively' lobby past 10pm and want personalised service where the staff know you by name even if you stay in its most basic accommodation, then opt for something else.

On our arrival we were very surprised to find that there were no electric doors or doormen at the entrance, you had to manually push thick heavy glass doors which we found very difficult. At check in there is no seating for other guests of your travelling party to sit, people just standing around everywhere and certainly there is not enough staff at these counters. I had made my booking for check in the previous day to my arrival as we were travelling all night and wanted our room to be available on our arrival at 8.30am the following day. Check in staff did not check the documents properly and advised me check in would not be available until 3pm it took 3 times to show them the booking for her to understand and an e-mail conversation with the booking company advising our request. The booking was made 6 months prior to our stay and being a smoker I requested a smoking room, I understand this is a request only and not all requests can be met but making my booking so far in advance I thought this would have been met. I am sure other guests that had a smoking room did not book 6 months or more in advance. We had to wait an extra hour or more for this type of room to be available. With this happening we were each given a $50 voucher to use in certain areas of the hotel but we still did not think this was acceptable nor did we use the vouchers. In our package breakfast was included so in waiting for our room we had breakfast and again showing the staff the documentation that check in date was actually the day before we still had problems with them understanding our booking and later that evening we noted this breakfast was charged for. The following morning when we went to breakfast and advised what had happened and the Manager in this section was really good, he understood the situation gave me his card, went to check in and this charge was reversed. The breakfast was fantastic, the quality and quantity of food was amazing and all the staff were very polite, friendly and worked very hard. The first morning we had breakfast as it was a little later in the morning we sat in a bar area and it was a bit difficult in eating as the tables only came to knee height. Although the restaurant was very nice there are a large number of guests at one time for breakfast and everyone talking it gave the feel as more of a cafeteria. In your room the mini bar is weight sensitive so as soon as you take anything from the mini bar you are charged, this is the first time I have ever come across this and I was quite disappointed that the fridge was full to maximum quantity so there was no room to put your complimentary bottles of water to get them cold, we could not buy fruit and keep refrigerated, this is a way of them making more money as you cannot but drinks outside of the hotel and put in the fridge. It was also disappointing that a hotel of this calibre only supplied coffee mate as a milk substitute instead of long life milk, can\u2019t think of anything more disgusting to use and again couldn\u2019t even buy fresh milk to put in the fridge as there was no room. Each time you arrived from the lift it was noisy and once in the foyer it felt like being in a Mall, at times we had to wait 10 minutes or more for a taxi and again entering or returning having to push the thick glass doors. As we were so tired on our arrival we were glad just to get our room but we found the following faults and looking around our room the next day we were totally shocked to what we found Air conditioner was noisy Desk chair squeaks everytime you move The other thing we found annoying was the bathroom light was near the door entrance and the side lamp switches were behind the side draws which were difficult to get to at times There was dust everywhere, and this was not just daily dust this was weeks if not months of dust and fluff on the TV side board lip side, glass shelves with mini bar menu and vase, desk mirror frame, window seal. Vinyl on the writing desk drawn on Round table had a burn mark 1 side table had a wood missing The most disgusting thing of all that we found that there were stains on the valances of both beds (pictures attached) all I can say is I was glad we were checking out that day. As I write a review on all hotels that I stay in and this room standard not being acceptable I thought it would be appropriate to advise the hotel of these conditions. I requested for a senior member of housekeeping to inspect this room but no one was available until I advised about my report, after this a member was sent to the room within 15 minutes. I showed her all the dust & fluff & especially the stains on the valances and no commitment was made but on each instance all she advised was sorry Maam and advised this would be passed onto Management. Shortly before checkout a member of Management did contact me but she did not come to inspect the room while we were still there and no type of discount or refund was offered. We were however offered transportation to the airport and again I declined as I just wanted to checkout and arrange my own transport. I have stayed in 3* hotels which are cleaner than this.

However, she said we could check in first and come back for the key later. When we came back one and a half hours later at 4pm, we were again told by another stoned faced check in officer that the room was not ready. We complained that the previous officer had already said the room would be ready by 4pm. It was after much prodding that she called up the housekeeping department to ask. The housekeeping said they need another half an hour more. That means a check in of almost 5pm as it was already 4plus at that time. After a frustrating wait, we finally got a call at around 520pm saying that the room is ready. That is when another hiccup occurred. When I went to collect the room keys, the second check in officer insisted that I have not paid the deposit for the room. My partner had done the check in so I thought that she have not paid that deposit yet. When I paid that deposit and joined her at a nearby restaurant, she said that she had paid when checking in. After checking with the check in officer, they discovered that we indeed paid that deposit when we checked in earlier, except that the previous officer did not key into the system! We finally checked in at 6pm. This was the worst check in experience we ever encountered, had to experience this from a 5 Star hotel is totally unacceptable. There was a crowd at the lobby and the check in staff seemed unable to cope with the crowd. Having said this, to their credit, they agreed to extend our check out time to 3pm. We also enjoyed the facilities and views from our room and the sky deck.

We had to pick up our own luggage and cramp them into a space that was enough for only 4 pieces of luggages in a 15-17 seater mini bus. The seats are small and overall, the whole airport transfer experience was unimpressive for a 5 star hotel shuttle. We wouldn't think much of it except service steadily become worse from then on. The check in experience was one of the worst we've encountered. After we filled in the form on the bus so that we 'don't have to queue at the check in counter', we wandered around the lobby looking for SIGNS of where we need to go to check in, only to see chaotic crowds at the check in counter with no clear indication that we (people with registration form) should go straight to the head of the queue. So we lined up. Once we finally got served, we were told the hotel had no more of our room (non smoking king bed) even though we booked one month ahead of our arrival. So we were 'upgraded' to city view, but with two separate beds. It was also clearly a smoking room because the toilet cubicle reek of tobacco smell. We went out from 9am until 4pm and still the room has not been made up. I had to call and remind them. I would have thought that this is the ONE step ALL hotels have to get right. Three stars hotel in Vietnam provide better services than this 5 star hotel. The Skypark is nothing more than glorified swimming pool which would be okay if service was good. We could clearly see some people with drinks and food but there were no signs of where we can go to get them and the wait staff (attendants) simply walk past without asking if we needed refreshments. Unimpressive and since I was willing to pay for drinks and food their lack of service mean less money for Marina Bay Sands. The Sky on 57 restaurant was okay. The waiting staff was clearly inexperienced. They served us the entree before the soup. They forgot what wines we ordered and had to ask us again. For a dinner that cost 2 people $400 (SIN), the entire experience was really over priced. In terms of dining options, we found there were two choices. Number one, the astronomical $200 per person as mentioned above or the $15 per person food court (highly overpriced for Singapore). There is nothing in the middle. Or if there is, you have to do a bit of research to find it while sitting in your hotel room. If or when you find it, no doubt, it will be over priced too. Overall: we will NOT return to Marina Bay Sands Hotel any time soon. Do not waste your money and time on this place. There are cheaper and nicer options out there.

The rooms where the typical Sands style rooms that you find in any of their hotels, very nice. Did not get breakfast included in any of my stays so can't comment on that. Check in took forever the first time, we took the complimentary shuttle from the airport. Would not do this again, it is more hassle than what it is worth. You have to fill out forms which they tell you will express your check in but I didn\u2019t see it. Plus you arrive at the check out with everyone else on the bus which makes your wait longer. Just jump in a taxi from the airport, costs like 14 Singaporean dollars. Go to the main check in at tower 1 to get through quicker.

We arrived a few days after some family members. Our family had booked 6 rooms through a friend that is a VIP and Sands have flown them back on their private 747 from Vegas in the past! We stayed from 29th-1st in our room. Upon check in there was no record of our booking, a quick call to the friend who called the manager sorted this situation out however as it was last minute 27th Dec 2011 there was not enough club rooms (which is understandable to some extent) We arrived from our flight at 10pm, got to our club room on level 40+. The rooms are spacious, views are great and fittings were also nice except the sofa bed was out. As there were many issues ill note them accordingly below: 1) Sofa bed We called on the club priority line at 10pm + and asked that the bed not be made and be converted back to a sofa. They wanted to send housekeeping then to sort it out which was nice but quite late and with a baby we just asked if it could be done the next day. The next day it wasn\u2019t made up, but still out. On the 31st morning I called priority line again and went to reception on our way out to sort out the issue and they confirmed it would be done (again) That afternoon we encountered another issue and when the service manager came up to view it AFTER housekeeping had been through we again complained about the sofa bed, so house keeping was immediately called to rectify it. The sofa bed was made but the of the 3 back cushions the middle was placed correctly and the two others were placed on the armrest, with pillows placed where the seat cushions should have been. The service manager didn\u2019t even pick this up... Where is the commonsense & training? Also there was a used tissue under the sofa bed after they folded it up which I had to pickup. Refer to pictures of setup... 2) Baby bath Not a big issue, but might as well highlight it. Called priority line on the 30th morning requesting if they had a baby bath available, the person on the phone stated yes they do but they will check on availability and get back to us. We waited sometime 1 hour+ and called back. The person who picked up this time asked if anybody had called us back? Well obviously not otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be calling right? They said they were all unavailable and we would be put on a wait list. No issues, but it would have been nice if they followed it up rather than us have to. We never got one throughout our stay. 3) WORMS During and after the shower we noticed small black things around the tiles. On closer inspection they were wriggling and were worms, i counted in excess of 20, they were coming out of the gap between the shower floor tiles. Rather than call and complain I decided to go to reception and mention it as the phone staff are obviously useless. They said they would have it fixed during the day. We return back in the afternoon, there are still at least 6 dead ones lying on the floor! I call the priority line again ask for the manager as this is unacceptable. One of the service managers came up to inspect it, took some pictures and so we complained about the sofa bed so she organised housekeeping to fix the sofa and tiles. She said unfortunately the hotel was fully booked so couldn\u2019t transfer our room. They used a sealer to cover the place where the worms were coming from which made the room smell quite bad, and there is no window for the fumes to escape so we just had to get a high on them. The service manager said its their 2nd NYE and hotel was running at full capacity. My question is, how can you be a manager with such low attention to detail in such a hotel, and moreover if you can\u2019t cope at 100% then why do it??? Refer to pictures & video. 4) Mouldy accessory box On the last night after all these issues, we went to use a cotton bud so opened the box and reached to the bottom where they were, the box was lined with mould... Nice, I mean aren\u2019t these things meant to be hygienic? 5) Carpets Not a big issue but since I\u2019m doing this I may as well mention it. Sitting at the desk I noticed a long hair on the carpet (not ours) as it had been there from day 1, maybe the vacuum isn\u2019t he best but for whatever reason it was there from check in to check out, I was wondering if it would be cleaned but wasn\u2019t holding my breath. 6) House staff Now its a known fact that all hotels use foreign labour as its cheaper and Singaporeans won\u2019t do it. When the hotel is running at full capacity during NYE you would expect no less from a hotel of this calibre, but we overheard the cleaner come out of the room on her mobile calling a colleague saying in Mardarin \"where are you I have nothing to do\" Nothing to do????? really??? I can think of something for you to do! These rooms were not cheap at Singapore $450 a night! The communication between staff is utterly miserable, its been mentioned before and its obviously the same. The Sky Park is nice, Club rooms get breakfast on the Skypark, other guests can\u2019t even pay to eat there WOW! But the food selection is 1/4 of that available to all patrons downstairs. Hot food was eggs cooked to order, tomato, beans, bacon, sausages and congee. They had some cereal, toast, ham, salmon, salad and 2 fruits. On the last day 1st Jan I went down to reception and demanded to see the duty manager, I brought up all these issues, and armed with pictures and video went to show her. She initially declined with a disgusted face! I said if i had to live in it then the least you can do is watch it! I asked her if this was a hotel or a camping ground? At $450 a night I don\u2019t expect these issues to surface, i doubt they would even happen in Hotel 81! She seemed very understanding and remorseful on the hotels behalf and gave us 30% off and asked us to try the breakfast downstairs on the hotel. Later in the morning we had another call, I assume from a manager asking if all issues had been resolved. At the same time his mobile was ringing and you could obviously tell he was distracted from the conversation as he had to stop talking to see who was calling. At this stage I had literally had enough of this and said \"yes\". Seriously I know its not easy to manage a hotel of this size, but if you\u2019re going to put the \"Sands\" name on the hotel you should protect your goodwill with the same level of service! The communication of this hotel is utterly pathetic, and our NYE was tarnished by the series of events that happened. During one of the conversations to the priority line after the worm issue had been \"cleaned\" the first time I said if you don\u2019t send the manager up ill post it on tripadvisor, to which I was told \"everybody has a right to express their opinion!\" so MBS management here it is! I have been truthful and factual, as it stands during peak times your hotel is hopeless! I do not blame individuals but essentially this hotel is poorly managed, I have never ever encountered issues with any hotels at the lower or high end that have compelled me to the extent to write such an extensive list of issues.

When I was swimming at the infinity pool, 90% of the people were either lazing around of taking pictures (even in the pool). That is enough to make the statement \"to see and be seen\" true. * PREMIER GRAND ROOM * I'm a local. My friends and I stayed in a Premier Grand room on the 12th floor facing the Gardens by the Bay. I didn't go into the huge balcony, but one of our friends was stuck there for a long time, taking in the atmosphere. Being a higher category, the room was certainly huge. A pity I didn't take pictures as it was messed up already. Anyway, we had a corner room. Once we entered, it was a 4 meters walkway which has mirrors on both sides (mirrors are always a nice touch). Then, it was the living area that had a dining table, sofas, chairs and tables. The huge LCD TV could be turned around to face the living area or the bed area. As we turned left, it was the bedroom area. 1 comfortable king-sized bed. Point to note: there was not much refrigerating space. If you plan a surprise cake, then you could ask the Room Service to keep it for you first. Beside the bedroom, there were 2 huge wardrobes that lets guests keep clothes and also contain an iron. * BATHROOM * Before visiting, I had heard a lot of raves about its bathtub. Indeed, the rumour was true. It was so huge that somebody could well sleep inside. One of the first things I did was to soak in the tub. With automated curtains, you could also see the city view. How nice! Besides the tub, there was a toilet, a shower area, a huge dressing table with two sinks (love having two sinks) and a lot of amenities, towels and space to walk around. The bathroom was almost as huge as the bedroom. Of course, not to forget, the balcony spanned the sides of the living area and the bedroom area. * BANYAN TREE HEALTHCLUB * We enjoyed the Banyan Tree Health Club very much! Steam + Sauna + Hot Pool! Point to note: Each room key only allows a maximum of 3 guests' usage each time. Also, men and ladies have separate facilities. * ROOF * After enjoying the Health Club, guests would hit the Jacuzzi + Swimming Pool at the Roof area. These facilities were very crowded, in huge contrast to the Health Club. The Swimming Pool was made up of 3 separate pools that have wooden platforms in between for phototaking opportunities. Indeed, the view was breathtaking, and the water was very cold, even in the day. * THE SHOPPES * Prior to staying at MBS, I have always enjoyed the Italian restaurants MOZZA - Osteria Mozza and Pizzeria Mozza. Osteria Mozza is a fine-dining restaurant that served excellent Italian cuisine - the Truffle Pasta is not to be missed! It was a delighting experience dining there. Right next door, their sister restaurant Pizzeria Mozza serves authentic woodfired pizzas - Yummmmmy! Reservations are highly recommended as these restaurants are very popular with the locals. There are plenty of restaurants at MBS, and a number of celebrity restaurants as well (including Mozza). Reservations are recommended, so check out MBS website in advance. Besides celebrity restaurants, there are also mid-range and low-range food available. Din Tai Fung, a Taiwanese restaurant, costs around SGD 20 per person only. You can also find even cheaper food at the food court at less than SGD 10 per person. * RISE BUFFET * Previously, I was given the impression that Rise Buffet had very impressive desserts. However, the desserts didn't impress me at all. The dining experience was good because of company. The food selection and quality were expected. I wouldn't crave to revisit this restaurant. * TRANSPORTATION * I understand that MBS offers bus shuttle services to the airports and Marina Bay MRT Station (Train). It is convenient to walk to Promenade station through the Helix Bridge to get to anywhere in Singapore, or, simply take a bus or taxi. * OTHER ACTIVITIES * Shopping can be done at MBS easily. Most of the brands are mid to high-end. If you are a Casino regular, and have Premier Advantage points, then you could offset a fair bit of your purchases. MBS do not offer cheap shopping for sure.

Ab 14.1.2012 ist die Anbindung an das MRT Netz fertiggestellt. Dann kann die Stadt sehr einfach per U Bahn erreicht werden. Viele G\u00e4ste bleiben nur eine oder zwei n\u00e4chte im MBS. Meiner Meinung nach reichen zwei N\u00e4chte aus um alle Attraktionen zu erleben. Die meisten G\u00e4ste reisen wegen dem spektakul\u00e4ren Pool an, der die hohen Preise rechtfertigt. Wer Singapur als Zwischenstopp in erw\u00e4gung zieht ist hier also sehr gut untergebracht. Wer sich die Stadt anschauen m\u00f6chte, dem empfehle ich ein Hotel auf der Stadt seite der Marina Bay. Hier gibt es f\u00fcr das gleiche Geld deutlich weniger Wartezeit am Check In und individuelleren Service. Da das MBS sehr gro\u00df ist kann die Wartezeit am Check In bis zu 15 min in anspruch nehmen. Es wird sich allerdings sehr bem\u00fcht diese Unannehmlichkeit etwas zu mindern indem von einer sehr freundlichen Dame Wasser verteilt wird. Bei teueren Arrangements entf\u00e4llt diese Wartezeit selbstverst\u00e4ndlich. Dort ist ein Check In an einem VIP Terminal oder ein In Room Check In m\u00f6glich. An der Concierge Rezeption habe ich nicht eine sekunde gewartet und alle Fragen wuden umgehend und umfassend beantwortet. Auch \u00fcber das Telefon war der Service ausgezeichnet. Unser Zimmer war sehr sauber und sehr gut ausgestattet. Im 50 Stock ist aber immernoch die Autobahn auf der Meerseite zu h\u00f6ren. ich empfehle daher ein Zimmer in hohen lagen zu bevorzugen. Die Meerseite hat mir pers\u00f6nlich besser gefallen. Um den Ausblick auf den CBD kennt man nach einigen Tagen SIN aus allen Perspektiven. Die vielen wartenden Schiffe in der Stra\u00dfe von Malakka sind Nachts ebensosch\u00f6n beleuchtet. Der Pool ist wie bereits erw\u00e4hnt spektakul\u00e4r und alleine den Hotelpreis wert.

Wer ein Clubzimmer bucht kann im Dachpark fr\u00fchst\u00fccken, sehr empfehlenswert. Zu erw\u00e4hnen ist das Angebot an Einkaufsm\u00f6glichkeiten.

Shortly after we arrived, my partner went into the bathroom to go to the toilet, only to find half the bathroom area completely flooded with toilet water overflowing from the bowl, and the previous guests business presumably floating at the top. Completely horrified, we immediately rang the front desk services to get the issue sorted out. My partner told the man on the other end of the phone that we had a dinner date we had to attend so unfortunately we wouldn't be present while they attended our room, to which he was told \"No, you must be present in the room while it is attended to\" - which we found extremely rude and unnecessary considering we had prior arrangement and a booking at a restaurant we didn't want to be late to. The man on the other end said someone would be at our room in 10 minutes at which we would be able to leave. So while my partner waited, I quickly ran down to the restaurant in the MBS shopping complex to tell the friends we were meeting that we'd be a bit late. I returned to the room and my partner was STILL waiting there. By the time I had returned, 45 minutes had passed and NO one had arrived to sort the problem out, and by this point the bathroom and some of the room was smelling putrid. I was so angry I rang the front desk and told the woman on the other end (who could barely speak English) that we had been waiting longer than double the time specified for someone to arrive, and that it was ridiculous that we were told that WE had to wait all this time, let alone at ALL. She then laughed and said that we should just leave and muttered something incoherent and hung up on me. When we returned from our dinner - which we were an hour late to, we returned to the room thankfully fixed. The bathroom unfortunately still smelled terrible. Something else that enraged me is that a note was left which said: \"Dear guest, We came by at 17:25 to attend to your request. Your request has been attended to while you were away.\" What really annoyed me is that it stated that the request was \"attended\" to at 17:25. I know for a fact that it was NOT attended to at this time due to the fact that this was at the point where my boyfriend was waiting in the room and when I was running around telling my friends and the restaurant what was happening. I resent being lied to by staff who want to make out that they were diligent enough to attend to our request (which was completely reasonable in the first place!)..I have no idea when or how the problem was fixed or why it even happened in the first place - but things like overflowing toilets that aren't attended to shouldn't be happening in a 5 star hotel. I've stayed in $50/night hotels that have had better functioning facilities and more diligent staff. On a better note, the SkyPark is worth visiting. We enjoyed the Infinity Pool and jacuzzis on the roof and the atmosphere on top of the hotel. The restaurants/bars up there are too expensive to bother with. Honestly, the only reason we wanted to stay at this hotel was because of the SkyPark/Infinity Pool and the Casino. My boyfriend (who is an avid poker player) was disappointed that there was no poker at the Casino but found the staff in the place very attentive and pleasant to deal with. While I understand that guests at the hotel should be granted access of the pool - it is disappointing that MBS doesn't designate even one day in which the public are able to visit and have a swim - because essentially most people stay here to have a swim at the pool and to pay at LEAST $400 for one day of that is completely ridiculous considering the rest of the hotel experience is far from being up to scratch.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cOne of its kind in the world\u201d", "Author": "shubz81", "ReviewID": "UR122452307", "Content": "I must say one should stay in this hotel once in a life time.... omg its amazing .... we loved the way they made it , you have everything in this hotel one can dream off. they have a amazing swimming pool on 57th floor which they call sky park . really it is a park on top floor . it is a signature building of the world . you have huge shopping mall with casino in it ... i am sure girls will love it . must go", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201c5 star service all the way and unbeatable views and entertainment\u201d", "Author": "Tracey S", "ReviewID": "UR122445594", "Content": "Complimentary pick up from the airport in an air conditioned luxury coach sets the standard.

Firstly, the rooms are quite expensive which is the norm for 5 star hotels and all rooms were sold out a few months before New Year's Eve. I booked this hotel months in advance to secure a swanky Horizon Deluxe room at the 50th floor. When I checked in, service was prompt and efficient so no complains there, despite it being the busiest time of the year. A welcome drink of 2 500ml bottles were provided at the check-in counter to quench your thirst. I was provided the ocean view room in Tower 3which I did not mind but the city view rooms faced the skyline. I was going to catch the fireworks on the 57th floor at the Infinity pool anyway. The Ocean view provided views of the South China Sea, our offshore islands, the Marina Barrage and construction work of the upcoming attractions. Room: Huge, spacious, with a contemporary design and a fantastic king-sized bed with fluffy pillows. 4 complimentary bottles of 500ml were provided for guests to guzzle down. The bathroom was great with luxurious toiletries provided however a bidet or water nuzzle hose was conspiciously missing in this 5-star world class hotel. The usual safe, hair dryer, ironing board etc, slippers, radio alarm clock and robes were provided. A flat-screen TV with the usual International channels was mandatory. My only gripe was that the minibar was automated so any items removed from it would be charged to your account. There was no space to place your own drinks or food items which you would like to refrigerate... The designer tea and coffee bags (TWG and Robert Timms coffee) was a nice touch. lol. Also, the air-conditioning was automated and to conserve energy, would increase or decrease the temperature of the room whenever it wished. (I had a pretty sleepless night, tossing and turning in the heat.) Facilities included a Banyan Tree Gym and Spa as well as the famous Infinity pool and hotel guests can access the Skypark for free. The pool is amazing with to-die-for views either in the day or at night. The pool spans the tree towers and when you swim to the edge of the pool, its as if you will swim right of a cliff and plunge down with the amazing skyline view ahead of you. There are restaurants behind the pool however just like the room service menu, breakfast is pricey for $44 per pax. There are also numerous restaurants on the ground floor of the hotel and linked passageways to the Shoppes across the street. Tip: Skip the hotel breakfast and have it at the wide selection of restaurants at the linked MBS shoppes such as at the foodcourt or Coffee Beanstro. They are better worth for your money... This is so that you will save your money and shop at the luxurious designer boutiques the Shoppes is peppered with! There is complimentary airport transfer to the hotel for foreign guests however for locals, you can access the hotel (which is slightly out of the way) via a complimentary shuttle service to and fro from Marina Bay and Promenade Stations. Come 14 January, the Circle Line Bayfront MRT station (right in front of the hotel) will be in operation so public transporters rejoice!! Access to MBS, Shoppes and Casino would be MUCH more convenient.. In a nutshell, fantastic, swanky hotel with unparalled views and world-class facilities.. an a outstanding New Year treat!", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, New South Wales, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAwesome stay, few bug problems though\u201d", "Author": "Albert O", "ReviewID": "UR122387237", "Content": "Stayed at Marina Bay Sands with my family in two Deluxe Rooms for 3 nights. It took us about 10 minutes to find the reception, since the lobby was huge! (PS: free apples! :D ) Loved the room, and service and friendliness from all staff was excellent! The rooms are well equipped, and everything was automated (even the curtains were automated, which was amazing). The air conditioning in the room, which was also automated, was very confusing to work - it never reached the temperature that we set, and left us very cold (I ended up turning it off in the end). Other than the balconies of our rooms needing a sweep up, the flower bed on the balcony needing a clean up and maintenance (ours was full of litter), and the showers having a minor fly problem (didn't notice it until I looked up one time while taking a shower), the rest of the room was very clean. I had to call concierge to ask where the gym was (since it wasn't written in the hotel guide in my room). The concierge was very helpful and polite, and I found it surprisingly pleasant to be called by my name (never had a concierge address me by my name before, usually it's just \"sir\" or \"mister\"). The Skypark's pool and jacuzzi were incredible, and it's 57 storey view was amazing! The 150m pool was split into three regions, with one of the regions being adults only - perfect for privacy. Though the floor around the jacuzzi was very sandy, the place was very clean. Towels and drinks were provided. The gym in tower 2 was very well equipped - had an amazing view from the 55th storey, with a sauna, steam room and hot bath in the change rooms, as well as towels and water bottles provided! Staff in the gym were very helpful also (at first I thought there were only cardio machines, until the staff directed my attention to the weights room.. xD). The drinks at the club in Skypark were usually pricey ($30 for a Singapore Sling... the long islands that we have at the clubs in Sydney aren't even half of that price) The shopping center, which is accessible from the hotel via an underground passageway, was simply massive! It takes quite a walk to get anywhere around the shopping mall (took me at least an hour and a half to walk from one side of the mall to the other, and that was only one floor). The food court was reasonably cheap in price, and some stalls were open 24 hours - great for a midnight snack. ;D Coincidentally, I ended up staying at the same time as the Asia Music awards, and was almost stampeded by a crowd of fan girls after walking past a Korean superstar at the shopping mall... >\"< One thing about Singapore's weather - it rains (daily when i stayed). Would have been great if there was a sheltered walkway between the art+tech museum and the shopping center at Marina Bay Sands, because I was completely drenched when I got to the door of the museum, and the aircon inside the museum was on full blast - it was penguin-land! :S Overall, the place was unforgettably amazing, with surprises at every turn.

We checked in got the room and was quite tired at it was 10pm+ local time. Sofa bed was made up, called front desk explained we did not require it and preferred to use the sofa, we declined having it changed that night due to the time and requested it simply be done the next day. Sofa bed was made again next day, we called again and went to the front desk the next morning again to reconfirm that we did not want the sofa bed. Only after the service manager came to inspect the worm issue did housekeeping come to make up the sofa. Housekeeping here are absolutely sh!t... Refer to the pics, they cant even make up a sofa, they but pilliows on the back, and the sofa cushions on the armrest! Service manager didnt pick it up as well! Are we staying in hotel 81????? Also there was a used part of a tissue that definitely wasnt ours, located under the sofa bed which they didnt clean after closing the bed. Dont worry housekeeping let the customers clean it up! Baby bath issue: Not a biggie but since im at it.... Called requesting a baby bath, was told they would request one and get back to us, called quite some time later after waiting to get an update. \"sorry sir has nobody called you to tell you we dont have any available? we will put you on the waiting list\" Ammm would I be calling if somebody had told me that????? WORM ISSUE: Mrs finished having a shower, calls me in \"what are those black things?\" WTF? they are worms? (refer to pic) The floor tile grout was missing and maggot like worms were coming out. There had to be at least 20 of the critters... Was I camping it the outdoors? Went down to reception later to report the issue, they said they would attend to it. Come back later that day, and it was nice to still find some lying around. Call up and let them know what was going on and the Service Manager turns up, orders some staff to rectify the issue. Mould issue: So after all the above issues, the last night in this fabulous landmark, the Mrs decides she needs a cottonbud so opens the box in the bathroom with the stuff she needs. Wow, nice its comes full of mould complementary! This was the last night/straw, I went to see the manager who was very helpful, offered 30% off and free breakfast, she didnt want to see the video of the worms, either she has experienced the same issues before or simply was truly disgusted by the look on her face.

The architecture is immense and stupendously mind-boggling. The three towers of the hotel rise some 200 meters and are topped by an enormous 'surfiing board' formed cap with huge swimming pool, restaurants and the Club Lounge. Shuttle service from the Changi airport was quick and efficient. Checking in - we were 'Club Room' - was arduous: a wait of some 45 minutes. Our room on the 37th floor was spacious, as expected with all the usual amenities. The airco was terribly loud, and turning it off gave way to the very noisy traffic sounds from a main highway far below. Bathroom is large and has everything you need; but it's hard to take a bath because the bathtub is all 'rounded' with no place to put shampoo etc; hard to bathe without getting the entire bathroom wet. Room service of a Club Room sort (e.g. turn-down service) was non existent. Fine and quick complimentary internet (both broadband and wifi). The Club Lounge is on the roof. It is not so much a lounge as a restaurant with too many tables; views though are stupendous. Service is absolutely tops, and the spread of foods both for snacks and also the breakfast is very good. The elevators are quick and smooth, but too few for the magniftude of the hotel (2500 rooms!); and there's a curious transfer to another elevator on level 55 in order to get to the roof top. Concierge service is fine and efficient and friendly. Warning: prices for drinks and food in the entire Marina Bay area are exorbitantly and stupendously high. E.g. don't expect to get a small beer for under 8 Singapore dollars; a relatively simple one-course meal for two without drinks will set you back at least 60 Singapore dollars.

Much of this you can experience without staying at the hotel of course.

Staying in Singapore I have much better preferences in the 5 star category. Smaller hotels that have a way higher level of service, experience and a genuine Singapore hospitality. Marina Bay sounds service is cold, clinical and inexperienced. The line to check-in was in the main thoroughfare - not in a reception lobby, and it felt more like waiting in line for a low cost flight. There were 40 people ahead of me and it took well over 60 minutes. Totally unacceptable. The rooms are modern 5 star standard. The roof top pool is of course magic, but its crowded with the hundreds of people staying here. Compared to las vegas this hotel is lacking in facilites for the volume of people staying here. I loved the Titanic exhibit at the museum, but of course I didn't need to stay at the hotel to attend. The shopping mall is nice, but ridiculously overpriced. The hotel is off the beaten track, so to speak and I would rather have a hotel in another area that offered easier access to other attractions. The MRT subway in Singapore is one of the worlds best, but no station at/near the hotel. So who is this hotel attracting? People like me who will stay 1 night just to see and a few international visitors. It's main future is the Asian gambler and that's really who they are after.

I saw many guests standing in the line and insisting for a city facing room, even though they did not book the city view guarantee room! They would just not ate no for an answer and would instead raise their voice and create a fuss. This obviously was very irritating for us, as we had booked for a guarantee room by paying extra and were standing in line behind people who didn't! 4. Be nice to people and they will return the favor. We only ever saw extremely polite and friendly staff everywhere. Even the security officers left their posts to help us find our way.

Following the queue, well mannered service staff ask if we are checking in or out, about our room category, and told us to prepare our passport, reservation letter and relevant documents. He then led us to a shorter queue. Other staff came by and offered us some bottled mineral while we are waiting. about 20mins or so, we reach the counter staff. As she checked our reservation, she told us that only room for level 2 is ready. i made a reservation for grand horizon room, and you assigned to me a level 2 room? i believe you are famous for the \"view\" and \"service\".... and that is what i paid for? She told us, if we want a higher floor rooms, she can make arrangements and room will be ready by 4pm, and she will call to us. 4.30pm and nobody calls, we rejoin the LONG queue again. she apologize for the inconvenience and for that, she will compensate us with late checkout. now i understand, the roll over effect all the guest had resulted in such a mess in the lobby and reception. finally i got my room key, but it led me a to WRONG tower. instead of Tower 2, receptionist had asked me to go to Tower 1. I approached a chinese house keeping lady, which has no idea where my room was. after some hassle. we found out room, and worst to come. we entered our room, and we had a feeling that \"somebody\" is still inside. the room is not kept properly, with the room card still inserted, rubbish, half drank bottled water. I made a complaint to the \"express service line\" but nobody appeared in 20mins. i called them again and i told them, i will leave the room now and we expect someone to housekeep it when we return. This place is over crowded anyway. if you had heard about the infinite pool, so many people is there already. they had some crowd control measures, which i feel they had done a good job already. you should experience the beautiful view from the pool and enjoy the afternoon or evening there. Ku De Ta, must go! and you don't have to pay cover charge if you enter early. Finally, we are satisfied about the room condition. I must say the room is well equipped with all necessities and all the equipments are in good condition. the curtains are power controlled, big TV, comfortable sofa and bed. and very spacious in the Grand room. We had a good undisturbed good night rest and morning service as our request. view from my \"city-skyline view\" at 22nd floor is not great at all. i did paid for extra to get a good view, but its not what i expected. Buffet breakfast was included in our stay package and RISE is huge and overcrowded. they have a wide spread of international buffet breakfast and good quality food. Generous with their servings, so please ask for smaller portion if they serve it to you. seats turn around pretty fast so you dont have wait long to get a place for your breakfast. We did express checkout at 2pm (by dropping the keys and filled in some forms) because of the long queue at the reception. i hope they don't make a mess out of my credit card bill later. i worry because they charged a higher sum on my credit card during my check in. Generally, service staff is very polite and patient (despite the continuous non stop crowd they have to handle) but i must say they can be more efficient, or they need to employ more to handle the huge crowd. Its only the waiting time that is really bad and MUST be improved immediately. sorry, but i have to say this is not what i paid for. i will not recommend anyone to here for business trip or vacation stay.

There was a pool table, a dining table, 3 large tv in the room. It is the kind of place you could have a party in. However, because we weren't in Singapore to laze in our room, it was a bit of a waste on us. Also the entire room smelt strongly of smoke. The Cons 1. Check in was slow. The staff must have been aware of this and did come around serving drinks while we were in line. But the entire process still took almost 1 hour. 2. The atmosphere. There was something just lacking in the atmosphere. Coming back to the hotel never felt like a relaxing part of the day because of the amount of people constantly around the place. 3.

The rooms are very spacious and and it provided a lot of room for my niece and nephew to run around.

Thankfully, it never poured heavily during our stay but the pool can get really cold whether its day or night. The view is fantastic especially at night. The only complain, if there is any, is there are just too many people up there. But then, MBS is such an iconic building and it is no doubt it is so popular with tourists and locals alike. We were glad to have booked the Club room as that meant taking most of our meals at The Club on 57th floor. The service was very good and attentive, and at least it was not crowded as opposed to the Rise at the lobby. The wait staff were very attentive to our needs and knowing that it is our 1st meal of the day, they promptly whipped out colouring papers and crayons for the 2 little ones. That gave us some peace to have our meals! It was a very good experience for our family, and I'd like to add that when vacationing, do take things in your stride and you will find that things will turn out beautifully, and we should not allow minor hiccups to ruin our holiday.

I also partook of the chocolate buffet and out of the 26 of 57 items I had, only one I thought was bad, the mini chocolate donut was tough and unchewable, otherwise they were all good and their buffet is cheaper than the Fullerton's chocolate buffet and has more items. The room itself I was probably least impressed with. While it was nice enough it was lacking the wow factor. I booked the lowest level room but being a 5 star hotel I was still expecting a separate tub and shower and separate toilet. It was a bit small. My room was on the 9th floor facing the highway and the traffic noise was extremely loud. Since it's a new hotel I would have expected more steps taken to soundproof the room as much as possible. I would not stay on that side again unless it was a very high floor, or better yet get a room facing the city and bay. It was satisfactory overall but I wish they had made the base rooms a bit more impressive as with other Sands resorts like Venetian Las Vegas and use triple pane glass or soemthing to minimize the traffic noise.

We also waited for our bags for over an hour and it wasn't until I called to find out where they were that they eventually arrived. The pool is quite spectacular but unfortunately, we were already looking forward to leaving. We had ordered room service for breakfast as we were going on tours that day, but even though it turned up on time, it was quite cold. Maybe MBS could look at not putting hot food on cold plates then onto a cold steel box? When we went to check out, we thought about doing the express check out but thought better check the bill & i'm glad we did. They tried to charge us for the extra night that we had already paid for months ago but took it off when I showed the receptionist our tickets. That was the final straw in 3 nights of incompetency from Marina Bay Sands. To finish with, we would never stay there again.

The rooms are very good and I had an excellent view of Singapore from the 37th floor. The infinity pool is quite amazing. However, while some staff provide good service, others don't and this might be due to the newness of the hotel. The check in girl at Tower 1 that I had at first was stressed for whatever reason and couldn't find my reservation after several variations on my name - she didn't even offer me a room after I said I would go over to the Ritz Carlton instead. I then went down to Tower 3 check in where the girl did find my reservation eventually. The service at breakfast is where the problems are - tables not cleared, coffee not replenished, etc and that was consistant over 5 days. The main thing they wanted to do was to give you the $44 bill for the delights of the breakfast. There are quite big queues at times both at check-in and check-out. As you would expect the prices in the hotel reflect the 5* status so do beware of the bill for your late night drink in the bar where, by the way, the service is very good.

Note that there are there are three check-in counters (one at the base of each tower) and one ginormously long lobby. My room was on the 9th floor of Tower 3 and faced the harbor and the large construction area for the future Marina Bay gardens and it was noisy. The glass is NOT soundproof, so if you're a light sleeper down for an afternoon nap then you will not sleep well. The room and bathroom was clean, but smaller than I expected. There is one sink, a large shower, and no bathtub. The wallpaper in the bathroom was already peeling, the carpet was stained and dirty in many spots, and there was graffit on the desktop. For being a relatively new hotel at $300 a night you'd think that the rooms would be slightly bigger and kept in better condition. However, it is clean, comes with the usual toiletries along with two complimentary bottles of water everyday, the bed is comfortable, the tv had good reception with lots of channels (including HBO), and there is free wifi. The main attraction of this property is the pool and it is FABULOUS. There are plenty of lounge chairs throughout the day. The pool opens at 6.00am and closes at 11.00pm (it will also close when there is lightening). If you don't want to be in the sun then go before noon where the lounge chairs in the 2nd row are shaded. If you're a sun worshipper then go anytime during the day, especially in the afternoon. The water is pleasant and the lifeguards and pool attendants are friendly and helpful. I wanted to get a massage at the Banyan Tree Spa (55th floor of Tower 1) but there were no available spots. =( The mall has plenty of high end stores and a really good moderately priced foodcourt. The hotel does NOT offer a free ferry for guests (they should) to the Merlion. You can walk there in approximately 15 minutes, take a cab for about $5 SGD each way, or take the water taxi for $4 SGD each way. You can catch the water taxi by the museum entrance (the building that looks like a flower) and it's a 6-8 minute ride to the other side. While the hotel does not have a free water taxi for guests, it does have a free shuttle service from the airport (guests only) and to/from Promenade and Marina Bay MRT Stations (general public).

The room rate includes access to the famous Skypark, offering visitors a 360-degree view of the entire city. This is a must-see! Our reservation included the sumptuous buffet breakfast at the Rise restaurant located in the lobby area. You will not need lunch after that and there is such a wide variety of choices that you will not even get to half of what they offer. It was a great way to start each day. We ate at several of the restaurants of the celebrity chefs who have opened popular outposts there in the Shopping Center that is accessible via the hotel's two underpasses; Pizzeria Mozza (Mario Batali), HY California (Hide Yamamoto), and db Bistro Moderne (Daniel Boulud). All were delicious with great service throughout. We also had an inexpensive, lunch at the hawker-style stalls on the lowest level of the huge shopping area. Not bad for hawker food, but Singapore's REAL hawker stands offer better (and more authentic) food. We spent some time window shopping - how so many high-end watchmakers can be profitable is beyond me. The casino is a big draw, especially for the Japanese and Korean visitors. There are two levels - the very large lower level allows smoking so that even if you opt for gambling upstairs on the \"nonsmoking\" level, that smoke will wafts its way up. Annoying to us nonsmokers. The futuristic new ArtScience Museum is a five minute walk away--easily accessible from the Shipping Centre--and is well worth a visit. We saw the current exhibit on the Titanic and found it fascinating Checking in took a few minutes, but the staff passed out glasses of fruit juices and water -- a nice touch that made the wait actually pleasant, Checking out took a minute or less.

The other roof top had view of the Singapore Flyer and it looks awesome at night with lights on. You can also view the lighted Maritime Museum which looks like a flower. The gym is located on 55th floor and can be accessed from roof top (57th fl) in the middle lifts. The changing room (ladies) has sauna, steam bath and hot tub. Green apples are free to eat and can be consumed at the rest area in the gym with the pier view (beautiful view of ships docked there). Opens from 7am till 10pm. The shopping is awesome.

Double glazed glass meant that you couldn't hear the major highway that is on the hotel's doorstep and you couldn't even see it from the room unless you step out onto the balcony. The rooms are well utilized and there were some signs of wear and tear on the furniture, but nothing extreme. I would say that the room compares favorably with both the Ritz Carlton and the Hyatt Hotel with not much to choose between them. The high traffic at the hotel/casino complex means that there is a good flow of taxis, although there was still a bit of a wait at peak times and when it rained. However, I felt that it was marginally better than when I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton and the Hyatt.

I was unable to see from where I was whether a service staff did unknowingly serve her a portion of it but the very thought that this was brought in and presented at that table was somewhat insensitive.

My expectations were too high, but it turned out not as good as I was expected. And it started on check-in\u2026what a mess! Not proper of a 5 star hotel! First, the hotel was overbooking, we checked in at 8 pm and there were no room available for us and for our friends. We had reservations confirmed by a travel agency voucher, so they had to give us a room. And we had a small and simple room, not worthy a 390 \u20ac room we paid. My friends had a memorable experience, once in a life, and we shared it with them \u2013 a night in Presidential Suite. UAUH! But on my normal experience, after a hard check in, we were totally getting alone to go to our Tower room. No one lead us to the room. The hotel was so big and we had to ask everyone where is the Tower 3 and how to get on the lift. Finally, we get by ourselves with 2 kids to the room. Of course, on the morning, we didn\u2019t know where to have breakfast, so needed to search it again. Breakfast was so crowded, with lot of people, lot of noise and too messy for us. There was plenty of food and for all kinds of tasty, but it was not a relaxing and enjoying meal. The skypark, the infinity pool and the Ku De Ta restaurant bar saved our day in Marina Bay Sands. When we went upstairs, we where completely amazed with that view, that we forgot the others experiences. We spend the morning on that fabulous pool, enjoying ourselves, and the lunch a snack on the KU DE TA. The rest of the day was wonderful! At night we had a truly trouble to get on our transfer. The hotel doesn\u2019t have a proper lobby. It doesn\u2019t have a place for people wait for their pickup. It\u2019s a chaos! My kids where tired and they didn\u2019t had a chair to seat, they had to seat on the floor while waiting for transfer. And most of the people must wait standing on the lobby. There was no information about the busses arrivals area, and we were waiting for a long time for our bus, getting stressed because it didn\u2019t shown up and then It was waiting for us on their underground area. So, too crowed and tourist hotel. No information and no personal attention to its guests.

We made a special trip through Singapore to be able to stay at the hotel for one night and were not disappointed. Being honest, I was worried about our staying at the hotel because of so many varying and negative reviews on TA. Having been to Las Vegas, I expected the Marina Bay Sands to be a mega hotel and lines just like Vegas and was not expecting a 6 star experience like many properties in Singapore are known for. There are crowds and lines are real but that is what one gets with a mega casino property. However, the service was much better than one finds in Las Vegas or Macau and much better than I expected based on previous reviews. As for the hotel itself, it was amazing. We booked a club room with a city view. The shuttle from the airport to hotel was very easy and efficient. With a club room one can check-in at the VIP lounge which took no time at all. We did arrive early and our room was not available. It gave us a chance to go over and experience the Singapore Flyer and explore the mega mall attached to the hotel and casino. The room was very large and the bathroom had lots of space and nice amenities. I read others complaining about wear and tear. However at least in our club room it was in pristine condition and it felt new. The club lounge was wonderful and well worth the upgrade. The staff was very friendly and learned your name immediately. The breakfast was extensive and very good. The setting for evening drinks was perfect. Like others have shared the pool and sky park is an architectural wonder that must be seen. It was crowded but we loved being able to swim with the city skyline in view.

At check-out time it is utter chaos and just trying to leave the hotel takes much longer than it should.

Make no mistake: it is not a business hotel. The \"integrated resort\" functions in two ways: first, thanks to its vast offering of shops, entertainment and dining, plus its flashy architecture, it attracts large numbers of visitors; second, its 2,500 rooms can process a commensurate number of guests; the ultimate objective is to channel the masses into the casino floor, where MBS draws the bulk of its considerable revenue; the rooms can be priced very reasonably. The level of service derives from this business model. If you are a gambling VIP, I have no doubt that it must be excellent. If not, you will be competently handled, together with a few thousand others, but should not expect personal attention because the staff has no time and is not trained for it. Check-in and check-out, in particular, entail waiting in long lines. The standard rooms are modern, average in size, not particularly luxurious. The quality of the materials appears average, not sure how they will age. Bathrooms are OK, not over the top. Room service is slow and not very responsive. The views are spectacular if facing North (city skyline), boring if facing South (construction works). The most famous part of the hotel is the skypark, with its star attractions the infinity pool and the lounge/restaurant/bar Ku De Ta. The pool, reserved for hotel guests, is impressive, but one has to be prepared to swim under the gaze of the endless crowd of visitors. Ku De Ta is ostentatiously hip, but again too crowded and touristy to be really cool. Location is so-so. With so much entertainment on-site, one can easily stay in the resort and not need to go out - after all, that is the whole concept. No other attraction or point of interest is within walking distance, although that may change in the future, as the new Marina Bay CBD develops.

This constituted actually my second stay at this enormously sized property, and both times I was offered an overall very good hotel experience. While staying at a sufficiently sized, nicely appointed room with a sea view on my first stay, this time I was able to reserve an even bigger room with a city view on a high level at Tower 3. The fabulous view offered to me upon entering my room was definitively not comparable to any other hotel experience in Singapore. If you are fond of spectacular vistas, you will love the panoramas offered from your room windows during the day, but you will be completely 'gobsmacked' at night. Yes, it is simply breathtaking, and when taking the lift to the sky park and sipping a drink at the pool it get's even better since you are able to enjoy the Singapore skyline in an outdoors setting from the incredible height of the sky park platfom. There is just nothing like it anywhere else in the world, and at times the whole experience appears to be almost surreal - in a very good way. The Deluxe room I stayed in was in itself very spacious and nicely furnished - with great beds, ample closet space and a very nice bathroom. I don't mind not having a bathtub available and therefore being given a bigger shower cubicle, and the open design of the bathroom (with a very large sliding door to the hallway) was completely to my liking. The room was also kept very clean, and the AC was working well and absolutely sufficient. There were also no issues with the huge flatscreen TV set and the rest of the hardware (i.e. phone systems, personal safe, hair dryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board etc). I ordered room service once, and even though this came at a cost the quality was great and the service quite satisfactory. I also used the dry cleaning service, and found it to be reliable and of good quality (again, this of course does come at a premium price). During my whole stay I never encountered any problems as mentioned by other reviewers before with respect to malfunctioning room key cards or unsatisfactory service levels. Don't get me wrong: the Marina Bay Sands is a huge property and vastly popular with tourists from all over Asia and the rest of the world. Thus, one cannot expect a 'cozy and intricate' boutique hotel styled experience. The place is definitively mega busy at almost all times of the day, and this is in my point of view actually to be expected from a hotel offering thousands of rooms and running at full capacity almost all the time. Therefore, in my opinion one simply has to accept that there will be queues at certain key areas like the check in counters or breakfast restaurants as well as throngs of people being served at the same time during peak hours. And yes, sometimes it does take longer to secure a taxi - but it never was a really serious problem in my experience, and the staff is actually quite efficient in handling the sometimes very large numbers of people populating the property. Nevertheless, if one does look for a cozy, small style hotel experience - the MBS simply is not going to be able to match this expectation level. Having said that though, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the MBS hotel, always slept well and had got a good rest at my room. I certainly felt that the rooms offered a luxury experience, and an overall very pleasant hotel stay.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Lansing, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWorld Orchid Conference Visitor\u201d", "Author": "Doris A", "ReviewID": "UR120735909", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay in this amazing facility -- thoroughly.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cGreat (huge) place, worth a visit\u201d", "Author": "Wimster", "ReviewID": "UR120735748", "Content": "Of course a special place to stay, very luxurious.

Service there was horrendous. 1) I was in the lift and asked a hotel staff if I was in the right tower, he told me he doesnt work in the hotel department and asked me to ask someone else. 2) Next, I tried to get some laundry done. Someone came to my room to pick it up. I asked her how to pay for it and she completely didn't understand what I was saying. Eventually she just shaked her head and left. 3) The WORST experience I had was with the concierge. It was a Sunday night and it was pouring outside. The queue for the taxi stand was too long and I was running late for a meeting. I asked the concierge if he could book me a taxi urgently. He tried for about 2 minutes and then he got back to me saying he couldnt get through to the taxi company and suggested I wait in line. The gentleman was wearing Les Clef d'Or (the Golden Keys) on his jacket lapels. It is my understanding that this is the pinnacle of service standards. Those who wear the golden keys are generally able to achieve the impossible, but yet he was unable to book me a taxi! I was utterly disappointed. The concierge definitely does not deserve to wear the golden keys, it is an absolute disgrace! In the end I had to run out to the main street in the rain wearing a suit and carrying my luggage. By the time I reached my destination, I was drenched and sweating profusely and very late. I strongly recommend the Ritz Carlton to anyone looking for better service.

Best surprise - when asking for a late checkout was offered 2pm, which was super convenient. What's the downside? It costs more than other 5* hotels in Singapore. And with 2600 rooms at times you will feel a bit like a number at times. Don't be expecting a boutique hotel experience! Also the hotel is in the Marina area so you won't be walking into the city, but hey, there is no need to - everything you need is on site.

Where to start? We arrived too early for check in, and wanted to refresh ourselves and store our bags. The hotel has a courtesy suite open to guests to shower, and rest. Although this is a shared space, I found it extremely handy to shower and change after a very, very long flight from Dallas. Once refreshed, we went and explored the hotel. On the top of the hotel, there is a deck that connects all three towers. On this deck is an amazing infinity pool, with waterfalls, that reached to the edge of the terrace. There are restaurants and bars. There are lounging areas, and amazing 360 views of Singapore and the sea. After enjoying a drink and the view from the top, we checked into our rooms. The service at this hotel is top notch, all the service people we encountered were friendly and accommodating. My room was in tower one, the rest of my work mates were in tower three. My room was huge---one wall of windows that had a terrific view of the bay. The room was soundproofed, the bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom grand to say the least. I had this raised, oval shaped tub, a marble shower, all the amenities one needs to do business or relax, including plush robes. Breakfast in Rise restaurant was a huge all you can eat selection, Western and Eastern favorites. For dinner, I was fortunate to eat at one of the best restaurants in the world --Ku De Ta, which is also conveniently located at the top of this hotel. A spectacular meal. A colleague of mine was amazed at the early morning yoga classes held in the fitness center, with views of the rising sun. A tour of this fitness center revealed state of the art equipment, as well as hot tubs and saunas.

My experience has been consistently the same and sadly a disappointment. About a week prior to arriving I phoned the hotel to merge two separate booking for our two night stay. One was made by my work and the other by me over the internet. When I phoned to ask to merge the two in their system I was told they couldn't find one of them and to call back each day to get the issue solved. I would have expected the customer service officer to take my details, sort it out and email me the outcome. Not on your life would they do that level of 5 star service! Next we arrived around 9:50 pm on Wednesday night. There was a whole bunch of people at the check in counter with little movement. Many seemed to have been there a while. We soon understood why as we waited for an hour to check in. I have never seen such a slow and completely non functioning process at work in a hotel check in. You would think that all persons had pre-booked, it should take little time to process them into a room. In the meantime the lack of organised queues saw people come along a push into the front of the queue, quite often with assistance from hotel staff. This was really annoying so late at night after a long flight. Next we checked in during which time we asked for a city view room. We were told there weren't any and that we could move to one the next day if we would come down to see the same customer service officer. I asked her to do it for us and call us to pick-up the key when ready and she refused and insisted we make time to go down and do it from scratch the next day. Poor service and I am getting the impression their system is very poor and causing the issues around checking in and out and does not facilitate servicing customers needs. Anyway, after going up to our room at close to 11pm at night, we found the card did not work and we couldn't get into the room. Back down to the reception to queue up again and get a new card made to try again. Then we entered the room and found it to be unusually small for a 47 sq m room as a lot of space was wasted at the front door. Next day we came back to our room and found the room key card didn't work again. Back to the reception and the queue. After enduring more pushing in we got a new card and entered the room. Then we went for a swim in the rooftop pool (very shallow 1.2m depth). Coming down we found the key didn't work in the lift. At 9:30pm we were forced to go down to the reception again to get a new key made. Excuses given were that the keys are really sensitive, although ours had only made contact with a towel. We went up to the room to find it didn't work. Back down to reception and a new key was made. This time the key worked. During my last stay in September with a colleague we both had similar issues with delayed check in and out times and key malfunctioning. It has got worse on this stay. Despite apologies no one really cares, just hot air. Given the money charged is for a 5 star hotel stay, we wont be using this property again.

My husband ended up going back down to the front desk to retrieve it himself! Not a great start. But I have to say we arrived very early at 9am not expecting to get into our room until at least 2/3pm but to our surprise we were in by 11am and we had temporary passes to the sky park in the meantime so we could access the pool. We were in tower 3 and our rooms were very nice, although typical hotel style decor. One of the cool things were that the drapes opened and closed when you placed your card in the slot. The only other problem was the very long wait for check-in and check-out so leave plenty of time to allow you to get to the airport. This really needs addressing. We loved the fact that there were plenty of staff and security around the towers and up at the sky park, which is out of this world. My father was also treated very well, being an elderly gentlemen and service by the pool was very good. We used to sit there with our lovely thick toweling robes on during sunset before getting ready to go out to dinner as the cool temperature of the water and nightly breeze.

Breakfast time was a feast with fabulous dishes from around the world, great coffee, pastries and basically everything you could wish for.

It just does not keep up with similarly priced properties elsewhere at all. You'll only go for the huge infinity pool. The good: The pool, obviously. Simply stunning! The view from the rooms is nice. Get a city view room and watch the bay area light up at night. The rooms are medium-sized and comfortable. Good but nothing special. Service is friendly and helpful. The gym is excellent. Lots of machines, a large number of dumbells and weights stacks in the weight room, separate cardio room, spacious and with a great view. 5* all the way. The bad: The breakfast buffet is very small compared to other hotels in this price range. Not worth the 45 SGD. The door to my room did not always close by itself, I had to pull it several times because the lock did not click and it could be pushed open without a key. The aircon is very loud. The shower setting is mostly hot. You turn the knob a mile, then it goes very quickly to ice-cold. Not a huge problem, but again, not up to the standard the hotel wants to set. There are crowds of tourists in the lobby and the sheer size of the hotel with the casino and mall attached make it feel too much like a cash-cow and less like a luxury hotel. You need to switch elevators to get from the lower level rooms to the rooftop. The gym is in tower two, the spa in tower one. If you're not in those towers, you have to go down to the lobby and back up. No coffee machine in the room, just a kettle. Room service menu is the usual club sandwiches and chicken satay, a bit boring. The ugly: I just paid 600 bucks for a room and internet costs extra, in this day and age. Are you kidding me?

The service was fine, but it was delivered without any warmth by people who know they will never see you again. You will get better and cheaper food from the food courts in the mall across the street, and even better and even cheaper if you just head for the Chinese, Malay or Indian Villages of the city proper. There are all easily reached via the MRT (subway) The food at the breakfast buffet is slightly above average. Again, it checks all the boxes but the dining areas are in the enormous lobby, with all the warmth and intimacy of an airport departure lounge. The experience was similarly soulless and anonymous, and as such, not enjoyable. The prices alone put me off room service, and off of the other smaller restaurants in the hotel proper. I ended up avoiding them all and instead walking over to the mall which has just about every kind of eating experience imaginable - steak houses, pizzas, French (althoughj I am not sure why one would go to Singapore for French cuisine) ,a local mini mart and an enormous Asian food court with good food at reasonable prices The view from the rooftop infinity pool is very impressive, just like in the brochure. Instead of paying the room rate, for S$20.00, you can buy a pass which will get you in. It is popular and very crowded, like any outdoor venue in Singapore. It is the view that makes it unique. As a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Marina Bay Sands is worth it for 2 or 3 days, max. But If you want to really experience Singapore, stay somewhere in the city. There is really nothing else in that part of Singapore aside from a small museum, a convention center and lots of construction. It may be nice someday. The problem is that the really interesting and historical parts of Singapore are 15 to 45 minutes away by taxi. The MRT (subway) is a 15 minute walk over the DNA bridge. An interesting experience . once. It is all very impressive at first glance. Having sampled it once. I will find a quieter, more genuinely Asian hotel the next time. If you do stay at the Marina Bay Sands, get an MRT pass, as you will be riding it frequently. The MRT is really cheap, modern, fast and efficient and is spotlessly clean and safe. Taxis are also inexpensive .for taxis. Traffic moves well. Despite the anonymity of the Marina Bay Sands. Singapore is worth visiting. There are few cities in the world that are more safe, more clean or more easy to get around. The well-known sites: The zoo, the botanical gardens, Sentosa Island and the Bird Park all definitely live up to their reputation. It is a very good place to combine a business and family vacation. I did just that, and was glad. If you get an opportunity to visit Singapore, by all means go.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorth a stay...once.\u201d", "Author": "Ravenlt21", "ReviewID": "UR120226635", "Content": "My husband had a business conference at the Marina Bay Sands, and I made the trip with him. The hotel is definitely something to see, between the casino, the shopping mall, the restaurants, and the skypark. The views from the skypark on the 5th floor are amazing, and the restaurant choices are varied. It was evident to us during our stay that the hotel has become a tourist hot spot. So while we were not responsible for the room costs, we are glad to have had the opportunity to stay at the Marina Bay. That being said, if we are fortunate enough to return to Singapore, we will likely choose a different, more quaint, hotel rather than paying the high prices for this extremely busy hotel. We were in a basic room on the 6th floor with a very disappointing view and next to an extremely busy highway (even at 4am). The rooms were decent-sized and relatively clean, though it was very late in the afternoon before our room was cleaned several days. The breakfast service did not meet expectations and the \"hot\" food often cold. At 35 SGD (I believe), the breakfast was way overpriced. I also sat by the pool one day for over and hour before I was ever greeted by the pool attendants. And at the point, I had to ask for a menu myself. That being said, the service in the other hotel lobby restaurants were much better, and we found the concierge service to be exceptional. I did use the spa and found the service and rooms to be very nice and even exceeded expectations. You do pay dearly though, as a 90 minute massage was 300 SGD. On the other hand, the fitness center was very nice and complimentary to guests. So, while it will likely not be our choice going forward, there were parts of our stay that we very much enjoyed, and we would recommend anyone to stay at Marina Bay Sands once.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWorth the experience\u201d", "Author": "2travelwell2", "ReviewID": "UR120201629", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands as a special treat for one night.

And I was lucky enough to get a room here during the event. It's a big integrated complex. Hectic all around, buses, people, bag trolleys. Mostly foreigners. It was peak season with the event plus the school holiday. The hotel has 3 towers. Conveniently, you can check in at any lobby, without hassle. The room was spacious with premium brand amenities. You can even check the room bill via the online TV. To get to the top, you need to transit to another elevator. The observation deck has its own opening hours. It was closed when I went there. So, I just plunged into the pool and jacuzzi. Each with its own view of S'pore. From here you can see the massive expansion the country is undergoing. Most S'poreans won't stay here for the view, since they are already living in apartments. The breakfast restaurant was surprisingly small comparing to the hotel size (and number of guests). But most of the S'pore hotel deals, early bite was an optional addition. So, breakfast time wasn't crowded. There's a counter to experience driving a Ferrari, if one needs an adrenaline rush. A casino at the basement floor, if you're feeling lucky. Also, a Venetian-like boat ride, for a romantic cruise. The flyer (also a center for a number of tourist attractions) is within walking distance, about 10 minutes away. Too bad there is no near MRT station. You need to hop on a bus, first.

We took our time to arrive after normal check-out hours at about 2 plus. Super long queue at the reception. No drinks, cold towels or refreshments were served when we arrive. THe queue system is not well managed, they put in stancion ropes but the people, having waited so long, jumped queue once a counter is available regardless whether the queue was for check-in or out. No bell service once I got off the car, had to pull my luggage in myself though thankfully it was only a small weekend bag. Finally met the concierge at the lobby who asked me what I was planning to do. I said to check-in, he said check-in is at 3pm, no check-in allowed now. I told him I do at least have the right to register myself so they know I've arrived. With that he walked off and did not even offer to take my bag. Finally got our room at level 26, city view. Fantastic view of the city across Singapore river, night lights are even more spectacular. Room is large, beds are comfy, TV screen is large too. Bathroom separate shower and bath, though the hot water is kind of hard to control. Kept pressing the red button and turining but to no avail. Aircon was not cold enough for me, but that's a small matter. I do not recommend you touch the minibar if you don't have a habit of using it as it's an electronic system where items you remove will be automatically charged to your room. So forget about using the mini-fridge to store your own stuff. Which is quite a shame really. They do provide ice (2 times free per stay, 3rd time chargeable) so you can still get your own cold drinks. Anyway, the highlight of this hotel has to be the roof. THe sky deck features an long infinity pool overlooking the city. Jacuzzis on the other side faces the open sea dotted with tankers. Weather was great with cool breeze from the sea-side blowing in. I took the swim at night (seems like everyone decided to swim at night as the jacuzzis were full) as the pool closes at 11 pm (great!). Swimming at night looking at the night sky close up is therapeutic. THough I did get a rather uncomfortable feeling with the lifeguards sitting by the poolside, who seemed to be leering at the girls in bikinis, but that's just me. There are 3 outlets at the Sky Deck, the pool bar with very few outdoor seating and glass partitions around blocks out the breeze so it can get a little stuffy, Ku De Ta, some funky bar/tapas outlet, and The Club, but that is only for VIP guests. DId not have breakfast as my room rate did not include it, but it was at the lobby area where a million Chinese tourists/ guests/ outside visitors walk past so don't go looking for anything ultra exclusive despite the price you paid. Checkout was terrible as the queue was so long. I had already requested for a copy of the bill prior to checkout and all I needed to do was pay but they kept telling me the system was down, please wait. I also kept telling them I already have a copy of the bill so they just need to charge me, if they should find any incidentals after they can email me as they already have a copy of my credit card. Took a lot of convincing before they allow me to approach the counter. It was overall an enjoyable stay hence the 4-star but I was quite disappointed with the service especially coming from a hotel background myself. On another note, I left something in the room and contacted them after and was pleasantly surprised by the operator who handled my lost & found report, she was efficient and courteous. NOt all is lost, perhaps just more training for the staff since the hotel is massive with so many operational issues to look into.

The room was spacious and there was a welcome plate of fruits and chocolate. Did not touch the mini fridge after reading the comments here on TripAdvisor. Mattress was very comfortable and pillows were just the right amount of firmness. Bathroom and toilet was clean and everything working properly. We did not have breakfast as part of the room package but no problems finding food in Singapore at anytime. Underpass to the MBS shopping mall made it easy to walk around but the main lobby at Tower 1 does not appear to be properly designed to cope with the large volume of traffic that consisted mainly of taxis and buses. The few times that we took taxis to and from the hotel the drivers would complain about the poor traffic flow at the main lobby. The restaurants located at the base of each tower appear to be crowded most of the time but prices are rather steep. Considering the hotel I guess it can't be helped but walk a short distance to the mall and there are loads of restaurants, fast food joints and a food court to choose from. The sky garden at 57th floor is an obvious draw. We gained access by using the hotel room key card and once inside the infinity pool was the centre piece of the place overlooking Marina Bay and the city. There's also a jacuzzi opposite the pool with an amazing view of the sea.Went up at around 4PM and the pool was relatively empty. Service was good and the staff seem to be struggling at times due to the sheer number of guests and visitors but the effort is there.

The beds were very comfortable, the work desk was a good size, there was ample storage for clothes (quite rare in hotel rooms nowadays) and a large, beautiful bathroom, one of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen!

The staff on duty were all friendly and helpful and there were lots of loungers although they are a bit close together and don't have much shade. If you want to avoid the sun just head to the other side where there are lots of trees and shaded areas where you can relax and enjoy the sea breezes. The gym in Tower 2 is fantastic and has to be one of the best-equipped hotel gyms in the world! The hotel lobby is spectacular with some amazing artwork- a real visual treat and there seems to be a good selection of restaurants as well as a nice coffee/pastry shop with a good selection if you don't feel like a restaurant breakfast. The access to the Marina Bay Sands shops is very easy, there are lots of taxis available and the whole place is very well-designed. We ate at Mario Batali's Pizzeria Mozza which was excellent and we also loved the selection of food at the Rasapura Masters foodcourt in the basement near the skating rink. We saw a production of The Lion King at the Sands Theatre and it was a wonderful evening at the theatre. We were very impressed with the Marina Bay Sands and would definitely go back- perhaps it isn't perfect but it seems to be very well-run for a hotel with almost 3000 rooms.

All the bad reviews are true! 1. CHECK-IN IS NOT A BREEZE In fact, it was such a chore! We already arrived late in the hopes that lines would be more manageable but we clearly thought wrong. The only positive thing about waiting in line was the availability of free refreshments. 2. NOT SO FRIENDLY SERVICE One would think that after making us wait in line for about 30 minutes, the check-in staff would be more pleasant or accommodating but this was also not the case. Every request we had regarding room preference was turned down and we even got the convention center as our view. 3. AVERAGE ROOM Considering the grandeur of Marina Bay Sands, the room was a bit of a letdown. Granted that size of room was bigger than most Singapore hotels, the room looked generic and lacked character. Beds were small too. Also, much to our dismay, we were not even informed that we were billeted in a handicapped room! I would not have griped about this if not for the fact that the bathroom flooded every time anyone took a shower. 4. THE SHOPPES = ZZZ While I was at The Shoppes, I felt like I was walking inside a museum instead of being in the middle of a shopping area. Not much activity at The Shoppes and stores are not unique either. 5. SO-SO BREAKFAST EXPERIENCE As if lining up during check-in was not enough, one also has to queue just to have breakfast. To be fair, there are no lines before 8 a.m. Also, there's another restaurant option at a different tower but food selection is rather limited. At Rise, food selection was not bad and buffet tables were replenished fast, but it has to be said that the food was ordinary. It missed the chance to showcase the good in Singapore cooking. But I forgot all my issues about the hotel when I went up the pool area... If only for the opportunity to swim at the magnificent infinity pool, I strongly encourage everyone to stay at Marina Bay Sands. The moment I saw the view from the pool platform, I finally understood why a lot of people are willing to put up with the less than stellar service one gets at Marina Bay Sands. Swimming at the infinity pool is an experience like no other and it's an experience that I would gladly share with anyone who cares to listen.

Not sure how they took my suggestion of a segway to get around the huge lobby floor...but I was just trying to be helpful The bad points: it is a bit of a walk to the rest of Singapore via the bridge, it is really huge (I mean you can take 20 minutes to get to breakfast if you are at the top of Tower 3 and want to eat at Rise at the base of Tower 1), the queues to checkin, checkout and for breakfast can be annoying and if you want a lounger by the pool on a Saturday get there early. The internet: these rooms are expensive so why does the hotel insist on charging for wifi even in public areas when other Singapore hotels do not? I found free internet in the malls and in other hotel lobbies so this tended to drive me out of the Marina Bay Sands early in the day and I never returned till late. Also this hotel is a public attraction so expect to share the queue for breakfast, for the pool and for the elevators with the bulk of the Singapore public looking for the next great thing to do (alongside shopping and eating). The hotel needs to adopt some guest only elevators and guest queues for breakfast, but I guess that might be seen as discriminatory. Lastly when you rent a room here don't even bother to open the fridge to put a beer, bottle of wine or a single piece of fruit in it. The fridge is full of MBS property, beers, water, chocolate etc. And if you touch anything in the fridge the electronic sensors consider that you bought it. So bring your own fridge if you want to enjoy a cold one. On the plus side this system makes checkout faster as they know what you had while you were still in the elevator on the way down... But seriously MBS I expect to be able to use the fridge if you advertise trhe fact that there is one on my room. And I don't expect it to be full of YOUR stuff.

My trip to Singapore was for business i stayed in the marina bay sands hotel which is an amazing property i will start when checking in it was very simple and easy took us a couple of minutes to be on our way to the hotel its a 25 min drive from the Airport. i stayed in a high floor room but the elevators was super fast and you dont need to wait long if your on your way down , i would recommend the rooms to be facing the lake not the ocean , maybe the ocean view in a couple of years when all the construction would be finished on the new opera house which looks magnificent but if your asking you don't hear sounds of construction so it was ok. The room is really nice the bed , pillows was very comfy the TV had alot of international channels and the options of buying movies and a system you can navigate in to check your bill or the hotel property to know more about the hotel and what services they offer. the bathroom is huge and all the amenities was there. cable plugs was all over the room so it was very helpful i asked for an adapter and was there in not time , the internet was for free all my stay was complimentary with the room , but i dont think that's the case for everyone so you need to double check before. we have rented a car with a driver for our 4 days of business the car was waiting for us with a sign of your name everyday morning on time. so thumbs up for the driver although we were half an hour late sometimes ( blame it on the beds) what i liked also that the room clock had a ipod dock so while working at night i plug in my ipod for some music. Room service is a diffrent story the variety you have on the menu is amazing an international mix for all taste. and 25 min maximum to your room. the room had an iron with its iron board , it had an umbrella because its usually raining in Singapore so that was helpful. the Service and staff is one of the best i ever experienced the reception, concierge staff are so friendly and always smiling they speak very good english compared to other asian countries, they try to help you all the time, when checking out i needed my bil done in a way which was a bit complicating for my company accounts department but it was all done in no time. Singaporean people as a whole are very friendly ( very) so i think this is just in their culture. now the good part the hotel Casino , worth a visit try your luck its a 4 floor casino and you just cant get enough i visited once and it was nice for time to pass. one more reccomendation is the sky bar lounge ( its in the 57 floor breath taking view) nice atmosphere and enviroment , one think i didnt do is visit the pool on the roof afternoon as its a must when visiting singapore ) if you want to know why just check the hotel pictures and you will understand :) ). maybe some people would like to know this story i left the hotel for a meeting and left my wallet there so i was a bit worried and came back late at night the room was cleaned and the wallet untouched. if you have a meeting early in the morning they have a wake up call service but the great part about it its an electronic one so when your half asleep and answer the phone it ask you to press any button if you would like a snooze in 5 min you click it calls back again in 5 and so on till your awake it really helped me a lot :p last thing if your going for an exhibiton in suntec exhibition centre its just 5 min away by car. and if you want to use the Metro system there is a station 2 min or less walk from the hotel that can take you everywhere. i tried to put everything i think off if you need anything else just message me and i hope i can help MAQ_SHJ", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, UAE", "Title": "\u201cOne night stay - beautiful\u201d", "Author": "Elsoueidi", "ReviewID": "UR119613239", "Content": "We stayed at the MBS for one night only but it was great.

Unlike other reviewers here I experienced virtually no queue on checking in, or indeed anywhere, despite the fact that the hotel was full to capacity. I found the staff largely pleasant and helpful, with the exception of Mr. Din at reception who was extraordinarily helpful and personally took us up to our room and ensured everything was in order, thanks Mr. Din we were glad to have met you. The room was wonderful, the floor to ceiling windows mean the view is spectacular. Rooms with views facing the city cost more than rooms facing the sea (how often does that happen?) but the extra cost I would say is well worth it. If you are fortunate enough to get a room on a higher floor, the view of the city and the bay is spectacular day or night, plus you will have unbeatable seats for the nightly fountain sound and light show on the bay. Everybody who has ever stayed here would remark on the pool so I won't needlessly add to that, except to say that if you did not stay here and instead paid for a trip up to the observation deck, you would only get a partial view of the extraordinary pool and not from a good angle. Yes the hotel is huge and the ambience is not going to be the same as smaller classic hotels like Raffles but I can't imagine another hotel in Singapore that could have better views or a better pool. One final tip if you want to keep cost down on food you can eat very well at the food court in the adjacent shopping mall.

This is one of the newest coolest hotels in the world displaying architecture and views that are unlike anything I have seen anywhere. This reason alone means it\u2019s probably worth going for a one or two night romp as I did last month and never return again. Must start by saying that if you do indulge and are prepared to spend the 500 bucks/night, then you should definitely dig a little deeper for an extra 200 and book a club room. This will entitle you to the full buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening canap\u00e9s all served atop the sky deck. The service in that sky lounge is absolutely among the best I have experienced anywhere in the world! Staff always smiling and during the evening drink service I never saw the bottom of the three separate drinks I had going. Other service I experienced in the outside this sky lounge was extremely \u201cso-so\u201d\u2026 I put this down to the hotel being so big and like with any organisation of this size, you are just another number. If I\u2019m spending $700+/night, I want to be treated at least like they are happy to see me\u2026. Is that asking too much?! Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by an unhappy looking bell hop who made no attempt to help with our bags or point us in the direction of the reception. When we eventually found the check in desk, again it was a bunch of blank looks and actually felt more welcome when I bought a packet of chewing gum from the 7-Eleven down the street! Rooms are nice and clean and actually almost too big. Almost. We spent most of the time on the sky deck by the pool, which was awesome but because they allow members of the public to go up there and even have guided tours through there, you cannot go in or out without have the 3rd degree by one of the many security guards.

Finally we were led to our room which unfortunately was on the 2nd floor of Tower 3 overlooking the freeway - so much for the spectacular views. The room was typical of what you would expect from a hotel of this class but nothing special to write home about. One of the things that annoys me about hotel bathrooms is the lack of water pressure in the showers. Well, the one we had in MBS was like a trickle. I wouldn't say that we were disturbed by traffic noise but there was a distinct hum of cars on the freeway which the double glazed sliding doors could not completely eliminate. The hotel is huge which means that it is very busy with a lot of human traffic walking around the place. Definitely not the sort of hotel for people wanting peace and quiet!! On a more positive note, the hotel is well located next to a huge shopping complex with a lot of up-market stores, cafes and restaurants. Although the prices are high for food and everything else, it is convenient to have so much choice at your doorstep. What I enjoyed most about MBS was spending a couple of hours relaxing and swimming in the massive pool up in Skypark.

First of all the problems started with the booking. Due to my tight working schedule, i communicated through email with the reservations department. Nobody bothered to reply my queries which were sent through email a few times, until I showed my dissatisfaction and anger through the email. Secondly, i booked with one credit card, but decided to pay with another on the day of checkout. And guess what, they still billed me on the credit card that i used to book with, and furthermore, with a double billing. I seriously wonder what the person at the check-out counter was doing and whether she did swipe the card that i passed her to pay. Thirdly, I requested for the cake to be kept with the concierge, and they were nice enough to do that for me. But when I wanted to get the cake back, they told me there was no such cake and i had to make several phone calls and they had to call me back several times before they \"re-located\" back my cake. And when they managed to re-locate my cake, the cake was delivered to my room only 20-30mins later. That's not very efficient. Fourthly, during the check-in, the benefits and privileges that we can enjoy that comes with the suite were not informed. The person at the check in counter did not bother to explain to us or even inform us the facilities that we can enjoy but merely pass me two key cards and asked for the next waiting person to come forward. And this happened at the VIP lounge. I don't feel very VIP-treated after all. I understand that the hotel is busy and bustling with visitors to stay. However, to maintain their standards as a world class hotel, the type of service and the people working there who are just too busy to attend to the very simple needs of individual people who stay there will just bring the reputation down sooner or later. I personally feel, for the amount of money that I paid and the service that I got, I will rather go to other hotels in the cities such as fullerton or mandarin oriental, that provides much better and efficient service as compared to MBS. I doubt i will ever want to come back again, unless there's another reason or experience to prove otherwise. The only part that's nice abt MBS is their rooms, being spacious and comfortable, and the view from the room was amazing. That's the only part where I enjoyed. All in all, there's nothing fantastic.

We feared an anonymous, sheep-herding experience but the Marina Bay Sands people all seemed to work hard to give each guest personal service. The rooms are quite generic but pleasant. There is no sense of being in SE Asia; you could be anywhere. The facilities in our room were very good. Comfortable bed, easy opening balcony door, responsive climate control, good black-out curtains, aesthetically pleasing bathroom that is also practical. The SkyPark (the roof pool and restaurant area) was breath-taking, even though we'd seen photos of it. A shame they don't allow camera tripods up there (allegedly for safety reasons). It feels like a real privilege to be up on the roof looking out over the city. The poolside menu is limited and pricey, but it would be, wouldn't it? The staff (as everywhere in the hotel, in our experience) were consistently friendly and our food and drink was excellent. For people who want to treat the whole Marina Bay Sands area as their 'hotel holiday', (if you like that sort of thing), I imagine it's second-to-none. I much prefer an authentic sense of a place, and the MBS location (on newly reclaimed land at the edge of the city) makes that slightly more of a challenge than if you're staying right in the city centre. You need a short bus ride to the nearest MRT station (Marina Bay) because the pedestrian footpath seems to run out before you get there, and you're left with no option but to walk on a busy dual-carriageway. Unless I went the wrong way! MBS is much better set up for people to take taxis, which stream in and out constantly. I feared a bland, mass-production, mildly irritating hotel experience.

It is just too big to be comfortable, the main concourse is crowded at all hours and there were hoards of people who appeared to be wandering aimlessly through the building. The service was poor to say the least, check out was the slowest that I have ever experienced; there was a huge queue and in the end, I trusted to luck and deposited my key card and a completed check-out form in the box provided. The food outlets which I used were not good and very American in style, great, if you like burgers and club sandwiches but if you are health conscious or a vegetarian, forget it. The bar prices were ridiculous, I estimate that the price in the hotel, for a local beer, after tax and service charges, is about twenty times the shop retail price! The one good thing was that at least I enjoyed plenty of exercise, just walking from one end of the huge building to the other. No doubt this stunning hotel will be a massive financial success for its owners, owing mainly to the gamblers who flock here to lose fortunes but I for one, was most disappointed.

It has rooms in three 57 floor towers with underpass walkways connecting to the casino, mall and theater across the street. Perhaps due to the sheer size of this resort, the extremely polite staff can not provide personalized service. The check in with long queues and wait reminded me of standing in line at the supermarket pay counter. Further the concierge service could not keep up with the volume of guests leaving most of us carrying our own luggage to our rooms. For the price one pays for to be a guest at this 5 star resort, the service of a concierge is a foregone conclusion. The infinity pool, sky park and jacuzzi hot tubs on the 57th floor is a marvel. WOW ! The view is memorable and the crowd in and around the 57th floor makes this entire experience forgettable. If you think the crowds on weekdays are bad, just don't bother going to the pool on the weekends. I swam only twice in my 7 day stay. In casual conversation with the security guards on the 57th floor responsible for allowing in only those with a hotel key card the best time for a swim is 6 am. The pool opens at 6 am and closes at 11pm. The food is great. I ate in room service, breakfast at Rise restaurant and at the Ku De ta restaurant on the 57th floor. The laundry service, and the priority service is excellent. All issues of not working phones and losing TV cable service were restored efficiently and effectively.

If you have never stayed before then this hotel will be a treat. If you want what comes with staying in Club and your are used to it you may be disappointment. This disappointment comes from the room which wasn't cleaned properly. There had obviously been a fire in the shower cubicle and the black marks were still on the floor which look filthy. The bathroom still smelt of smoke and we were in a non-smoking room. The toilet back up the moment when turned on the shower as soon as we arrived and flooded the bathroom. This is the second time the toilet has backed up in a club room and flooded the bathroom. Might be a problem in this hotel. Seeing it was an overnight stay and I was tired I just took my son up to the 56th floor where the swimming pool toilets were. I tried to explain the troubles with the room on check out in the VIP lounge but the young lady was not interested as I believed she thought I was trying to get a discount. The same response we received last time when we reported the toilet backing up. The VIP lounge check out was extremely slow. The club lounge was very good with some very attentive staff yet the service has drop a bit in there. The food in the club lounge is always brilliant so the chefs always save the day. Unfortunately, when you are a guest in the hotel there is no way of distinguishing you from the tourists on the ground floor hence, when you asked to speak with someone you might have to wait a long time after some people are just asking the price. Then conceierge may forget you and walk away. This has happened many times so don't feel disappointed that you do not get good service on the ground floor. The hotel needs to sort out a way of having the tourists go to a particular desk and the rest service the actual paying guests. The restaurants down stairs also become full at times, so as a guest you will get turned away whilst others are just coming for a meal. Not sure what the hotel can do about this but it is a little annoying as a guest trying to get a meal downstairs and the place is full. Hence, you have no other option but to eat in you room all go up to club. Going up to the club is lovely but not in the rain as the lifts become flooded and the rain pours straight in so you have to make a made dash to the club lounge which is difficulty when you are in a cast and on a walking cane like I was. Basically, for first timers - go for it, you will love it. The added bonus for this hotel is the airport check-in facilities across the road but be warned they do not operate on a Tuesday or Wednesday. I found this out the hard way when the porter took my bags down there knowing I wanted to check in and then saying, \"Oh Gee, sorry forgot\". The check-in facilities were the only reason I wanted to stay this time and I wasn't impress when I found out it was closed. I thought walking on a cane with my young son it would make it easier to check-in but it wasn't too be. The porter then tried to hi-jack my bags back to the hotel. He handed me a card and said pick up the bags at tower 1. I just looked at him and said, \"What?\" He started to roll the trolley with my bags on it back to the lift and I had to stop him so he could unload my bags. He was obviously in a hurry and I was just a mother, with a cast and a walking cane so he was going to tell me what I had to do.

The architecture and workmanship of the actual building is a piece of art. On arrival at the hotel, the coach parked below at a massive car park. At this point, I felt like I was entering a space ship. There were so many people from all over the world had arrived the same time as me. I felt small, which is understandable, being a large complex with three hotel towers connected by a gigantic atrium. The experience of amazement for me, probably lasted up to then. Checking in was a long a drawn out process. It reminded me of long queues leading to immigration. That to me, was still understandable. I got to my room, and wow, what a view. Singapore city as my backdrop, fantastic. My first sign of warning came from a guest I shared my lift with. She left the restaurant complaining how it took 45 minutes for her to get a glass of milk, only because it was not on the menu. I thought to myself, bureaucracy gone mad. I remained with an opened mind and continued on. The next day, I got up ready for my morning workout, when I found the key chain for my room would not undo. I tried my best to undo the clip, but it was jammed. I then called front desk, and waited a good hour. I couldn't wait any longer, so I called my father, in Malaysia. He managed to talk me through ways of manipulating the chain it's self to unleash it, which I finally did. On my way down to the gym, at the lift, which was an hour plus by then, only then was there a technician of some sort to assist me. I thought to myself, good thing I wasn't having a heart attack. After that my overall experience was totally disappointing. I felt like I was part of the herd of cattle being gathered and told where to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurants in the lobby lacked character. The staff seemed over worked and just wanted to get their job done. The swimming pool, the key structure was amazing to look at, but so were the crowds of in house guests and visitors from outside who came to enjoy this tourist spot too. I was there alone, so I didn't feel comfortable going for a swim for very long, leaving my valuables on display. My father came to visit me the following evening, and he was thoroughly disappointed by the service, or lack of it. We were in Singapore the following weekend, where we had already made reservations for the expensive poolside restaurant. Nobody had heard of us, we spent a long time on the phone waiting to be put through, and it seemed that in Singapore, where Customer Service is usually of high priority, it was lost in this place completely.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Charles J", "ReviewID": "UR119168151", "Content": "Stayed @ Marina Bay Sands Tower Suite.

A whole family can enjoy with lots of space! The beds were comfy and I really had a nice night's rest there. The view is wonderful - both the night view & day view. We stayed on the 32th floor. Im really impressed with the electric operated curtain system. It was a nice effect. The in-room free wifi service and also on the deck was a good addition. Facebook post away people! We also went up to the Skypark which was on the 57th floor and the view was naturally spectacular. A dip in the infinity pool on the deck is also a must-do when you stay at MBS. Go early as it gets crowded very quickly as its a popular spot in the hotel. (I felt the water was too chlorinated though...) Enjoyed a fun and lovely stay at the MBS. Not so sure about the service, food or staff as we didnt get room service. We did ask for ice buckets and it was quite prompt - so service should be OK & above average. Location wise its not as accessible as a hotel with a subway at the basement but Singapore is small and everything isnt too far away. Easily accessible by Taxi or walking.

After our 14 hour flight all we wanted to do was to check in, have a shower and a quick bite to eat. We arrived at Singapore airport to be collected by the hotel bus which was nice and watched a video on how the hotel was a modern day built miracle. We arrived at the hotel at 6.30pm well after the 3pm check in. We had paid $1585.00 for 2 nights to stay in a \"Club room\" which includes breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapes, We were very excited about the hotel and even more excited about the amazing roof top pool. When we arrived at the hotel, it was like a circus people everywhere and nobody to help you. On check in we were told at 6.45pm that our room was not ready and that we had to wait between 1-2 hours. This is when things went from good to bad very quickly. I am not sure that after 3 hours past normal check in, why our room was not ready. I was starting to get a little mad when they kept saying sorry we have no rooms ready. They then offered to pay for us to have dinner in the restaurant and wait, but after a 14 hour flight, being hot, tired and in need to have a refreshing shower I was not happy to sit there and have dinner in the state we were in. They then offered us a room with 2 single beds...yes for a happily married couple who wants single beds??? We were meant to say in a King size Club room on the 37 floor and that's what I paid for and wanted. I think that, that is reasonable. We when got offered a Suite room on the 14 floor. At this stage I was over it and over Marina Bay Sands even before I had checked in. Keep in mind that we were at the check in for 1 hour as the young man behind the desk had to check and recheck and call someone on the phone, and then call the manager who then also called someone on the phone. All of this was about 1 hour of people who seemed to have no idea how to handle this simple problem. I must say I was very reserved, unforgettably the man next to me was shouting so loud that even I felt scared as he was being told the same thing, that his room was not ready.... We had dinner at the buffet which was over $250 and on the second night pizza in the hotel restaurant which was $140 yes for pizza. I am happy to spend money but it was very expensive. My advice is not to eat in the hotel or the shopping center that is also owned by the hotel and venture outside to eat. The service from the hotel staff who working in The Club room eatery was very good and the food that was included was very nice. The pool was amazing and was really the only reason that made me book this hotel. In the end if you want the experience go for it, but we will not be staying or recommending it to our friends.

Firstly we stopped at every terminal for about 5 - 10 mins which was a huge waste of time and nobody got on the bus at terminal 2, 3,or budget. This irritated me extremely as it was my birthday we had shelled out 700 dollars plus and had to wait a very long time to get to the hotel. Another couple commented they should have shelled out for a taxi. Then arrived at the hotel eventually and asked for directions. Staff member viewed our itinerary sheet which was clearly marked club and directed us to check in. This happened another two times as we felt the directions were wrong. I also asked where club check in was and was directed to the wrong counter. Once we had checked in we commented we wanted to go to the club. The member of staff said we could have afternoon tea in our room (like I wanted to shell out for mini bar when we had bought a club room). Directed us to a lift which didnt go directly to the club so we walked back to a lift directly to the club. Once we finally reached the floor with the club a member of staff directed us to ku de ta when we asked for the club lounge thankfully we realised thsi otherwise we could have accidently spent hundreds on drinks. Found out later you can transfer lifts on the 55th floor. However I feel thats fine if you didn't buy a club room and you just want to see the pool but we had paid one of the top rates. Everytime we went into the club the staff were very snobby and asked us in an accusing manner whether we had club access and our room number. The club did serve nice food however the vibe in the club was so pretenious I felt out of place and I have been to hotel clubs before. The pool was ok but too crowded and very cold. The view at night from the pool area and surrounds is very romantic. One postitve note was that the hotel bus also takes you back to the airport and the porters took our bags directly to the bus.

The hotel connects to the casino and shopping center and there are lots of shops as well as a man made canal inside the shopping center for boat rides. Now the downside - the rooms are not exactly 5 star standard and as in previous reviews the rooms are modern but appears to be cheaply constructed and falling apart from the high traffic. Service is not exactly the best and the check in process of very mechanical and no one offers to help you with your bags either.

We arrived at Changi at 6.30am at Changi after long flight from Rome. We found the Marina Bay Sands Shuttle Bus very easily (through the glass doors past SIA info desk). Bus left at 7.00am (as advised) and arrived at the Resort about 8.00am. Porter service at Resort fantastic took our luggage into storgae, up to Reception to check in staff friendly (although check in does seem to take a long time), since our room wasn't ready we where given a card to access the Sky Lounge & Pool area and told to come back to Reception at 12 noon. We did but by this stage Reception was very very busy and took 20 minutes or more to get our room keys but hotel aware of delays and had staff serving free drinks to people in the ques. Also this was 24 hours before the Formual One Grand Prix so Resort was extra busy. No problem three restuarants to choose from for a snack in the lobby, or down the escalators under the road to the very very upmarket shopping centre (think Cartier, Tiffany's, Hermes etc) but as most shops not open till 10am not alot to see till then but wonderful Food Court open. Our room was on the 34th floor with view of the ocean in the 3rd Tower. A wonderful Room Steward spent 15 minutes showing us the rooms features and how to work all the applinces (TV, air con etc) Presentation of room was spotless however missing from our room were the robes and slippers plus the ironing board, we got one robe and an ironing board although we'd requested two robes (handy for the pool area). The Sky Lounge and Infiniti pool is one of the major reasons why you stay here, quite surreal to swim on 58th floor with all of Singapore laid out in front of you. Drinks and snacks aren't cheap, $12.00 Singapore dollars for one draft Tiger beer. There are three restuarants in the base of the hotel(lobby level), for the breakfast service we were told that the one at the base of Tower 3 caters mainly for Chinese (and other Asian) foods, the one at base of Tower 2 is a mixture of American style breakfast and the largest one at base of Tower 1 is afull international buffet for breakfast, we ate here for our breakfast and yes it seemed to have almost anything you could wish for for breakfast, price for two was steap, $90.00 Singapore dollars but food and service was excellent. Very affordable, delicous evening meal was had in the Marina Bay shopping centre food court (that description doesn't do it justice), you are blessed with lots of choices. How view of the Resort was fantastic and we would stay here again as we felt price reasonable for the high standard, however another Australian couple we meet on the Shuttle Bus on our departure, teir experince was the complete opposite of ours, they stated that when they entered their room it was filthy with unclean bathroom, with hairs in wash basina nd room had not been vacuumed and they felt staff didn't want to try to hard to fix their problems but all I can say was our experience was very good, yes it is expensive to eat and drink there but you wouldn't except to find super cheap prices at a very up market resort and if you want a bit of opulence for a Singapore stop over then stay here, it was great.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, South Australia, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOverated and poor service\u201d", "Author": "Hanh N", "ReviewID": "UR118923318", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights in Marina Bay Sands.

Also transport in the area can be frustrating, it is too far from the local subway to walk and getting a taxi from the hotel was easy enough but if heading from tower 3 in the direction of Raffles Avenue, Raffles Boulevard (the bridge and the Singapore flyer) be prepared to get stuck in a traffic jam as taxi's have to do a U-turn.

Amazing pools, great views. 3) Spacious rooms 4) Great access to shops The Cons: 1) Too many people (but given it is part of a casino, this should be expected). The sky park is constantly packed with people (and I mean packed!). Only time I could actually swim laps in peace was between 630-730am. Can't even relax and take in the views in peace past that time 2) Very big hotel - a lot of walking, especially if you get a room in Tower 3 and need to walk to the gym / coffee house for breakfast 3) Not very organized, given the size which is probably overwhelming for the staff. Case in point - someone was checked in to my room at 11am on the day I was meant to check out. Person happily sauntered in to my room with a key card that was already activated, and it was not even past check out time yet.

The hotel itself is truly amazing, the lobby is unbelievable. We had a room on the 35th floor facing the South China sea and on a clear day you can see the island of Batam, it was a wonderful view, the room was well presented and very spacious, the bathroom well equipped, and it was bigger than most hotel rooms! The sky deck on the 57th floor, where the infinity pool is located, is out of this world and something that will stay with us for along time, apart from the pool there is a garden area, several jacuzzi's(that look out to the South China sea) and 3 bar/ restaurant areas, the downside to the sky deck is that part of it is open to the public (not the pool area) and so is does get very congested, which took away from the experience for me. The other issues I had with the sky deck, was that it took nearly an hour to get a drink, as I don't think they have enough staff serving around the pool area, I only counted 4 waitresses, yet there were 5 lifeguards!, also there was music playing from the main restaurant behind the pool which was quite loud, now I love to listen to music, but as it seemed to to jazz constantly playing, it did start to grate on me somewhat. The other issues with the hotel were that even though it stats that check in is from 2:30pm we couldn't get into our room until 4:30pm and we had to get our keycard re-programmed as it would not work(It is required to operate the lift), it seems as though they don't have enough staff for the size of the hotel, and so the staff that are there, seem to be overworked and stressed, I would of thought that a hotel of this standard with the \"sands\" name behind it would have been more organised, maybe they need a little more time to iron out the kinks, but for me I will stick with shangri-la hotels when I am visiting Singapore as the staff are the best I have ever encountered.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "Toski", "ReviewID": "UR118809398", "Content": "We visited Singapore coincidently at the same time as the Singapore F1.

The hotel was fine because it was new so everything was nice and clean. However, the service staff really gave us a hard time. 1. Bad experience with the Front Office - The check-in time was stated as 2pm on our confirmation letter but there was no room for check-in when we arrived and we had to wait 4 hours at the lobby. The front office staff did not bother to inform us that the room was ready and we had ask before we were given our room. When we asked for late check-out, we were asked to pay. If we had checked in on time, it would be fair. But having to waste four hours of our time with no service recovery, I don't think they value their guests. 2. Bad experience with the Concierge - Our baggage was supposed to delivered to our room, but we waited for 45 minutes and still nothing came. We had to call a couple of times before the bell boy delivered our baggage. What was worse is that the bell boy doesn't seem to know that we were already in the room and he opened the room door himself. 3. Bad experience with the Valet - the valet and Front Desk each gave us a different carpark rate for hotel guests. Apparently there was a change in rates which was not communicated properly internally and the staff themselves were confused. 4. Bad experience with Room Service - we called to ask for ice buckets and were told that the first is complimentary and the hotel charges for the 2nd bucket onwards. Maybe this is a new standard with a 5 star hotel that I'm not aware of. But I find it a joke for them to even say that they are charging for a bucket of ice. 5. Bad experience at the swimming pool - absolutely no sense of luxury except for the view. There were visitors loitering around the swimming pool taking pictures and just enjoying the view. No doubt this is a spectacular view and probably the hotel used it as an attraction. It feels like a family hotel with kids running around and tourists loitering around taking pictures and making noise. Exclusive 5-star experience? Not a bit. You probably need to go in the wee hours to have some quiet time at the pool. And you only get two cards to access the pool at one time. So it doesn't work well if you're travelling in threes.

Hotel website offers 15% off advance pay non-cancellable rate which I took advantage of.

From the time we arrived by taxi to the time we left the staff took excellent care of us. Somebody unloaded our luggage & was delivered as soon as we entered our room. Club Rooms check in at the VIP lounge & I waited in line for 5 minutes(it was 3:30 pm) but the lady who took care of us made sure we had a city view room in the highest floor possible. The only downside twin beds not available which was not a big deal. I had a queen size bed & my daughter had the sofa bed closer to the floor to ceiling window. Housekeeping prepared it right away per our request. Our room was HUGE. The bathroom was the size of my previous hotel room. Needless to say the swimming pool was the highlight of our stay. It was a bit crowded Sunday afternoon but the adult section had plenty of room. I did witness the lifeguard redirecting a couple of kids who weren't supposed to be there. Monday the pool was practically empty. There are people walking by the pool area who by their attire are not there to swim but I suspect they are hotel guests also. Everytime we enter the pool area we were asked to show our room key. There was plenty of food at the Club Lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea, & evening cocktails that we didn't really spend any extra money on food. Staff was so attentive. I forgot a soup spoon & as I was standing up to get one, somebody already was handing it to me when I didn't even ask for it. Pool area side of the Club Lounge can get really loud & busy. The seaview side tables is where I sat for evening cocktails because it was very quiet & relaxing. Check out the gym. They have the best equipment & view. Staff made sure water bottles are within reach. Didn't have time to watch TV but when we turned it on just because we discovered you can view your bill there prior to check out. Really nice feature since we did charge some drinks to our room at the bar. Extra fridge we requested prior to arrival was provided so didn't even bother to open the mini bar fridge that is motion sensitive. This hotel is a destination in itself. My first 4 days in Singapore I was by myself & stayed at a less expensive hotel. I did a lot of my sightseeing then & all I needed was a bed to sleep in. Two nights here is enough for the experience & the Club Room definitely is worth the price. I would stay here again to experience it w/ the rest of my family. After that I probably would not. It is like going to Disneyland, you've been there once or twice, you don't have to go there again unless they come up with another attraction other than the pool.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cPoolside vacation in bustling Singapore\u201d", "Author": "melbournehome", "ReviewID": "UR118639261", "Content": "We had a terrific time staying at MBS for the F1 GP.

The best bit for us was just being able to relax by the pool each afternoon having shopped or toured most mornings. The pool is amazing, just can't get enough of that view whether it's an afternoon or a night swim, incredible! My only criticism is they need more shade, some unberallas PLEASE! The best place for breakfast and/or a casual lunch is not the hotel lobby (crowed and over priced), venture our to the Australian bistro on the outside the MBS shopping complex (think it's called South Coast).

I\u2019d read recent reviews and as a result had low expectations. In many ways it was better than expected, however, it isn\u2019t well equipped for families. If we were staying as a couple my ratings would be higher. Arriving at Singapore Airport we attempted to use the free shuttle. The coach area is a long walk from the arrivals area, situated at the end of Terminal 3. The driver told us we were facing a wait of 15 minutes for other passengers to arrive and then possibly a similar wait at Terminals 1 and 2. We quickly decided to take a cab, which was less than $20 and well worth it for a comfortable 15 \u2013 20 minute trip. The lobby is spectacular with soaring ceilings. There were no queues at check in but we experienced some difficulties with our room. We are a family of 4 and had booked a Horizon Deluxe room to guarantee a high floor. Reception advised we had been upgraded to a larger room that would accommodate 2 separate beds for the kids and a king for us. Sounded great, until I asked which floor? The 3rd floor of the hotel was not acceptable, no views and noise from the lobby. Second option was a room on the 47th floor but with only a king and one single bed (enough said). Third try and we were given a room on the 27th floor, city facing with 2 double beds. Unfortunately double beds at Marina Bay Sands are smaller than normal making for a very intimate and somewhat uncomfortable nights sleep. My advice, do your research and if booking on the net or using a travel agent be crystal clear what type of room you are reserving down to the bed configuration and be ready to stand firm with documented evidence of same. The room itself was lovely, new, clean and well equipped with a large bathroom. The views over the city were spectacular and the laser light show fun to watch. Housekeeping was very late (after 3.30pm each day). It\u2019s disappointing to return from sightseeing to find the beds unmade. Breakfast was included in our tariff. We ate at the Tower 3 restaurant the first day. It was less crowded than Rise and had a better selection of Western and Asian food. It was obvious that the hotel is trying hard to manage the queues but Rise makes things difficult with a very small and cramped \u2018egg\u2019 area, resulting in long waits for omelettes etc. The rooftop pool was spectacular and fun to experience, day and night views are wonderful. We\u2019re glad we experienced Marina Bay Sands. It\u2019s clear the hotel is trying to address the long queues etc but bottom line it\u2019s a very large and busy place.

As our flight arrived Singapore early in the morning, I knew we were normally allowed to check into the room of any hotel in Singapore at the earliest around noon, or sometimes they let us in early if a room was being made available. So we left our baggage with the concierge and went to sit in the food court of the shopping centre which was adjacent to the hotel. We were being advised to come back to the front counter to register to check in. At 1pm, we went back to the front counter, we were registered and were told to come back at 3pm to get the card key to the room. At 3.30pm we went back to get the card key, was only given the card key at around 4pm. Went up to the room on 26th floor, only to find that the people occupying the room were not meant to check out yet. So we had to go down to the front desk to get another card key to another room. At the time we got the card key to a new allocated room was at 5.30pm. I was dead tired. As we checked out on 24 July at 10am,, we left our baggages with the concierge as we only needed to leave for the airport at 12.30pm. When we came back to pick up our baggages, the concierge was kind enough to push our baggages down to the bus terminal for the airport. As we were about to board the bus, my husband realised that my son's bag was missing. He went back with the concierge to search for the bag at their stores but to no avail. 45 minutes were passed and I was getting anxious of missing our flight. In the end, my husband found the bag sitting on the floor in lobby one. The concierge must have dropped it while he was pushing the trolley into the storage without realising about it. I nearly missed my flight and was running my life into the boarding gate. After all that I went through, will I stay there again? Never. There are so many nice hotels in Singapore.

The negativity comes from people with unreal expectations. Take for example the hundreds of reviewers who suggest asking for a room on a high floor and city view. The hotel has 2560 rooms! And only half of those face the city \u2013 1280. Out of these only half are on high floors \u2013 640. So how can every single person expect a high floor, city view room? I also read reviews saying that the view from the ocean view is horrible, because of the construction and the ships in the harbor. Really? You want to blame the hotel for what the Singapore government is doing? Then there are the reviews about the lobby being busy like an airport terminal. Well, what were you expecting when you booked a room in a 2500 mega resort that is the icon of Asia? You want a peaceful, tranquil hotel with not a single soul around you while you enjoy your morning dip in the pool \u2013 go to the Fiji Islands. So here is my tip for a great stay \u2013 do your homework \u2013 now what you are getting into. Don\u2019t expect the hotel to change itself into a boutique destination just because you want it to. Check the website \u2013 you can now book a room with a city view guaranteed by paying $50 more. It is worth it! We paid the extra and got exactly what we wanted. Skip the breakfast at the main buffet restaurant \u2013 long queues and it\u2019s the same food every day \u2013 you will be disappointed. Instead try the food court in the mall \u2013 great variety and way cheaper and no queues. Yes the Sky Park will be crowded. But it is open till 11pm. And the views at night are way better than during the day. So spend the day at the casino, shopping, watching a play at the theatres or eating in the restaurants in the mall. And go to the SkyPark after 7pm. You will get a good 4 hours to yourself. If you are looking for some sun at the Sky Park, well tough luck then.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shepparton, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeat Jetlag\u201d", "Author": "ErnShepparton", "ReviewID": "UR118350401", "Content": "We stopped here to chill out on way to Melbourne from London.

So here you can get a different perspective, and be prepared to make the trade-off. When you try the new and novel and big, you are likely to trade down very dramatically in the service and overall value department! As a frequent traveller, I value the chance to check in quickly, check out quickly. In this hotel, with all of the package tours and mobs of tourists, don't expect that to happen. When I went to check in, the lines were not particularly long, but it was still a long wait. From what I could decipher, most of the discussion on check-in was \"does the room have this, does the rate line up with my package tour quote, etc\". A lot of wasted time. And time that's wasted - we can never get back. Breakfast - again - tons of people - and expensive!. A very nice buffet, but be prepared to be walked into, jostled and blocked by the mobs of \"looky loos\" that want to scrutinize everything carefully before finally making a selection. If you're on a leisurely tour - that may be fine for you, but if you're on any kind of a schedule - forget it. You want to get in, get out, get done. On check-out, I had no delay, but it was early - around 8AM. If you check out later - leave plenty of time. Oh - then there is the novelty factor - You can read all of the other wide-eyed reviews that marvel at the roof top pool. My room was comfortable, clean and way overpriced. Other hotels that are more centrally located and much more service oriented are the Shangri-La and the Mandarin Oriental. Centrally located also means close to the MRT stations.

We needed to check out late, so we had to pay for extra day! The hotel is huge, very big, it's like you are in Las Vegas. They even opened a Casino there last year, now all the people come there to play. The roof top swimming pool is overcrowded, lots of screaming children. They have adults only area, but it's right next to kids zone. I have nothing against kids, I have 2 of my own, but if you travel as a couple, there is no place to relax. We had breakfast on the roof top, it's ok, not too big of a selection, but very busy. It seems like they want you to eat fast and leave even faster. Rooms are quite big and I would say nice, comfortable bed, nice big washroom, very nice view. However, they don't have enough stuff to clean everything. So, first day our room was not cleaned until 5-20 p.m. We paid 700 per night, I think it is unacceptable for that kind of money.

Wine list is very expensive, 100$ for very average wine. Spanish restaurant was nice. We had late night appetizer there and wine, also expensive, but atmosphere was nice and simile is excellent, very friendly and knowledgeable!

Printed out exactly the same thing as I had earlier given them and they somehow found the booking. They advised us that we could use a hospitality room for 2 hours to freshen up as check in is only 3pm. Gave us a room number and a key. Got to room and the key wouldn't open door. Back down we went, changed the key and then upon entering found 4 women in the room changing. Back down to front desk where the manager told us that it is a shared room. This was not told to us to begin with. There were dirty towels on the floor of the bathroom and all towels had been used and he said that they will come and clean within the hour. Gave that a miss. Went for breakfast which was superb. Have to say the best breakfast that I have had at any hotel @ $42.00 per person. The rooms were very comfortable. The hotel is like a railway station. The pool is very busy and noisy. The views are spectacular. 2nd day our keys to the room were inactive, guess it had something to do with the 2nd nights accommodation that they initially couldn't find but a nuisance when you come home tired and want to get to bed and you have to go back downstairs to get the keys reactivated. Breakfast 2nd day requested a cuppacino but was told that the coffee machine was broken. Asked if they could get a coffee from the other restaurant and told no I could only have regular coffee. Not again and I wouldn't recommend it either. Next time I will go to the Capella on Sentosa where the price and the service match one another.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cImpressive Singapore city skyline from Sky Park @ Marina Bay Sands\u201d", "Author": "wmloke13", "ReviewID": "UR118070911", "Content": "After reading a fair bit of terrible reviews on this hotel, my wife and I decided to spend a night to check out the latest pride of Singapore.

And I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to experience Singapore at its best. We were holidaying in Thailand and specially flew down to Singapore for a day to stay at this hotel because we had heard great things about it. It did not disappoint at all. Our shuttle bus driver from the airport to the hotel was not very friendly. He didn't help to get our luggage onto the bus and neither did he help us get it off. It didn't matter though, We just didn't end up tipping him. We had originally booked ourselves a Premier Room, but we were provided with a complimentary upgrade to the Orchid Suite with living room, bedroom and stunning views of the city. The staff were very courteous, helpful and friendly. The hotel also has check in and baggage drop off services for certain select airlines such as Singapore Airlines etc. We tried out some items from their in room dining menu and they were delicious. I must mention that the soaking tub in the bathroom is absolute bliss. I just wish they also provided us with some bath salts, but unfortunately they don't. The shower area is huge. The city looks wonderful from the infinite pool on the 57th floor, and the Jacuzzi's at the back side provide equally wonderful views of a beautifully manicured golf course, especially after sunset. You can order cocktails or fries etc while in the infinite pool. The hotel has a lot of visitors to the sky-park, restaurants etc and mostly runs at an 80-100% occupancy, so it can seem really crowded at times, especially in the lobby and reception area. But once you go up to your room, it feels like you are in an absolutely different world. Although a lot of effort was put into designing the hotel itself, we felt like our room, especially the living room could have been furnished better. It just seemed like somebody had left it halfway through. The bed was very comfortable though. We tried out the Pizzeria Mozza restaurant. The Pizza's were really good but we were not impressed by the 1 hour preparation time. We also had High Tea at the TWG Tea Salon and Boutique. It was a good experience, but was quite pricey. We didn't get a chance to go to the casino, or try out the breakfast since we were only there for a day.

Do NOT expect prompt room service/house keeping. Do NOT expect greeters and 'smilers' stationed at the lobby a la the shang ri la. Forget the small touches of a small luxury hotel. Do NOT demand perfection. You won't get it. But really, I believe we are not that super high maintenance that we would suddenly drop dead if there are no butlers or 'greeters' to make us feel special, looked after, and pampered. We would not care if the bathroom tile is NOT super clean and spotless, because we won't be sleeping on it. The details and perfections are nice, but not essential to an enjoyable stay. If you encounter a bellboy that does not know your name it would not suddenly spoil your whole stay. Unless you are, mmm.. maybe madonna? Because of this hotel's sheer size, there will be lots of people. in the lobby, at the skypark: when staying at the atrium floors you will hear them murmurring and chatting below. (not when you close the door) You will encounter children running, laughing or crying. There will be people smoking in the casino, they are loud, and grumpy, and tired. Ordering room service can take up to 40 minutes, 30 is the norm. Switching your 'please make up room' light is a useless act, be warned. Just call them (by phone) and it will be done, and quite promptly. Bathroom is huge, tub is huge, shower is huge but the tiles are a bit 'smudgy' and dirty but hey, I come here to take a shower not admiring bathroom art. The bathroom works. Room service food is great. Delicious, big enough for two, and the staff are always friendly, talkative, smily. Beds are hard, linen are not the softest. Room is big, city view is nice, electronic blinds are a nice touch. Minibar is electronic, so you will pay when you take out stuff but if you need refridgerator space I believe they can lend you one. I really love staying here because of the fun. You can never get tired trying all the different delicious restaurants at the mall (CUT, mozza, rasapura masters, etc), at the 4th floor casino where children can enter (waku ghin, hideo yamamoto, santi), shopping at the 10,000 (this is an exaggeration) different stores for blu ray to chanel to a 1900's antique phone, just going to the sky park, hitting the gym (which is always empty), the casino (which is always not), watching broadway shows. Visiting the art gallery, taking a sampan ride. Things you can never do in the grand hyatt, the hilton, mandarin oriental, st regis or millenia ritz.\u00a0 The gym is state of the art. The equipments are modern, the view is a million dollars. The sky park is crowded yes, but only hotel guests can access most areas. Only guests can go into the pool. I came here at night and even though I am deathly afraid of heights it was not scary at all. I stayed all by myself for three nights and was so glad I stayed here. I was always occupied by all the fun. If you are tired of this hotel you can always take a cab to the orchard, or the fullerton one across the lake (?). There is this baby clothing shop I frequented at the mall. There is also a grocery store. I did not encounter any trouble checking in or out, the lines were fine. if you stay in a suite/club room you will get a private check in/out area. All the staff I met (reception, housekeeping, room service, bellboy) were friendly, smiles a lot and attentive. Believe me, staying here is 10 times better than anywhere in singapore.

I travelled with my partner who was in Singapore on business and we stayed for 2 nights from Weds-Fri. Firstly, check-in took well over half an hour and we were rewarded with a room on the 30th floor that did not have a bath tub and looked out over a construction site. I was not impressed and we had been in the vicinity for an hour. The next severe disappointment was that MBS charge an extortionate rate for WiFi in your room. It was S$8 an hour or S$20 a day! When you are paying such ridiculous room prices in the first place I was shocked that they had the cheek to charge for any extras at all (including movies on the limited in-room entertainment system). Things did not get better, on the first morning I was trying to sleep in the room and was awoken by loud construction noise on the floors above. I called down to complain and was told that the noise would continue for at least another 2 hours. I was offered a room change but this was not an option as my partner was already at work. The next option (which was recommended by me, no other services were offered by their '5 star staff') was a complimentary drink and some food. This was agreed to but after 1.5 hours of waiting in the room, nothing appeared. I called down again and was told that the request must have been lost because the kitchens were over-whelmed?! I was by this time, annoyed and starving - not a good combination. The one saving grace was a lady called Amber from group management. She called my room and was very apologetic for the lack of service I had received previously. She sent up a complimentary bottle of wine and a fruit bowl; breakfast the next morning was also free of charge. It was refreshing to be dealt with professionally and efficiently. Thank you. The pool area on the sky deck is quite impressive but that should not be the only positive aspect of a very un-organised and over priced hotel. Another thing to note is that although polite, the drivers of the private hotel cars do not have a thorough knowledge of Singapore and a journey to an address only 15 minutes from MBS took me over 45 minutes because the driver repeatedly got lost. If you do have to stay here, go and see the Lion King because it is a fabulous show and give yourself plenty of time to check in & receive any form of service or request from the front desk!

We checked-in on Wednesday and checked out on Sunday. [Booking Process] We made a booking a couple months ago before arrival at a corporate rate. The guy at the reservation said over the phone that we must produce staff pass prior to/upon check-in to have corporate rate applied. As my husband had to travel on business and couldn\u2019t be around on the day of check-in of our family, we went down to the hotel on Sunday to register a guest name. [Prior to Check-in& Guest registration] Upon registration, we asked about the corporate rate, the front desk couldn\u2019t retrieve correct information and quoted much higher price. 1. When we went down to MBS on Sunday 3 days for registration of guest name, the room rate the front desk told us incorrect. After the guy talking to his colleague next to him, he managed to give us the correct rate. I felt a bit uncomfortable so asked him to write the price in his name card and kept his name card just in case. He requested passport information of arriving guests and we also gave him credit card detail. [Check-in Process- Data Retrieval Issue] On the date of arrival, a lady at the front desk couldn\u2019t retrieve the information of the guest we registered three days ago and we had to wait about 30 min. 2. When our family arrived, I helped with check in. The lady at the front desk couldn\u2019t retrieve the guest data. It took her 30 min. She asked for the passport again and it seemed like she was inputting the data again. It was around 3PM and we had to wait a while. [Handling of Customer Request \u2013 Service hotline] It seems like the operators at hotline don\u2019t relay the message properly or the receiving party may lose messages. Whatever the case, there seems to be no centralized follow up for completion of requests from guests. I had to make same requests for a very simple item 5 times and at least 2 for other requests. 3. To begin with, we requested extra bed for a kid. They gave us so called \u201cdouble double-bed room\u201d, in MBS which meant a room with a sofa bed. I called the service hotline to come and open the bed to find out the size of the bed. After 15 min, nobody came. So I called again and they sent housekeeping. At that time, I thought that was unusual for 5 start hotel but I was not upset about it. 4. Next incident is the one which really made me write this review together with how billing error was handled by the front desk . All started with us just wanting to have nice chat among family over coffee and tea after coming back from shopping in MBS. We looked for our cups and realized housekeeping removed cups (or cups just disappeared) and spoons were not cleaned. o I called the service hotline and asked for 3 cups. Waited more than 10mins. Nobody came and so I called the hotline back again. The person at the hotline didn\u2019t know about the request I previously made. So I had to repeat the request. After 10 min, nothing happened. I called again. Same thing plus they didn\u2019t know what my request was. I got quite angry and called to ask for a manager. Again, nothing happened. I called hotline again to ask what's going on. The lady replied \u201cyes we are looking for a manager\u201d. I asked whether she knew what I was asking for. she said she didn\u2019t know, she just heard that the customer is very angry and they needed to look for a manager. OH MY GOD.. [Handling of Customer Request- Encounter with housekeeping manager] \u2013The Manager didn\u2019t know what the issue was when she showed up. Didn\u2019t look very sincere and the way she treated us made us feel insulted. o I was very frustrated and couldn\u2019t believe what just happened. Our family seemed quite surprised at the incident too. Then somebody knocked on the door. I opened the door and there was a lady standing. She said she was a manager from housekeeping and started saying \u201cI am so sorry.\". !!!! Then she said \" Btw what happened?\u201d. Again, frustrated, but trying to be fair, I started explain from no cups in the room, having to repeat the requests 5 times, nothing happened after 1.5 hours, including the dirty spoon. While I was talking to her, she said a few \u201cOh really?\u201d and even when I wasn\u2019t finished all of sudden she just stopped me from talking by saying \u201cby the way do you want some coffee?\u201d I said \"OK, but I just want cups\" and she disappeared. A few minutes later, she showed up with two packets of coffee that housekeeping usually leaves in the room as a complementary service. o Later FINALLY, a guy showed us with only TWO CUPs (not THREE cups)and TWO Spoons which seemed washed. [Handling of Customer Request- Front Desk] \u2013 brushing off the request o So I called hotline again to ask for one more cup. On top of the cup, I asked for customer feedback form so that I could write a formal complaint. o This time, they sent us the additional cup after 10 min. o For the customer feedback form, they transferred me to Front desk. 5. When I got transferred to front desk, I advised the front desk that I wanted to complain formally and asked them to send me a feedback form to our room. The lady said they will contact us after we checkout to request feedback and asked me to wait provide feedback LATER. I stressed to her that i needed the form. She said yes but we didn\u2019t receive the form afterwards. [Check-out and billing error - Front Desk] Massive errors in the bill, Slow response, unhelpful & VERY VERY rude. 6. When we received our first bill, there were numerous errors in the bill. o Although room rate included breakfast, the breakfast cost for all was added o Multiple minibar items were added to our bill which we didn\u2019t consume. o Huge overcharge of room rate By THEN we all learned that in MBS it was normal to make at least two phonecalls to make things fixed. And yes, I had to call twice for those errors with overstatement to be fixed. I also asked for hardcopy bill after they made correction, they said yes but they didn\u2019t send the revised bill. 7. The next one is really unacceptable. Not only because they made a mistake but also because the way it was handled by the front desk, which it took 2 hours to fix after us going through so much horrid experience. o Shockingly, I noted that the room rate was overstated by approximately 30%. To explain, say, our corporate room rate for garden view is X++. For the bay view room we requested , MBS charges additional SGD 50++. Hence, the correct rate should be (X++)+(50 ++). But our bill showed the total room price of (X++)+(50 ++) +(50 ++). So it was overcharged by 100 ++++. o I called hot line, the hotline transferred me to the front desk. And the discussion with front desk lady was the top highlight with MBS. At my comment that bill was wrong, the lady at the front desk argued that it was correct. She continued to say as we are staying in Bay view room, we\u2019ll have to pay 50++ extra. She didn\u2019t seem to listen to the logic I was saying that the room was charged by 100++. The ton she used was so called \" scolding\" -for me not understanding the simple logic of having to pay 50 more for the bay view. o After that, for 1 hour, I had to dig out my bags to look for the name card from the guy who we met to register the guest a week ago. After I found the card, I called the front desk again to look for him. In MBS, the checkout time is 11AM. Thank God. He was on duty that day. Knowing the check-out time and our flight time, I asked the lady when he can call back, she (I am not sure whether this is the same person who tried to argue that it was right rate in our bill) rudely said when he finished serving the guest in the counter. o 30 min later, he called. Fortunately he remembered the rate he wrote in his name card, and us. After another 20 min he fixed the rate. o But due to our flight, we had to hurry to the airport and couldn\u2019t get the hardcopy bill and by that time I have given up receiving anything from this hotel at my request. [Constant Mal-function of Card-Key] we had to go down to 1st floor to get keys fixed everyday. Lesson learnt: 1. When you deal with MBS, always obtain and keep evidence on key items. Don\u2019t expect any extra service from the hotline or front desk. 2. This hotel is best if what you want to do is shopping around MBS area and swim on the roof top only as MBS staff dealing with phonelines and front desk simply don\u2019t seem to be incapable of or disinterested in helping with requests with slight complications. Lastly, Yep, they have a gorgeous swimming pool with great view.

Good thing is that they have an iron and ironing board for your convenience, other than the usual tea and coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers and bathroom kits.

A word of advice, if you want to use the pool and avoid the crowds, the best time would be early morning before 7.30am or probably late at night around 10pm to 11pm. Restaurants Tried the Rise Restaurant and Lounge but for buffet breakfast only. Rise Restaurant has many varieties of food but my husband found it too clustered everywhere and didn't like the feel of it. On our second day, we tried the Lounge instead and we prefer it here although the selections ain't as many but the food are displayed within one area and we find it cozier.Moreover, Rise Restaurants can be very crowded when too many guests come in all at once. The one thing that I do have to give credit to the hotel is the honesty of their staff, even their housekeeping. We didn't realised that we left our passports and money in our safe box until almost 5 hours after checking out. We called at first to ask them to check but was a little disappointed when they failed to call back an hour later.We had to cut short our time meeting our friends and went straight to the hotel to sort it out and we were pleased that their housekeeping gave everything back to the security.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cPoor service dominates this hotel\u201d", "Author": "boababe", "ReviewID": "UR117777613", "Content": "I am currently in Singapore visiting my daughter who has lived here since April.

Rule #2... guests shouldn't have to ask for a menu. We had a question about an item, but since no one came over, my daughter got up to ask about it. The waiter did not know ( the question was the portion size). We ordered it anyway. Thirty minutes later we still were waiting. We asked the hostess to find out what happened and it arrived shortly thereafter. When we were finished, my daughter had to get up and ask for the check. We were presented with three different checks before we received the correct one. During this time I asked where the restroom was and the waitress didn't know. Rule #3...servers should be trained with at least basic knowledge of what they're serving and the layout of the facility. At any price, I would expect better service than what we experienced here, but at the exorbitant prices that we paid, we should have been treated like royalty. Shame on the management of MBS.

Staff pleasant enough and there is a great amount of patience with all the guests in the place. Internet fast and came with the room. Basic room large enough with adequate breathing space. Mine had a balcony I rarely used. Bed was comfortable and room adequate in size. Bathroom is large, but minimalist (Read: There's a sink, a toilet and a shower) at least in the atrium deluxe category. The highlight is the pool, but it can get really crowded during the day. Night swimming is probably the way to go. For the price, I probably would not stay here again unless paid for by some 3rd party. Maybe Fullerton or Marina Mandarin.

At any measure it\u2019s certainly impressive with over 2500 hotel rooms and suites, Casino, several hundred shops, A collection of restaurants that represent the dreams of the world\u2019s leading culinary names, A Sprawling Convention & Entertainment Centre and heaven forbid let\u2019s not fail to mention the Skypark and one of the world flashest high altitude swimming pools. But after A 4 Night visit staying in a Club Room I cannot help but come away with the Been There Done that attitude but next time I will go back to the Fullerton. Sure the Hotel had moments of excellence, but It just failed to impress overall. I arrived in Singapore late one evening, it took less than 10 mins for a bus to pick me up after being guided by the Marina Bay Sands Greeting Desk in the terminal. Word of Warning if your taking the shuttle bus, be prepared for a longer than normal trip as it stops at all terminals before heading to the Hotel, In hindsight I should of sprung for a Taxi. Check In at Marina Bay Sands was quite hassle free. I couldn\u2019t help but notice though that for Club Rooms there was no private check in and later noted that during busy periods the lines at service desks where very long for both Check In and Check Out. My room on the 47th Level to be honest didn\u2019t particularly impress me, I was worried when I exited the lift and began to smell musty covered cigarette smoke odour. I was very dubious if my non smoking room on a non smoking floor was fact or fiction. The rooms are nice not amazing, The Coffee pastel tones made it look kind of dark although quite warming if that\u2019s what one wants in a tropical environment. They are nice rooms and this particular room had a nice little standing balcony which offered a nice view over the harbour and the construction site next door ( Due to nearby construction every harbour view room will suffer this fate for sometime to come so do not get conned into paying more for a Harbour view room ) Facilities in the room where very good, Nice LCD TV with a multitude of channel choices in every language plus movies and interactive info. An Ipod dock and very high tech scam proof bar fridge that contains weight sensors so no cold drinks at 7/11 prices at this place. The lounge and desk space was very adequate and the bed was actually very comfortable. I liked the addition of the in room Nespresso unit. The marble bathroom was massive with a separate Toilet, Shower and Bath area, Twin Bowl sinks and ample storage space. The only major fault was that someone had been smoking in the lavatory at some point recently because the smoking smell was clearly evident. Housekeeping\u2019s efforts with the deionizer gained little improvement over the entire stay. Being a Club Room we had access to the Club Lounge in the Sky Park, The breakfast on the first day was unimpressive and the service more so, We where sat at someone else\u2019s table initially, service seemed very inconsistent and the staff struggled to serve the numbers involved. However each other day the I noticed the service got significantly better and better to towards the end of the stay what was a very high standard with real hospitality and I put my first experience down to just a really really busy day stretching staff somewhat. The Skypark and Skypool are both big draw cards and this causes its fair share of problems across the hotel. The Skypark bring in a lot of visitors who can quickly at peak periods turn the main foyer of the hotel in to a crowd you would find outside a concert or sporting event, chaos stalks closely. The Skypool as innovative as it is, is not huge by resort standards and gets very very crowded almost all the time. Also the hot tubs are not remotely private so if you want use one be prepared to be in Uncle Vishnu\u2019s or Aunty Chens Holidays snaps. I wasn\u2019t personally impressed by the pool beyond the view it was way too crowded and more of a public swimming pool feeling than that of a resort which I am paying decent money for. Location wise the hotel is okay but not as close to the action as I would like, Though that being said its Singapore and everything isn\u2019t too far away. You can walk to Boat and Clark Quay if you wanted to, the sprawling Marina Square Mall which feeds into 3 or 4 other malls is about a 10 min hike as is the esplanade, the Singapore Flier is also about a 10 min stroll. Marina Bay Sands own shopping mall whilst impressive isn\u2019t anything to really get overly excited about its full of shops which are for the most part devoid of customers. The same high end brands you will see at any shopping mall across the world are here, there is very little I would consider unqiue, The Food Court tries to imply it\u2019s a glammed up hawker centre but the offerings are rather mediocre at best, go to a real hawker centre if you want to eat well not here. Overall I am not unhappy I tried out Marina Bay Sands, Its certainly impressive from a design and engineering point of view and for the Yes I\u2019ve tried it out value it was an interesting experience I didn\u2019t pay top dollar so I am not going to bellyache about being ripped off or anything, However buyer beware, Do not expect the highly refined experience like you would get at say the The Fullerton, Shangrila, Grand Hyatt or Mandarin Oriental for example.

As guests of the hotel you dont pay to wander around, great views of Singapore! the rooftop pool is also very cool, has an infinity edge which is a little freaky so high up. When we stayed the public were able to wander by the pool, though not right next to it where guests swim. Not too fussed on people all sticky beaking, though they are looking at the view rather than you! the feel up there was surprisingly resorty.

The marble bathroom has a good size and nice but limited amenities, the exact same \"cheap\" amenities like venetian/palazzo in vegas which i dont like. It took us few minutes to finally get the shower work... I guess theres a reason why there is an instruction there, so not user friendly.

However, with check-out time at 11:00 and check-in time at 15:00, we were informed no twin bed rooms were available when we check-in at 15:40, only king sized beds. We were then told that to have twin beds immediately, an additional $50 per night has to be paid as it was city view facing. This additional charge was not included in my reservations email nor in their room reservation website, neither was it stated in the front office. The front desk informed it was only a decision made the week prior. I did managed to have the extra $100 charge waived, it was indicated an up sell of room in the receipt. With 4 hours between check-out to check-in time, it seemed that the hotel housekeeping could not cope with the turnover of rooms. \u00a0 Lobby Still crowded and rowdy. No feel of being in a 5 star hotel. It felt like walking through a shopping mall. \u00a0 Room Stayed on 31st floor this time. Sink was slow flowing due to the stopper issue, curtain was stuck and had to call technician to get it fixed. Everything in the room was powered by having the keycard inserted. This includes the clock and each time we removed the keycard, the clock gets reset and we need to set the time again and again! This is a basic necessity that should not be linked to the power source. We had a full day of thinner smell from the corridor on the 2nd day, this was due to maintenance work from as early as 7am to 3pm. I felt ridiculous when one staff came into the room to spot check the minibar in the midst of our stay. Yes, he indicated, spot checked! And he just walked in without even us giving the consent of entering the room. Still surprised that a 5 star hotel provided no newspapers. \u00a0 Internet Continue to see no free internet but charges dropped from $15 per hour back in Oct 2010 to $8 per hour. \u00a0 Room service Ordered an American breakfast in room for $42, with tax and service charge, $50. Juice + Egg + Bacon + Rosti + Coffee + 3 toasts. The service was on time, though staff informed that the service cart would be collected 45mins later, no attempt was made to retrieve it after 2 hours. \u00a0 Valet Parking An improvement in service though congestions at the driveway are still seen. Would be good if Tower 3 provides valet parking, it's not an exciting experience to walk thru the crowd from Tower 3 to Tower 1 just to get your vehicle. \u00a0 SkyPark/Swimming pool They now have screens between the walkway and the swimming pool though it still felt like exhibits in the pool. Over crowded pool. Best time to avoid crowds would be before 8am. Pool is opened from 6am to 11pm. This was not indicated in the room information, had to call to find out. Information of opening hours should be easily available for the guests. Late night swimming isn\u2019t relaxing with the club playing loud music next to it. \u00a0 Check-out The printer was down at the counter I was at. The front office staff was unaware till the manager informed her. If the manager knew of this, the printing should have been redirected prior, and time not wasted to redirect printing when guests are checking out. \u00a0 A little better than my previous stay, still have more room for improvements.

You are basically paying for the views. \u00a0 My previous review http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1770798-r83778180-Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a bizzare hotel\u201d", "Author": "agent_anonymous", "ReviewID": "UR117049934", "Content": "I was so looking forward to staying at this hotel - the hype surrounding it is immense.

We felt very bad about their attitudes and the way we were being treated during check-in. There are over a thousand rooms in the hotel. The check-in counter was under staffed. Service was compromised and hotel guests suffered. I do not think that I should have paid such high price for the disrespectful services. To be honest, after so many months, I am still angry. My friend's room was unfinished. My friend begged for a room facing certain view. The staff appeared to have a lot of discretion in terns of room assignments (there are over a thousand rooms). My friend was \"granted\" the requested type of room by an arrogant staff. However the room turned out to be unfinished with furniture. There was a large empty space between the bed and the window. It appeared that certain furniture which should be put there to fill the space was missing. The buffet breakfast was a mess. Too many people!! The quality of food was worse than a 3 star hotel not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel.

I was very impressed at the presentation & tour. I decided to take my wife for a nice weekend getaway to this hotel. Paying $589++ / nite in was expecting a lot. As there was no photos of each room, I called long distance to the hotel reservation. I was told the room I booked will be above 28th fl, with 57sqm in size like a junior suite. Here comes the bad news: 1. Come check in time, the line was extremely long. Then I was told the room allocated for me was on the 5th floor, thus I won't have any view as it will be blocked by buildings. I decided to change room and got a deluxe room on the 28th floor. 2. When I came in, carpet was dirty, some notes left over from previous guests were found on the carpet & desk. What was more shocking, when I lifted the toilet seats I could see splashed of dried urine all the place, and I found also the spoons were dirty after being used by previous guests. 3. When I called guest services & asked to be connected to front desk to give my Premier Advantage number..after a long wait, I was told I should just leave the number to the guest services. 4. Had dinner at Guy Savoy, food was OK, not worth the price though. 5. After dinner, we wanted to hang out at the famous Sky Deck...it was closed due to private function. Entering Kudeta we have to pay $100 .. If it weren't for the sky deck, why the heck we want to pay $600/ nite ?? 6. Next day we only could find Decaf coffee in the room. Called guest services and request it + tissue roll. House keeping came with some more decaf coffee and no tissue roll. Communicating with house keeping was very difficult as he spoke no English. Called guest services again & they promised to take care everything,..nothing was taken care of. 7. We ordered food at the pool, the waitress could not speak good English and had no knowledge about the food. We asked three questions and were answered \"I DON'T KNOW\" without any effort trying to find out: A. Does tuna sandwich come with fries? B. How many pieces of the sate ? C. What type of bread comes with the club sandwich? 8. Once the food came, there was only 1 set of utensil. It took 15 minutes and 2 angry reminder to get chilly sauce and ketchup. Over all, this hotel is over rated. If you have stayed in Venetian Vegas, don't expect services to be even close. I am a regular there and a VIP player.

I made it clear again to the front desk that it is cancelled, but this did not prevent the hotel from charging the no show 1 night which I only realized the day after my departure. It took 11 emails to all that may be involved until finally, after 3 days, I received a confirmation that the charges will be reversed. There is absolutely no coordination between the reservations, accounting and front office departments. Getting there: There is a free shuttle service from the airport. Recommended. Runs every 30 minutes. Checking in: Check in time is 3PM. As most international flights arrive in the morning, don\u2019t rush to the hotel. One solution they suggest is to book an extra previous night. There is no real lobby to sit and relax while waiting for your room to be ready. It feels like a central train station. You can only sit in the crowded restaurant which provides the only sitting area in the lobby, spend time in the casino or shop in the mall. I was not even offered to store my luggage. I was told that they will call my mobile when the room is ready but they never did. After checking back at around noon, I finally got my room and was sent on my own to look for it between the 3 towers. The Room: A disappointment for the price paid, to say the least. Below average standard with bad finishing. Rooms will need a lift up soon. The bathroom fixtures are cheap and not fit for a 5 star hotel. The floor service was not to be seen for the 24 hours I was a guest and the Evening room turndown service was none existent. The Roof Top: This is the highlight of this wonderful architectural design. A must see. Swimming is something else. It is as crowded as the lobby. There is only one service restaurant in this huge area that allows you to enter in swimwear. For the other restaurants you are required to be properly dressed. The lounge chairs are basic and there isn\u2019t any shaded sitting in the poolside. The poolside service is good but slow. The Casino: Las Vegas, like the whole venue. The Restaurants: Very good food choices. 5 start service & Expensive. Location: Not convenient. The hotel is far away from the action and shopping area. Conclusion: Stay in a good hotel for less $$ and don\u2019t spend more than half an hour to visit, unless you are a casino fan.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms, amazing views, great service but overpriced food by the pool!\u201d", "Author": "Mitchy_10", "ReviewID": "UR116624339", "Content": "Marina Bay Sands - We paid heaps and expected heaps.

After all, we are there to use both the pool and the clubhouse. Anyway, ordered food from the poolside F&B which took 45minutes or more to come - much to slow service. And only came with 1 menu when there was a family of 5 waiting. Service needs to be improved.

First of all with regards to the shuttle from the airport my experience is that if you are travelling with young children and are in rush to get to the hotel after a long flight; you might not want to take this shuttle service. It makes multiple stops at the different terminals within the airport and waits to pick up other passengers. So an average 20 minute car ride can become 1 hour. The shuttle stops in the basement level of the hotel via a parking lot. It is quite chaotic and there is no clear signage from the basement level to the check in counter. After taking the escalator up, going left and then discovered after awhile we needed to go right, we made to the check in counter. It was here it started to go downhill, rapidly. It was 8:30 PM in the evening, and there were 5 check-in agents and the line I joined, I was next in line. It took 15 minutes before I was got the counter and the check process was extremely slow. When we asked the agent why it was so slow, we asked whether it was the computer system, she said yes and this was normal and also the hotel was fully booked and she needed to find a room for us. We had already booked two weeks prior and gave a credit card to guarantee the booking with the hotel reservations. We had emailed all requirements prior to our arrival about the need for a roll-away bed and a cot. After 15 minutes of standing waiting while the agent got us a room and were handed the keys, we were informed that if anything was taken out of the mini-bar and put back in, we still would be charged as it is an automatic min-bar system. We explained to the agent that we had young children and the agent confirmed that even if the children open the mini-bar and take something out by mistake and it was put back in immediately, we still would be charged. I explained to the agent that this was unacceptable, but she said I would have to take it up upon checkout with the hotel manager. As it was late, we decide not to go up to the room, but head to dinner and told the agent to send our bags up and make sure that the roll away bed and cot was in the room. We went to Rise restaurant in the lobby for dinner. It was a typical Las Vegas Style dinner buffet, average food and service. An hour later, we went to the room, and when we opened the door, the scent of stale smoke can be smelt, even though we were told it was a non-smoking room, and still the roll away bed and cot had not arrived. We had to call housekeeping to get them to deliver it. The room was on the 39th floor and had a great view and was modern and large. But looking closely at there was lot of evidence of poor workmanship in the construction. For example the base of the faucet in the sink completely turned around when you turn just the faucet on \u2013 see the attached a picture. Do not be surprise to see loose door handles in the common washrooms. For the kind of money being charged, you would expect some quality branded toiletry products, what was provided was quite inferior \u2013 see the attached photo. You would also expect that if you advised the hotel that you have children, they would provide necessities for children as well. Other hotels provide children shampoo, etc. Nothing was provided, not even a colouring book from Marina Sands Bay. We had breakfast the next morning at Rise \u2013 again it was an average buffet. There seems to be a lack of a la carte options. The last morning of our trip, we had breakfast on the 57th floor at the Sky restaurant - Great view and a slight change from Rise \u2013 smaller buffet, the opportunity to order a main course from a menu. Quality of food and service is the same, average. At one point I asked for cold water. The waiter proceeded to tell me the filtration system was not working so they would only serve bottled water. Told them that was fine and to ordered it. I waited more than 5 minutes and still no water. I went up to him and then he told me that he needs to know where I was sitting. There were only maybe 10 tables in the restaurant so he obviously forgot but made it seem like it was my problem. It finally did come he had split the bottle of water between 4 glasses and charged SGD $10. I absolutely have no problems paying money for good service and good amenities but none of those existed. The check out the next day was a complete nightmare. The queue was so long \u2013 it was utter chaos. We just did express check out. The hotel has great views and fantastic pool, but lacks in the area of providing personal service and a magnificent experience, and clearly does not anticipate your needs. If you want a weekend a way to enjoy The Lion King Show, the celebrity restaurants, Universal Studios and the casino, I would recommend that you do not need to stay at Marina Sands Bay \u2013 stay elsewhere. It worth the short taxi ride to get to Marina Sands Bay from fantastic hotels like Fullerton or the Four Seasons Hotel \u2013 they sure provide personal service, anticipate your needs and that magnificent experience.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penang", "Title": "\u201cJaw Dropping\u201d", "Author": "MrBuff", "ReviewID": "UR116591533", "Content": "First time in Singapore and first time at a hotel of this level, Unbelievable, seriously good, I was lucky enough to stay at a Club Level room, quality of room outstanding, & the view, did I mention the view, from 35 floors up, amazing, especially at night, the floor to ceiling windows are great, having Club Level rooom meant that we were able to use the Club Lounge on the 57th Floor adjacent to the pool for breakfast, afternoon tea & drinks in the late afternoon.

The ground floor is a mass of people and a bit of a zoo. The room was well appointed and a good size and also had a small balcony that looked over the large building site between the hotel and the sea. The food on the ground floor buffet type restaurants was good but it did feel as though you were eating in a large cafeteria...albeit with a spectacular atrium. The pool deck is very spectacular and you seem to be hovering right on the edge of the roof...some 55 stories up. The cafe on the roof terrace for a business breakfast was good...it would be easier if you let people book but there was no problem getting a table. Rather like the check in the check out was no fun and took 20 minutes to get through to the desk. You could do an express checkout if you didn't want to check your bill. The attached shopping mall I could see being a real attraction with every conceivable high-end label in the place. The Casino is also attached but I did not go in so cannot comment. Short cab ride into the Colliers Quay / Raffles area so being on the other side of the man-made 'bay' is no issue. In summary for business I would not stay there (despite the competitive rates). If I was on a stopover with the family they would lap it up and it would be good for a couple of nights.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MECHELEN", "Title": "\u201cOne in a lifetime.\u201d", "Author": "CHEOUX", "ReviewID": "UR116350480", "Content": "Yes, 2500 rooms makes this a factory hotel.

But unfortunately, it's just too big to provide this. Note that your just one of the few thousends staying their that night. So get ready for queing at check-in. My room on the 50th floor was spacious and had all a room needs. I had booked a smoking room but there wasn't one available. But no problem I was told; the room has a terrace. And that was great. Most rooms with seaview have these small terraces with large sliding windows. And a fantastic view. Quality of the bed is good; very large TV screen, coffee making facilities, minibar, etc. Spacious walk-in shower. One night I ordered room service (although there are plenty of restaurants) and enjoyed the quality fo the food. I in fact only ordered a minestrone soup (excellent!) and some sat\u00e9s. Ordering went without any problems and food was delivered within 15 minutes - on a trolley table. The other night I had dinner at \"Sky on 57\"; excellent but expensive food. After dinner we went to their terras for a few coffees, cognac and cigar. This is the place to be when seeking some more relaxing environment. Probably the only tranquile place in the hotel. For breakfast you need to be creative. The Rise restaurant offers good food and high varaity but the queing for 15 minutes and the very noisy environment makes it for me a \"never again\" experience. I did a late night check-out at tower 3 desk and that went without any queing. As I checked out prior to the expected time, they couldn't give me a bill yet but an invoice would be sent immediately -which I indeed got by mail before arrival back home. In short, I give this hotel a \"very good\" rating because it delivers beyond expectations for a 2500 rooms place. And of course mainly because of the infinity pool on the 57th.

Late check out was only granted for 30 Jul and I was told o check with the Premier Advantage desk again the next day for a possible late check out 31 Jul. It was amusing!!! I reckon the check in agent was probably new on the job and unfamiliar with the processes. It was resolved eventually. I resided in the Horizon Grand at Level 48, long and spacious in T3 overlooking the Marina Bay. Excellent view of the Fireworks without the smoke, perhaps due to the direction of the wind.

Sadly, complimentary evening cocktail ends at 7pm and I did not get to enjoy it. Jin Shan chinese restaurant serves delicious Cantonese cuisine. Sky Pool was crowded be it day or night. Ku De Ta which is next to the Sky Pool offers loud and good music. Check out at Premier Advantage desk was easy.

However, there are quite some bad sides about this hotel. Its size of Over 2500 rooms make it a very impersonal experience.

Granted, we were offered a SGD 50 voucher and a complimentary late check out two days later, but only after seriously complaining and calling the front-office manager. One of our rooms (we had two) had a strong smoking smell and could not be cleaned. The lobby is like an airport. Checking in is like doing so for a low cost carrier and do count 30min at least. Many staff do not speak Enlish. We had to queue for breakfast, only to get an improvised table at the bar. Food was average and the second day we went for breakfast at the Fullerton Hotel in front, even if we had breakfast includedin our rate. The pool is worth the experience but really only once. It is crowded like a Chinese public pool on a holiday and apart from the view, really isn't special. The many non-hotel guests passing by really is disturbing.

When we checked-in they asked if we wanted a third bed ($100SG/night), we asked how big the beds were and were told \"Just a little smaller than a queen\", which was not true at all! However we were too cheap to pay an extra $100 on top of what we were paying given we had booked for 3 people. Another gripe is the fact that wi-fi is not included and must be bought as part of a ridiculous $30 resort fee. Breakfast was another sore point, with the only option seemingly available an expensive buffet breakfast ($35++), although the food was fantastic.

Perhaps non-guests should only be allowed on the observation deck and not in the pool area. The staff were friendly and it was immaculately presented.

We were very excited to go, however, when we walked in the hotel didn't at all feel like you are walking into a hotel. The so called lobby looked more like a mall with no hotel staff to welcome guests and guide them where to go. There was no clear signage as well on where we should go to check in. Finally after roaming around for few minutes I saw someone sitting at some far desk went there and asked her where do we go for check in and she guided us. There was a long queue, however, during the wait there were staff going around offering guests juice, water and wet wipes which was nice and refreshing. When it was our turn, the frontline staff offered us a free upgrade and for that she requested us to wait for 2 hours. We accepted the deal although we all were exhausted after an 8 hours flight and promised that she will be caling us when the room is ready. We decied to go to the mall and have lunch while waiting for the call. After almost 3 hours wit not receiving a call we went back to the lobby and waited in the long queue again. The lady who served us initially was not there so we went to another one to check and right away she gave us the room access. We went to the room only to find that the room was a regular room and not the one we were promised to get. We were extremely dsappointed and called the frontdesk to inquire. They were not able to help us as they said they didn't have anyting in record ad the lady who served us initially was not there to check with her. Inside the room the furniture was again another disappointment. It had no harmony, was not comfortable and it felt like the hote just wanted to start business so they collected some pieces of furniture from different stores. We had a sea view room which was amazing and there was a laser show on the sea on daily basis which we were able to see from the room and was nice The breakfast was again another disappointment as it mostly caters for asians. If you are not used to eating meats and curries at 08:00 a.m. then this is surely not your place. There was a tiny section which had English breakfast but it was not exceptional.

But with all the people inside the lobby (check in looks like economy section of an airport terminal, with snaking throngs of people) and the sightseeers crawling all over the 57th floor (the Skypark) , MBS's capacity to recognise guests individually and give the kind of personal service you would expect from world class hotels is largely diminished. Up at the skypark pool you can scarcely move for tourists in the long narrow stretch alongside the pool - it has the ambience therefore of a public swimming pool (crowded, screaming kids) If I could ask Marina Bay to improve just ONE thing it would be to limit tourist access to just the 'nose' of the skypark and not let them anywhere near the pool, so as to protect guests' privacy and to help foster some kind of tranquility poolside. its a curiousity factor to have an infinity pool at the 57th level, and an amazing view of course, but it you want serenity or class you'd be better at the Ritz Carlton . So that's the pool. Rooms are a good standard and size and tastefully decorated , but would benefit from a bit more technology . The beds however are marvellous! And I did notice that despite being on a non smoking floor, there were cigarette burns inthe deep pile carpet and the smell of smoke in my room in the evening sometimes was noticeable. I was not the only one talking of this in my group. The mini bar is weighted - you are charged for anything you lift out and there's not space to put anything in of your own. Allow one hour for room service. It's a vast hotel and this has clear impacts for the time it takes to order food and wait for it to arrive!! Business facilities in the convention centre are stellar - if you are there for business this is a faultess venue with an outstanding conferencing team. And the proximity to the Shoppes at Marina Bay gives the opportunity to eat or dine at either the extravagant or economical end of the spectrums. the food court is fantastic and cheap.

Walking into the lobby, we thought wow, checking time is 3pm, so when we got there a hugh queue to check-in, we where given a glass of champagne to drink while waiting lovely touch, but nothing offered to our son to drink. Once we got to the desk after about 20mins the staff where very friendly and effecient. We headed to our room on the 54th floor, entered the room, put of key card in the slot and the curtains automatically open to the most amazing view, very clever bar fridge if you lift any thing for more than 30 seconds it automatically charges that item to your room account. The room was massive, horizon grand, but small things let it down. Big stain on the carpet when you first walk in, bearing in mind hotel only 12 months old, I'm sure it could of been removed in that time. Beautiful bathrooms but again one of the light fittings beside the mirror was falling off the wall. Just a few small things nothing to spoil our holiday but it was noticable for the price of a room and new hotel I would not expext these things. We headed up to the pool, wow but so crowed, you can hardly move, people can pay $20 to come up to the sky deck to see the pool and view so the first 3/4 of the pool is for everyone so big families, groups all screaming so we headed down to the guest only pool, peace at last, got comfortable on the sun chairs go to go for a swim but told no children allowed in this pool you have to go to the other end. We have one 10yr old son, not young screaming kids, just 1 child who just wanted to go for a swim, so we had to move to the other end. No chairs available to lie, then finally a family left so we got some chairs. So noisy I felt like i was in a shed full of geese. Not very pleasant at all. Kids kept jumping in and splashing, screaming, yelling. Yes it is nice to have a adult pool away from kids I totally agree, but make a guest area with children available to the guests as well. We are still paying guest with a child. There is a great food court under the hotel, so many outlets to choose from from all around Asia, but again no where to sit. There is a skating rink in the middle of the food court which had about 4 kids skating on it. Great concept but not in the middle of a popular food court, move the rink and add more tables. The food was beautiful, but when you are 3/4 finished people start hoovering next to you waiting for you to leave so they can have you table. Not very enjoyable experience. We did go back there the next day for lunch not as busy but nobody on the rink. Total waste of space. Our main reason staying at marina bay sands was to see the lion king stage production which was fantasic. Not sure if still playing but highly recommend to see.

My girl was so scared that she kept crying. Even the corridor outside our room was completely dark. And the phone in the room couldn't be used so we couldn't call to ask what had happened. Lifts also stopped working and we could hear people banging on the door whom I presume were trapped inside the lift. We had no information and no idea what had happened and how long it will last.

The lobby looked more like a prestigious office building rather than a hotel. I got in line at the check in desk and was eventually at the front of the queue. The member of staff was very inefficient and slow, the whole process was irritating... and I was paying $1000 per night for this.

At least there were plenty of little shops/boutiques/cafe/restaurants. The suite itself was very nice, large and roomy and decorated in a modern style. It had all you could want from a hotel room. They called it a suite but it was really a very large room. the bed was very comfortable. and the internet was included. So far all is ok, but certainly not worth $1000. Until you get the the roof, that was amazing! its huge, across the top of the whole hotel. It has numerous restaurants and bars and a nightclub. There are some infinity pools that looks like the water is falling off the top edge of the building.. the view is amazing. There also some hot tub/jacuzzi scattered around, overlooking the cityscape. The rooftop has the wow factor. Overall, the hotel is very expensive, too much like an office building and the service lacks, but the rooms are very nice and the rooftop is amazing, and there is a large casino opposite (maybe a part of the hotel). I don't think I would stay here again as the expense is not justified by the experience and the lack of good service and its a little out of the way from the areas where you are likely to have a wonder around.

Nice if you're not in a hurry as they need to go through 4 terminals for pick-ups before heading down to the hotel. Arrived around 1pm.

Many thanks to John for his attentiveness and service (the girl at the lobby check-in counter had no clue what I was supposed to do when my room was ready). Loved the spacious room and sofa bed.

Apparently, an unpleasant one. Being a singaporean, I chose MBS hotel as my choice for an enjoyable hang out with good friend thinking that it'd offer us the best service since it's under the Sands group. Even though the facilities in MBS is excellent, they do not have excellent staff to deliver it. We were very disappointed and I'm very sure we will not be patronising MBS hotel again. When we checked in, the front desk staff, Mijuana, offered us a free upgrade to superior room because they do not have a deluxe room ready for us. We DID NOT expect our pleasant surprise at check-in will turn to a 'surprise' during check-out. Do not trust the words of the front desk! They claimed free but charged us the upgraded room fees. We did an online booking of the $399 nett summer package and it comes with 2 complimentary drinks at skypark restaurant and SGD50 credit. Mijuana reminded us about the complimentary drinks we're entitled to in our package but did not remind herself to give us the drink coupons required at the restaurant. We waited almost half an hour for the staff to deliver the drink coupons to us. This is not room service. Are they printing the coupons? Why do they need such a long time? We utilised the SGD50 credit on room service thinking nothing would go wrong. It still went wrong. A $399 nett package amount to almost $600 at check-out. We spent easily half an hour standing at the front desk to check-out. The staff,Joy, claimed that there isn't a summer package of $399 nett and commented that I had seen it wrongly maybe it's $399++. I'm paying money to get accused of cheating MBS. She even commented there isn't any $399 package there is only a $339++ package. The manager, Marie, came and I thought everything would be well settled. She said they will honour my word $399 BUT $399 before all the tax and services. In the end, they realised after tax and services $339++ would amount to $399. So I commmented I didn't see wrongly it was really $399 nett that I saw. Joy explained maybe it's the marketing gimmick and only the consumers would be able to see the $399nett.

I got the free bus from Changi Airport & was greeted at the reception upon checking in with a hot towel & glass of champagne. My room had spectacular views over the water & also came with a Nespresso coffee machine with several coffee pods. I checked in the early evening so I missed the cocktail party on the first night so I showered & headed to the Casino. You have to carry your passport to gain entry & was told I must have a collored shirt & long pants which I did. I was a bit miffed as upon gaining entry all the locals were in shorts & t-shirts. Never mind, the place was buzzing, very loud music, machines going off every few seounds & the place was packed. The gym was state of the art & ALL the staff were very friendly througout the resort, I made it to the cocktail party on the last night & was greeted with pink champagne & there was an assortment of finger food, from crab to cavier. After the champers I decided on a cocktail but there are none on offer, so better still they had JD on the menu, thankyou. The drinks last for 2 hours so I got plenty under my belt because after that they charge $s18 per nip. At the end of the skypark there is a nightclub which was packed but the JD's in there were $s26, pretty pricey.

Worst still, that very night, all the elevators in our tower broke down due to a power surge - they went only to the top and ground floors.

After all that and finally reaching our room, our night was plagued with flickering lights and an air-conditioning system that would spontaneously switch itself off.

The electrician came the next morning and declared this to be a fault of the main switch control panel and fixed it.

Check in queues seem to be very long otherwise. We asked for a room overlooking the Bay and were given room 3855 in Tower 2. Each tower has 6 lifts which are very quick and you have to pop your ears! Our room on 38th floor was amazing, the biggest room we have stayed in Singapore with king bed, desk and chair, sofa and coffee table plus buffet with TV. The views were amazing despite I would make the curtains to open fully. They are automatic and sort of leave the sides of the window covered....we have pulled them behind the desk and a little side table so the whole window was open to the beautiful view. The view is amazing during the day but even more beautiful during evenings and nights. Our bathroom was huge with big bath, double sinks, seperate toilet and seperate shower. Expresso machine is provided if that's what you like and lots of toiletries, the soap is a different shape :) We could access the Club daily for breakfast 6:30 - 11 AM, afternoon tea 2 - 4:30 PM and evening drinks (alcoholic one included) and canapes from 5 - 7 PM. All is in a form of a buffet and the staff is very friendly and very attentive, the alcoholic drinks come very quickly and the staff is quick to top them up but the non alcoholic ones come in a slower pace possibly because most people want the alcoholic ones :) We enjoyed the food and didn't eat anywhere else. The pool is for use by guests only and is quite full especially during afternoon, the best is to go early morning or after 9 PM...it's open till 11 PM and most guests seem to come already dressed in their bathers with bathrobes wrapped around them. Pool towels are provided and so is some water which we didn't try. Talking about water, the tap water is absolutely foul, never before we experienced such a horrible tasting and smelling water in any other hotel in Singapore. They do provide two bottles of water a day about 600ml each which we used for teethbrushing. The pool is amazing, water seems very warm in the morning and afternoon but not in the evening. The service in the hotel is not what you would call personal, it's a huge hotel, more like a resort. We expected this after reading reviews and didn't come out disappointed like some other customers. The Club staff is very good, they remember your name and room number after only few visits. My husband used the health club and said it was very good. We booked Lux package which included a free bottle of champagne and one free chocolate bar for two at the Club. The champagne was nice, provided with some strawberries but the chocolate bar was a bit too much...too much chocolate, too sweet....The cupcakes at the Club were much nicer.

While you're staying at the hotel you get 10% discount at the Art and Science Museum entry where is Salvatore Dali exhibition at the moment ( plus Van Gogh light show exhibition and Shipwrecked exhibition which is very good). I believe you get some discount on the Lion King show also. The Shoppes shopping centre across the road is quite empty and there is an iceskating ring plus a nice water feature. Make sure you go and watch the Wonder Full light show which is in front of the shopping centre every day at 8 and 9:30 PM plus Fridays and Saturdays at 11PM also.

When we first started planning we decided to overnight in Singapore expressly to stay at Marina Bay Sands (the media machine having done its job nicely) so our agent booked us a Premier Horizon Room, specifying a city view. let's get one thing straight. This place is big. There are entire suburbs in Brisbane with a lower population than this hotel and when we arrived the foyer was thronged with literally hundreds of guests and visitors. The thought of waiting in the massive check-in queue was quite daunting but within moments a staff member approached the end of the line and suggested we walk down to Tower Three, which we did. At T3 we were served after a short wait but we were told that our room did not have a city view because \u2018those rooms are subject to availability\u2019. I read Trip Advisor before leaving home and it seems that this happens quite regularly so I stood firm and pointed out that our only reason for being in Singapore was to stay there, and four months in advance should have been sufficient time to ensure availability. A city view room was eventually located but we were told we could not check in until 7pm because the room was still being cleaned. My (cheeky) response was that I was quite prepared to have the room for only half the time as long as they were prepared to refund me half the tariff. To gave the staff their due, they were unswervingly polite and friendly and when it became obvious that I wasn\u2019t going to be loud or rude but I wasn\u2019t going to give in either, they got rid of the problem (me) by upgrading us to a suite in Tower One; city view and all. Moral to the story: be very nice, but make sure you persist. The suites consist of the usual two rooms, bathroom and dressing room and the entire space was flooded with natural light. The view was stunning. Our room looked directly across the harbour to the lion and at night the vista really is something to behold. Amenities are 5 star standard with a few extra little touches, like a Nespresso machine. The bathroom suite was gorgeous. I don\u2019t usually bother with hotel toiletries but the shower gel was so nice that I took the unopened bottle with me to use during our travels. My only real criticism of the suite is connected to the rather strange lighting arrangement. The bathroom is full of mirrors and very well lit, but it doesn\u2019t have a power point for a hairdryer. The dressing room has a hairdryer in the wardrobe and the whole thing lights up like a landing strip, but it doesn\u2019t have a mirror. The bedroom has a mirror, but the lighting is so dim you literally can\u2019t read or do anything that requires use of actual eyesight. Odd. I always read before I go to sleep, so I was thankful I had brought my iPad! We had a dinner reservation booked at Jumbo for 6.30 so my son lost no time going up to the roof and leaping into the pool while I got ready. The pool is wonderful, but don\u2019t expect any personal space. It is full of people at all times day and night and many of them are clearly there just to \u2018see and be seen\u2019. Not my cuppa. We went back up at around 10.30pm in the hope that the crowd might have thinned, but it hadn\u2019t. Next morning we had breakfast at the buffet which was a great mix of east meets west and possibly one of the best we have ever had. Check-out was flawless and overall the entire experience was quite an event. Look, I have to be honest. This is a gigantic hotel with literally thousands of rooms and heaven only knows how many people staying there at any one time. Now that I\u2019ve ticked it off the \u2018to do\u2019 list, I\u2019ll head back to one of the smaller character hotels next time. Marina Bay Sands is impressive, architecturally stunning, and the staff is wonderful (several of them picked us out of the crowd and acknowledged us every time we walked past, which is pretty good work considering there as just as many onlookers as guests wandering around at any given moment) but overall this hotel is a monolithic tourist trap and far too big a machine to be entirely to my liking. BTW don\u2019t expect the MBS shopping centre to open at its advertised time. I dashed over to spend an hour there before we left, only to find that \u2018opening hours 10.30am \u2013 whenever\u2019 really means \u2018we\u2019ll probably open at some stage today but it certainly won\u2019t be any earlier than 10.30\u2019.

We found the front desk staff do not explain much int he way the hotel worked, like how to swipe the cards in the lift then pick your floor. Or the minibar is computerised so if you iontend to take drinks out to cool your own, make sure you tell them and have it noted on the computer, otherwise you will be charged. Also on our departure we found out they do take your bags to your room, it just happened on our arrival no one offered to store and transport the bags so we had to lug them from the basement up to check in and then onto our rooms, so make sure the staff deliver your bags as its a long way to walk. The room staff are all willing to help, even though they speak little english and all offer lovely smiles. The complex Is HUGE!!! so put on comfortable shoes to walk around and have plenty of money to spend as the shops at Marina Bay Sands are all exclusive and xxxxxeee. The food court is GREAT!! Lots of choice and clean and cheap. You could eat there every night of your stay. Make sure your choose the right room for your stay as they will try and get you to upgrade when you see guests having breakfast/afternoon tea in the skypark, otherwise you will be stuck having to battle for a table on the ground floor if you don't venture out and into Orchard Road/Chinatown/Boat Quay etc ec. The view from the City side are mind numbing, especially the night time when the lights of Singapore are on. Once the construction on the sea side is completed it should be just as magic. The MRT (train system) will be a big bonus once it is completed, right outside of the front door which will be a big bonus for those wanting to venture out. It is supposed to be coming from the airport so this will also be terrific. If you stay here, you must swim in the infinity pool, 57 floors above ground level and make sure you take your camera as the skypark is also a must, the views of Singapore unbelievable. Yes, we will definitely go back and stay in the Club Rooms, more expensive but the breakfast and afternoon teas make up for it, we loved our time there and only hope they keep improving their services.

Sadly these are the only things that impress. This is a large and busy hotel, but sadly the staff and management don't appear to be up to the job. Breakfast - the one meal that every hotel should get right - is a good example. Hotel guests queue to get into the main restaurant on the ground floor. Not to wait for a table, but simply because there are not enough staff to escort guests to those that are available. Service is often slow, staff are unaware of what is happening around them (you are at constant risk of staff turning round into you with hot coffee, dirty plates etc) and 'hot' food from the hotplates is often cold. There is no visible management presence - which must be a significant part of the problem. General repair and cleanliness is also poor. Despite being relatively new it's all too common to see loose decor and trim around the hotel. The same piles of dirt were clearly visible in public areas day after day. The \"junior suite\" I was provided with had a glass coffee table in which bits of dried up rice and clipped fingernails had become trapped. No-one seemed to notice or be concerned. Presumably this is, again, due to management sitting in their offices rather than walking the floors of the hotel - inexcusable in any hotel, but particularly one selling itself as 'premium'. Finally rooms on the lower floors that face out over the East Coast Parkway to the new gardens development are noisy day and night through a combination of traffic noise and construction work.

Our first 8 nights was spent at the Swissotel Merchant Court which is about a 10minute drive from the Marina. First impressions with the MBS were excellent. The building alone is a magnificent structure and we found ourselves in complete awe of the place. Check in was pretty painfree and took under 10minutes to get our room key. However they didn't advise that our credit card would be charged an additional $100. It wasn't until we left the hotel and were out of the country to discover this. We phoned the accounts staff who ensured this $100 was a security bond and would be refunded immediately. We are still waiting for this to happen and it is almost 2 weeks since our trip. Our room was great. Nice beds. Huge flat screen tv. We initially asked for a twin share and were given a king. The view from the room was magnificent but be warned you have to pay extra to get a room with a view! The skylounge rooftop is one of a kind. The service not so great. We had to ask several waiters for a drinks menu and it never came. The lady at the gifts skylounge gift shop couldn't be bothered serving me as she was too busy talking to her friend. I was prepared to spend abit of money on souvenirs and she told me to come back later. Overall we found the staff not very friendly compared to our previous hotel the Swissotel. Their staff greeted us daily and asked how our stay was and if there was anything they could do to help. They genuinely wanted us to enjoy our stay which we did. We spent 1 night and 2 days at the MBS due to it being so expensive. We couldn't go to Singapore and not stay there. If you want to eat and drink there be prepared to spend alot of money. I would suggest going to the Marina shopping mall as the food court is very cheap with a great selection of food. It will take you around 6 minutes to walk there.

Having seen so many poor reviews, I wanted to take some time to provide travelers with some tips from experience to make your vacation perfect. Hope this is useful. 1. Asking for a room with a view of the city during reservations does not guarantee that you will get it. It is on a first come first serve basis. So don't get upset when you get to the hotel and they don't give you a city facing room. However, all three times I have requested the reception politely and with a smile and they have found a room for me with a great view. Traveling on weekdays increases your chances. 2. Avoid the free airport shuttle to the hotel. It is free and convenient, but the drivers are rude and the service is very slow. Take a taxi. You will get to the hotel much faster and it'll cost you $20. 3. On my previous stay, our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 12 pm. I asked the reception if i could go to the pool while we wait for the room. They gave us dummy keys that allowed us to the pool. I noticed that people who didn't ask for these dummy keys to the pool did not get them. So ask! 4. I agree with a previous review that if you don't want to wait for breakfast you should try to get to Rise restaurant before 8am. The food there is unbelievable! The lunch and dinner buffet are unbelievably bad value for money! And most of the dishes are cold. The cooks at the Chinese noodle stations are not very chatty or friendly. 5. The pool is very crowded with hotel guests. But with 2500 rooms, what would you expect! And this is the main attraction for many, but it is unreasonable to be expecting privacy. However they do have an adult only section of the pool which is closest to the kudeta restaurant (which by the way is the pinnacle of bad service and overpriced drinks and not managed by marina bay sands). The adult pool is more relaxing as the kids are at the other pools. 6. The concierge service at the hotel is fantastic. They are the best I have ever experienced. They will do anything you need them to do and with a smile. Saraswathy at the concierge desk is really good at what she does and I can't wait to see her again. 7. Oh, ask for a room in tower 1 or in tower 2. All rooms in tower 3 come without a bath tub. 8. We had a rental during our vacation and used the valet service. These guys ar great. But they don't allow you to call down before leaving the room for your car.

Enjoy the free champagne offered at the reception instead of spoiling your mood about the queue. I had 3 glasses and they didn't mind giving me more! 2. One way to get a great deal is the club room - $200 more but worth every cent 3. Go for breakfast before 8 am to avoid the long queues 4. Use the express checkout form. Great way to avoid the queues! 5. Enjoy the Jacuzzi at the sky park. The pool is crowded, but the jacuzzi area is quiet and gives some privacy. Also, the reviews that say that there are tourists at the pool with cameras are untrue. The pool is only for hotel guests. 6. I saw the bar at Buena vista musical show at the theatre.

Another thing which I think is ridiculous is the sensor in the minibar. If you move any of the bottles in the minibar and don't put them back in the right place in 30 seconds, you get charged for that. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and this is the weirdest thing i have ever heard of. Anyway, overall service is at high standard and staff were polite. I would like thank the concierge and operator for their assistance during my staff. Also, the bell boys and the front desk were also helpful.

It's a pain that you have to deal with this nonsense issues upon arriving home. It's not that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. It is a shame that Marina Bay Sands is such an iconic building but it is let down its customer service team. Management, especially HR should immediately work on to address and improve their area of customer service as it is vital to its organasation as well as tourism of Singapore as a whole.

Check in is a disaster and it seems that it's just one desk and there are either lots of trainees or no one knows what they are doing. They also tried to tell us that there were no city view rooms available as they were being cleaned. We persisted and they said that they would put us on the waiting list (approx 3 hrs) and would offer us late check out to make up for the delay. Miraculously a city view room became free and we were able to take it. I wonder where the actual situation lies here - Somewhere between them just wanting to convince people to take sea view rooms, or maybe they have been offering late checkout to so many people that a cascade of late checkins throughout that side of the building has become the result. Hmmmm. Once checked in your next impressions will be better. We liked our room (a bit dated already but big and comfortable), and our view of the city. The skypark is very cool, and 1/3 of the pool does not allow children so you can escape that if you like. The mai tais by the pool were good. Our bed was plush, and we ordered breakfast for the room (it's not included as standard) and it was about 20 dollars each and arrived on time, hot and was very tasty (I can recommend the eggs benedict). So there are many good points to outweigh the bad point of checking in. But that check in was so tedious that I think I would probably recommend you to find someone to try and do it for you, or to organise a late checkin/out in advance!

Luckily I only stayed there for 2 nights. Reasons: 1. Long time to check-in, with only 4 staffs trying to serve the long line of guests. 2. Terrible breakfast because there are no food, no plate, no cup, no juice, no bread, no nothing. I've never been to a hotel which was so overbooked that they just could not cope with the demands. My child have to eat the leftover corn flakes on the table in order to fill her stomach because we could not wait any longer. Whenever there is refill coming, everyone has to cut in to get the food. That is worse than a detention camp. I do not blame the staff becuase they could not do a thing. The MANAGEMENT should take responsibility for what's happening... or they should go and take a look at the buffet resturant in the morning. I think all the guests had been very patient but not without complaining to each other about their stay and the quality of the food. 3. The interior of the hotel is, sorry to say, very bare. I am in the design business and being minimal is not what it looks like. The long and narrow corridor is very distrubing and dinning out with millions of people walking pass you wasn't a pleasant experience, not when you are paying a premium price for having a bite. 4. Sky garden - the biggest disappointment. For those who want to pay over $20 Singapore dollars to look at a long linear walkway (another corridor) with a few trees, please reconsider. It's OK if you're stay there and get free pass to the pool. Otherewise, forget it. The reason why I picked MBS was its proximity to the museum and the Lion King Show which I enjoyed very much. But I was deeply regretted that I made a wrong decision. I should have stayed in other 5-stars hotel which I could start my days with quality food and services, rather than spending my energy trying to fight for bad leftover for my family. One piece of advice: Skip the buffet breakfast if you already confirmed your hotel booking with MBS.

I have a Club room in tower 2 overlooking the city. The room is very spacious, clean, uncluttered and appointed with everything any guest could want, including a large TV, work desk, tea and coffee and a Nespresso machine plus the obligatory and essential iron and ironing board. The bathroom is also very spacious with a double sink, large bathtub and both the shower and toilet have doors. Internet access is also free for Club room guests and I assume for Suites too. I have a room with a connecting door to the next room and the family staying in the next room had a young child who seemed to have the need to cry all night which was a bit annoying, but other than that one night I wasn't disturbed by noise. The lobby is huge and the main entrance at tower 1 gets especially busy with a lot of people who seem to linger around but overall the lobby isn't really as bad as some have made out. The Sky Park is spectacular and the Infinity Pool is an experience not to be missed. The Club lounge is also excellent serving a good variety of breakfast foods. The pool wasn't really that crowded even over the weekend and it is exclusively for guests only so claims to the contrary are not true. The shopping complex is massive with every famous brand you can imagine. The food court is also very good but more expensive than the hawkers I prefer to eat at. The Casino was packed on the weekend which was to be expected but during the week days especially during the day its much less crowded. Remember to take your passport with you if you go to the Casino, entry is free for foreigners but you will need your passport. I cannot fault the service, all the staff I have encountered have been very helpful, friendly and genuinely respectful. Just a few minutes ago I called Priority Services requesting more tea and coffee sachets as I had used all I had and within 10 minutes I had room service deliver a whole tray full, and just now Priority Services called to ask if the tea and coffee had been delivered. Being a Club room guest I was able to check in at the VIP reception so it was very quick and efficient. I did notice queues at the normal reception desks but over the past 5 days I haven't seen the huge long queues that some have complained about. I have often had the need to take a taxi to somewhere in town and as yet I haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes although its rather annoying that some guests jump the queue by not doing the right thing and waiting at the designated waiting line. My one and only gripe is the hotel charged my credit card account for a fee which I had no knowledge of and when I called to find out what that fee was I was told no such fee had been charged by the hotel and yet its there on my bank statement. I have since instructed my bank to cancel the charge. It was a little annoying as my bank charges a foreign transaction fee which isn't much but a waste none the less. This is a very large hotel so if you're looking for something more intimate then the MBS is probably not for you. However I have been more than satisfied and I would have no problem staying here again. Having said that I am also not as picky and hard to please as many other reviewers seem to be. My advice is to do your research first. A lot seem to complain about trivial issues that could have been avoided had they taken the time to get their facts straight, while others have made claims that are just simply untruths.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rosenberg, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThis is the best hotel I've ever stayed at.\u201d", "Author": "coolhandandrew", "ReviewID": "UR115059740", "Content": "Marina Bay Sands is incredible.

There were a few hit and misses, more misses, and if it weren't for the infinity pool, our stay would not have been as satisfying. Our first impression was - it was BIG. Large foyers, tall ceilings... It certainly caters for the masses (casino enthusiasts was our impression), and that is where the personal, friendly service is lost. Yes, it has all of the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel, but we thought their service was a let down. What we enjoyed: (1) Complimentary airport shuttle service (2) Our upgrade from Atrium to Horizon room, though it looked just like any 4-5* (corporate) hotel. (3) Infinity pool - well worth the rest and relaxation, particularly from the heat and humidity. There is a section for families and a section for adults only, so it caters for all groups. The view of Singapore is great! What we disliked: (1) Lack of quality customer service from a 5* hotel, i.e. no smiles from receptionist, no doorman. (2) There is no close MRT and is somewhat further away from places such as Orchard Road and Chinatown. Catching a taxi is easy enough, except our Sunday night after dinner when a taxis was hard to find, we ended up catching an MRT to Marina Bay and walking 10-15min along a construction road to our hotel. Not exactly a nice return back to 5*.! (3) Having to pay for internet access, particularly for the price you pay. (4) Bad room temperature control (always around 25-26 degrees despite our attempts to change the temperature gage). If we return to Singapore, we would not stay at the MBS again. For the money we paid, we would be much happier staying in another 5* hotel closer to an MRT and more amongst the thick of things.

Sky pool is impressive and the room is good. However, when it comes to billing, it's my worst experience. Here are some of my comments. 1. The hotel policy is non-refundable and non-cancelable. So, be very careful and read T&C before you make final booking. 2. It's fully charged many weeks to my credit card account. With that, there's no way you can fight if you want to cancel or change the date of stay. (I guess the advance charge supports the non-cancelable polity of the hotel). 3. The billing is really mess up and made me really upset. I was charged again on the end of 1st night for the amount of 2,3xx singapore dollars (even though I have to pay around 370 singapore dollar and I booked only 3 nights). Don't know where that amount came from. Here is more story and be very careful when dealing with the hotel directly. Don't know why big hotel like this has very bad billing system. I was fully charged for 3 nights at least 1-2 weeks before showing up. However, on the 1st day of my stay (even though I didn't show up), there was another charge of 2,3xx S dollar to my account. On the next day, I called so many times but the hotel transfered me back and forth between many departments. No one seem to know what's going on and blame other department. Good management, right? Finally (after 6 calls, look like the problem is solved but the hotel staff still didn't know what happened to my extra charge. The worst thing came when I checked out, Cashier said I have to be charged for 3 nights since I haven't paid yet. Wonderful, after 6 calls (from overseas), I was double charged again. I spent lot of time talking and complaining until they believe they already charged my account.

Huge noisey foyer with many people around all hours of the day and night, not very personal and lacks the WOW factor, very clinical with no warm and cosy atmosphere. Restaurants are very expensive as are the drinks, could only afford to have one each night. We ate at the food court, quite a long walk to get there but very cheap with a large choice of local food if that's what you like. Has a skating ring alongside, good if you have children. Went into the casino to take a look (we don't gamble). Nearly every second person smoked, couldn't get out of there quicky enough. I thought smoking was banned in these places!

This hotel lacks some of the personal touches of other cheaper hotels such as chocolates on your pillow at night, daily delivery of a newspaper and turning down your bed at night. Quite a walk to the MRT (train station) but taxis I found to reasonable for getting around and there were plenty of them available. We used the business centre for the internet, you get 3 hrs free/day which was more than adequate for us. We wouldn't stay there again as we just wanted the experience of trying it at least once. It was quite pleasant but the money spent wasn't justified. As far as recommending it to others, everyone needs to make that choice themselves. I did read comments from Trip Advisor before we chose this hotel. This site is fantastic and I use it all the time. The funny thing is, is that Marina Bay Sands encourages its guests to post comments on this site, can't be doing its reputation too good looking at the latest comments. I hope they are taking note and will implement changes to ensure a more pleasant stay.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Experience, Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "drumDW", "ReviewID": "UR114693791", "Content": "This hotel is definitely one of a kind!

I woke up with a stiff neck 12. lavatory fixtures have started to loosen (I guess those were the low-end type) 13. Used marble tiles for the bathroom and there wasn't any anti-slip mat in the shower. 14. no litter bin and bidet spray next to the watercloset 15. Skypark was overrated!!

Literally hundreds of people are up there to catch the stupendous view. And the pool is just too small to cope for a hotel this size. I'd hate to swim in a pool packed like sardines.

Only hotel guests can go to the pool, make a short stay in MBS then move elsewhere. I agree with many posters, impersonal 1-star chaotic service. The hardware of the hotel is ok. To sum up it \u2013 SERVICE is poor, you pay for the pool and skypark experience, stay short then move elsewhere for much quality service and hardware in town. Free airport shuttle - at every 30mins. proceed to the COACH area at Changi airport. Business center ~ we later found out guest/room (not sure) can have up to 3 hours of internet I presume per stay. It is not 24 hours. CHECK IN~~ the worst experience in my travel life. The check-in area in the lobby floor traversing the 3 towers is like a zoo. No clear signage for check-in desk. I asked the staff floating in the lobby where to check-in, but I was told to ask myself. WOW, what a service Later we found out there were 3 check-in desks in the lobby the pm we arrived. We line-up for more than 50mins. So little staff. The hug hotels in Vegas handle more check-in guests, but service was swift. The management needs to seriously rectify this problem. Staff did NOT inform us of business center, laser show nor any other facilities or service. NO info in rooms as well. Below par. BELL Serivce ~~ IF you are not SUPER VIP don't expect efficient Bell service like in Japan other Asian hotels. ROOM - I believe rooms in Tower 1&2 are better/higher grade room for they are with balcony but outside corridor. We were in an end unit in Tower 3, with a sweeping view of the city and Marina Bay. It is only a 14-mth old hotel, but wear&tear shown in the furniture and fixture. What a shame! Housekeeping work is under-par. There is a electricity socket compartment on the desk which is really good comparing with many hotel rooms are so short of AC sockets. BUT it was filled with digusting dust and crumbs\u2026 NO map/floor plan of the hotel and the adjacent Shoppe/Casino complex. No info on business center, internet charge (S$30/day) nor shuttle service to airport. The carpet is not clean, I spotted multiple debris in it, for I never heard the housekeeping staff vaccum throughout the day he works on the floor while we walked in and out frequently. I doubt the carpet is cleaned regularly. Water/soap stain on the faucet. There was a filthy white tissue or paper stuck on the stainless steel toilet roll cover, I just forgot to take a photo of it. Filthy.... The management should demand the staff for detailed (not to say meticulous) housekeeping work!!!! Bathrobes, slippers are good. Tea/Coffee making facilities are quality. The aircon was not working properly with a drooming sound at night. Room temp was at 26C. We had to call a technician. Room Service ~ not swift, but the food was fairly good given it was in the middle of the night. Mid-night menu was very limited, Hainan Chicken Rice was not even on the menu for midnight service. *-* Restaurant s ~~ If your room package includes breakfast , esp your stay includes a weekend, go to Rise the restaurant to line up early. It was like a circus. CHAOTIC is the word. If it is not complimentary , enjoy a more relaxing breakfast elsewhere. The food was general. We line-up for 30mins for a table, briefly settle in a table , upon we return from getting food from the buffet, our table was cleared, Oh, My!!!! The small card w our room # & info was still in the glass indicating the table is occupied. Restaurant Manager should have better management and training to staff. Sky57 on the topfloor observation floor was not impressive, I assume it is more fine dining. But it is a sitdown fastfood. Terrible. Osteria Mozza ~Italian restaurant in the Shoppe (the adjacent mall) , stone-oven pizza is good. Overall the service in the gift or cake shop in the lobby area is unattentive. I walked away 3 times from the cake shop for the staff all clustered at the back of the shop, despite I stood there for more than 7-10 mins patiently. Are they too busy?? Not really. CONCIERGE ~ not very knowledgeable, they only suggest restaurants & service in the hotel and adjacent mall. POOL, SKYPARK & OBSERVATION DECK ~ The HIGHLIGHT the reason you stay here. Spend most of your time in the infinity pool, enjoy the panoramic day and night view which soothe us out to forget all the flaws of the other area of the hotel. Poolside F&B is very general but service is swift. Drinks are below par. CASINO ~ Bring your passport, you need it like going through immigration in and out (~) the lower floor is smoking. Upper floor is non-smoking. Dealers do not look very enthusiastic like other casinos in Vegas.

The pool is worse than a public pool. As the showers are actually a floor now, I suspect that almost everybody went in without showering. The number of kids in the pool make it hard for anyone to actually enjoy especially if you have to consider those parents actually bring their maids in tow.

When I first decided I was interested in staying in that hotel, I started my homework, doing a lot of research, specially in their website. There, you may find a lot of information, as well as several options of rooms and packages. Upon studying all the available options, I decided for a package called the \"De Luxe Package\", with \"The Club Room\". Once the package and room were chosen, I started researching how to get best value out of it. Very easy, if you have a few minutes to spend, looking for the best dates for the best rates. Upon arriving on the 12nd of June, I spend approximately 5 minutes in queue, and that was because I didn't know yet that I could have used the VIP check in, because my package entitled me to it. Of course, if the check in time is 3pm, anyone who has some experience travelling must know that that will be the most crowded time. I arrived 3 hours later and then asked for a 3 hours late checkout, which made all perfectly suitable. I can't help but think that I was not in the same hotel as the same people complaining about service here. I travel a lot, I have been in a lot of luxury hotels around the world and I have never been so kindly treated by any staff. It was a spotless service, with a very personal experience. With the package I chose, it was like an ALL inclusive resort; and even with so many people around, the waitresses and managers, of course, would call me by name (and this was the first, of hopefully several times I intend to go there) and would always have a few minutes to talk to us, showing genuine interest in our well being and giving us valuable tips about what to do in the city. It was an unique experience. In all honesty, although the luxury, architecture, and all the impressiveness of the hotel are astounding, what surprised me most was the quality of the service. The pool was not that crowded, depending on the time one chooses to go there, and one cannot expect privacy in something that is certainly a tourist attraction in itself. Besides that, the effect, the cleanness and the temperature of the pool were perfect. Not to mention, again, the service provided by the staff for those staying there. All in all, this was one of, if not the best experience I had abroad in a luxury hotel, and that includes USA and Europe. I definitely recommend it to anyone caring to do a little research before making a reservation.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cThe Feeling is First Class...

Upon arrival at the airport, we were expecting pickup. We were directed to go to a bus stand to wait which we did. After 15 minutes of waiting and no signs of pickup, I called the hotel only to be kept waiting for the longest time with no valid answers. They have no idea what we wanted when all we want is pick up to the hotel. We ended up taking a cab. Upon arrival to the hotel... there was a super duper long queue at the check in counter. They are so busy... When it was our turn, we gave our feedback about the pick up but they were too busy to be bothered but because u are taken away by the beauty of the place... and because of the long queue behind us... we kinda just accepted the bad service? They upgraded our rooms for us... which kinda made it up? Basically, service just did not match up to how amazing the place was. All that is made up the moment we saw our rooms. We were up at level 47. Breath taking view. Rooms were definitely up to expectation. Hotel was still brand new... everything was tip top :) We were lucky coz we get to witness the opening ceremony of the Youth Olympics. The fireworks and laser show display was amazing and we watched them live from our window :) The roof top was quite a let down... the pool was definitely an experience but because it was so high up, it was soooo hot! U can get immediate sun burn. Also, the pool was packed! And around the pool area was a lot of visitors who pay to go up to walk around and take pictures. Hence, no privacy at all ard there...

Upon pulling into the forecourt our bags were removed swiftly from our Taxi and taken away by the bell boy who just asked for our name. We arrived in the lobby which indeed itself was very busy and there was a long looking queue to check in however a hotel of this size it has to be expected. We was offered a glass of Champagne whilst we waited in the queue. It took around 15 mins to check in which I dont think is too bad and 3 glasses of Champagne helped. We got to our room and the rooms keys did not work. This has happened to me before at many hotels. I made the long journey back to reception (an area dedicated to non checking in guests) and the keys were replaced and they said they would send an engineer just to check the door anyway. Got back to the room and they worked ok and we entered the room. WOW. A huge room and the biggest bathroom I have seen. 5 mins later the engineer arrived as promised and checked the door. We had booked a club room and the club lounge is situated on the top level where the swimming pool is. The swimming area itself is just amazing and the club lounge did not disappoint either. Breakfast there was excellent with a large choice of everything and eggs cooked to order. Afternoon Tea & Soft drinks are available all day and then Cocktails and drinks from 5pm to 7pm with a good selection of canapes etc. There service here for our 3 day stay was top class. The swimming pool area does get busy but we always managed to get a bed and all towels are provided for you. The gym at this hotel is first class. What baffles me the most about reading some of these reviews is that people expect a hotel of this size not to be busy and lack personal service. If that is what you want then stay at a smaller hotel.

The hotel itself is pretty awe-inspiring, but just the service is HORRIBLE. We were there as invited casino guests, and even then received the most mediocre service. Marina Bay Sands seems like utter trash compared to resorts in Las Vegas that actually reward casino players. Our reservations were not honored TWICE (we had two separate stays with a trip to Phuket in the middle) and we spent countless hours bickering with the staff to actually accommodate us. MBS staff need to learn that you can't dictate your policies BY THE BOOK, but should allow exceptions and learn how to be flexible. After a grueling 20 hour plane trip, we went to the invited guest check in where it was literally packed! Who designed the area I do not know. It literally has two sofas and nothing more. They did not honor our reservation for a club level room and instead placed us in a standard room even though we placed the reservation several months in advance. The service staff seemed very unsure about what they were doing and seemed to be making a big deal out of nothing. So then, since it was 3am in the morning, we decided to just take the room and try and get some sleep. The next morning, we went again to the front desk and asked them if they would honor our reservation. Finally, after an hour or so, they agreed to move us to a club level room. We decided to check out the rooftop club lounge, and it appeared very nice at first. The breakfast and afternoon tea service are very good, although it did get extremely repetitive after a while. And the size of the lounge is extremely small. The host at the lounge was incredibly rude and would not let us enter due to a system error, which was resolved with a phone call to the front desk. The room was not spectacular. Definitely not what'd you expect from $350+per nights. Anyways, onto the second part of our stay. Before we left, we requested, and double requested with the front desk that we would be receiving CITY VIEW club level rooms when we came back, but when we came back, they had not only neglected to give us city view club rooms, but didn't even seem to find our reservation. They instead made us feel like we had done something wrong and tried to act like they were doing us a favor by finding us a standard room! So, the worst part of this hotel would definitely be the service. Beware the service. (Also, the rooftop pool is a joke. There is no room to swim because of all the people and the temperature is probably like 60 degrees, way too cold for kids and elderly)", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cArchitectural Wonder.

You can see from far that the structure is beautiful with one rooftop stretching across 3 buildings as 3 pillars. It is one of the few hotels that I see have an airport shuttle available to the hotel. It is a big bus. I can imagine how many hotel guests it is expecting. It picks up guests at all 4 terminals in the airport. By the time when we leave, we can have our luggage express check out for certain airlines including SQ in the coach terminal. Once off the shuttle into the lobby. There is a little live orchestra performance. The lobby is huge. You just can\u2019t see the end when looking straight. We move to the Front Desk to check in. While lining up, we are served with drinks and cocktails free of charge. One minor issue is they are quick to serve drinks but slow to collect back the glasses. Given that the hotel has just opened its door, there must be a lot of procedures that need to be improved. My family is one bus earlier than us and they got 2 rooms. When I have mine, it stunned me when I open my room and found that there is already luggage in the room. I immediately close the door. I go to my brother\u2019s room and find out that the luggage belongs to my Mom. However, how can the Front Desk give 2 rooms to my family and give the same room key to me while I should have my 3rd room. It poses security threat to the hotel guests if my room key opens any other guest rooms already being occupied. The Front Desk explained that our room is not yet ready and will switch our room keys to the next available room. Once settled, we go to the hotel shopping mall across the street accessible by an underground tunnel. The size is a real mall with lots of shops and can go to the casino. We grab a light lunch at the food court trying out different local food. Be prepared to pay in Singapore dollars. If you don\u2019t have it, there is a foreign exchange upstairs. The food tastes very good. During the 3 day stays, I do not manage to finish going around the whole mall. It is a long walk back to our hotel. All rooms are now ready. We all have a wonderful view of the city. The hotel is separated by a bay from the city. So the bay view towards the city is very beautiful. You can see almost the whole downtown area including the Merlion across the bay. At night, there is a laser show on the mall rooftop and the bay. It has the laser beam as well as lights running around the rooftop. The amazing part is the laser poses 3 screens in the air as if you are going to an open air cinema. You can sit comfortably in your room enjoying the laser show. It lasts for about 15 minutes. I can see lots of camera shots across the bay. You should not miss the rooftop Skypark which is a must see. You can have the whole city view. There are restaurants and bar in the centre so you can walk along the edge to take lots of photos. There is also a swimming pool that you can swim to the edge of the building 57th floor above the ground. Since it is a tourist spot and if you are not the hotel guest, you have to pay to go to the rooftop. The hotel should separate the non-guest visitors from the guests swimming in the pool. Otherwise there is not much privacy for the hotel guests and especially those ladies laying down for the sunshine. I later noticed that there are blinds that can be pulled down but once they are down, they blocked the view from the non-guest paid visitors in the hallway to see the city view. The hotel has to think of a better way to give more privacy for the hotel guests. Another issue is that there is no dedicated elevator for the paid visitors to go to the rooftop. Both guests and visitors are sharing the same elevators, so the elevators are usually packed. The buffet breakfast down in the lobby is very good, more Chinese style than western style. Be early as there are lots of people and you may have to line up for 10 to 20 minutes, not to mention the food are going fast although they are re-filled pretty quickly. The casino is a strictly controlled area. Every time you go either in or out you have to show your passport. It to free for tourists but Singaporean has to pay S$100 to go in once. The government is trying to control the Singaporean visits to a maximum of 30% of all the gamblers. That\u2019s why the security is so tight. Overall the hotel is worth visiting.

Anyway they were eventually able to locate a room for us and put us into a Horizon Grand room. The view was spectacular! The room is huge. Almost too big, long and skinny and it seemed to be missing furniture or maybe needed larger scale furniture. There was a lounge area and a sleeping area and room for another bedroom in between. Both areas had 42in LCD TVs. A small dining table and a couple of chairs would've fitted in nicely. The bathroom was fab. huge shower with fantastic pressure. There was a large sliding door which blocked the whole room off or you could leave it open but it was tucked well away from the main bedroom. Very nice amenities too. The crowning glory is of course the pool and roof views. The top deck is open to the public from 10am, however the pool is semi-screened off from the many sightseers. We always swam in the morning and found it really quiet , peaceful and the most beautiful time of the day for watching the city wake up. We did not eat at the hotel as there is a huge mall attached next door which has some nice restaurants and one of the fabulous Singaporean food-halls where all sorts of Asian food is on offer for about $5-7.

I wrote to the management and received no response. They are too embarassed to answer. I will be writing a separate review as well as feel bad for Chef Tetsuya in Sydney who's restaurant Tetsuya's is supposed to be the inspiration for Wakughin. Very disappointed and will tell all friends/colleagues not to waste time/money. On the other hand, Guy Savoy lived up to the Brand name. After visits to Paris and Las Vegas outlets, we enjoyed this immensely and the current Chef is from the Las Vegas branch. Well worth the $350 plus per person for some the best French food this side of Joel Robuchon and Pierre Gagnaire.

Marina Bay Sands has a lovely foyer - very modern. Check in was straight forward, just what you would expect. The room was a decent size and nice amenity. I would highly recommend the breakfast - excellent quality food - good coffee if you ask for them to make you one with the machine, omelettes/eggs to order. Now to the sky deck - it really is a remarkable view and pool. Our first morning jet lag had us up early and we were there watching the lights twinkling and the sun rise over singapore with only 3 others. Go back 8 hours later - eeek.. Every man, woman, child and their dog is up there. A pool seething with humanity. And as we were travelling with kids - no luck on the food front. One restaurant had no kids policy, the club was nibble food, and the other place Ku de ta was more of a bar. So we were relegated to the restaurant in the hotel lobby or room service. One thing I will say for the pan pacific, the pool was a good size, not as glamorous as here, but very few people using it and great poolside service. Also, do NOT let them put you in a room that faces over the 6 lane major road and building site if you have kids. Trying to put them down for naps was a nightmare. ANd really not at all a pretty daytime view. Insist on a room facing the city side. IT would be fine if you were out during the day because at night the harbour is all you see with the boat lights sparkling, but I would still prefer not to look onto a building site and road with all the attendant noise. Like pan pacific this is a great location for shopping with malls attached. All in all a very good experience with minor exceptions. Also, if you have children be sure to go to the zoo and take bathers. There is an amazing water park in the middle of the zoo, and they have boat rides, pony rides, carriage rides, a carousel - as well as all the animals.

The rooms were really nice, clean and modern, the bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was really nice (which is a very important factor for me), there was a wide range of restaurants to eat at in the adjoining shopping centre (with lots of food options onsite too), staff were very helpful, we received a late checkout which was really good, the chocolate buffet at the club was the best dessert I have ever had in my life! Honestly, the list goes on, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wished we had stayed there longer (instead of at another hotel). It might be a bit more pricey than other places, but it is definitely worth it. And while the service isn't personal (that they remember your name - you shouldn't expect them to with the size of the hotel, number of rooms and number of people that go through there - I don't think any person with amazing customer service skills could achieve that!), staff are always friendly and willing to help, went out of their way to improve our stay, and I believe that is a good enough indicator of a strong customer service focus. My only complaint is that they open up the skypark (where the pool is) to the general public, and it is a bit awkward having random people watch you in the pool, but if you get there early enough, you don't have to worry! Having the shopping centre across was very convenient, except my sister and I ended up going over our baggage allowance as a result, but the casino was pretty good too, the gondola's in the internal canal was a pretty cool idea, and did I mention the views? To be honest, our main reason for staying at the Marina Bay Sands was the infinity pool and to get some good photos of the Singapore skyline, but we were pleasantly surprised with a lot more.

The room comes with free WIFI too and included a Nespresso machine in the room too. We had a room that faced the ocean and the views are breathtaking. My 1 year old daughter loved the room too as she continuously played around the room for 3 hours. The check-in was brief and smooth, around ten minutes. I requested for a late-checkout on the following day but was rejected due to full bookings on the next day, which i accepted reluctantly (what can i do?). The room was clean and we had a very comfortable king size bed. The TV is big enough and we loved the big bath tub, including my 1 year old daughter who was there with us. We avoid swimming at the infinity pool as we noticed that the pool was always crowded with people. We went to the Club room at level 7 in the late afternoon to enjoy the free high tea that came with the room. Noticed that only suites occupants were allowed at this club and saw some people rejeted when they wanted to dine there. This enhanced our experience and we felt special about it. Some finger foods, pies and cakes were served. My wife had her favourite cup of Mocha and i had the Latte. The food was ok but the views up there was great. We had our breakfast here too on the following day. As usual, the american Buffet spread. We ordered the Nasi Goreng from room service and this is disappointing. The nasi goreng taste awful (not sure why). Don't expect this kind of standard at Sands. Overall, quite a pleasant stay except for the Nasi Goreng from Room Service.

The concierge counters (atleast about 10-12) throughout the lobby are alsoi very helpful in answering your queries, or to plan an outing. The shops at the Sands are of course a shoppers paradise - and since pricing is exactly the same as the city shops, you really dont need to shop outisde. There is of course the Casino and the theare as well - playing some fabulous shows which are a must watch. And then there is the iconic arts Science museum - the building itself is so beautiful, the exhibitions held are also definitely worth watching (admission extra) - I managed to catch one on paintings by van gogh anf another exhibit of Dali paiintings and sculptures - simply subper. The downside - The food in the room serice menu is exorbitant - simply go the food court in the hotel- international variety and much more sensible pricing. Don't also miss the \"wonderfull\" water fountain show held every night at the hotel marina promenade (with the room upgrade - we were also able to view it from our room- minus the music of course). They also have a fantastic chocolate buiffet at the Sky club on the 57th floor.

The staff, assigned to direct guest to the convention hall breakfast area, direct me to a different location and could not converse properly. After being rejected and going back to the same staff, she could not direct me to the breakfast area effectively because of poor communication skills. She ended having to walk us there.

The lock on my door broke once and I was locked in my room for 45 minutes. The bedside alarm clock was broken all the days I was there in spite of complaints. The internet in the room disconnected frequently (too many people use it - I was told).

The reason being that this hotel will almost certainly be judged on what you expect from your stay. The service was excellent and the staff were friendly on check-in. Mr room was excellent and of very high standard with great views. The food and drink options were extensive and the ones i used were all of very high standard. The access to shops, bars, cafes, casinos, theatres and museums were impressive. The priority customer line from the room was efficient and polite. The bathroom was very large and beautifully equipped. I could probably go on, but you probably already get my drift! However, I am sure you are already waiting for the BUT! So let me continute... This is a HUGE hotel and very much of the vegas style for those who have been to Vegas before. It is a vast complex and hugely impersonal. When I pick a hotel I look for luxury and a low-key, but very personal touch. This is not something you will get at the Marina Bay Sands. That is why I gave it 3 stars. It is very much a personal view based on my expectations of a 5 star hotel - the next person could easily give it a 5 star Tripadvisor rating. As you will have read from my review, I did list a number of very positives points, but I still came away feeling somewhat underwhelmed. I normally stay at the Mandarin Oriental - which offers exactly the type of luxury hotel I look for and dare I say probably cheaper than the MBS. Some of the reasons were as follows: 1. Upon arrival at the hotel it was totally hectic with literally hundreds of poeple milling around - so much so no one even spotted me arriving and my suitcases were not received by the concierge. Not a good start. 2. The hotel check-in was exactly like queing up at an aiport check-in; lots of people waiting in a roped-off line. 3. I took all my suitcases to my room without any offer of help - simply due to the size and number of people around 4. The reception and main lobby area felt much more like a high-class shopping center than a luxury hotel 5. The sea view was nice, but has a huge and noisy building site between the hotel and sea - go for the city view everytime! 6. Hotel information in the rooms was very limited - it is not easy to know what services and facilities are available to guests. Yes there is a priority telephone line to call, but most people like to read about the hotel and ts facilities upon arrival. 7. Poor wireless reception in my room 8. The infinity pool was impressive but very overcrowded - it felt more like a holiday camp!I decided therefore not to use it. I would have been lucky to find somewere to sit. Once again, changing rooms facilities etc were not signed clearly and therefore slightly off-putting. Another HUGE disadvantage was the large eating and drinking facilities for Club members! It took up such a vast area it made you feel really like a second class guest if you were not a Club/suite guest. There was therefore limited areas to relax, eat and drink for regular guests. A very, very BIG put-off for me. Overall, as I said, your opinion will depend on what you expect from a hotel, but for me MBS was just too large, way too impersonal and just generally disappointing. To end on a positive, the staff were all very friendly and helpful and tried their best to assist.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cONCE AND NEVER GO BACK!!\u201d", "Author": "restlessjetsetter", "ReviewID": "UR111054337", "Content": "Internet reservation sucks it does not allow to book because there's minimum stay, although there wasn't. book via phone, guy was nice and accomodating. mentioned honeymooners, and they said they'll accomodate as best as they could. reservation confirmation received stated \"tower 3\", upon check in at counter nearest to tower 3 they insist we are suppose to check in at \"tower 1\"(for those who never been there before the distance between tower 3 and tower 1 is about 3 blocks away, with lugage maybe more). at tower 1, upon check in asked for a room near elevator it turn out getting crappy room facing constructions, low floor and very far from elevator eventhough reservation stated \"request high floor, city view\". the package we were it includes voucher for shopping, was not given upon check in instead was informed bell man will come and deliver. waited for 3 hours several calls to express service and a trip to visit the receptionist we still didnt get the voucher! in the end called the express service who still insist for us to stay in the room to receive the voucher, with angry tone and tell them we were hungry and they will have to leave the voucher in the room. we got it on our room - on top of the table when we returned in the late evening.

We waited an hour and a half for our room to be ready when we checked in at 9.30pm on friday night. They offered us an upgrade, but the room wasn't finished being cleaned and stank of smoke even though it was a non smoking room. There were children running between rooms next door, banging the door everytime they left at 11.30pm these kids looked no older than 9 or 10 and no adults were visible. After a good night sleep we decided to give it a chance. We enjoyed a very expensive buffet breakfast that should have been dinner price given that it was $100 per head (clearly they think everyone is winning big in their casino). The roof top pool is stunning! but packed with people on the weekend. During the week it was quite and enjoyable. Saturday night we asked for a firm pillow to be brought to the room as all the pillows were soft feather. At 4.30 we put in the request and left the room to go for a walk before dinner. We came back at 5.30 to find they had left an other feather pillow on the bed, to go with the other 4 that were already there. We rang again to request the firm pillow and asked if they could send someone up within half an hour as we were getting ready to head out for dinner. The half hour passed and no one arrived. I rang again and they said they would send someone up straight away. No one arrived so after an other half hour I rang again and said we had to leave for dinner and that I wanted the pillow sorted by the time we returned. ( no problem). Well Midnight we got home from dinner and the same pillow they delivered at 4.30 is still sitting on the bed. They had done nothing. After ringing 3 more times and having 3 visits from different staff we finally got a firm pillow at 1.30am. What a joke! the sevice and follow up was dreadfull. No ownership of a problem, that was what I thought.

For me, the experience was not a pleasant one. To start with, we had a business meeting in a converted suite because all the function rooms are full. Our buffet lunch was served in the suite but we were not given any spoons until we asked for them repeatedly. I find this lack of initative disturbing for MBS, as fried rice was one of the dishes served in the buffet lunch, and during the long wait for the spoons to come, most of us end up using the dessert spoons and forks to eat our rice. Another complain is the slow internet connectivity, we were having alot of problems with our tokens during our business meeting. We arrived at lobby at Tower 1 to check into our rooms at 230pm. First impression of check in counter is - super long queue. Most of the people waiting to check in, were all standing at the lobby, while counterparts are standing in the check-in queue, our group included. There dont seem to be sit down areas for us to wait. Though I understand that check-in time is 3pm, we end up getting our keys to our rooms only at 5 plus, close to 6pm. So, the whole bunch of 20 odd people end up standing in the lobby, waiting for our keys for close to 3-4 hours. Thus, you can imagine our frustration and tiredness. There was even a major screw-up of 2 groups of us being assigned the same room number. And the poor people only found out after making their way from Tower 1 to Tower 3 (where their assigned rooms are) and have to walk all the way back to the Tower 1 lobby to change again. What I cannot stomach is I believed our booking of our 10 rooms is through corporate sales and yet this is the kind of service level that was given. There dont seem to be have any internal communication between the corporate sales and the front desk on this. Because of the late check in, we were all further frustrated to be informed that the check-out time the next day is 11am. By then almost all of us had already a very bad impression of the hotel service level. I did call the service line personally that evening to request a late check out and relate our experience of checking in only at 5pm to the customer service officer, but they were only able to give me standard answers of check out is only at 11am, max 12pm no later. In fact, I was kept waiting on the phone line for very long and the line was even cut off abruptly once. I must admit that the next morning, we were pleasantly informed that we are allowed a late check out at 2pm, but unfortunately this info came too late like 11am, where everyone has already packed up and prepared to leave. Thus almost all of us just want to leave and go home. I have to be honest to say that the only saving grace for this stay-over is the hotel's Infinity pool. I couldnt help but compare this MBS stay with a previous team building weekend stayover at RWS. It was really a marked difference and I am sad to say that I dont think I will re-visit MBS in the near future or recommend it for a business event.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable service, please dont take stock of the damning reviews\u201d", "Author": "perthaustins", "ReviewID": "UR110627065", "Content": "Whilst im only new to TripAdvisor im not new to the hospitality game.

I think many people who gave this the thumbs down are not comparing apples with apples. Those who do not define this as a luxury hotel, especially. Firstly, this has over 2500 rooms, and I believe their service is just the best it can get. You can't get your own personalized service with so many rooms in such a new place. I thought that the service in the club was excellent. This hotel has a more modern and busy atmosphere, being a tourist attraction in itself. If you're looking for the classy boutique type where the receptionist knows all the guests personally, this just isn't it. It's such a different type. Its the first of its type in Singpore, I must say, home to one if its two casinos. most bad reviewers are comparing it with the existing ones around the same price range, which to me, as said earlier, is not comparing apples with apples. The hotel has so many nice facilities, that is, from the pool, to the spa and fitness centre, and the shopping mall, all interconnected, its just great. The view of Singapore is great though, but one policy i'm against, that no tripods are allowed within the skypark. How else do you get good night photos on the skypark without a tripod? Asked one of my local friends, they said use the photo service. But looking at the prices and quality, its just not worth it. The night photos especially are blurred and overexposed. my suggestion is that maybe you could pay a little extra to bring up a tripod or something like that because I understand from one staff that the tripods take up space and some nights are very crowded. But i'm sure the crowd won't be there much longer if they can't get good nightshots. I mean, what makes the skypark so magnificent is the view. We just can't get good photos of it!! well, other than that, its just almost flawless. The nearest MRT station is a 10 min walk though, and very hot during the day. I guess that's not controllable by them, but they should have some shuttle service for guests to the MRT station or something...or better still a shuttle to the city and different attractions around Singapore. The taxi queue is just always so long...after some event at night when I was making my way back from an evening stroll, I could see the taxi queue was just so long... But anyways, theres nothing too bad about it other than what I mentioned. Service is great, wish I could point out a few team members but can't remember their names. All very polite and heartwarming. This place is just amazing and awesome...and a totally different experience form ordinary Singapore hotels. It's so big...so lively day and night. And once you retreat to your room, its suddenly so quiet and ambient, especially with the Singapore skyline at your window. A great finish to the day is also their \"wonder Full\" light and water spectacular, great for after dinner or supper show. It's about this baby growing up...basically a story through life.

Before deciding which hotel to stay at in Singapore I read reviews on here about the MBS and at first I was put off the idea of staying at the MBS because of the bad reviews but then I searched other travel sites and found the reviews were far more positive. One major site (which I wont name out of respect for Tripadvisor) has well over 1100 reviews on the MBS with an average of 80% approval rating as opposed to less than 1000 on this site with an average of 62% and other travel sites that have much higher approval ratings. Why is that?. I decided to ignore the negative comments on here and place more trust in the majority of good reviews not only on this site but all the other travel sites and I decided to book at the Marina Bay Sands. As I suspected the bad reviews on this site are rubbish. I had a great stay at the MBS. I paid an advance booking which entitled me to a 15% discount off the standard rate as long as I paid at least 14 days in advance and agreed to the conditions which are the same as any other hotel offering the same deal. You don't have to be a mathematical genius to figure out a 15% discount is a significant saving, so to me the Club room I booked was well worth the money. The rooms at the MBS are huge, with very tasteful decor and everything a guest who hasn't got unreasonable expectations would want. Its very well furnished with a very comfortable bed, a sofa, writing desk, large TV and plenty of draw space and it has a Nespresso machine which I used a lot. The bathroom is also large with a separate shower and big bath, twin sinks and large mirrors. The view of the city from my room was a huge plus for me especially at night The Club lounge on the 57th floor is one of the benefits of getting a Club room and its beautiful. They serve really good food and the view can't be beat. The service there as with everywhere at the hotel was fantastic. People on here whine about rude, unhelpful, non English speaking staff, where are they? Because I never came across any staff anywhere in the hotel who were anything but welcoming, helpful, cheerful and polite. The Infinity pool is stunning and there's heaps of room to swim or just relax taking in the sun. The water wasn't dirty, I didn't feel like I was being stared at by non guests and there's no way non guests get to swim in the pool as some have claimed. Yes the lobby is busy but as others have quite rightly pointed out no one has a room on the lobby floor and most if not all guests don't spend most of their time there anyway. Why complain about the location? Do you not check to see if that is an issue before you book? If not why not? That's your responsibility. Why blame the hotel for the lack of an MRT? Its not the responsibility of the hotel and as others have said there's heaps of taxis which are really cheap. Reviews are supposed to be an honest reflection of your experiences but way too many complain about silly issues and others clearly make up stuff to whine about that simply aren't true. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews especially on this site which normally does give a pretty accurate picture of what to expect from hotels, but not in this case.

The Club lounge on the 57th floor is amazing, not just for the view but also for the service, food and amenities. Like other reviewers have mentioned I don't see why people complain. I wonder why it is another reviewer who had previously stayed at the MBS and clearly hated it would return especially when that reviewer made every effort to dissuade readers from booking at this hotel in their first review. Why return if it was as bad as they claim and especially when that person did not recommend anyone stay at the MBS in their first review? They're obviously incapable of following their own advice. To also complain that the location of the hotel is not close to the city centre begs the obvious question why, if that was such an issue, did they decide to book there anyway? The hotel clearly hasn't moved any closer to the city since their last visit. As with another recent reviewer I share the view that many of the negative comments lack credibility and I would advise those considering a stay at the MBS to consider the fact that the vast majority of reviews are very complimentary to this hotel and are far more accurate and honest in their appraisal based on our experience there.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cOverrated\u201d", "Author": "richann", "ReviewID": "UR109970157", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights in club room.

I booked a Club room and check-in was not an issue, the service was more than adequate and the room was perfectly fine. Overall the hotel was in keeping with that of a 5 star hotel so I really wonder why some people complain so much. One recent reviewer complained about the color of the tiles in the swimming pool! Really? That's a worthy reason to complain? They also complained about the water in the pool being dirty. I swam in the pool every day and I saw no evidence of dirty water. But then when you look further and read their other reviews it turns out that they claim to have left the MBS to stay at not just one other hotel in Singapore but 2, both of which they gave an excellent rating for and in both glowing reviews they made sure to name the MBS as a bad hotel. So like others have stated, I really doubt the credibility of many of the negative reviews on here. They're just not believable. It doesn't matter to me which hotels people decide to stay in, I have no vested interests other than giving an honest appraisal of my own experience. I agree the lobby is busy but it was not a concern to me because I really spent little time there other than on the first night when I took a stroll around. Surely all things considered given the stature of this hotel can anyone reasonably expect anything less than a busy lobby? In terms of room comfort, cleanliness, service, facilities and amenities I can't fault this hotel and that is a genuine and honest review. My advice to those who read the reviews here to help them determine whether to stay or not is don't treat the negative reviews with much (if any) credibility, this is a perfectly good hotel.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cIncredible architecture - but not a luxury hotel by any means\u201d", "Author": "crewfox", "ReviewID": "UR109816349", "Content": "I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in October 2010 for 6 nights while attending a week-long conference that was held at the convention center located across the street from the hotel. I, like many others, was impressed with the sheer scale of the hotel and its incredible architecture (particularly the rooftop terrace and infinity pool), but on the whole I was disappointed with the service, the level of comfort provided by the hotel, and the difficulty we had accessing basic features such as dining and casual meeting spaces. The room I had was a large, and very comfortable. I had a great bed, along with a large and comfortable seating area by the floor-to-ceiling windows looking over the Bay. The bathroom was also large and comfortable, though the shower was awkward and tended to flood the floor (no tub), and there were no outlets in the bathroom to use the hairdryer. As other reviewers have noted, there was a strong smell of sewage or waste pipes in the bathroom throughout my stay. The roof-top pool is lovely, as are the views, though I found that service was non-existent. For a hotel of this calibre and price, I would have expected pool servers who prepare your lounge chair and provide towels, and are available to serve you drinks, food, etc. There is no such service at the Marina Bay Sands, and you have to go to a small booth to get your own towel, have to sign them in and out (I guess they are afraid of theft? How tacky!) and they have a few snacks like potato chips and candy for sale. They are definitely missing out on a opportunity to make money and make guests feel more welcome without poolside service. I believe most of the hotels' problems stem from the fact that it has a HUGE number of rooms (2500 I think?) and it does not have enough dining and service facilities to accomodate all of those guests. During my stay the hotel was full to capacity, and it was impossible to have breakfast at the 2 restaurants available due to the lines of guests waiting to be seated, often for more than 1/2 hour. My colleagues and I ended up having coffee and pastries every morning at the \"Sweet Spot\" coffee shop at the base of Tower 3, which was faster and usually not crowded. Another major problem for me was the hotel's total absence of informal meeting/gathering spaces. The design seems to have been completely focused on the architectural drama of the hotel...and while it's impressive, it's also austere to the extreme. The very long lobby that connects all 3 towers has got to be a quarter-mile long, and I counted 5 benches available for seating along the whole thing. Yes, FIVE. For me, a business hotel should have comfortable seating and gathering spaces in the lobby where guests can gather, have a pre-meeting before an event or dinner, without having to be seated in a restaurant or bar. Finally, due to the size of the hotel and neighboring convention center/shopping mall, everything is a long walk. It was at least a 10-minute walk to the meetings rooms each day. I will say that the food/catering and service in the convention center was excellent, and very varied each day. Because Singapore has such a mix of cultures in its population, the food offerings each day included vegetarian fare, items prepared without pork, without gluten, etc. so that a large conference with a variety of international attendees would be well served. The hotel bills itself as a luxury hotel, but I found the service subpar. It may have been due to the hotel still being quite new at the time of my visit, but in general I found that most requests took a very long time to fulfill, and that the check-in and check-out staff in particular were slow and generally not helpful. The concierge staff was OK, though one night we asked them to help us get a reservation at a casual restaurant, and we were sent to one of the most expensive Japanese restaurants in Singapore.

Another insider tip: quite often you have to wait in line to get seated at one of the breakfast areas on the ground floor level in the morning so first morning we got in line as well but not even a minute later a staff member came up to us and asked if we would like to have breakfast at the restaurant right next to the pool (53rd floor!). Apparently , at least so we were told, they sometimes pick out randomly people from the line and send them up there so it wont get too crowded and actually the least people even knoe that you can also enjoy breakfast up there. Next morning we went traight to one of the staff member ladies and asked her right away and she sent us up again! Its so much nicer enjoing your breakfast over the rooftops of Singapore to start off your day and als the food is way better than downstairs ( last day we had to have our breakfast downstairs since we had to check out early) and its definitely not crowded at all compared to the breakfast area downstairs, so dont hesitate to ask!!! Also the rooftop bar is amazing to pay a last visit befor heading to the room and take one last drink. Sipping on a cold Cocktail and looking over the beautiful city at night is just priceless!!!

We stayed on the 40th floor. You can just sit and watch outside for hours 3) Service I thought was quite good. There was never a significant delay despite being such a huge place. Pleasantly surprised here. 4) Casino, Shopping & quality resturants all nearby. 5) Limited options for vegetraians Negatives : 1) They just cannot manage the crowd at the lobby. Checkin requires a lot of time and if you do reach the hotel before 3 PM be rest assured you will NOT get the room. They happily give you the option to upgrade. So pay more and get the room ! 2) For a quality 5star hotel the bathroom size was quite small and that too without tub. Just not acceptable (again you have the option to pay and upgrade) 3) The sea facing rooms have a terrible view. We were forced to stay for a night. Send them a mail in advance (could be on some help) 4) Taxi's apply surcharge from here making it less affordable. Have to walk to MRT unlike other hotels 5) For singapore standards is far away from most hotspots 6) Many travel agents (Sing. attraction exp.) dont have pickup-drop from this hotel 7) Room rates quite expensive at most times despite such huge supply So I guess, Stay there once just to experience it and 2nd time onwards at other much better/cheaper options.

Singapore service can be a bit hit and miss and this place missed. I'm in the travel industry and have stayed in lots of Singapore hotels and this one is average at best. The pool is magical, but you feel like you are in a fishbowl as the tourists walk along the mezzanine taking photos. Also there is a lack of suitable change/shower areas. I started using the gym washroom as it has nicer facilities. BTW the gym is superb by hotel standards and there never seemed to be anyone in there. Check-in was painless.

Large shower, auto curtains, flat TV, internet, Pod coffee maker in room - should be mandatory in all hotels (however MBS ruined it with powdered creamer - for those prices they could provide fresh milk?) Club room is worth the extra cost, breakfast, high tea, cocktails, all good. Club room wait staff sensational - friendly, attentive, chatty. Club room hosts/managers rude and arrogant - to the point of creepy. Lots of Singapore hotels have day-use areas for those of us who have to check out midday and fly that night. Not here.

I booked online through their website and decided on a club floor room. Expensive , but at the time I though why not. Our check in procedure took about 5 minutes and the staff member was very friendly and polite. I had requested a city view and she even mentioned that to me at check in and said she had given us a nice room with a nice view. So up to our room, we decided to take our own luggage thanks to reading some prevoius reveies. Our room was on the 36th floor, but when I opened the door we had a sea view, which was nice at first glance but as I moved closer to the window, all I could focus on was the construction site. Very dissapointed, but I thought I wouldn't be spending that much time in the room, so why bother to ask to be moved to another room. So off we go to explore. the 57th floor was quite amazing, the pool was devine, but very busy. I too find it strange that it is open to people not staying in the hotel to come up to the 57th floor, just takes the shine off paying so much for a room. The club lounge access to the 57th floor was quite a treat, the breakfast & canape's in the eving were delicous. We went to the chocolate buffet one evening, OMG so much chocolate, so many choices, I did feel a little sick when we left. We didn't get turn down service whilst there, even though it was included, no big deal really but why say its included, if you are not going to bother doing it. We only got a newspaper delivered on the first morning, not on the second morning. Check out was also fast and very impersonal, the staff member didn't even look me in the eye.

Fortunately our stay was fabulous and we could not fault the hotel at all!! We had booked a club room and were allcated a room on the 47th floor (tower 2) which was a city facing room with an excellent view. We checked in at around 3.30pm in the VIP lounge in Tower 1, which took less than 10 minutes. We did notice a very long line for check-in at the main reception desk. The room itself was large and very comfortable, furnishings were fine and sufficient - I don't know why other guests complain about sparse furnishing, perhaps they like cluttered space. The bed, linen and pillows were all fabulous. Bathroom very big with free-standing bath, 2 basins and seperate toilet and shower cubicles. AC was excellent and easy to control, free internet also worked fine for us any time we used (free in club rooms and suites). Yes the pool area is fantastic, crowded on weekend afternoons but fine in the mornings which is when we mainly used the pool. Non-hotel guests viewing the pool do not bother you at all and are restricted as to where they can access (just one end of the pool only). The best sunbeds to get are the ones at the water's edge. Service at the pool was very efficient, plenty of staff - orders were filled within 5 minutes or so for us and other guests at the pool. Excellent gym on the 55th floor. Club lounge was very good, friendly/helpful staff, large variety of hot/cold food at breakfast and afternoon cocktails. Hotel location is fine, easy to walk over to the shopping mall and casino as well as crossing the helix bridge to get to the Singapore Flyer. Taxis are also plentiful in front of Tower 1 and Singapore is very small and easy to get around in. We did not use the metro so I cannot comment on this. Yes the hotel lobby is huge and always busy but as this hotel has 2500 rooms what else would anyone expect?! Those guests who don't like lots of people around should go stay at a smaller hotel, common sense! All the staff we dealt with were very polite and friendly throught our stay, always very keen to assist. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel and would return when next in Singapore.

It did meet expectations. It is smaller than the Venetian, but a fabulous property none the same - excellent rooms (I admit, we did upgrade to a suite - the city view and extra space was worth 10% extra for the upgrade), The service has to be experienced to be believed - the staff is super efficient, and always ready to help. The concierge counters (atleast about 10-12) throughout the lobby are alsoi very helpful in answering your queries, or to plan an outing. The shops at the Sands are of course a shoppers paradise - and since pricing is exactly the same as the city shops, you really dont need to shop outisde. There is of course the Casino and the theare as well - playing some fabulous shows which are a must watch. And then there is the iconic arts Science museum - the building itself is so beautiful, the exhibitions held are also definitely worth watching (admission extra) - I managed to catch one on paintings by van gogh anf another exhibit of Dali paiintings and sculptures - simply subper. The downside - The food in the room serice menu is exorbitant - simply go the food court in the hotel- international variety and much more sensible pricing. Don't also miss the \"wonderfull\" water fountain show held every night at the hotel marina promenade (with the room upgrade - we were also able to view it from our room- minus the music of course). They also have a fantastic chocolate buiffet at the Sky club on the 57th floor. And of course one of the best things about this hotel - The infinite Sky pool on the rooftop - simply the best swimming atmosphere one can ask for - the city view, the cocktails by the pool, the jacuzzi overlooking the sea with ships - simply has to be experienced.

The hotel/shopping mall/casino/convention center is a destination in itself. One would not have to leave the property for a week and likely have a wonderful time. As usual with my reviews - The Good , The OK and The Bad/Ugly The Good - Check-in. Was greeted warmly at reception and between taxi and desk I must have been asked if I needed help with my bags 3-4 times. Eventually I said yes and was glad I did. - Bell-hop. I was glad I used the bell-hop for my bags. He escorted me to my room and showed me the ins and outs. Upon checking around the room, he noticed the TV was not working and the air conditioning was loud (it may have been a touch loud, but it wouldn't have bothered me). - Maintenance. Following up on previous point, within the hour I had a new TV as well as an air-condition fix so it was quietly humming. Nice job done by all. - The room. Large - about 50 sq. meters. Excellent view of city skyline. A nice working desk, with a couch/sitting area complimented a nice large and comfortable bed. The bathroom was also large with a stand-alone tub, as well as a shower in its own room that seriously could have fit 6+ people. Overall - pleased with the room. - Room service. Fast, helpful, hot, and prices were fair as far as room service goes. Well done. - The rooftop pool. It is pretty cool - I don't know how to describe it any other way. The pool has an adults only section so those who don't want to run shoulders with toddlers don't have to. - The gym. Nice - all the equipment (aerobic/weights) you need. Well maintained, water, great views (55th floor), etc. Would be a heck of a home gym....... - Service. The employees were great. All of them took time to speak with me - not hurried at all - and with a smile. I genuinely felt welcome. This is huge Sands for my future considerations. Well done. - Access to mall, convention center and casino. They are all a 5-10 minute walk from the lobby. High-end shopping mixed in with the casino, along with some excellent restaurants. The hotel and property is undoubtedly a destination in itself. The Bad/Ugly - The light in my toilet room did not work. I (wrongfully) assumed it would be fixed after housekeeping cleaned the next morning - but it wasn't. I did not report the light - but it was fixed, but only on the evening of the 2nd night. All in all - it wasn't a huge issue but I'm trying to remember one thing I didn't care for much. This is a very nice property. One you could stay weeks at without leaving and exploring rest of city.

I have stayed at many fine hotels all over the world and this one is excellent. The hotel facilities are exceptional, the service is faultless and the rooms are very well appointed, spacious and comfortable. I stayed at the MBS for 6 days on a business trip, during that time I had a number of items such as files, flash drives, disks and documents delivered to me at the hotel and not one went astray simply because the person delivering those items asked the reception staff to call my room and gain permission to deliver them to me personally. Its a hotel with over 2500 rooms on three towers so it makes sense to make sure the item you need is delivered to you in person and in my case the reception staff were more than helpful with that on several occasions. The fact that I am not in any way more important than any other guest I don't believe the staff would have done any different to any other guest who had enough sense to ask. Its certainly much less problematic that throwing a temper tantrum that is bad enough for 2 security guards to get involved. I agree with a previous reviewer who made a very good point. Always get reservation confirmation in writing and make sure the details are correct and contact the hotel a day or 2 before you're due to arrive to make sure your booking is confirmed. A bit of foresight and common sense can avoid issues later. My stay at the MBS was problem free, I had no reason to moan about the service because during the entire 6 days the service was excellent from all the staff. My room (Club) was very clean and housekeeping did a very good job keeping it that way, I didn't have housekeeping enter my room when the do not disturb was on and no one bugged me with calls to my room. I often had room service meals as it was easier to eat in my room while continue working and the meals were delivered in a reasonable time frame. When I did eat elsewhere including the Club lounge for breakfasts I had excellent service from all the staff. On the few occasions I did relax at the Infinity pool the pool wasn't jam packed, there were many people there but not that many for an reasonable person to find an issue with and there was certainly no evidence of non guests using the pool, that claim like many is pure fantasy. After reading the reviews I noticed that in many cases as soon as several people had posted positive reviews it was followed by a flood of very negative reviews which to me is highly suspicious. Personally I suggest to anyone considering a stay at the MBS they should treat most of these negative reviews with a pinch of salt, I have little doubt most are contrived and posted for ulterior motives. Many more guests like myself have posted positive reviews than those who have been negative and it beggars belief that there should be such a stark contrast between the vast majority who have had excellent experiences and those who complain about spurious and trivial issues.

Instead, I was able to board the airport shuttle bus which took me to MBS within 20mins; managed to check-in to a nice Atrium Premier room which was perfect for my family with two young children; got tickets to the Lion King which was extremely enjoyable (although, do go to the Box Office at the Mall for info etc the Hotel Staff did seem to have inadequate info on availability etc); breakfast at \"Rise(?)\" was great and one of the best compared to recent stays at other hotels; and Concierge staff were most helpful and offered to call Cathay Pacific in HK when I wanted to take a later flight back. This is a HUGE hotel and at times resembles an Exhibition Centre but once you retreat to your room it is fine. The Swimming Pool on top floor is great - kids loved it - however we did find it a tad dirty at times but this is purely due to guests choosing to swim with outdoor clothing rather than the usual swimming costume! I would suggest MBS try and stamp this out before it discourages others from enjoying this great facility.

The hotel also has an efficient service of complimentary pickup and drop to the airport. The skypark and the Infinity pool at the 57th level are unparallel. The views at the top are too good and it's a 'see it to believe it' experience. Post this, the Singapore Flyer seems less interesting. The breakfast service has a lavish spread and caters to almost 7-8 cuisines.

I don't know why people complain about the location or lack of public transport facilities near the hotel and blame the hotel for that. Whenever I consider booking at any hotel one of the factors is the location in relation to what my needs are. My point is its up to you the traveler to determine which hotel you decide to book into so if the location doesn't suit your needs then obviously common sense demands you find an alternative hotel that does. As for public transport facilities, it has nothing to do with the MBS, they are a hotel and they're not responsible for public transport infrastructure. There is a MRT close by but as far as I am aware its not completed yet and as a previous reviewer correctly pointed out, that is the responsibility of the appropriate government authority, not the MBS hotel. In any event Singapore is relatively small with many very efficient taxis that are very cheap, it amazes me that people are prepared to pay premium prices to stay at a 5 star hotel but quibble and moan about a few dollars spent on a taxi. Seriously there are way too many trivial issues that people complain about in their reviews, most of which could be avoided with some simple consideration, pre planning and common sense. Get the right information before you book, weigh up the pros and cons before you make a decision and make sure you confirm your booking details not only when you book but also a day or two before you're due to arrive. The vast majority of complaints I have read would never have seen the light of day had those people used some basic common sense. There was no bad service at the hotel that we encountered. Check-in was easy, quick, welcoming and efficient so was room service. Housekeeping did not once barge into our room when we had the do not disturb sign on and when we did leave our room we always came back to a clean made up room. The pool is not filled with non guests and even recent photos taken by guests on this site show its not as packed as some claim. The rooms are superb, large, comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom is also superb with a large enclosed shower and separate bath. If you don't like the toiletries provided then use your own. The room had plenty of hanging and drawer space, a personal safe, TV, work desk and because we had a Club room we had internet connection at no extra cost and the resort fee wasn't applied. The Club room is amazing and my sincere thanks to Selim and the staff who provided us with excellent service. I did not come across one staff member who was rude or unable to speak English anywhere in the hotel. The Lobby can get busy but as other more sensible reviewers have pointed out no guests either have a room on the Lobby or spend most of their time there so its not an issue. I had applied for a Premier Advantage Card on the hotel website before we left and I received an email to let me know it was waiting for collection and it was. No problems, no hassle.

Check in was as professional and quick as any major hotel I have encountered,the reception staff were very polite and welcoming. They happily answered my questions and weren't loud, rude, sarcastic or condescending as some reviewers have claimed. When booking at a hotel, any hotel, most will either engage the services of a travel agency or book for themselves, be it online, by phone, letter or email. Either way regardless of the method you will receive confirmation in writing which will clearly show which name the booking is under, if you don't receive that confirmation then you are well within your rights to request it. I, like most sensible people, check that the information in the booking confirmation is correct as soon as I receive it. I travel frequently and on occasion I have found errors in confirmations from hotels, it happens and its not a major issue if you take the time to rectify those errors prior to checking in. At some point the guest has to take responsibility for their own oversights, trying to shift the blame to the hotel for what is in many cases their own negligence is quite simply unfair. My advice is read the details on your written confirmation, if there are any errors contact the hotel immediately and once you have received a revised confirmation that is correct then print it off and present that to the reception staff on checking in. If you do that you are very unlikely to encounter problems. As a frequent business traveler I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over Europe, Asia and North America and the Marina Bay is an excellent hotel not just for the business traveler but also for the majority of guests who are holidaying. The rooms, service, facilities and amenities are in keeping with any 5 star hotel I have stayed at. I have had the pleasure of being a guest of the MBS twice and I intend to return.

I myself was not confirmed and I told the rep that I would like to book it but I can only confirm the other 2 people (i.e. my spouse and myself) later.

She requested for me to send over the credit card authorisation form to their general email, which i did. Someone else responded to that email, calling me and confirming my booking. I said to leave it and let the rep i was dealing with handle it. The next day, I confirmed the 2nd booking with my rep and emphasised that I want the 4 tickets to the show to be together. She said she will process it and send me a confirmation email. 5 days go by, no confirmation, I call up again and was told that my rep wasnt working that day and this rep would be able to help.

Service: \"Touch and go\" sums it up. Initial check in was fine however after that, thing went down hill. It came to a head when we had to make a complaint since my wife got the run around - all just to set up a premier club account. Something like that should be EASY instead she was fed all the wrong information. She wasted one hour on this and I was less then pleased. Value: The room itself was nice but for the price we paid, we could easily get comparable rooms and stayed for more nights Positive ======== Facilities: Gym and Pool, great Gym and pool area. Room: The room iself was nice and spacious with a good view. Only one TV was a bit weird for a hotel of that class. Conclusion ========== Hotel although great to look at, still needs work in terms of improvements in training and business processes. Checking in was fine for us but checking out was a nightmare due to the amount of guests and the lack of co-ordination of staff members. Entry should be seperated for hotel guests and general public. It's a minor security detail. ABOVE AND BEYOND: I want to thank Karen, someone from their marketing department who helped us to sort all our issues.

This made us so confused, and what's worst is that she informed us that our confirmation number is useless since our name was not in there in the reservation list together with our lady friend. We contacted our lady friend( since she was not with us when we check-in) to no avail as her cellphone has an empty bat, and Chey did not try to at least make our confusion bearable, she just kept telling us \"again i can't check you in coz' your names are not on the list\".So we are forced to take a taxi and went to where our lady friend was (who was so sure of our reservation). We don't know what really happened but when we came back (around 6pm), one of Chey's co-workers informed her that there's another one of that name (almost similar name of our lady friend who also made a reservation)!!! and Chey did not even bother to say sorry for all the troubles we had. If only she did not put aside our confirmation number it would have saved us time, effort and taxi fare.

We expect our stay to be relaxing but we're so tired and disappointed with what happened. It would be good if hotel employees extend natural friendliness and sympathy to their guests.

This hotel is horrible (in the most horrible sense)! It was supposed to be a weekend getaway for me and my girlfriend and we were expecting to be wow-ed, but instead we were left utterly frustrated and disappointed. My first negative experience came even before I checked in! I made my reservation via the hotel's website. It wasn't until a few days later did I receive a confirmation email on my booking, and this was ONLY AFTER I sent them a follow-up email to inquire about it. The confirmation email stated that I could check-in at either Towers 1 or 3 and provided NO INFORMATION on parking for vehicles. Naturally, I drove my car to one of the towers, only to be told by hotel staff that the carpark entrance is located on the opposite side of the road where the convention centre and shops were. Hence, I had to make a detour. There were road signs indicating where the carpark was but those who do not know better will think that this carpark was only meant for people heading to the shops and convention centre. I parked my car under the section marked \"Hotel\". You would think that the elevators/escalators at the carpark would lead you up to the hotel. NO IT DOESN'T! It leads up to the shops and it took us at least another 15 minutes of walking before we got to the hotel. Next up is the check-in experience. The actual check-in process was alright - took about 10 minutes. But we had to queue for about 30 mins before we got our turn! When we first joined the queue, there was a family of tourists at the front. They were complaining about not being served despite having waited in line for one hour! I believe that check-in times are usually bottlenecked at the housekeeping and reception levels. From my experience with other 5 star hotels in Singapore, checking in at 2pm and checking out at 12pm is the norm. Marina Bay Sands' check-in and check-out times are 3pm and 11am respectively. This is already an additional 2 hours for housekeeping to ready the rooms for new guests. At reception, there were four staff serving the check-in crowd of about 5-7 groups at that time. Therefore, the only logical reason that I could think of for the appalling waiting time is lack of manpower. But then, is this a justifiable excuse? After all, guests are paying 5-star rates, and they should be getting 5-star service. Sometime later, I realised that I had forgotten to inquire about the complimentary access card for use when exiting the carpark the next day. I was checked-in at Tower 3 and had approached the reception there to make my inquiry. To my dismay, they were unable to provide me with the information that I needed and I was told to approach the valet service counter at Tower 1, which was at the other end of the building - a 5 min walk. I finally reached the valet service counter and once again made the same inquiry. Another piece of dismal news - MBS does not provide complimentary parking for its hotel guests and a fee of $6 is required. $6 is not a big amount and I can very well afford it. But what peeves me is the knowledge that MBS has the cheek to charge ITS OWN HOTEL GUESTS for parking when most other (if not all) hotels in Singapore provide complimentary access. Why are guests not informed of this beforehand? Surely MBS does not expect all its guests to be foreigners? Also, I think that my question was a very basic question which the reception staff could have handled. Telling a guest to do a 5 min walk for such a simple matter does not reflect well on the hotel's service standards at all. My experience the next day was no better. I got woken by sounds of highway traffic and construction drilling at about 9am. Just some background information before I proceed - the MBS project was a massive undertaking with the Singapore government. However, there was some delay and they had no choice but to open only certain parts of the estate to the public, the hotel being one of those opened earlier (recall that MBS is made up of several components i.e. hotel, shops, convention centre etc). There was still construction work going on at an adjacent compound that is directly linked to the hotel, hence the drilling that I heard. As for the highway traffic - the hotel is located NEXT TO a major highway, so probably at least half of the hotel occupants will have the highway as the view in their rooms. So yes - MORE sound proofing work needs to be done for these rooms! To be honest, I was glad that the check-out time for MBS is an hour earlier than the norm as I was eager to leave. Given that this hotel's rack rates are not cheap, guests ARE ENTITLED to gain access to top notch amenities and service. Regretfully, this was sorely lacking in both aspects. I recall seeing this whilst using the \"Check In\" feature for Facebook - \"Marina Bay Sands Hotel - this place is ridiculous\". I absolutely agree. Last but not least, a word of advice to my traveler friends - there are many quality hotels in Singapore, especially around the Marina Bay area where MBS is located. Some examples include The Ritz Carlton, The Mandarin Oriental and The Marina Mandarin (good value for money).

There is also a lot of construction going on around the hotel, in particular towards the waterfront, and the first room that was assigned to us was on a low floor looking directly at the highway that is right in front of the hotel and the construction site beyond it. Having said this, the hotel is brandnew and the rooms are clean, come with huge TV screens, a nice bathroom with a free standing tub and all amenities that would be expected from a top notch casino hotel. Restaurants and shops are abundant and further dining and shopping options are still being added. The infinity pool at the top of the hotel is amazing and probably a good enough reason to stay at Marina Bay Sands for a night or two. To sum it up, Marina Bay Sands is definitely a must-see and worthwile a short-time stay. But (unless you are a serious gambler for which the location next to the casino is most important) for longer stays I would not recommend it as the service needs improvement and as a mega hotel/tourist attraction with no focus on treating guests according to their individual needs does not provide a \"feeling-at-home\" atmosphere.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cottesloe, Australia", "Title": "\u201cUnbiased and objective.

We stayed in the \u201cbase model\u201d Atrium room on floor 7, and found this to be perfect, nice and close to the action, but still with modern and spacious witht floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the Casino and \u201cShoppes\u201d across the road. There were 3 of us, myself and my partner, both in our early 20\u2019s and our 5 month old daughter. They accommodated for all three of us perfectly, and our cot and luggage were delivered to our room within 10 minutes. Firstly, our flight arrived into Singapore from Brisbane at 08.00, and we were at the hotel by 09.00 even though check in does not start until 15.00. We proceeded to the check in counter and amazingly they let us have our room, at no extra cost, 6 hours early! A lot of people have commented on the fact that the lobby is like an Airport, very impersonal, and in reality they are probably correct. However, as previous posters have said, you don\u2019t stay in the lobby, this was not really a problem. The building itself is absolutely amazing, I found myself in awe every time I saw the hotel from the outside, or even stood in the lobby. The Skydeck and rooftop are also amazing, with fantastic views of the Financial District on one side, and out to sea from the other. Going up there for the first time took my breath away, I have never experience anything else like it anywhere in the world. The room itself was very clean and very modern, and was what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, with a nice big bathroom and large comfortable bed. One of the things we most enjoyed about this hotel was the food court in the \u201cShoppes\u201d which are accessible via an underground tunnel from the hotel lobby. The food court was unlike anything we see in Australia, with lots of great quality, cheap international food, from traditional Chinese and Indonesian food, to Indian and Western cuisine. There is also a funky indoor skating rink next to the food court for the kids. The Shops themselves are very high end, and are brands such as Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Rolex, and are not much fund for the average traveller who is unable to afford such luxuries! It is unfair to complain about the location, as the hotel does not profess to be a city-centre hotel. For frequent or even second-time visitors to Singapore, it makes a nice change to be away from Orchard road, and just spend a few days in the resort itself, but for much longer than 3 days, the location MAY become tiresome. That said, we never paid more than $6 SGD to get to Orchard road, as Cabs are very cheap in Singapore. Another thing of note are the free half-hourly shuttles in the air-conditioned luxury coaches, this operates perfectly and on time, and the coaches really are luxury, with wide leather seats and lots of leg room. Finally, the Casino itself was just ok, it is huge and very impressive, but I don\u2019t believe it really caters to the Australian Gambler, with only a small number of Blackjack tables, the lowest limit being $25, and not very much roulette or other \u201cwestern\u201d games. In short, Marina Bay Sands is a \u201cMust Do,\u201d and has everything you want for a Short escape in Beautiful Singapore.

When I was last in Singapore in August 2009 the towers were about 3 quarters built and even then it was an imposing construction. Its truly an amazing hotel and not just because of its obvious stunning architecture, but also because it is deservedly a premium hotel in every definition. I booked a Club room which was in tower 1 with city views and the room was faultless. I'm not sure what more people could expect as it had everything you need. It was clean, nicely furnished, a decent size TV, work desk, more than enough hanging space and drawers unless of course you're one of those who packs more clothes than you would need. The bed was a king and very comfortable, the bathroom was large with a separate shower and bath. I had free internet, a Nespresso machine and the usual iron and ironing board. I did not hear anything from neighboring rooms and I'm a light sleeper. The Club on the 57th floor is quite special, certainly the best I have seen in my many years of travel. It was a great place for breakfast and the food was excellent. The infinity pool is exceptional and not really as crowded as some have claimed. The restaurants aren't cheap but its not like they claim to be, there are many cheaper alternatives in Singapore if your wallet cannot stand the strain. The casino is worth a visit, it may not have the visual impact of Vegas casinos but its not Vegas. The Shoppes are well worth a stroll through and the lobby is really visually stunning. Service was really very good, from the reception staff at check in to housekeeping to the Club lounge, room service staff and the pool, I was always greeted with a smile and assisted very well. I had no problems with missing luggage and although I was met at the airport by prearranged transport I notice the hotel has a shuttle bus service between the hotel and Changi every 30 minutes and its free, you cannot get better than a free service so there is no reason to complain. Taxis are everywhere in Singapore and they are very cheap, alternatively if you are like me and prefer a more personal service to and from the airport Singapore does have limo hire services and they're not that expensive. One of the many lessons I have learned from a lot of traveling is plan ahead. Get the information you need before you make decisions and base your decisions on what your specific needs are. Don't just make assumptions, ask the right questions when they need to be asked and not after the event. Be polite, civil and respectful and you will achieve a great deal more than being rude, arrogant and overbearing.

In a nutshell it was a very average experience for a above average rate. There was simply NO wow or exciting factor. Check-in time (5mins) was expedient in view that it was the peak check-in window at 2:45pm. However I was given a room on a smoking floor (35th) without being consulted or informed. It's basic reception skill 101in the hospitality industry. Always inform/consult with the guest when assigning him/her a smoking room. For the reception in a 5 stars establishment like MBS not to do so is just inexcusable. A case of MBS being overbooked and hence forcing its staff to find whatever room is available for the guest? It's one of the few if not the only hotel in Singapore that have check-in and check-out times of 3:00pm and 11:am respectively. By that MBS is in fact robbing its guest of two hours from their stay to save on its housekeeping direct staffing costs. Better profitability at the guest's expense !! The atmostphere in the hotel lobby resembled that of a bazzaar with a mix of guests and general public in the crowd. A function of the 2000+ rooms capacity no doubt. To add to it Justin Bieber was there at the time and his fans were there too of course. Choatic. The room was spacious but quite ordinary and uninspiring by way of decor and ambient. For example the curtain/sheen are drawn open/close by electric motor but there is no remote for it by the bedside for the guest convenience. The magnificent view from the room is the only consolation to a very ordinary and somewhat disappointing room experience. Called \"express service\" operator to find out and confirm if my room is indeed a smoking room. Was put on hold for 3-5 minutes and then cut off. No call back from the operator. I had to call to ask again before provided with an affirmative reply after another minute hold and wait. I would have thought an immediate reply is expected of such a simple and straight forward question. Apparently \"express service\" is not quite what it means at the MBS. Staffs whom I had contact with were generally polite and helpful. Special mention must be made of the housekeeping and Skypark Club Lounge staffs. They did try their best to make up for the many shortcomings of the establishment they work for. They were sincerely friendly and helpful. The Skypark is the only saving grace factor for MBS. Its magnificent view and relaxing Infinity pool were the only experiences living up to the marketing hype put out by MBS as far as I am concern. Access to hotel billing information through the room entertainment (tv) system together with its express check-out procedures does making it quick and convenient for its guest to depart. Certainly a positive considering I wanted to get out of such an ordinary and mediocre experience as quickly as I can. As if too aware of its many shortcoming MBS does not even provide feedback card in its room for the guest to fill in. There is not one in my room at least. I am sure their explanation for it would be the availability of their online feedback for productivity reason. My advise to travellers out there is for the money you would be spending by staying at MBS there are quite a few much better hotels in Singapore to go to instead. I could name them here but that would be quite unethical.

Not a quiet/sedate hotel. The size of the place is quite immense and personal service is thus distinctly lacking. Food & drink is certainly not cheap and whilst breakfast offered plenty of choice the food was by & large lukewarm. certainly room for improvement. On the plus side - location is good. The gym at the top of Tower 2 is absolutley brilliant. But the showstealer and the reason you should visit this hotel at lesat once - is the Skypark.

And even more problems during our 2nd stay. During our first stay there, they checked us and another couple (all adults) into 2 adjoining rooms (with a door in the middle) and the 2nd room had twin beds (which we had clearly asked for king bed given Mr. and Mrs). We had a lousy construction view the first time (can't remember which level but it must be the lower levels as there was a balcony). Apart from that, everything else was ok during our first stay; we had daily morning room service and daily turndowns during the evening- a complimentary fruit basket and plate of chocolates (I'm not sure if it was part of the room package or their sign of apology). Check in took sometime as well- ard 1 hour or so. The pool then was crowded in the morning but we spent most of the time either at the casinos or heading to Orchard Rd. (we had friends fetching us around then). During our 2nd trip there, it was just my husband and myself and the main reason why we stayed there was we were going there just to watch Lion King. This time, it turned out worse than the first time. The first hiccup happened right when we drove up through the driveway sharp at 2.30pm. My husband asked if he could park in the hotel and the valet told him: No, Sir. We only valet park here and it's more expensive. The valet directed my husband to park at the adjoining shopping mall (which we later found out that you can actually park at the hotel where the valets park their car but just pay a higher price which my husband clearly said he was willing to pay). I had to get off the car and do the check in all by myself while my husband drove off to find the other parking area which you'd have to walk through the shopping mall first before getting the hotel. I proceeded to the check in counter only to find out that the room was not ready and they advised me to go around the pool area (skypark) and hang around and get some drinks and wait for the room to be ready. They also said they will call me once the room was ready. We were both tired from a long drive and wished to get to our room immediately but we complied. At least they took care of our luggage. I do wish they served complimentary drinks at the skypark while waiting. So, we walked around the shopping mall and located the foodcourt (which wasn't opened the last time we were there last Nov) and had a late lunch (no point going to Skypark when it was so hot and the food up there puny yet expensive). We waited till 4.30pm and there was no phone call. Fed up, we walked all the way from the shopping mall to the check in counters and demanded for our rooms and we were told it was ready. We headed to the room in Tower 3 and found it to be clean and ready to be lived in. We then tried to access the wifi from our room - we wanted to subscribe to 2 full days of access but somehow, the list failed to pop up on our mobiles and I had to call concierge to confirm what happened. Turns out that we had been charged to hourly wifi access (but my husband hadn't clicked on anything since nothing turned up on his mobile) and after a few phonecalls to concierge, room service and finally someone called back from the IT department and we had that sorted out after an hour. At least they granted us complimentary WIFI access after our ordeal. One thing about inroom WIFI access here is the network tends to 'dropout' or 'timeout' after some time of idle and you'd have to relog back in everytime that happens. That was the end of MBS's screwup for the first day. In the evening, when we got back to our rooms after heading out for dinner and the Lion King show, we found a plate of chocolates with a letter of apology for late check in and they turned down.The room itself was great- firm mattress, plush pillows and we had a great sleep. Midway through the night, it did get a little hot and we just kicked off the covers despite the airconditioning set to 21C. 2nd day there went by without any major hitch (they didn't turn down on 2nd day and we didn't bother asking for it). The guy who came in to clean did a great job arranging my various bottles of amenities on the sinktop and was really courteous as we were around when he came by to clean around 11am. We checked out on the 3rd day and there was a long queue at check out. Despite that, only 2 counters were allocated to check out. The line at check-in (both the check-out and check-in were side-by-side) was short. They should have the sense to offload some of the checkout queue and redirect to the check-in to speed it up. It took around 30 mins to get past check-out (and I think I was there listening in to the previous poster from Jakarta who complained about the surprise breakfast charge). My husband had another nasty surprise when he went to collect his car parked at the shopping centre as he was given inhouse guest parking passes that would charge him only 1 day since they don't charge on Sundays and the valet told him it would only charge a day) but we had to pay 3 days at the exit parking. We had to turn back to the drivethrough and my husband got off and had a word with the valet and the valet insisted that it shouldn't have happened (being charged 3 days) and finally gave us complimentary passes for our future trips and parkings there (not like that's going to happen...I've decided to go with Resorts World in future trips to not go through all the problems)) as my husband didn't get the receipt from the exit parking (we didn't see a receipt button and if you have driven or parked in Singapore before, you'd have to use a cashcard and swipe it at the exit- it was our first time doing that and we hadn't expected receipts to be issued at the parking exit where the bar goes up and your car goes through). We left MBS with less than a great memory at MBS. The view from our room this time was great- we had a great view of the Esplanade and the skyline. Oh yes, the room keys kept failing in the lifts (we had them reissued 4 times) but that didn't stop the problems..we had to get into the stuffy hot lifts (you'd imagine the lifts are airconditioned being a 5-star hotel)...put in my husband's card..and press the button..which then didn't light up. Then, we'd need to proceed to using my card...press the button..which then didn't light up...with frustration because by this time, you'd get other guests in the lift looking sideways at you (there are some people who would use this lift as visitors to get up to the Skypark and I think the other guests might perceive us as those) and it doesn't help that the lift was hot. Then we'd have to walk out to the lift and walk around 50ms away to get our key cards reset or changed with another set. After half a year, I'd expect the key card system to be working properly (it's beyond the teething stage already) as the same happened during our stay here last November.

Then after reading the positive reviews I wondered how it is the experiences were so vastly different, how could so many more reviewers (almost double) have such high praise and not have experienced the same issues as those who were so scathing in their reviews. I came to the conclusion that vast majority of those critical reviews simply aren't genuine and probably motivated by those with an ulterior agenda, maybe the opposition are worried? so we settled on the MBS and booked our week long stay there. We had no complaints what so ever. From the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly by very genuinely welcoming staff, the check-in was very quick and professional. Our Club room was beautiful, clean, very well furnished with a very comfortable bed, writing desk, TV, large well designed bathroom and a view of the Singapore city that was truly a sight to see especially at night. The Sky Park is incredible, the infinity pool is unique and amazing and I might add its not open to non guests so that claim is simply not true and one of many untruths written in bad reviews. Ku De Ta and the Club lounge are spectacular and the service is outstanding. The Shoppes is well worth a stroll through even if some of the shops are beyond the budget of many. The casino is free for tourists but you do need your passport, its not as big as many Vegas casinos but personally I don't think that is a bad thing. The hotel lobby area is really stunning and huge. A lot of people around and clearly many are not guests but sightseers, but its not an issue unless you have very delicate sensibilities. One previous reviewer described this hotel very well when they said the MBS is much more than a hotel, it is the entire package and a destination in itself. We had no issues at all with the service. I didn't encounter any rude staff and none that couldn't speak English. Room service was fast and efficient for a hotel that is so large. We were never intruded upon by room staff when we had our do not disturb sign on.

Trust me, ignore the nonsense manufactured rubbish people moan about because we didn't see, witness, hear of, let alone experience anything like what people have complained about. Ignore them and find out the truth for yourselves, you wont regret it. We had a Club room in tower 1, checking in was fast and trouble free. Our room was perfect, very comfortable bed, large bathroom with a good size shower and bath. The room was well furnished and not crowded with too much clutter or furniture, the view is spectacular and when we had the do not disturb sign on no one bothered us. Just remember to turn it off when you leave your room or it probably wont be made up when you return which would be your fault not the hotels. The pool is amazing and can get busy but there are no non guests in the pool area, that is rubbish, if you actually stayed at this hotel you would know its nonsense. The Club on the 57th floor is truly beautiful with wonderful welcoming, friendly and helpful staff and the same can be said of all the staff we encountered. I don't know where all these so called non English speaking staff are because we never encountered any. Service is excellent everywhere as you would expect. I don't know why people complain about the location. Surely people have the sense to check to see if the hotel location suits their needs. If it doesn't there are 249 other hotels and no doubt more than a few would fit the bill. Don't complain about the location, that's your choice.

The check in process was extremely slow and I am from Indonesia which should be used to agonizing delays.

The hotel was crowded and filled with people trying to get to the top floor, so it takes a while to get our bags up. The next morning we were again shocked at the lines to get our breakfasts, we had to wait 45 minutes to get seated or have to walk 1 mile to get to another breakfast area near the convention centre. This happened every morning and made you regret taking a room with breakfast when we could just go down to the food court for better and cheaper meals. The staff was friendly until i missed a tip and they started singing my room number outloud in the corridor going away, which was unthinkable if you stayed in Korea or Japan or Indonesia. We also had trouble sleeping because the room is not sound proof from the neighbors so at 1 AM we still heard people talking and laughing. Location was not very good and it is quite a walk from Marina area except at night which is cool. The price was too high for this type of room in this area. Mandarin Orchard is a bit cheaper but so much better. I even preferred Concorde which is way cheaper or Fullerton.

There were many guests checking in but it was fast as there were many staff in the counter. They were all so very warm and friendly and allowed us an early check-in and room upgrade! At the counter, the staff told us that our room key is our access to the elevator and to skypark. That prevents outsiders to go up and that feels good. The room was very clean and big. The temperature was just right, lot of free coffee and tea bags. For inquiries and request, there is a priority button on the phone and they always grant our request for extra bathrobes and slippers (as they got wet at the pool). The in room dining is fast and efficient, the waiting time is just right and the food is good, the cost is cheaper that dining in in those classy restos at the adjoining mall. The skypark with infinity pool is beautiful. There are many people swimming and walking around, but reasonably because there were many curious guests. There is no free internet access inside room and lobby, but you can have free internet access at their business center behind the check in counter. They also have a big guests lounge beside the check in counter with flowing tea, coffee and cookies. You really wouldnt be hungry at the lobby.

The room is rquipped with a big flat screen TV, a round dining table with 4 chairs, its own aircon controll pad, a Bar fridghe that sends automatic billing within 30 seconds when items removed or just move around.

A working esspresso machine with 3 choices and TWG teas and Timms coffee.

We are regulars to Singapore, and visit every second month or so, and we often stay in wonderful hotels. This was meant to be a big treat, paying $440 USD for one night. The location was not as good as many other hotels. The foyer was like an airport. No ambiance, nowhere to sit or relax. Big glass sliding doors opened into a huge empty hall. With many people rushing around. There were just 2 staff at check in, unhelpfully labeled Registration. We wondered if we were in the wrong queue, but the queue on the other side of the huge hall was 5 times longer, so we waited. And waited. And waited. Nowhere to sit. Most hotels have a welcoming foyer with couches and armchairs. Not even a plastic chair in this hotel. So the 3 of us stood and listened to the other guests complaining about waiting 20 minutes just to check in. The room was quite nice, but the drilling from the construction site next door was not. Very loud-and we were on the 26th floor! So we did not bother going on the baloney at all. Pool was nice after walking a very long way to the toilets that were rather awful. Staff were banging on the toilet door as I was changing, maybe they wanted to clean it, I don't know. Quite rude whatever they wanted. Because of a storm everyone was ordered out of the pool so that was the end of that. A 10 minute dip. The shopping mall was rather depressing, designer shops with not a customer in sight and lonely storekeepers standing outside, watching you and hoping you'll come in. Not my idea of fun shopping. We were not sure if breakfast was included in our $440, so we went down the next morning anyway. My son's hot chocolate never arrived, I had 1 yogurt and one croissant, my husband had a plate of hot food, and the breakfast bill came to $90 SD!! Luckily, we were able to see this weekend as an adventure and not to let this hotel's poor performance spoil our visit to Singapore. Total bill for one night : around $530 USD.

We did write and complain about our experience to the hotel, I had to follow this up twice by phone and a second email before I got a response. The hotel wrote to us and acknowledged the majority of our complaints had been brought up by other guests - proves even with all that money to spend they can get it so very wrong....As 'compensation' for not really delivering on what a SG$1000 dollar experience should be we got a complimentary certificate for 2 at Rise Restaurant, which we will not be using as we have been told the Rise experience a bun fight! In short the hotel needs to make up its mind if its catering for the general public or for its guests, currently it is doing neither well. Rather than retyping everything out, below is the letter I wrote to Marina Bay Sands, I am afraid I went into one when writing and apologies for the length but for SG$1000 a night I expect perfection. Online Booking I booked a Luxe package online. The booking confirmation did not indicate a Luxe package had been booked. I had to ring to confirm I had a Luxe package. The booking confirmation did not indicate there was VIP checkin available nor what Tower I would need to check in at. I was not told this information when I confirmed the booking over the phone. Check in We chose to arrive via MRT, signage was poor with a bus stop for Marina Bay Sands pointing to the right on exiting the MRT station, we never came across the bus stop and saw no more signage to the Marina Bay Sands. Signage to the hotel was too discreet, hidden by building work hoardings or non existent from the moment we entered the Marina Bay Sands complex. Once we came up into the hotel in tower two there was no signage indicating which direction check in was, we ended up finding check out, only to be told check in was all the way down at the front of the hotel in tower one (once again this could be simply resolved by providing the information in the booking confirmation) . Having checked in, we then had to go to the VIP lounge, where we were told we could have checked in. Again, why is this information not included when you make the booking and why isn't the VIP lounge signed? Room The room we were given looked nothing like the room in the photos, whilst the room was large in size it felt like it was an after thought to make it into a suite - like 2 regular rooms had had a couple of doors built into the interconnecting wall. It felt as if there was absolutely no consideration to the interior design of the room, either in aesthetic or use, the room contained the basic furniture that was needed in a room without any thought to the rooms shape or size. The room was sparsely furnished in comparison to its size; with a room of that shape effort needs to be made to furnish it so it does not feel like you are sat in a corridor. Why the view from the window has not been made the hero of the room I don't understand, you could have had the lounge there or added additional chairs so you could sit in the window and appreciate the view. The room was advertised as having a pillow menu, where was that menu, we never came across it. The room was advertised as having a nightly turn down service, that didn't happen either. If your going to have electric controlled curtains, have the controls next to the bed, not next to the curtains?! I tried to increase the air conditioning from its set 23 degrees to 25 degrees using the thermostat on the wall this didn't happen and for our stay the temperature remained at 23 degrees, which is freezing. Service I would expect a 5* hotel to have sufficient English speaking staff, be that whether its in an English speaking country or not. There is a big lack of English speaking staff at this hotel, our restaurant booking was taken for the wrong night, we were met with blank expressions when asking questions and and our food order was not correct once brought to the table - If you were in China you could let it go, but Singapore's main language is English. Bathroom The temperature control on the shower was too stiff and meant that the water had to be on full power to easily adjust the water temperature, which meant that you were covered in either scalding or freezing water before you could get to the dial to change it. There was only one bathmat next to the bath, not one for the shower. There is no towel rail, where are you supposed to put your wet towels after you have used them? Skypark This was like being on Orchard Road. For the money, we would have expected some privacy/exclusivity, we certainly didn't feel this was delivered during our stay. If anything using the pool felt like we were exhibits for the Sky Park day visitors. I was under the impression that the use of the pool was exclusively for guests, there were plenty of non guests using the pool.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Moderne01", "ReviewID": "UR103730714", "Content": "We only stayed 3 days at Marina Bay Sands but wished we had stayed for more.

Once the gardens/glasshouses on the ocean side are completed then the few from both sides of the hotel will be great. The room was great, a very comfortable bed and great bathroom and huge bathtub. The service from the staff was very good. Always helpful, we managed to check in 3 hours early. The concierge and bell hops were always helpful and the free shuttle bus to the airport that leaves every 30 minutes is a bonus. Even though the shops across the road are not really part of the hotel as such, they are very nice. The 24 hours Rasapura masters hawkers food court is helpful if your budget doesn't quite stretch to breakfast at the hotel. The casino is just a basic casino, nothing special, and the fact the smoking is still allowed is probably a real turn off to most non-smoker, non-serious gamblers. At the moment its a bit hard to get from the hotel to many of Singapore's attractions but once the new MRT station is completed this will improve this greatly. The public buses that run past will get you to most places though, and taxis are plentiful and fairly cheap.

It's stunning from the outside - and the inside too. Very much on a Vegas scale, only thankfully without a lot of the over-the-top interior design. Plus the casio/shops centre is across the road from the main hotel - so you don't have to compete with those crowds. The big attraction is the swimming pool on floor 57, it's just amazing. And it didn't get TOO busy either, either mid-week or weekend. Families tended to arrive at the end of the day and it was busier then, but check out the Ku De Ta section (with red sunloungers) which is adults only (provided the lifeguards police it). We had a standard city view room, tower 1, floor 29, with great views over the bay to the city. Room is spacious, nice colour scheme, great bed, oversized bathroom with his-and-her basins, separate shower, \"statement bathtub\", robes etc. Pretty much what you'd expect from a 5-star room. PS the rooms on the ocean side look over a huge building site so you might want to avoid them for the next 12 months. Like most hotels with 2,500 rooms don't be expecting 5-star service; hotels this big just can't deliver it. The staff are mixed - from experienced and helpful, to disinterested and dithery. You should also expect to queue (often lengthy) for anything at reception (great start: a 10-minute line for check-in, even at 10.30pm....) and for taxis. Best bits: that swimming pool. Did someone mention the view? Great gym. Good bedrooms. Elevators surprisingly quick for so many rooms. Little niggles: feeling like you're just a number (i.e. one of 5000 guests). Not policing the \"adults only\" rule in one part of the swimming pool. Queues. Variable service on the pool deck, expensive in-room wi-fi.

Its any wonder the staff are run off their feet when they have to deal with stupid requests from thoughtless guests who lack the foresight to think and plan ahead. If you book the cheapest room don't expect to get a room on the higher floors. If that's what you want then dust off your wallet and pay the price. That applies to any hotel. There's nothing wrong with the level or quality of service at this hotel. I stayed there for 4 nights and I had no issues at all, none, zero. In fact the service made my stay one that I will remember and appreciate for a lifetime. The room was excellent. I wont go into the finer details but you lack for nothing, the bed the bathroom the amenities the view the space is all you can expect from a hotel of this quality and trust me the MBS is all quality. This is not just a hotel, its a destination in itself. My advice is check the bad attitudes and unreasonable expectations before you leave home, relax kick back and enjoy and if you do that you will have a great time.

We stayed at the horizon premier room on the 27th floor in Tower 2, which has seperate shower and bath tub. (Tower 1&2 ) The room is big, has a nice view of the city. It only took us 10 mins to check in, wasn't too bad. The staff were ok. Since the hotel is always fully booked during the weekends, you should not expect any upgrade or choices of room. Make sure you check what you' have booked, because my original booking was in Tower 1 but they allocate us to Tower 2. (OK, I justneed a bath tub, I think tower 3 has no bath tub as we were told) The next morning we woke up at 10 and went straight to the pool. There were qutie a lot of people in the pool, I don't think you can do a lot of swimming (many kids), but it is ok to take pictures. It has the most beautiful view of Singapore, so take as many pictures as you can. The only problem is the weather. It is unpredictable. I was there when the weather channel said thunderstorm, but turn out it was sunny. (Lucky). If it rains than it will ruin your experience, so go when it is sunny! The casino is big! While it is quite annoying to go-thru 4 check points at the Entrance before we can actually get into the casino. Hold on to your passport until you hit the table. The shopping mall is ok, but stuff are not cheap. Make sure you try the celebrity restaurants. (DB or Mozza). You need to make reservation ahead, otherwise you won't have a chance.

Some people need to get real. This hotel is outstanding and I don't give praise lightly. The service was fantastic, really friendly charming helpful staff everywhere.

While the hotel has spectacular design and breathtaking view of Marina Bay from its sky pool, the service was a serious let down. This hotel has 2557 rooms but don't seem to have enough staffs ? On day one, we asked for a shaving kit to be delivered to our room , took them 30 minutes and two follow up calls until the kit was delivered , wonder why. The sky pool has a great view but it's always busy. Again, one sky pool has to accommodate for 2557 rooms ,so i'm sure you can imagine how busy it can be. I would have given \"average\" or \"decent\" rating if it wasn't because of the priority express staff communicating the wrong information about car parking for hotel guests. This hotel doesn't provide complimentary parking for its guests ( unless if you're their Piaza members ). So, we parked our car in the shopping mall and had to walk about 10 minutes to the hotel. Okay, we were fine with this at first, no complaints. On the night before we checked out, we came back to to the hotel around 11pm and parked our car . Upon returning to our room, I called up the Priority Express hotline and asked specifically if i needed to inform the hotel my car plate number so that we needed only to pay $6 flat per entry rate . The lady confidently informed us that no such registration process was required and we were assured by her that upon exiting, ONLY $6 flat rate will be charged. The following day, we checked out and when were about to exit the car park, we were shocked to find out that hourly rates were charged to our cashcard!! Later did we find out that we had to inform the hotel out car plate number and they would enter the number into the system and issue us a special parking ticket. Was this communicated by the lady from Priority Express? No!! Im not making a huge fuss about the parking fee that we had to pay when exited, it was the misleading information that upset me.

It was a good 4 star room, spacious with comfortable beds and chaise but feels more functional rather than luxurious. The room lacks the character and elegance found in other Sands hotels. In fact the bench at the foot of the bed had a glue/wax stain (and evidence of unsuccessful efforts at removal); rather disappointing considering this hotel just opened recently. Our view was of the harbour and the undeveloped promenade area. Should be spectacular in the future but lacks luster at the moment. Facilities - Underwhelming lobby with bizarre colourful reception area for a 5star hotel, this is probably temporary but as first impressions last, this sets the stage for a less than glamourous experience and what to expect during your stay. Fantastic pool at night and early morning when you have it for yourself, easily the best and most impressive pool we've seen but during the day it's like a human zoo. The hotel is already beginning to show signs of wear, with peeling signs and scratches in the window. This is probably a teething problem. Service - Friendly, warm and accommodating staff. Food - Daily breakfast buffet offered a wide range of cuisine but the taste was just okay. We dont think it's worth SGD38 (although included in the room). The Chocolate Bar we found to be average bordering on poor. The display looked quite appealing but the quality and taste of the desserts were not memorable. Food court was a reasonable option but the next day, our local guests and us all had tummy trouble. Considering this is a 5 star hotel and it is Singapore, this was a bit of a shock. Location - Great location at Marina Bay, and would be even better once the MTR is up and running. Evening river walk to Clark Quay was quite pleasant. Price/Value: The scene and price are set for a 5-star experience but at present the Marina Bay Sands struggles to provide more than a 3.5 star experience.

We were in an Atrium room on the 9th floor which unfortunately did not have a view facing the city. Our room had a splendid view of the continuing building works that are going on all around the Marina area. Very noisy both with the traffic passing on the road but more importantly the continued sound of reversing beepers on diggers and trucks, from early to late. So....... Pro's: Fantastic build with just the most incredible swimming experience you'll have had in a long time. Con's: We had a bottle of Tiger beer each in the Skypark bar on our last evening Sing$18.00 each plus 7% tax but more incredibly a 10% service charge for a barman to lift them from behind the bar on to the top of the bar. The very same bottle of Tiger was available in the 7/11 store for $4.50.........so be warned.

For a hotel who charges this much I wonder why they are ranked this low on Tripadvisor. Certainly people who have in the past stayed here felt shortchanged or something because there was a good number who left the hotel unhappy about their stay. So I decided to just book a night and move to the Grand Hyatt where I would normally stay when in Singapore. Date of Stay: March 31,2011 Room Type: Marina Bay Club Room Upgrade: none Amount Paid Per Night: 432.65++SGD Reservation Method: Hotel Website Loyalty Card: None Airport/Hotel Transfer: When traveling into Singapore I usually just take a cab to the hotel either the normal cab or the limousine service at the airport, basically the difference is not that big so if you don't want to queue for your turn just head for the limousine counter and you will be on your way in less than 5 minutes. The hotel also offers shuttles to the hotel for arriving passenger but I didn't bother locating where the pickup point was. Check in: I've read dozens of people complaining about the 3pm check-in time and that most of them were turned away if they arrived early. I was worried this would happen but was pleasantly surprised when Didith at the counter sent me to the The Club at Marina Bay Sands for some refreshment while they clean up the room. There I was served breakfast and refreshments and in under an hour Anthony approached me with my room keys. Room: The room could be considered a suite by its size but I would have preferred that the bed was moved closer to the widows and the sitting area moved to where the bed was. To be very honest I am not least bit impressed with the room. I feel that the hotel in their rush to open didn't put some thinking in the design of the room and hence you are given a plain box with a bed, sofa, a work table and a TV. For example: 1. I was on the 49th floor and had an amazing view of the Singapore skyline. I would stay again if just for the view but the automatic curtains even when fully open still covers almost 1/2 of the window hence wasting the magnificent view. If they thought about it, they could have either extended the railings of the curtains to extend to the walls on the side so that when opened it would just move off to the walls instead of blocking the view or like in most hotels which boasts their views they could just have a roll up shade instead. 2. The Nespresso Machine and electric kettle is kept inside the cabinet without any power outlets. So if you want to have coffee, you would have to bring it out and plug it elsewhere to enjoy their morning brew. In all hotels i've stayed in that have Nespresso or other coffee machines, all of them have it mounted and plugged into the sockets already and there is enough space in a room for a small cabinet to fit these in and not just appear like an after though. 3. Another example is the position of the TV, Although it should be in full view from the bed, you would have a hard time seeing the TV from the sitting area. Bathroom: Pretty standard, quite big but then not impressed one bit. The shower stall was the biggest I've been in, problem is they only equipped it with a normal shower head they least they could have done is install a rain shower system overhead. The one at the Grand Hyatt maybe half the size but at least it has one. For the amount guests are paying for I would have expected better toiletries. I understand that Paiza is an exclusive club for high rollers but they could have just picked up L'Occitane, Bulgari, Acqua di Parma or Molton Brown toiletries at least they would smell better. To be honest the Paiza Toiletries reminds me of toiletries provided in local hotels in China. Breakfast: The spread at the Club lounge is okay. Don't expect too much, at least they have eggs, sausages, hash brown, a few dimsum and congee. They have a good selection of bread, fruits and yogurt. Check-out: When I got to the ground floor the Club reception desk was empty and I had to wait for over 10 minutes, after which I decided to go into the VIP lounger where I found a hotel staff to help me. Overall: Stay for the pool, get a picture taken and check out as soon as you can. Although I've read a lot of complaints about the service at the hotel, I've never encountered any except perhaps the lack of a turn down service. I've read somewhere that you have to actually request it and they won't really do it for you as part of the stay which I thought was weird because it's pretty much expected in all luxury hotels.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGuest service outshone the site facilities\u201d", "Author": "Blanksie1945", "ReviewID": "UR102710596", "Content": "I stayed on 2 April with my wife in a Club Room on 44th Floor.

Walking into the lobby is like delving into a work of art, one that goes up and up and up... the hotel consists of three giant steel-and-glass sculptures connected to one another by a friggin ship at the top. How much more awesome can you get? Once you get over the initial wow, however, Marina Bay Sands falls short on the nitty-gritty details. The rooms are spacious, which is rare in an overcrowded city like Singapore, and the beds are lovely and stacked with fluffy pillows, but the bathrooms leave something to be desired. The toilets seem pretty old compared to the shiny new surroundings, but most importantly, they're on low flush. LOW FLUSH!!! Suffice to say, with my dad and his incredible digestive tract, we had to call the concierge twice to fix the toilet bowl. To their credit, they're always friendly despite the horror stories their handymen must bring back with them after unclogging the toilet. The shower is also disappointing. I might sound really demanding, but if I'm shelling out hundreds of dollars per night to stay at a 5-star hotel, I expect a shower head that does more than give a feeble spray of water that alternates between scalding hot and squealing cold every few seconds. Moving on to Marina Bay Sands's pride and joy: the infinity pool on the 57th floor. Okay, the pool itself is the epitome of awesomeness. No complaints whatsoever about the pool. But it is packed with people. And when I say people, I don't mean well-behaved adult guests sipping cocktails while reading on their lounge chairs. I mean FAMILIES. Screaming children. Grandpas with camcorders recording ever move their sweet, cute, SCREAMING grandkids make. More children. Despite the \"Adults Only\" signs adorning the pool perimeters, there are kids everywhere. Running between your legs, canon balling into the pool and splashing water all over you... and their parents don't bother telling them off, they're too busy admiring the view. I'm not normally an anti-kids person, but this was just too much. It was way too crowded to be relaxing at all. Speaking of the noise level, that's my other big issue with the hotel. They hire many people from mainland China, which is fine in and of itself, but mainland Chinese people are LOUD. I'm Chinese. I'm loud. But I also know when to be loud and when not to be. The employees of Marina Bay Sands don't. Breakfast at the hotel buffet is like Sunday dim sum with the rest of the village: dishes clanging, people seated elbow to elbow with barely enough space to walk in between the buffet lines and the tables, and above all the disorder, constant yelling from the waiters and busboys and other employees. Come on guys, I expect that in a dim sum restaurant and somewhat enjoy that aspect of dim sum when my family and I do go, but not from a 5-star hotel that is costing me an unbelievable amount of money! This might sound really classist of me, but they're charging 5-star prices, so I feel like we deserve to be transported to an environment where there is some sort of order and people aren't hurried in and out of the breakfast buffet. I couldn't for the life of me enjoy my meal. I just felt so harried by all the waiters rushing about, yelling all sorts of orders to one another. All in all, if you're taking little kids with you on your trip, then by all means, join the hordes of parents with little screaming, canon balling children and take over the rooftop pool at the Marina Bay Sands. I'm not being snarky here, I do mean that in the nicest way possible. There's no use trying to fight it. The pool has been taken over by children and that's just how it is. If you're a young, hip couple or a group of friends, ehhhh.

The room was large as was the bathroom, which had a separate shower stall @ a funky bath. The room was decorated in a minimalist style as befits an ultra modern hotel. I arrived at 9pm on a Thursday evening & was delighted to find that there was no queue/line to check-in. I had been allocated a sea facing room but requested a city view, which was given to me with no fuss. On the first evening, I ate at Rise restaurant, which offers both a buffet & a la carte. The buffet was very good, offering a great selection of both Asian & western dishes. As I was staying in a club room, I ate breakfast on the 57th floor. Whilst it was busy the breakfast buffet offered good quality choices without the choices being extensive. I'd always book a club room in the future simply for the views from the club area.

It was meant to be a stopover honeymoon treat for us. We booked throught the MBS website, which is more of a glossy sales brocure than useful website for information. I had to email them to ask for their booking/cancellation procedures. Entering my details I could only choose only from US states, eventhough I picked \"Australia\" for country. Prices on the website didn't include the extra tax/service charge, which only got added on *after* I've submitted my credit card details and confirm the booking. That was a substantial ~$80 added on from advertised prices. So, inital impressions weren't that good. Checking in-: long queues, very polite stuff who tried to help manage the queues but there was little they could do. Kids screaming and running about in the lobby. It was peak period after all. Rooms - we wanted some backgound music - there was no radio, not even via the TV. When we called reception to enquire, we were told we could hire a DVD player for $100 a night and that could play CDs. So we had to reply on our iphones for music for our $500/night room. Room size was good, bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was large. The tub was good sized but to fit 2 in, the fixed tap in one corner could really take someone's eye out. The view of the city always impresses, but it wasn't as high as floor as I had expected or paid for. (31st floor). Upstairs the skydeck was breathtaking, but again, lots of screaming kids running about. And unfortunalty, it rained for us. All the service staff we've encountered were very polite and tried to be helpful. We appreciated that and that all of them spoke good English. Room service breakfast was good - one of the best ommelette I've ever had. Not trying to be scarastic here. It was good. So, unless it is off peak season and you've got a good discounted room rate and you are ensured of sunshine and good wearther, don't bother.

To be honest I don't get it because none of the things I have read that others have complained about happened to us. One thing I have noticed is those who seem to complain the most always seem to recommend another hotel by name to stay at. I wonder why that is ... maybe the competition is worried perhaps? This hotel could never be described as a bargain hotel and it doesn't pretend to be. Yes it demands premium prices and it, in my opinion delivers quality in return plus much more. Can you get a good quality hotel in Singapore cheaper? Yes of course, we could have booked elsewhere cheaper and if that is all you need or want then maybe this hotel isn't for you. We decided to stay at the MBS because we wanted to have the entire experience and not just the room or just the pool or just the Sky Park or just the shops, casino, museum or restaurants and the list goes on. That for me is the point of staying at a hotel like the MBS because its not just a hotel. There are 249 other places that are just hotels in that city and if you just want a hotel then one of those 249 options is where you should stay. We had great service everywhere at the MBS be it reception, room service, restaurants, casino, Club lounge and the pool. I didn't encounter rude or snooty staff anywhere but there again we weren't rude to them either so I guess you get what you give. Maybe some people need to lighten up. Our room was amazing, very clean, large and the view was awesome. I agree the pool would be better if it was heated but I loved it. The Club on floor 57 is beautiful and the staff there were so friendly and welcoming in a genuine way. I'm not much of a gambler but the casino was fun and worth the experience. The shopping mall has a lot of high end expensive brand name stores and I get that not everyone has the budget to indulge, but not everyone has the budget to indulge Rodeo Drive either and yet tourists still visit it.

The rooms are big and very nice, a decent value for the upper $300's US, but not a bargain. I'll skip to the issues. The service is NOT good. We ordered food at FUSE bar one night at 11:15 pm and the waitress said \"I'll have to check if we can do that. The kitchen closes at midnight\" Wait...what?? She refused to recant this assertion and then rudely corrected my friends pronunciation of lychee. Which by the way can be pronounced both ways, depending what language you speak. Regardless, how rude! The service all around is stubborn and slow, although often polite and stubborn and slow. Fitness Center-service is very nice and view is spectacular. However, this is where the architectural marvels start to give out. The air con is in the MIDDLE of the room, and the cardio machines at the perimeter. Considering the large windows, it's pretty hot and humid and uncomfortable unless you are an accustomed Singaporean I guess. The women's locker room contains the SAUNA and basically IS a sauna. So after your sticky hot workout, you can shower off and try to change...yeah right! It's so hot in there it's a nightmare. The bathroom doors have a one way weatherstripping that swing through and trap the door on the wrong side...bad, bad, bad. The equipment is nice. Rooftop dining/drinking- Spectacular view, really world class. Also, the most expensive drinks in the GALAXY I'm pretty sure and I've been to some pretty overpriced locales. $15US for a BEER. $30 or so for a glass of wine/champagne. And get this. They don't even fill the glass!!! They put it 2/3rds and when you protest, they make it 3/4s full. A half pour for $30! It's like nothing I've ever seen. Every time! I went to the Sky on 57 to try to get happy hour snacks/drink. Same game with the half pour. And really nothin but fried crap on the menu, same as the pool, same as FUSE. Really?? Not even a satay or something? Actually, the satay at 'Rise' was fried to hell. Nightmare. So at Sky, we got those styrofoam asian crackers and ordered some grilled mushrooms which, after 40 minutes, still never came out! The stubborn slow polite waiter protested when, after 2 $30 half glasses of wine, we decided to call it a day, that we should keep waiting. Oh my word. So, go, enjoy, the view is great.

You can shower or bathe to your hearts content. Either way the long winded complaint was as clear as mud and made very little sense. I've stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and while it is undeniably an excellent hotel, I can't recall seeing an ice machine and a 20 minute wait for ice is hardly an eternity and certainly not something worth making such a big fuss over. Especially when the guest called the the concierge for ice, why not call room service? That's what room service is for and they probably would have got their ice in half the time. Some people are their own worst enemies and make things much more complicated for all concerned than they have too. Now I understand why other reviewers say many complaints are either not credible or self inflicted nonsense. I couldn't fault this hotel and the service was exceptional right from the onset. Check-in was problem free, the room type (Club) I had booked and the request for a city view was met. My room was very clean including the bathroom, it was tastefully furnished with a very comfortable bed, work desk, internet access, cable TV, a Nespresso machine and a safe. The room was spacious and well appointed, everything I would expect from a premium 5 star hotel. Room service was very good, the Club Lounge on the 57th floor was a fine venue to meet a client. The staff in the Club provided excellent service although the amazing view was a little distracting. The infinity pool looked very impressive and the view of the city from the Sky Park is really something special. This hotel is not just about the pool or the extraordinary architecture, anyone who says that isn't using their eyes. The MBS is a very unique venue for Singapore that goes far beyond just a hotel. If you think the MBS is all about the pool and the hotel design you've totally missed the point and the real experience. This month was my second visit and in just over 3 months I will be returning. Those who are discerning and have a sense of appreciation for quality will understand and appreciate the MBS for what it is, an excellent hotel.

Upon arrival at 430pm on a Friday afternoon we had to line up to check in. There were many staff on-hand at the counter and the waiting time was minimal. The ambiance of the lobby was not good. I felt like I was in a train station or in the middle of a shopping mall. The check-in area should be a bit more exclusive and perhaps a carpeted area with some soft couches or sofas to segregate it from the main hall. We were happy to know that we had been upgraded. We did not ask for this but felt we were off to a great start. The young lady checking us in was pleasant and took the time to write everything down on our key card envelope as to where the pool, gym and Marina Bay Club were located. She indicated that we could avail of the Marina Bay Club but breakfast would not be included and we would need to pay for drinks. In my opinion - if you upgrade someone, it should not come with conditions. However, we were happy to have a nice room with a better view. The room was in Tower 2 and had an amazing view of Marina Bay. This is what you are paying for - and it is spectacular. After unpacking we headed up to the pool to take a look. Amazing to say the least. However, this is where things started to slide. There are far too many people from the public viewing area lurking around taking pictures and posing. The pool area ( adults only section) is right near Ku De Ta and the public view area. The public should not be able to access anywhere near the pool area at all. There was a rope across the entry to the adult area that said \"Hotel Guests Only\" - but many \"would be\" photographers managed to slip passed without security confirming if they were hotel guests or not . There were some billowy \"curtains\" which were placed along the back end of the \"adult\" only section. But the general public would constantly stick their arms through with their cameras to take pictures. It was very irritating to constantly watch people pose and act like they were movie stars or something. It was very difficult to truly relax when having to always hear cameras clicking and the constant \"oohs and ahhhs\". The public area is fantastic in itself and would provide an adequate viewing experience without allowing entry to the one end of the pool area. MBS - you need to do something about this. Just before sunset we decided to go into the Marina Bay Club for a drink. We were stopped at the door while they checked our room number and name. We were abruptly told that we had a \"free\" upgrade but no benefits. I explained that we wanted to have a drink and were quite willing to pay for it. I was told If we wanted to access the Marina Bay Club we would need a letter of invite from the front desk 57 floors below. Embarrassed ( there were others in the line behind me), I gave in and walked away. Felt a bit like a fool trying to get something for free. We then walked over to Skypark 57 for a drink. We asked the security personnel standing outside the restaurant if there was a bar inside where we could have a drink? She thought I said \"spa\" and tried to direct me elsewhere. Eventually when I finally got through to her that we were looking for a place to have a drink only, she said she \"had no idea\" but to \"check inside\". We went to the entrance but were told we needed to be wearing long pants to enter. No problem, we though we would just nip back to the room and change. On our way back to the bar we bumped into other hotel residents in the lift , bare chested and wearing bathing suits but no shoes , obviously just having had come out of the pool. Why are guests permitted to walk around like that? hey would have had to walk past security before getting into the lift? Finally, we managed to get into Skypark 57 for the long awaited drink. We were given a menu which indicated on the bottom a minimum charge during \"happy hour\". When we asked the waiter about \"happy hour\" he said they don't have it. When we questioned the menu and the reference to \"Happy Hour\", he just seem very \"blurr\".. We ordered two drinks which came quite quickly and we settled down to enjoy the view. After about half an hour we were ready for a second drink. The waiter could not be found anywhere. The service on the outside area was poor and no one seemed to care that there were paying guests outside. Eventually we stopped one of the staff who looked like a manager and arranged another round of drinks. They appeared to be \"on the house\" as they were not added to our final bill. We decided to go out for dinner away from the hotel , by this time we were beginning to feel a bit irritated at the poor service overall. When we went to the taxi stand, there was no line for hotel guests. It was like leaving the shopping mall. Eventually we were shepherded into a waiting black taxi. We only discovered after he pulled out that this was a premium car and we would have to pay more than double the normal taxi fee. The hotel staff never mentioned this when they waved the cab over for us. Yet another unpleasant surprise. At dinner we decided that we would check out of MBS first think in the morning an move to another hotel. We ended up at Ritz Carlton. Better rate, much better service and we left feeling genuinely appreciated. MBS is a must if you want to check out the pool and the view. I recommend you stay at another hotel nearby (Ritz Carlton is excellent) and pay the 20.00 fee to view the public area of MBS.

Turning down service: just if you ask for it...in a luxury hotel... you shouldn't suppose to ask for something ..OBVIOUS! Pool: great pool but the staff..again..horrible. I asked them for a pic and they looked mad at me. Not enough water and when you ask for it they send you to the other side of the pool..and they don't have it either... \"Refresh, hospitability\": the worst ever! they just give you 30 minutes from the time they give you the card ( yes sure, 2 guest taking shower and get ready in less than 30 minutes???) Here, Joy..the worst ever! Didn't know the meaning of \"refresh\" so, I needed to say \" I want to take shower\" Finally she got what it means! Then , I was in tower 1, she sent me to tower 3.. when the room was in tower 1.. to find the room .. I was lucky to find Regina (a great staff) and sent me with another person to the room ...at that time I already used 15~20 minutes. How about that? I had 10 minutes remaining then. The room is shared for all the people who wants to use it, so when you want to take shower..the shower is not clean for you...is like a public shower... When I got to the room there was a family there..needed to wait for one person in the shower and then I went to shower. I made everything in the fastest way but I took more than an hour: getting lost thanks to Joy, waiting for the shower and finally took a shower! Ice: it took 20 minutes to get ice! First because I called concierge who \"asked\" for it, waited 10 minutes, the called \"priority services\" and they didn't have any message from concierge so I asked again for ice. Then, it took another 10 minutes. 20 minutes for ice? why don't they better put an ice machine? In conclusion, you will have a great time just because the hotel is gorgeous. If I would be in any other hotel with that service... no way. You forgive all this just because of the pool. But next time, absolutely I would go to Mandarin Oriental that has a much greater service. Not the same gorgeus building..but they know how to make you feel special and give you great service.

You have a computer and eyes so use both and get your facts straight before you sound off. It clearly states that Atrium rooms are only available UP TO the 22nd floor so to complain that you weren't given a room on a higher floor is your problem. If you want a room on a higher floor then book the appropriate room and be prepared to pay for it. Don't complain because you didn't get what you didn't pay for. I also agree with a previous reviewer who stated the obvious. Its up to you to decide if the location of the hotel suits your needs and not the fault of the hotel if it doesn't. Its also not the fault of the hotel if public transport facilities are not what they could be. Its a hotel, its not responsible for public transport so if you feel the need to complain then do it to the responsible authority. Use some common sense. I stayed 3 nights at the MBS while in Singapore on business and I could not fault it. No problems with check in what so ever and the staff were very polite. I booked, paid for and got a Club room in tower 1. The room was very spacious, clean, well appointed and furnished. The bed was especially comfortable, with a good size TV and a Nespresso machine which is a real plus for me. The bathroom for those who think it matters has everything you would want or need. The Club on the 57th floor served very good breakfasts, the staff were really friendly and the view was truly amazing. I didn't have time to make use of the pool but its certainly one of a kind. My work revolves around service industries so if its one thing I notice its bad service and believe me I'm not shy about complaining when I have had bad service. At no time did I experience or witness bad service by any hotel staff. Hotel staff are there to serve you and happy to do so in high class superior hotels such as the MBS which is exactly what I experienced but I also witnessed rude and at times offensive attitudes of guests. Yes these people are there to serve you but they are also entitled to respect and courtesy so do the right thing.

The pool was FREEZING, we only got in to get a quick picture and get out! The location is not the greatest if you want to walk, you have to get a cab as the MRT train is not completed yet. Good luck getting a cab in the evening or especially on weekends! We waited in the taxi queue for 50 minutes to get a cab!!! This is cause everyone coming to the hotel or casino has to cab.. Frustrating. I could go on and on but in a nut shell we will never go back. The hotel cannot seem to manage the capacity of the hotel and service severely lacks!

Check-in time is at 3 pm and we arrived there slightly after 3 pm. Registration was done but we were informed that room wasn't ready yet and when we asked for an estimated time for the room to be ready, the Front Desk replied \"we are not too sure\". We also requested for a higher floor and were willing to pay the difference but they were kind enough to provide us with a complimentary upgrade. We were promised that they would call us once the room was ready and on that note, we went to do some shopping. 2 hours later, we still did not receive any calls and we decided to call back instead. After being transferred from 1 department to another for about 15 mins, we were finally told by the Bell Desk that our room was ready but not checked into the system yet. We were puzzled at this and decided to just head back to the hotel. When we collected our room keys, I was slightly frustrated that the whole process was so slow so I mentioned it to one of the Managers at the Front Desk. He was kind enough to extend our check-out time to 2 pm. We went up to the room and it was really nice, spacious and the view was spectacular. We wanted to watch a movie but then realised that the in-room movie services were not activated. Called Priority Services (read: Operator) and were advised that it was not available because we did not place enough deposit yet. We then realised that we were not advised of the room rates upon check-in and we were only asked for SGD100 for the incidentals. I was getting increasingly frustrated as half of our afternoon was delayed already and we were expected to head down to the Front Desk to place more deposit for the room charges. I called and asked that someone came up to take my credit card details for the pre-authorisation instead. When the Front Desk agent came up, he verbally confirmed that only SGD270 will be taken as an imprint from my credit card. I requested for a copy of the pre-auth and he promised to send it up ASAP. 3 hours later, we were preparing to go out for dinner at DB Bistro and we called Priority Services once again to ask to be transferred to the restaurant as we wanted to change our reservation timing. We also asked why there wasn't a copy of the pre-auth sent to us and we were then advised that they do not provide a copy for the guest. No follow up was done to inform me of this and it added to my increasing frustration. Dinner at DB Bistro was great, food was wonderful and the ambience was nice. The server (think it was Karan?) who attended to us was attentive and polite and we enjoyed ourselves very much. We then retired for the evening. The next day, we headed to the swimming pool and it was a sight to behold. Although the sun was burning my skin, the water was cool to touch and we really felt relaxed. When we were checking out, the Front Desk agent asked if we would like to charge the charges to my credit card. I asked if the pre-auth taken was SGD270 and the agent said no, they took SGD363 as a pre-auth. It was at this point where I was really appalled and frustrated at the same time. I told the agent that I had to speak to a manager about this because the whole stay was really disappointing. When the manager came, I explained to him that it was confirmed only SGD270 will be taken as pre-auth but instead, more was taken and I WAS NOT INFORMED before they proceeded to obtain more pre-auth. Also, we were charged for the phone call to DB Bistro and again, we were appalled because shouldn't calling the restaurant be considered an internal call? It is a really minor charge that we have absolutely no problems paying for but the least the Operator could have done was to inform us of the charge. The manager seemed apologetic but he could not offer much service recovery. When we left the hotel, I then realised that I wasn't even given a copy of my credit card slip to sign and acknowledge the charges. What is extremely disappointing and disheartening is that for an organisation that brands itself as of world-class standards, we did not experience any of that claim. It is basic courtesy to inform the guest and do follow ups for any issues but sadly, none was done. Throughout our whole stay, we were not informed about the basic details that any other 5-star hotel would have done. The purpose of my writing this extremely long review is not to encourage a bad reputation for MBS; rather, it is for the management to really look into improving their service process and overall, for MBS to truly be worthy of their branding. Perhaps it is just my opinion, but it doesn't reflect well on Singapore's hospitality branding as a whole should foreigners receive similar expreiences as well. If not for the shortfall of service and the lack of service recovery, we would have enjoyed our stay because the view from the room and the room facilities were great.

On my last trip there this hotel was still being build, but looked impressive even then so I decided that I'd try it ont his trip. I booked quite early, so upgraded to a Club Room to ensure that I got a high floor. Upon arriving at Changi airport there is an MBS desk in arrivals that will direct you to the area where the MBS shuttle bus picks you up. This shuttle runs about every 30 mins from 7am to midnight and hourly after that, and picks up from every terminal (even the Budget one!!) The hotel has a Coach Terminal right underneath, and as you get off the shuttle bus it's simply a case of heading up the escalator to the registration desk. As I'd booked a Club Room I was able to use the VIP lounge to check-in which was nice and quiet as it was almost midnight. However I did notice the other 2 registration desks had a bit of queue to check-in. I was assigned a room on the 40th floor, although not one that looked over the city. Saying that the view out over the Singapore Straits is quite pretty at night, with seeminly 1,000's of ships moored up out there. You use your key card to make the elevator work, and tehre are 2 sets of elevators, one serving the lower floors and one serving the higher floors. The Club room was very large, leading out to a balcony (which didn't have any chairs on it, however I suppose they want you to gamble and not sit and admire the view!!) Typical 5 star style of decoration to the room, reminded me a little of the Intercontinental style. Large sofa next to the balcony and work desk ont he other side of the room. Big double bed with a whole stack of pillows and a large flat screen TV with a good choice of TV channels. I had free wi-fi access (not sure if that's available to all types of room, but I'm sure it is) which was very fast. The bathroom was huge, had a big free standing bathrub and twin sinks along with a seaprate shower area and a seaprate toilet. Good range of toiletries. After a great night's sleep it was up to the 57th floor for brekafast (as part of the Club package you get to have breakast on the roof in the Club Lounge, I'm not sure where you have breakfast if you don't book a Club Room) The breakfast is very nice, a good selection of items, but the view will probably grab your attention the most looking over to the city skyline. The infinity pool is in front of you, and then all you can see if the whole of Singapore laid out in front of your eyes. After breakfast I went to grab my swimming trunks and head up for a swim. the pool is nicely divided, 2/3 of it are available to families (and there is a smaller separate kids pool at the one end) but 1/3 of it is restricted to adults only which is a good idea. It's a great place to laze around for a few hours relaxing and reading. I was a bit concerned about a constant stream of tourists wandering past gawping, and making me feel like I was in a zoo. However they're restricted to one end and a viewing platform so you don't really notice them peering. The pool area is strictly guests only. Th whole MBS complex is huge, with an upmarket shopping area that even has it's own mini canal along with gondolas. The casino itself ive also very big, and seemingly busy at all hours of the day. Locals have to pay SGD 100 to get in, but it's free for tourists to enter. The hotel lobby is huge and is also constantly busy with tourists and locals passing through to have a look at what the fuss is all about.

When I put the 'don't disturbe' sign at my room on 3rd day since I didn't want my room to be cleaned for I needed to take a long nap, the cleaner staff slipped a note saying that he was ready to clean my room on 9.30 am but he couldn't because of the sign I put. After taking a long nap, I went to the gym for 1 hour and then relaxing at the Skypark's jacuzzi for 30 minutes. When I went back to my room, there was another note mentioning that the cleaner staff was there (again!) at 4.30 pm wanted to clean my room but he couldn't enter since I still put the 'don't disturbe' sign. I was impressed with his persistent to clean my room. It showed that the hotel staff were very care with the cleannies of their room hotel.

I enjoyed relaxing there very often until my skin was tanned. The view was also amazing at night. I love the Rasapura Food Court located in the shopping mall across MBS. They have many kinds of variety food there with cheap price and taste delicious also! I didn't mind at all about the location since I've visited Sgpore so often so that I've already got bored with Orchard Road, etc. I was there to relax myself, not to go shopping. I could find anthing around MBS area, cheap food court with delicious taste, a minimart & guardian shop, a museum, a theather, 15 minutes walking distance only to Esplanade through the fabulous Helix Bridge. Even when my hubby asked me to join him & his friends going to Universal Studio, I refused his invitation since I prefer to have me time by swimming at the pool, jacuzzi & gym.

The room we had was huge and the hotel did not seem to take the size of the room when furnishing the room. There were large open spaces, which seem out of place. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was large with a separate tub, shower and toilet area. Room service was great and when I ordered a glass of wine they brought an entire chilled bottled for tasting, which was a nice touch. I was though surprised that the room service tray was chipped and scratched in such a new hotel The only aspect of our stay that was not great was the service on several occasions which I am sure will be worked out as they are open longer and were not major. The first service issue was that our room was not cleaned until 4.30 in the afternoon, which I personally think is late. Second issue was the lack of staff in the Sky Park as they were running all about trying to service guests. The third issue was when we asked for a recommendation of a restaurant from concierge, we were told to look through a book. All was rectified when brought to the attention of the hotel or when we spoke to another member of staff. Overall, I would recommend the hotel and would stay again. The only huge issues I had with the hotel is that they do charge a cover for going to the bar in the Skypark at night.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "Title": "\u201cThe design is great, but the rest is awfull\u201d", "Author": "Mily1980", "ReviewID": "UR100712132", "Content": "I went there for 2 seminars one with clients and the other was an agents meeting, so all in all I stayed for a week.

So at that moment when you want to take a shower before dinner the cleaning guy will appear to clean it. And this will happened every day. Regarding the rooms the air condition is so noisy that at night you will not be able to sleep unless you turned it off. In the lobby you have people going through permanently like in a train station 24 hours a day. The swimming pool and the skypark are amazing, but it is open to the public if they pay a ticket and it is one of Singapore's main tourist attraction.

When my wife and I got there with our infant twin girls we were sent to a Deluxe room, a bit of a disappointment and our 3 month old girls were getting very hungry. I phoned down to ask to be switched rooms and was told someone would be up to help momentarily. 15 minutes later I had to phone again as our babies needed to feed and we needed to be in our new room. I was told someone would come up very quickly. 15 minutes later I had to phone again to find out if someone could help, I was not impressed by this time. About 5 minutes later someone finally came and moved us to our new room. Over 35 minutes waiting for someone to come and show us where to go with screaming babies, great customer service. I also asked the person on the phone to have a supervisor phone when we got to our new room (that did not happen, I had to call again after 30 min in our new room, the customer service is just getting better and better). The new room was definitely an Orchid Suite but not what I had seen on the website, not even close. The person on the phone said that she would give us $100 off the room for all of the troubles to this point. At least our twins could begin feeding and someone tried. I phoned once more and asked if I could have a room very similar to the one that I saw on the website. It took 5 minutes to get the person on the phone to actually try to find the room that I was talking about (I thought your job is to please the customer not try to convince them the room I have is adequate, especially for a $869.00 room). I was finally told that they had located a room and that it would be ready in an hour. In an hour I got the keys and went to the next room, frightened that it would not be the proper room again. Guess what? It was a Deluxe room again (if this was an Orchid Suite it was a sad small suite) that stank of smoke and there was a worker in the room that looked incredibly confused as to why we were there, he just slowly walked out of the room in a bout 3 minutes murmuring something to himself. I phoned again and this time spoke with the customer service agent again saying that this was unacceptable. We decided to move back to the second room. All of this took over 3 hours of wasted time. We could have had a 2 hour spa treatment, been to the pool, ordered room service,etc during this eventful trip from Tower to Tower. Good exercise though, didn't need to go to the gym. My time is worth much more than $100 dollars for 3 hours. We tried at that point to enjoy our night as much as possible. I just got the bill through email, as I did the express checkout, and found out that I was not credited with the $100. What a total surprise!!!! The worst hotel experience just got worse!!!!!!!!!!! I have stayed in $5 a night guesthouses in Laos with better customer service than MBS. Oh and the wrong credit card got debited money, TWICE!!!!! I have since cleared this up but again had to waste MY time to deal with a mess that could have gone smoothly if your hotel would have done it's job the way it should have been done.

I arrived at the hotel late afternoon and had no problems checking in but I do understand how some would feel annoyed with having to wait if they arrived before the 3pm check in, especially after a long flight. Its a huge hotel and I suspect the check in time has a lot to do with the logistics of cleaning and making up rooms after departing guests. If that is the case I think the hotel should consider increasing its staff resources during those peak hours to reduce that issue. It would be a small price to pay if the result is to negate what seems to be a common complaint. As for the room, I saw no reason for complaint at all although obviously I didn't stay in every room so I can only judge on my own. Mine was very well appointed comfortable and clean. The city view was stunning at night especially. The bathroom was perfect with a large shower recess and separate bath. The bed was especially comfortable and I slept very well every night. The Club on the 57th floor is amazing and that alone is well worth the cost of booking a Club room in my opinion and the Sky Park was an experience I will never forget. I found the staff very friendly and room service was excellent. As for the location, it may seem a little out of the way for some but I suggest anyone considering a stay at this hotel make sure you're aware of where its located and if it doesn't suit you then find an alternative as there's little point in complaining when the reality is that choice was yours. This is a stunningly beautiful hotel and based on my experience there I had no reason to complain. I am sure there will always be those who are hard to please and some who will make a mountain out of a molehill. I suspect a lot of guest stress has been self inflicted and blown out of proportion.

I don't know why people complain about the location. Its a hotel, not a cruise ship, have the sense to find out where your hotel is located before you book. Its true there isn't an MRT close by but that's not the fault of the hotel. Taxis are very cheap in Singapore and there are a lot of them and it doesn't take long to get anywhere in Singapore, but if you're really that tight with your money then book a hotel elsewhere. One other tip, when you venture out of your hotel for the day don't leave the \"do not disturb\" sign on and then complain because your room wasn't cleaned. We had a Club room in Tower 1 and it was excellent and worth every cent. The room was big, very well appointed and the view was awesome. Before we departed on our holiday we took the time to read the information we needed on the MBS website so we knew it was a 3pm check-in. In our case by the time our flight arrived and we had cleared customs and immigration and caught a taxi we arrived at the hotel about 2.30pm and we were checked in after a slight delay due to a small queue. The wait wasn't long and the reception was very friendly and welcoming. The Club lounge is beautiful and the Sky Park is an experience not to be missed. The facilities at the hotel cater for everyone's needs with a wide variety of places to eat. All in all we were very impressed with the MBS and I urge people to ignore most of the bad reviews as most complaints are self inflicted nonsense.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haywards Heath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "up2eleven", "ReviewID": "UR99508655", "Content": "I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in September 2010 and again in March 2011.

I arrived in the morning and was told that I cannot check in (which includes even just signing the forms) until 3PM. This i find odd as other hotels normally would accommodate doing the paperwork so i can get it out of the way and come back for the key. Anways, i left my luggage and went out. MBS is very far from the nearest MRT station. It's a long walk. So i spent a lot of money taking cabs to and fro from the hotel. In the evening, when i finally arrived to check in, there was already a queue. I noticed waiting time is longer than other hotels i've stayed. When my turn came, i noted that they ask too many friendly questions which to me is not really necessary and is in fact is the reason why check in process is so long. I stayed at tower 3. Rooms are comparable with other 5 star hotels like Conrad or Ritz Carlton. The gym on the 55th floor is nice but small. I noted there are no free weights unless there's separate room for this. The view from the pool is really nice especially in the early morning. But since the pool is not heated and the wind was so strong, i decided not to swim. The breakfast offering is comparable with the other hotels and quite expensive at SGD45 per heat. You can get a table if you eat breakfast before 7. AFter 7, you will need to wait for a table. I decided to just order room service for breakfast instead. although you can opt for a auto-checkout, i decided to do the conventional checkout. when i got to the counter, they told me that i need to pay only for the incidentals as the rooms have been charged already. i asked for a billing of the room as i know our company have special pricing. i also noted that no one told us that MBS offers free shuttle to the airport. We found out only about this when we were inquiring whether there was a shuttle from the hotel to the city. Right across the hotel is a high end mall where the casino, theater and the ice skating rink. There's a food court which is opened 24 hours. MBS has a lot of room of improvement. A colleague of mine had to change rooms 3 times because either the room was already occupied (and he was able to enter the room with the key), or it was not cleaned. The staff did not even apologize for the mistake or even the inconvenience they caused my colleague. Overall, for the same amount, i would rather stay in a hotel which is more central and accessible by MRT.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davao City", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Experience\u201d", "Author": "miraflor_merino", "ReviewID": "UR99469195", "Content": "The Hotels Ambiance is Very Good and the experience is really great.

We have both travelled to Singapore on business numerous times over the last few years but never together. However, in February we had an opportunity to travel together and so decided to go a few days early & enjoy a long weekend in Singapore before I moved onto the Philippines & my husband had to work. We decided to stay in the Marina Bay Sands as we had both witnessed it being built over the last few years & were interested to see what it was like. I can only say it is the most disappointing hotel we have ever stayed in. The lobby is huge but unlike Vegas hotels has no buzz or atmosphere, It is like a large unwelcoming airport. When we arrived, the cab had to drop us on the road as it was not allowed to drive up to the door due to the arrival of a \u201cVIP\u201d. So we had to drag our bags up the drive. This is no way to treat a paying guest. In any hotel all guests should be treated as VIPs, especially in a hotel charging so much. The rooms were basic, nowhere near as good as other similarly priced (or in fact cheaper) hotels in Singapore. I would by far recommend the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. The service was appalling. On the Saturday of our trip my husband & I spent the whole day walking around town. It was hot & humid so when we returned at 4:30 we just wanted to shower & have a relaxing snooze for a few hours before venturing out again in the evening, however, our room had not been cleaned. I called housekeeping & complained. I asked for fresh towels, which were delivered, but told them that I didn\u2019t want to have the room cleaned at that point as we wanted privacy for a few hours. 30 mins later a note was pushed under the door. I fully expected it to be an apology, but tt was a note from the housekeeping to say they had come to clean the room but as the do not disturb sign was on they could not come in. So effectively they were blaming us for their poor service. The room was also cleaned very late on the Sunday. Singapore is an expensive city, especially for alcohol, however the prices at MBS here were high even by Singapore 5 star hotel standards & the service in the bars was poor. So they charged extortionate prices, plus service, plus tax and then had the cheek to leave a space on the bill for a tip. The pool area is quite an amazing sight & the views are spectacular, however, none of the loungers are shaded from the sun & there is very little shelter on the roof when it rains. Also, there are comfortable sun loungers at one end of the pool, but this is the end near the public viewing area so there are hundreds of tourists taking pictures & gawping at the residents in the pool. The other end is more private but has quite uncomfortable sun loungers. So even this aspect of the hotel was disappointing. The most annoying issue was that my company had negotiated a special rate with MBS which included breakfast. However, I was charged a much higher rate excluding breakfast with no real explanation except that MBS insisted that this was the rate agreed on booking. This could be the fault of the travel agent, but I would have thought that once I could prove who I worked for the MBS manager would have adjusted the rate accordingly, but I was not even offered the chance to prove who my employer was, there was no discussion. So all in all, this was one of the most disappointing hotels I have ever stayed in & my husband felt the same. As I mentioned we travel regularly & stay in many hotels both for business & pleasure. If this has been billed as a three star with three star prices, then I would have been a little disappointed, but OK with it. To charge this much & call it 5 star is a joke.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNot to be missed if you are staying in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "adoboadobo", "ReviewID": "UR99368323", "Content": "Beautiful hotel facilities, lots of things to do and see, helpful staff", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and facilities\u201d", "Author": "Liltintz", "ReviewID": "UR99347304", "Content": "Booked a room in order to celebrate a friend's birthday.

The only thing I would recommend is to have are power plugs in the bathroom!! What is a girl to do, when she wants to do her hair in the bathroom and not the study table??lol. Anyways, another recommendation is the Banyan Tree Gym. Love going for a run on the treadmill in the morning and watching the city wake up. Fantastic view, as well as the facilities in there. So relaxing to just go into the steam room then dip in the hot pool. Banyan Tree products in the shower rooms were to die for; too bad they didn't sell them.

A friend of mine reccomended MBS to me, saying it's a brand new hotel, with great pool and fitness facilities. Few days before I arrived to the hotel, I contacted the Corporate Reservations to confirm my booking and inform about my early arrival (10 am). I arrived to the hotel at 11 am, after >20hrs journey. I would have expected that there will be a room ready for me, since I had sent the appropriate note to the hotel. Apparently, there was none. I was asked to wait another 4 hours for regular check-in, which starts at 3 pm. After short argument with the fron desk assistant we ended up with 1pm, until then I was allowed to stay at the pool area. I came back to the front desk at 1 pm to start my check-in. It took about 10 mins to locate my reservation in the system. When it was finally found, i was told that my stay should start on 20th (!!!) and I was asked to present a confirmation of my booking. Completely by chance, I had a printed out confirmation with me - usually I do not carry print outs, trusting that 5-star hotels have relevant systems in place. Obviously, the confirmation stated that my check-in is on 16th. At this point, it was 25 mins since I started the check-in process - still not in the room :). The next step is that there was no tower room with King's bed, so I was offered a larger Atrium room withi Kng's bed. Despite what the assistant said, it was not an upgrade - if you look at the hotel price list you'll see that larger atrium rooms are of the same price as smaller tower rooms. Finally, after 45 mins the check-in ended and I was able to take a shower in my room. The nect day I sent a complaint to to the hotel about entire check-in and with a request to change the room - atrium room appeared to be too noisy. Crowd in the lobby could be easily heard through the door. My complaint and request had not been answered for 4 days, despite my every day reminders, until I approached the front desk personally (I didn't make it earlier because of the queue that's always there). Day after that I got an apologize from hotel's quality and process manager, along with complimentary upgrade to the club room. This shows the main problem the hotel has - lack of consistent, 5-star service. There is a lot of extremely good staff, such as concierge, room keeping, room servive, but also a lot of flaws that you wouldn't expect in 5-star place, to list few of them: - amazing pool, but on sunday they were out of towels - at noon! - great fitness center, but max temp. in sauna - 70C, hardly ever reached (usually aorund 60, which is too less for real sauna) - a lot of assistants at taxi bay, but permanent chaos and jam anyway - etc. In the end, few words about the club room - it was fantastic. Spacious room with lots of ammenities (amazing bath tub, nespresso machine to list the key ones for me), outstanding snacks and coctails in Club restaurant at Sky Park. Despite all of the flaws, I do recomend to stay at the MBS, unless you're more picky than I. If you don't have any extraordinary requests, you'll enjoy your stay there for sure. I'm sure the teething issues will be resolved and at that time MBS will be a true gem. I'm going to give them another try during my next stay in SG. Hopefully, I will be able to give 5-stars in all 6 categories then. If you decide to stay there, just try to avoid going to Ku De Ta - it's not owned by the hotel and they serve the worst drinks I have ever had, for the most unreasonable price. Visit there may spoil the best evening.

When I checked in around 4:30pm, I was told there no rooms with king bed requested on my booking was available at my rate until another 1-2 hours later. If I need a room straight away then I can pay a SGPD30 upgrade fee. I accepted a room on a lower floor (3/F) as I was told that this is the only room that is available immediately. I was pointed to the wrong lift and had to walk back to reception to check the correct lift for the 3/F. I arrived at my 3/F room and expected it to be a king size bed however I went into the room: 1. There was an off smell 2. It was facing directly to the construction site 3. It was a twin bed room I then called the service line and the representative kindly arranged another room for me at the 16/F with no extra charge with a good view. Don't know whey sudden they have a room ready on a higher floor within 30 mins but when I checked in there wasn't. I waited for 20 mins plus for the bell boy to come after one follow-up call and took me to the newly assigned room. I needed to iron some shirts for a meeting that evening and could not open the iron board so called the service line around 5pm and was told that they will send help from house keeping but no one ever came nor was any message delivered to me that they could not make it. Finally, at check out, there were two charged on my invoice which I did not agree to: 1. Resort fee - I was told that this for the water, local calls and WIFI in my room. However, when I checked in I asked if the WIFI is free and if the complimentary bottle water placed out side of the fridge is free and the receptionist confirmed that it is complimentary. 2. Breakfast - I was informed the receptionist after I checked in that my room includes breakfast and showed me where I should go for breakfast. I had breakfast twice and both times when i signed the receipt I told the waitress that my room includes breakfast and they assured me that this is for records only. Hence I did not except to see this charge on my invoice. The only good time about this hotel is that they served rose champagne for free at check in and there are always plenty of taxis available.

Not a lot is my answer. Stayed here towards the end of Chinese New Year, and truthfully it's a factory hotel, with a big casino attached. So where do we start. Checking was fine, once you find the right side of the hotel to go to if you have a car and want valet parking - head for Tower 1. Reception girls where good, all the right questions, but missed all the key replies. Stayed in many hotels over major events - birthdays etc. Was staying in this hotel for my 20th wedding anniversary - actually told them that and...... nothing. So not really a five star hotel, have had birthday cakes for delivered kids birthday's in lower star hotels. Room, can't really fault the cleanliness. Had a room on the 50th floor - great view. Suitable for 4 people, but some sort of screen separation between the sofa area and the bed area would be a good touch. Breakfast - the only thing I can say about that is chaos. 38$/person for the privilege of cuing for 15 minutes. Staff are run of their feet, so getting refills on coffee can take time. There are two restaurants in the lobby level serving breakfast for 500 rooms so enough said. Actually for a good mix off food close to the hotel I would suggest walking across to the food court in the Casino complex - very good food at reasonable prices. The pool - guests have to pay for the privilege of using the swimming pool - you pay a \"resort fee\" of 32$ per room. That's a first for me, having to pay to use the hotel pool. It is spectacular, but lacks sun shade in the afternoon, so if you want to get roasted and toasted that's fine. You also have to deal with tourists visiting the sky park at 20$ per head..... so not exactly a private pool that you're paying to use.

At times I felt like being in a fishbowl with sightseers gawking at hotel guests using the swimming pool. I appreciate it is a landmark that many who are not guests would like to visit and I don't object to that as long as the guests are recognised as the priority and not inconvenienced by non guests. The Club room on the 57th floor was brilliant and the service faultless. My room overlooked the city and the view was breathtaking especially at night. No doubt those who have been harsh in their critique have had some basis for that opinion, but I've little doubt many have complained much more than they should ... some people are never pleased. I suggest people considering a stay at the MBS find out for themselves as I did. Its also pleasing to see the management of the MBS has responded to recent comments so they are obviously aware of the complaints.

It is a truly spectacular building with a wonderful view across to Singapore. The exterior design is stunning, something highlighted by the view from the infinity pool (more on that later). However it is a hotel lacking the touches of a Five Star establishment. Firstly, through an unusually non - Singaporean touch, access from the airport is via a long circuitous route. This is obviously not the hotel's fault, however it does add substantially to the time taken to get to & from other places in the city, especially during peak times, something to keep in mind if you are there on business. Also keep in mind that the location means no cheap local places to buy snacks, drink or food - they are all a taxi ride away. Arrival & check in was a sign of things to come. The entry section is far to small to accommodate the volume of cars dropping off & picking up, resulting in constant traffic jams. No doorman is there to help with bags upon exiting the taxi, and I had to find a staff member to figure out where to check in. Upon checking in, I asked for a quite late check out, fully expecting to pay a large amount for this. The staff, while pleasant, seemed unable to fathom how to do this. They kept quoting various figures, and was unable to understand that the maximum I would be prepared to pay was the equivalent of another night's accommodation, yet at the same corporate rate of the night before. Eventually he settled on half the rate, and I was directed to the 3rd tower (furtherest from the check in, no offer to help with bags still). The walk across was quite long, and in keeping with the experience, was filled with people, mostly tourists looking around. The room itself is lovely - very modern and spacious. Bed is comfortable, TV is huge. There are few crazy parts though - Shower pressure is poor, Window shades are automatic... but the controls are next to the window, not the bed (is it really that hard to pull them open or closed if you are already up?), there is a balcony on some rooms... but no chairs or table to sit outside, and the air conditioning refused to get below 22 degrees at any stage. None of these are deal breakers, but are surprising. The rooftop pool is a treat - the view is spectacular, water is kept wonderfully cool, and staff are on hand to help with towels, etc. Be warned though that the same space is used by tourists who pay to see the view, and thus you have an endless crowd of people walking back and forth behind you (more crowds). If you want to use the space at night when the bar opens, there is often a cover charge and dress code - though don't let this dissuade you. The view is worth it. Breakfast is another example of crowds - a massively packed buffet with some standouts (omlettes) and many failures (most hot food was cold). At S$45, not worth it. The final touch for me was checkout. Apparently they made a complete error in charging for the late checkout, and had not charged me for the first night. I pointed out that I owed more money, and this caused great confusion. To make matters worse, they then made up a number of increasingly weird excuses \"it has been charged to your central account\" (we don't have one), \"the computer has made an error\", \"it will get fixed automatically\", etc. Instead of thanking me for the oversight that meant I would pay MORE, this continued for some time. Eventually it was fixed, and despite the staff being pleasant, they were simply incompetent. Yes, this is a large property, and many of the issues are a result of the size. However I've stayed at numerous large hotels overseas (eg Vegas) with none of these issues. the attention to detail is lacking, and you simply feel like another room filler.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cOne Night is enough\u201d", "Author": "drleo66", "ReviewID": "UR96446746", "Content": "All singapore is very expensive , actually not value for money.

The service was horrid which is the main reason which drove me to write this review. Skip if you don\u2019t have the time!

I watched her clear table and tend to other patrons \u2013 after 20 minutes, it was obvious that she had forgotten. So I asked a second waitress for honey who gave me white sugar instead. Even though English is the primary language spoken in Singapore, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and reiterated it was honey I wanted, in both English and Mandarin. She told me to get it myself from the buffet tables. I explained that I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere which is why I was asking her. I surrendered and agreed to get it myself but she must point me to the right place - i.e. which table \u2013 be it next to the breads, the salads, and so on. She actually shrugged and walked away! Attractions The casino is clean and not bad. I liked the fancy technology like touch-screen roulette and pokie machines. The Skypark is ofcourse the main attraction of the hotel. Hotel residents can use the entire area for free. A good number of sunchairs and towels provided. The pool is further separated into an everybody section and an adults only section. The pool itself is quite good \u2013 an infinity pool, with amazing panoramic views of the quay containing the merlion. Great for taking photos. As I understand it, non-residents can also visit the skypark for fee but cannot use the pool (as I understand). Imagine herds of tourists and be prepared to have a dozen of camera snapping at you.

I was hesitant at first to stay at the hotel because of the negative reviews but surprisingly, the hotel is worth your money and worth a visit. The food of the hotel and likewise the surrounding food outlets, celebrity chef restaurants all live up to their name, had lunch at Hide Yamamoto and dinner at Cut by Wolfgang Puck and both restaurants were superb. When we checked in, my reservation could not be retrieved but the front desk guy, whose name sounds like Yao Ming, was more than helpful in accommodating me, the porters, room service people, etc were all very helpful. Though there is a shopping mall at the adjacent Marina Bay Sands shopping center, it is also quite near to the Marina Bay shopping areas all the way to Suntec and Raffles city, how I wish there was a covered walkway from Marina Bay Sands, all the way to Mandarin Oriental, that way, all the malls would be be inter-connected and you need not go out to the street to enter the malls, especially when it is raining. A suggestion though to the management of the hotel, they have this very annoying habit of calling you back to ask the about the service of the hotel, assuming you were to ask for a newspaper, drinking water, etc... They usually call 5 to 10 mins after your request, asking how long the request that you asked for arrived, and what are your view etc..

Happy hour was a little early at between 5 and 7 pm. Service at the hotel was OK. Staff in the lounge were fantastic and very attentive.

Thats the reason why we decided to recommend my cousin to stay at the same hotel during their visit. But the experience they had during their stay made us think twice if we will be staying there next time. Everything is as per normal when they arrive. They carry our thier own bags to the counter to check in, greeted by a staff over the counter which won't even give you a slightest smile ( Well... Maybe due to the fact that they are too tired to do so... As we know they got 1000 over rooms to sell so they can't smile to 1000 over guests... ) Actually even that doesn't bother them that much. But we are shocked to hear, that one of the hotel staff, which is a bellman in particular, actually thought that my cousin is a cocotte!!! The incident happen when she was on her way out to meet me at a pub KPO located somewhere around orchard road ( Killeney Road ). As usual the bellman will ask the destination while assisting the guest. Upon hearing that my cousin is going to orchard road, he bluntly ask with a smile on his face if she's going to ORCHARD TOWERS!!! ( Which is considered a pick up joint in Singapore!!! ) Not knowing what ochard towers is, she happily says no and repeat herself again that she's going to Orchard Road. Ironicly after asking her of her destinaton, he did not even inform the cab driver of where the destination will be. Maybe its the MBS policy to know their where their guest is heading to and thats it... I only came to know of this situation when we are having a conversation over lunch the next day. I called the hotel to talk to the manager on duty to complain about this matter but too bad my call was not being entertain. The manager is too busy to answer the call and the chief concierge is no where to be found. The best person they can find to talk to me is their bell captain.

On a positive note, it's true the swimming pool and view are fantastic. The pool appears to be open 24 hours a day so when your awake at 4am with jet lag, pop up there, you'll have the pool to yourself. The breakfast is excellent & room service was good (and quick).", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesbrough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cYou just have to experience the pool.\u201d", "Author": "DerekTrotter59", "ReviewID": "UR93322390", "Content": "I had visited Singapore previously and so my only intention was to chill out and not do anything touristy. I had seen the Hotel on the Gran Prix and thought I must check that swimming pool out. It is nothing short of amazing from the chill out perspective and the architectural design. I did exactly what I set out to do and enjoyed it thoroughly. The shopping arcade was still under construction but did not look far from being complete and did not spoil my experience in any way. I would recommend the club deals where you get put on selected floors with easy access to the sky park, the best part about this is you get given windows of opportunity to get free drinks and snacks during the day and you can definitely make it worth your while. You also get early check in and late check out as well as airport transfers. You could not want for anything else. In short i would build two days into a holiday to use this hotel and facilities to get over jet lag then move to another hotel to do the touristy things.

Our room on 44th floor of tower 2 was larger than expected with magnificent views over the river and city. The room was cleverly appointed and had everything the 3 of us required, including a large bathroom with a free standing bath.

Took the free coach from airport to hotel. At first I was not sure if I was eligible as it I thought you had to book on the Marina Bay site to get this. But regardless if you have booked online with other sites you\u2019re entitled to it so we took it why not it\u2019s free. Got to the hotel and it was massive had no idea where to check in. Ask a few people and finally got to the MAIN check in area. One thing i must say is they could put a sign that says main check in that would save lots of confusion. I can understand that wait if there was a line up or tour group that was in front of you. But mine check in in painless, got the usual swipe credit card and show passports and given the key to tower 3 on the 50th floor. I did not require a porter to take luggage as my wife and I had one each and just wheeled it up ourselves. Presentation of room was great, bigger than what I have stayed in Australian hotels. View was nice towards the sea but construction was still happening below, maybe the city side with night light may have been better? The store was great in the complex and the food court had a range of food for everyone and decent prices if you didn\u2019t want to pay for to go to celebrity chefs restaurants. The infinity pool was great, had a swim mid afternoon and enjoyed the view then waited till night, and watched it as well, then jumped in the Jacuzzi which was heated that was nice, the main pool was a bit cold at first. But I got use to it my wife didn\u2019t though. The mini bar has sensors as soon as you remove and item in 30sec it gets charged to your room account, so none of this drink now and pop to the store to buy a replacement. They did offer free water on each side of the bedside table, I was too afraid wondering what charge it would be. Eventually we gave in but it was complementary and they replace every time they clean the room. 2nd day we caught a taxi to orchard road cost us $10 SGD cheap as chips and spend a afternoon walking around, amount of people was amazing and crowded since the last time I had been to Singapore. Finally checked out and extended it to 12pm normally 10am, and we checked the time for the coach bus service to take us to airport which is also free. Which I thought was great. Bad points Upon check in they take your credit card details imprint so if you use the mini bar etc they charge you. In the end I didn\u2019t use anything upon check out. The hotel staff failed to sort of mention how much they take as security $200 SGD. I was under the impression that no money is debited unless you have outstanding charges. I got debited $200 morning on the checkout, questioned it and was assured it was a deposit and would be refunded. I actually came back to Australia and sent them another email, reply yes it\u2019s been forwarded to out reservations team but still nothing, then i see my account get credited in the morning then debited again, so I rang them and told them to fix it. Still nothing so I sent another email with my original email trail. Finally it has been credited but will no transaction record I see the money but that\u2019s it.

We arrived on Christmas Day, with a hotel transit bus from the Airport to the Hotel. Service, they try hard to provide good service, but I think there is just too many customers and not enough staff. In laws had to move rooms as they had put us and them in separate towers, plus in laws room had wrong beds so eventually we were all placed in the same tower (made things easier) . The 'topless hippo' tour bus has two stops out the front of Marina Bay Sands so this was handy for travelling to and from the places we wanted to explore. Spectacular views from the sun deck and infinity pool is just phenomenal! Lots of seats up top the only slight criticism I have is that there are so many people up there looking around it is probably a little uncomfortable for people just wanting privacy or who are self conscious. Spas are up there as well, on the opposite side, facing the view. It was really nice sitting there watching the sun set from the spa. Reasonable shopping was available at the Marina Bay Shoppes, but it is all high end as you would expect. We had great great service from a gentleman in Chanel cosmetics store. He stood out as the best assistant in the entirety of Singapore. Naturally we did a little spending there as a result ;) The foodcourt at Marina Bay Shoppes is mostly cash only! We got caught out as we had just arrived, were hungry! it was 1am in the morning and although shops were open, we could not buy anything as we had not changed any money yet :S Back to regular shopping, Vercace and Prada had not opened whilst I was there and I was a little dissapointed that there was no 'sales' being Boxing day. I was thinking about all the bargains my friends were getting back home! Mind you, Miss Teen bought a delightful YSL clutch for half price so perhaps I just wasn't seeing the sale items?! We didnt use the mini bar or room service, preferring to buy our snacks and drinks elsewhere and bring them back. There is no supermarket close by so snacks etc need to be collected when you are somewhere a little more budget friendly. Hubby and I had a King size bed. The bed is good, sheets are nice and soft but the pillows are crap! We found the pillows to be too squishy (We use firm memory foam pillows) after this we decided that without fail, we will pack our pillows on our next holiday! Ferarri Tours operate at one of the entry driveways to Marina Bay Sands. Basically you hire the Ferarri for 30 mins. You can drive it to the F1 track and floor it! It is a single person hire so one of the staff of the Ferarri company drives with you (hence I was not able to go with). Hubby took this tour and I think this was the highlight of the trip for him. If you dont feel confident driving the Ferarri I think they offer to drive you. But if you have a license... they let you drive!! 15 min walk to Suntec City was not too far from the hotel and was fun to explore and shop at. I bought some jewellery and a bag. Not so much to do with the hotel, but worthy of mention; Hotel Transfers with SH Tours I was really dissapointed. We booked these to go to Jurong Bird Park and to the Night Safari on different days. The main problem is that the departure time is more an 'estimate' than an actual departure time so in both cases we left a good hour later than expected. This meant that we missed the Birds of Prey show at Jurong Bird park (the first show and unfortunately the only one my hubby most wanted to see). For the Night Safari, it meant that when we got there, there was already massive crowds. Our bus was leaving at 10pm so most of our time was spent in the line to take the safari bus tour through the park. After the tour we RAN through the park to see the animals we most wanted to see (fishing cat and leopard) and then RAN back to the enterance so we didnt miss the bus. Night Safari is open until Midnight and it is my opinion that you do need all that time to explore the park.

Our toilet smelt like cigarettes and I had check if in fact we were on a non-smoking floor as requested (we were apparently). For a new hotel, it looked pretty run down already. The first day we had to call housekeeping three times to make up our room. The next day we were locked out for 30mins because the electronic door lock ran out of battery.

Let me start with the positive: the pool is very nice and an experience not to be missed, The hotel is not luxurious - it has a cheap feel about it and the public areas are busy and somewhat chaotic in appearance. Check-in was OK, check-out was slow (more than 25 minute wait) and it seemed that almost all guests had problems with their bills, Check your bill carefully for mistakes, ours had one. The hotel still has teething problems: the TV in our room suddenly stopped working and when I called to get it fixed they told me to just switch off the electricity, wait two minutes and try again! At the time of our visit (5-7 January) the gym was not ready yet and the two temporary gym rooms were pathetic. The bed is comfortable enough, the bathroom is OK but we were disappointed that there was no bath tub. Service at the pool was absent - we had to find someone to order a drink. Very expensive anyway. Also we didn't like it that there are hordes of tourists (non hotel guests) looking at you when you are swimming in the pool. We had dinner at the Sky on 57 restaurant which was a bit disappointing. They ran out of the wine we chose and they gave us another one without discussing it first (and charged for this more expensive wine) which is not something you'd expect in a quality restaurant. The dessert menu was pathetic with only 3 items to choose from. On the last morning we found a food court in the basement of the shopping mall opposite the hotel which was good and relatively cheap. I'd avoid the hotel for meals and go to the food court instead. To summarize, if you want luxury stay somewhere else. If you would like to try the pool, book one night at Marina Bay Sands only, arrive at 3pm and swim, have another swim in the morning before checking out, and proceed to one of the many much better hotels in Singapore.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWasn't that Impressed ...

I stayed at the Wynn in Macau and it was much nicer than this. Even the Wynn and Encore in Vegas is nicer than this as well. The location of this hotel is also pretty far from the main hot spots within Singapore. We had to take a taxi each time we wanted to go out which added up.

Arrived at the hotel via the Tower 3 entrance, which is the secondary, quieter entrance to the main one at Tower 1. It was however, still rather busy and messy, due to the small size of the drop off point and its awkward design, which does not facilitate efficient entry and exit of vehicles. The lobby area of the hotel was packed with people, and I had to wait at least 30 minutes to check in. Despite the crowd, the hotel only had 3 staff members manning the check-in area at Tower 3. I noticed some people, presumably impatient with the wait, resorting to sitting on the floor, giving the place a feel somewhat like that of a public bus or train station. Upon finally getting to the counter, the check -n process itself was fuss free, with the hotel honoring an early check in request (1 pm, instead of the usual 3pm), as well as a request for a room with a city view. The check in staff was polite but spoke very softly (I could barely hear him), and seemed very new to the job and/or the service industry in general. As per the booking, I was assigned to a club room, located on the 45th floor. Upon entering the room, I was suitably impressed. The room was expansive and well appointed and furnished, with an excellent view of the city. The bathroom was also big and tastefully designed, with his and hers wash basins,large, separate bathtub and shower stall. The room also had a sitting area consisting of a full sized 3 seater couch and a large coffee table situated near the floor to ceiling windows, providing a good place to relax and take in the city views. However, upon opening the mini-bar, I was surprised to find it stocked with personal food items left behind by the previous occupants of the room (half eaten packs of cheese, yogurt, etc), instead of the usual stipulated items. A phone call to \"Priority Services\" promised to resolve the problem, though I had to wait for about an hour before housekeeping arrived to clear and restock the minibar. Even then, I was informed that two of the items were out of stock, and I had to seek their assurance that i will not be charged for these items (the minibar was a automatic one, with an item considered consumed and billed when removed from its slot for more than 30 seconds). This episode somewhat tarnished an otherwise good impression of the room thus far. A visit to the Skypark on level 57 was next on the agenda. As expected, the views here were even more impressive than from the room. But as noted in several previous reviews, the area was very crowded. Thronging with people, the area did not offer any feeling of exclusivity or privacy whatsoever. Furthermore, the public area of the Skypark extended to area right behind the deckchairs of the pool, separated only by a low (2 feet high) barrier. As such, there was quite a lack of privacy for hotel guest using the pool. While there were hotel staff controlling access between the hotel-guests-only and public areas of the Skypark, the very high foot traffic of the area was not particularly appealing. That being said, the design of the Skypark, and in particular the infinity edged pool, was quite a marvel in engineering (though the hotel may want to look into providing heating for the pool, for the water was absolutely frigid!). We proceeded the the club lounge for afternoon tea. A fairly decent buffet spread of food and drinks was available, including champagne. However, other than the sit down dining area, there wasn't a separate lounge area for guest relax in, unlike club lounges in most other hotels. Access for club room and suites guest only lasted until 8pm daily, before the club lounge was open to all, including the public, for a chocolate buffet (chargeable, of course). The checkout process was similar to the check-in experience, which meant a fair amount of time waiting in queue. Overall, the stay at MBS was a fairly decent experience, with the main draw being the impressive building, the views accorded from a high level city facing room, and the novelty of the Skypark and swimming pool. One the downside, the sheer number of guest rooms (2500) and massive crowds make it difficult for the hotel staff the cope (long waiting times in particular), and it seems many staff are still lacking in experience. If one is after a genuine luxury hotel experience, there are numerous other options to consider ahead of MBS.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cUnsatisfactory Service and misrepresentation of quality\u201d", "Author": "dom_andrew", "ReviewID": "UR92368951", "Content": "Very poor, I will never recommend MBS to anyone.

There is chaos in the Front Office operations, from the moment I step foot on MBS property, I had to stop in the middle of the driveway and drag my luggage across the driveway with no assistance from anyone. I had to stopped a staff to get assistance to check in on the Club floor. She led me to the VIP check, but the staff behind the desk was too busy to attend to me. Eventually, one of them decide that I was actually a guest checking in and assisted me. I told the staff I was booked on the Lux Package, on the club floor. After she checked me in and handed me an envelope with no explanation and no one assisted me with my luggage to the room. (this is crappy service, poor and unsatisfactory service) The rooms was nice, but the view was a disaster. It felt like a construction site, looking out the window. The sound proofing for the rooms was poor, you could hear people and noise from the corridor, and likewise walking in the corridor you could heard noise from the room. (this is unsatisfactory quality and misrepresentation) The club lounge had full glass windows and set with dining tables and chair, this was not comfortable at all. There was a continuous flow of people looking at you from outside, this is far from the privacy and intimacy that one would expect as a Club Floor guest.

Plenty of time to really get to know the place. I have also worked in 2 hotels in NYC, so I understand hotel back of house operations. (one of the hotels was 4 stars) Here are the things MBS gets right: -Extremely comfortable bed- My baby got sick while we were there and after holding him for literally 7 hours a day, my back was done. Each morning it felt great because of the mattress however. Wish I could bring it home. -Room size- We had a basic room and it was very spacious, even with a crib. I'm told if you book a lower level floor the rooms are wider, as the hotel gets more narrow the further up you go. -Food- By far, the best thing about this hotel for me was the restaurants, and Rasapura, the street food market in the mall attached to the hotel. Mozza and Db Bistro were outstanding. Great service, impeccable food. Definitely make a reservation unless you plan on eating at 5pm! Rasapura food market was often my stop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It was dirt cheap, only mildly more expensive that the hawker centers around town, with options of food from all around Asia. Every type of cuisine has its own stall with a big sign. The chicken rice was the best I had on the island. They put this delicious vinegar sauce on the chicken. And the egg custard bao (bun) at the dim sum stand was a great sweet treat to wash down with a cup of teh milk (hot tea with sweet milk). I didn't love the nasi lemak (coconut rice with fried chicken) or the japanese ramen stall. The ramen was bland. It gets packed down there, so we shared a table a lot. We got to meet lots of other travelers that way though. Food is served fast, but sometimes you need patience for a table. The Sweet Spot bakery was perfect for morning lattes and muffins. I'm super picky about food/dessert, and this place gets it right! Amazing staff too. So nice! -The Shoppes- Since I was traveling with my baby, we spent a lot of time on our own. Having the mall attached to the hotel was great when we were jet-lagged the first couple of nights, and for early morning walks when he was ready to get up, but daddy needed to sleep longer. Its extremely expensive shopping (Gucci, Prada, etc...), but window shopping was fine with us. December and January is the rainy season, so it was a good option for those wet afternoons too. -The pool and Sky Park- Absolutely breath-taking. Could have spent hours up here. Read below for cons...didn't try any of the restaurants so I can't comment. I didn't find it too crowded. I know someone else in their review said there were 150+ people. In a hotel that has 2500 rooms, that's not so bad. Especially at the holidays. I also had someone check for my room key every time I went up, or walked through to the public part, so I felt like it was truly for hotel guests only. -Staff- I found all the staff in every department to be friendly, courteous, and prompt with responses to my questions or needs. Room service was efficient, though I only ordered once. Things MBS needs to work on: First of all, many reviewers were here during the holidays. Its a crazy time for any hotel, no matter what price point, and you've chosen to stay at a hotel with 2500 rooms. You can pretty much be assured you're going to have to wait for some things. That being said: Housekeeping- This was my biggest issue. They were not on top of checking when the room was ready to be cleaned. I'd go out for 2 hours, and it would still be dirty on my return. In all my travels around the world I've never had that happen the majority of my stay. I also had someone knock on my door TWICE when I had the Do Not Disturb on. This is unforgivable!! I also noticed the lobby is not as clean as it could be. Dust bunnies by the elevators, and the carpets by the elevators were not vacuumed every day. I spent many mornings down there with the baby and it was covered in carpet fuzz, a little bit of food, etc...one day I even saw a trail of ants Doorman/ cab assistant- This is still confusing to me. I never really saw a doorman. About half the time a person from the hotel would open the door for me. I thought maybe in Singapore they don't have a Doorman position. That it was a Western thing. I'm still not sure. Also, with getting cabs, sometimes there was someone there, sometimes there wasn't. And every time I got out of a cab, there was almost never anyone to help me. I had the cab drivers help me with the stroller usually. Again, I thought maybe it was only Western thing. If they have doorman, perhaps a different uniform would help? The pool- I have only a slight problem with the pool. It was cold!! The water was so cold the baby wouldn't get in. He actually cried when I put his feet in. And I hate cold water. Its absolutely beautiful though. Worth it to walk around up there. Luggage- We chose to bring up our own luggage, so I can't comment. I noticed whenever I got in the cab line though, that is seemed to be quite a mess downstairs. Luggage everywhere, no real order, confusing. I chalked this up to it being New Year's and Christmas. Overall, since its a new hotel, my hope is that they'll work out the kinks over the next 6 months. They've barely had time to hit their stride.

This is a HUGE vegas style hotel. And despite it being relatively new, the signages on the lifts are starting to peel off. Some of the lifts are even starting to creak!! PARKING The only place you can park is the Convention Center. And getting across to the hotel is a long long walk. So, as a guest, you are better off valet parking for S$12 or be a sucker like me who parked for a couple of hours, took a long walk (plus got lost) for S$10.00 ROOMS The rooms are OK. Huge and impersonal. We had Room 1026 and 1126 at Tower 3, facing a huge construction site. The bathrooms are huge but poorly designed. There is only one hook to hang your clothes. And there is no rack for you to put your shampoo and soap. Yes, it is all the way at the back instead of being in front of the shower. That is interesting is that you can pull open the glass of your shower cubicle to have a fulL view of the Helix bridge. SERVICE. WHAT SERVICE? More importantly, service personnel working in this facitlity, be it the hotel or convention center is sorely lacking in general knowledge of the directions, nor do they carry with them an easy reference booklet to help you. Whenever you ask for directions, they have you a helpless look or refuse to beyond the call of service. Case in point: Lack of knowledge I took a long walk from the Convention Center to Tower 1's main lobby and had to walk across to Tower 3. Along the way, I stopped to asked service personnel from the Convention Center from directions. No one was able to direct me. On my way back, I stopped by the Theatre at the Convention Center to ask where the carpark was, but was directed to the concierge (who is very far away) while the carpark was in fact nearby. Not thinking beyond At 9:15am, I was using the hotel's pool and I wanted to access the public skypark. I was in the wrong direction. I asked the hotel attendent where the public access was. I was pointed to the other end of the pool. No mention of the opening hours of the skypark. I walked all the way to the other end of the pool, only to be told that the public area is not opened till 10am. SAVING GRACE The only saving grace of this hotel is visiting the world's tallest and longest swimming pool on the 57th floor. The view is awesome......with the infinity pool against the skyline. It is VERY windy to be swimming on the 57th floor and easy to get cold. It gets very crowded in the weekends....so go early. There are also a few jacuzzi's against the skyline. It is not enough. The hotel should convert all the ponds (which looks like the jacuzzis, anyway) into jacuzzis. It is a once-in-a-life experience to visit the pool. All other hardware is not dissimilar. It is like a mall. if you have seen one, you have seen all. What differentiates is the experience. But would I stay here? For a very good price, maybe. The hotel may be an engineering marvel, certainly not a design marvel. And if service is a big thing for you, for the price you pay, stay with a Four Seasons.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cgreat rooms, lousy service = mixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "ThWilmesi", "ReviewID": "UR91296753", "Content": "I stayed over new years eve at MBS.

After all I read about it, I decided to cap off our 10 day tour of Malaysia with an overnight stay in a $600 a night room on our way back to Sydney. The hints of a badly run hotel started showing up when we arrived at Changi Airport. There were no signs to the hotel shuttle bus and there were a group of 15 of us who were equally confused. We took a punt and just waited at what looked like a coach pick-up point. When we got to the hotel there was again confusion as to where to check-in (travellers, there are 3 towers that you could be staying in but all under the same hotel brand). The room on one of the highest floors has a great view of the ocean with the many ships waiting to come into port. The downside is that the view is also of the mass construction site so it's a 50/50. The night view of the city is much better so it depends what you're looking for. The skydeck is indeed a marvel of engineering but that is where it stops. One can actually visit the infinity pool or a small fee (but you can't get into the pool. Without sounding elitist, it was a bit off-putting having tourist mill around the general areas snapping away at the pool and even people in it. The pool is closed in the evening ( THIS IS NOT MENTIONED ) and we only found this out later in the day after inviting some business guest over for a drink to enjoy the facilities. A quick call to the concierge and we were informed not to worry as we could have drinks in the bar at the top floor and no reservations were required. When we got to the hotel after dinner, we found out that the \"bar\" was actually a nightclub and one had to pay some horrendous cover-charge to get in. Even if you are a hotel guest. The crowd in the line (yes.. a line).. were in their mid 20s and we decided to give it all a miss as the thought of loud club music wasn't to our fancy. Terribly embarassing. The hotel bar was not much better. The band were positioned at the entrace faced outwards to attract people in. Quite off putting to have to watch the back of a band performing. The furnishings of this hotel are not completed and cheaply done. The paintwork in the corners were messy, top of doors chipped and the large room we had was sparcely decorated that it felt that someone had walked away with some furniture. The same goes for the large bathroom. overall the place lacks finish and one wonders who the interior decoraion consultants were. Service here is really bad and one gets the feeling that this hotel is catering for casino patrons who don't really spend much time in their rooms and are happy with a functional hotel. This is DEFINITELY not a business hotel. Having spent 5 months this year in hotels around Asia, this comment comes from experience. Many shops are yet to open and all mainly luxury stores. Orchard Road is stll much better offereing better prices and variety while still allowing you to enjoy the Singapore buzz which Marina Bay Sands doesn't. The handful of restaurants are exclusive brand names and most have conditions (no kids, set meals only etc). When asked about our stay at the hotel, upon providing feedback; the young staff member smiled and told us he hoped to see us soon???? Obviously they get enough complaints already.

Staff has no idea of what this hotel offers and the only thing they know is to apologise but without providing me a solution. I booked a Club Room which supposing provide me with free use of the Club at the top floor.... The Club is really a joke, which I shall elaborate below. My nightmare started right at the checking in. When arriving at the hotel no one tells me where i can go check in. When I asked a staff, he asked me which tower I was staying??!! How would I know which tower I am staying before checking in. I finally located the check-in counter and the queue was amazingly long. Waited for at least 15 min to get to the counter to only find out that my room is not available at the check in time of 3pm. When I asked the young lady when my room would be ready, she did not know. After much ado, they finally upgarded me to a corner suite on the 36/F. She put down Tower 2 on my check-in card...but only to find out that my room is located in Tower 1 !!! Staff does not even know the location of my room !!!! I asked for an extend of check-out til 4pm on the day of my departure, the hotel charged me SG$170 for that 5-hr extension... value for $$??????!!! The room was nice with a full size bath tub facing the sea but only to find out the everyone walking along the corridor of the 36/F can have a fully view of my bathroom. No one warned me of this design flaw. I did not realise that people can have a fully view of me taking a bath until my friend told me and he can see me at the end of the hotel corridor!!! The swimming pool at the roof top has a nice view of the city, but in fact it is a public swimming pool.... Non-residents can pay using this pool.... It is in fact a 'water world' for kids and families who are not hotel guests/residents. Staff allows non hotel guests and families with sneakers walking on the deck on the pool !!! This is shocking !!!!! Families brought chips and have picnic on the sun-deck of the pool.... What a scene !!! Went to use the Club (which is supposed to be free to Club Room residents) after my dinner, but only to find out that they charge guests after 7:30pm !!! at SG$40 per person. Staff at the club are not trained.... no sense of hospitality.... the only thing they do is chatting with each other rather then serving guests !!!!! My last day was a joke. I paid for my extension of my last day until 4pm when I checked in. I had breakfast that day packed my luggages and went out for lunch. When I returned after lunch my hotel key/pass denied my access to my room. When I went down to the reception, the answer I got was \"Why don't you reactivate my room key in the morning\" cos the standard check out time is 11 am. I was shocked. The room key/pass is computer code, I would have thought the reception would have keyed in my departure time when I paid for my extension till 4pm when I check-in. Apparently they have not done so, or the hotel computer system does not have this option. But at least they should have warned me. Instead i was blamed for not having my pass reactivated... It turned out to be my fault not theirs !!!!! Guess how much is the room tariff i pay for this kind of services !!??? US$500 + per nite.... The service I got is similar to a back-packer 2-star hotel !!! What a shame !!!

Come the next day when we were going to leave - we got a late check out at 2pm which was good and we used the express check out (just fill up a form and you're good to go) and was happy that there was no fuss. we went to get our cars from the valet but tada! - they said it'd take 1 hour to get our cars from the carpark. so there we were with the baby and all our bags waiting in the lobby. one car came up in about 20 minutes and the other took 45 minutes. The view is nice, the rooms are nice and lots to do there with the shopping and casino but basically they don't have enough staff to service the hotel and guests.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat views, average rooms and service\u201d", "Author": "rypper", "ReviewID": "UR90471217", "Content": "We checked in on 13 December for two nights with our children to celebrate my son's 3rd birthday.

Don't get persuaded by negative comments.\u201d", "Author": "Villaelanorabali", "ReviewID": "UR90401371", "Content": "We travelled as a family of three. Booked the hotel via a website that gave us a good deal for 3 nights included breakfast. We arrived on saturday night 4th Dec. Our flight was delayed and the queue at Changi Airport was incredibly long. We arrived at the hotel around 9.30 pm. At first we were feeling rather apprehensive and quite overwhelmed by the massive lobby and large number of people there. But being saturday night, a new and spectacular hotel like this would surely draw crowd, locals and foreigners alike. We read comments posted by guests stayed at MBS in the last few months only to discover mostly negative comments and this was discouraging. We actually cancelled our booking in early november but rebooked it after my wife advised me that we should find out for ourselves how good or bad this hotel really is. At arrival, we were very quickly spotted by a bellboy who greeted us politely and guided us to the check in area. Surprisingly there was no queue. The staff at the counter were friendly, efficient and professional. Meanwhile the bellboy waited for us nearby with our luggage, ready to go. We were upgraded to the Horizon room on 32nd floor, the room is generously large, clean and very modern. A very short time later, the bellboy arrived with our luggage, all done promptly and courteously. The bed was extremely comfortable. The buffet breakfast was incredible, it was huge (floor area and variety) by any 5 star hotel standard. Yes, there was a long queue but the staff quickly moved people. They assisted us while we were standing in the queue, they matched the number of group of people with the tables available. We discovered that to cope with the demand, they expanded the seating capacity from 300 to 650 people at one seating. Furthermore there are several locations where you can have the buffet breakfast, including the top floor at SkyPark where the amazing pool is. The variety and selection of the food were amazingly comprehensive, from Asian, European, Vegetarian and Continental cuisines. The quality was very high and they were all very tasty. The waitresses were very professional, friendly and treated you as if you were the only one dining there, fully attentive. Furthermore, the senior executive of the Food and Beverage Dept happened to be there, he approached us and chatted with us and offered his assistance in any way possible if there was any issue with the food or any other matters. By now we were very pleasantly surprised by the service we experienced and couldn't help thinking how could some other people experienced poor service at this hotel. The pool was the best one we have seen. It was truly breathtakingly spectacular, an engineering marvel. Day and night, the views are vastly different. Again, the poolside service was great. Drinks were reasonably priced. Not a problem in getting sundeck chairs for three of us. Not crowded. It is separate from the public area. we didn't feel members of the public who paid $20 to see the view were gawking at us. The last night we were there, we indulged in the chocolate buffet for dinner at the SkyPark. The manager was very helpful and showed interest in talking to us, he was friendly, polite and very approachable. It was an incredible feast of chocolate galore over 52 selections. Forget counting calories here. Location of the hotel did not pose any problems for us to get around, as taxis are so cheap in Singapore and they are easy to get. Most of the shops, cafes and food hall in the surrounding precinct have been completed. It's a pleasant walk for window shopping. In all we had a great experience and will definitely comeback. Particularly in a short couple of years, the huge construction site visible from our bedroom will be an international theme park. When it's open, The MBS Hotel will be a comprehensive place for casino goers and family alike. All in one amazing place.

There wasn't much of a trouble checking-in, since there were no queues. I was quite disappointed when we got the suite on the 22nd floor instead of one at the higher floors. When we entered the suite, we noticed that the room was facing the area that was having construction works, so my mom dialed for the help desk but was put on hold for MORE THEN 5-10 MINS. Quite ridiculous for a hotel like Sands. She was quite fed up of waiting, so she hung up and went back to the check-in counters at the ground floor to request for a change of room facing the CBD instead. She didn't kicked a fuss (so unlike her haha), but politely requested for the change. The lady who served her did a check and gave us another suite at the 48th floor with the facing that we requested. She said we'd like this room cos it was bigger. Indeed, it was much bigger than the Orchid Suite. Till today, I'm not sure what's the name of the suite but I believed we got an upgrade! My friends and I loved the spaciousness of the room. Could easily accommodate fifty people in it!! There was the typical living area with the dining area, a toilet, a bathroom attached to the HUGE bedroom with more couches! Sweet! I was worried my friends wouldn't have sufficient room to move about or sit around. But this suite was an answer to my prayers! However, I realised the pillow cases for the couches had stains and looked quite disgusting. The toilet near the living area had an awful sewerage smell wafting around every now and then, that my friends complained of. That night, my friend lost her cellphone along the corridor. We called the Lost & Found, gave them the details and although my friend didn't managed to get her phone back, the staff did try their best and updated me on the status every now and then. I appreciated that. My parents went for the afternoon tea at The Club, and they seemed to like the pastry there. I had my breakfast at The Club on the next morning. The spread was good, the food was delectable! The staff was also attentive and helpful. I've been to the pool for several times now. It's definitely one of the best because of it's panoramic view! The best time to visit the pool is definitely in the morning! It isn't so crowded and the sun isn't that scorching. Overall, I've got a great suite for my party and an unforgettable 21st!

Only good thing was the view from our room (city view, 30th floor, Tower 3) was awesome. Here are the bad things that you will may experience. 1) Reservation is useless! When I made a reservation online, I put a note of \"Wheelchair-access room is required\". After that, via separate email to the reservation dept, requested King size, & City View room along with wheelchair access room. And I had a kind quick confirmation emails from MBS reservation department. When we arrived to the hotel lobby at the check-in time(3pm), a room that we requested was not available and they told me that we had to wait 2-3 hours for the room to be ready. I demanded for 20 min fiercely and finally got a room. 2) Guest Service takes forever We asked for a wheelchair to be brought up to our room and they said it would be done in 15 ~ 20 min. I called 4 times for 1 hour and still did not arrive. When we came back to the room, they left the wheelchair in our room even though we turned on \"Do Not Disturb\"!!!! After room service dinner, we asked in-dining dept to remove the table, never came and we put our table outside of the door. Guess what, they just removed the table when they delivered our Breakfast!!! 3) Valet Parking is NOT Free! You have to pay $12 for 24 hours just for in-house guest. So if you have your car and staying more than 24 hours, guess you have to win some money at Casino. 4) Messy as much as you can imagine Main Lobby for your first entrance to the hotel is scrambled with Taxis and Valets. Parking staffs do not know where to guide the cars and no expertise shown. Sky Park is not something you can imagine as quite, tranquil or cozy. Jacuzzis are filled with kids looking like some scenes. Noise from other rooms (kids screaming 24 hours) can be heard 24 hours. Overall, this hotel is so new that everything is not mature enough to be rated as 5-Star hotel. Staffs are rookies, automatically the level of service is not up to the standards.

Also, we had a late check out for 6pm, when we came back from the Skypark to pack at 4pm our cards had been deactivated.

The only complaints I have is the hotel lobby can be quite crowded during the day, like a shopping mall entrance. We drove to the hotel and the entrance approach is not very well designed as its a small road and there's always jam to get into the front door. And you have no choice to park your own car as you have to let the valet to park your car and pay SGD 12 for 24 hours parking. The worst part of my entire stay is to wait around 20 minutes for my car during dinner time because the valet service is very busy according to them. I wished they allow the hotel guests freedom to park and pick up their car on their own, which is particularly useful when you need to get into your car in an urgent situation.

However I had absolutely nothing to be worried about. I started contact with hotel 6 weeks prior to booking, all e-mails and questions were answered promptly containing all the information I needed. I pre booked and took advantage of the 15% discount which afforded us an upgrade to the Club level which was the best thing we could have ever done and made the whole stay that much better. We travelled as a group of 4 Adults & 3 children (10, 6 & 6 months) in two rooms. What made this hotel ideal for us was that the children were able to sleep in our room in a full queen bed (fold out sofa) and take advantage of the Club at Marina Bay Sands facilities at no additional charge. Exceptional value! We spent 7 fabulous days at the hotel on the 49 floor. Checking in was fast, efficient and done in a private office setting where we were offered refreshments. There was initially confusion over rates however when I presented e-mail confirmation it was amended immediately. Our rooms were ready, clean and large, easily accommodated our family. Very comfortable. If I were to be very very picky the d\u00e9cor was a bit bland and it was a shame the curtains did not open further to offer all the view available. Storage in the room just enough and we did encounter randomly a bad smell coming up from the pipes in the bathroom. However non of the above would deter me from staying or recommending the hotel. The Sky Park is really breath taking when the lift doors opened for the first time and I will say the feeling never changed during the whole stay. The Club at Marina Bay Sands offered fabulous food and service. The staff were incredible. The pool was great, a little cooler than I have been used to in the Asia climate but refreshing. I asked for late check out which we were given at no additional charge. The check out process was fast and efficient. Lastly, the hotel is a little isolated. It would be great if there was a convenience store/7/11 near by. Maybe in time. I have nothing but commendation for the staff and facilities at this hotel.

The service is extremely bad. It takes more than one hour of the shuttle bus going to this hotel (normally by taxi it is just 15 mins) as it has 4 stops at the airport and it takes so long to wait at each stop and the driver even allows local Singaporean (later found out they are fans) to get on this bus for a free ride. When we arrived at hotel, the first thing we saw is people people people (we found out later than there were celebrities staying at this hotel) so a lot of fans were grouping at the hotel and the hotel seemed not interested to do any crowd control. Once we got in the hotel lobby, there was a big area with water on the floor as the water fountain on the side was leaking water?! And there was no direction to where the check-in counter is and we have to run into different directions to find it with so many people blocking the way. The next day, we went down to have breakfast and there was a very long queue, and we were led to another place for breakfast that takes a long way to walk, and it was just a temporary area with bad food and bad services. Later on, we called the operator from our room trying to find out the opening hours and transportation to Universal Studios. We can only be able to talk to someone after 10-15 mins, as no one was picking up phone calls or the line simply cut off. (I have never experience this in a 5-stars hotel.) Finally, we got someone telling us that Universal Studios opens at 9am and there is a shuttle bus coming at 8:25am to pick up, then we were transferred to the concierge, another person told us it opens at 10am instead and bus is coming at 9:25am. Anyway, we bought 4 shuttle bus hop-on tickets in town. On day 2, we went to breakfast at the hotel lobby, which the food is so much better but still we need to wait for a long time. We went out to the bus stop and found that there\u2019s a Marathon going on outside the hotel, we asked the hotel if the bus is still coming, the hotel said yes. So we waited at the bus stop but felt no vehicle was coming, so I went back to the hotel and asked again, this time another staff told me the bus was cancelled due to the Marathon. We need to walk to the casino side and took a taxi from there. Then I called the bus company to asked for a refund, the staff said there\u2019s no refund\u2026 Lastly, the sky park, it is quite small and crowded, and I think the staff at the park didn\u2019t really check the ID of people getting in (it is just for room guests and people who bought the pass). After we swam, we tried to find the shower facilitied but we cannot find any, so we asked the staff there, and the answer was: \u201cSorry, I am not sure.\u201d\u2026 There are still so much more incidents we had at this hotel\u2026In summary, at this price, I would suggest a much more established hotel down town, NEVER consider Marina Bay Sands\u2026", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta", "Title": "\u201cExpected much more, nice looking but more like a shopping mall than hotel\u201d", "Author": "CountryLadinIndo", "ReviewID": "UR89398491", "Content": "Check in under Tower 1 was overcrowded and more like entering Suntec City then a hotel.

To me, it felt like a home from home but with all the luxuries included. We were picked up by coach (free to MBS guests) from the airport. The coach was on time and the driver was very friendly. 45 minutes later, we arrived at the hotel and the first time we saw it we were stunned. Structurally, this is truly iconic. You can see the boat shape stretching across the 3 towers - fantastic design. We checked in which went very smoothly and were portaged to our room. The room itself was amazing and fitted with all mod cons such as electric curtains, shaver points, aircon controls for both rooms, mini bar, walk in shower, roll top bath, study area with fax/copier built in and Wi-Fi. It was very clean and comfortable. We ate in-room dining on a number of occasions which was also excellent and not bad in terms of value for money - a local dish of curry and rice (tasted great) was around S$ 16 - 18. The staff that brought the food to the rooms were always very friendly. The most memorable part of the stay was indeed the sky park and the fantastic pool which stretches across the top of the hotel. This location truly offers the most stunning view of Singapore, Day and Night. We spent many of our days lounging around the pool taking in the scenery.

We spent 3 nights here in Singapore. This was a fairly expensive hotel, costing $1100 (Sing Dollar) total booking through Wotif. From the airport, we caught the complimentary courtesy bus to the hotel. This bus ride took around 1 hour, more than twice as long as a taxi ride would have taken! The bus comes every 30 minutes, starting at terminal 1 where it sits for 5 minutes then wanders slowly to terminal 2, repeats the process before visiting terminal 3 and eventually departing the airport. This in itself took 15 minutes! The bus then takes the freeway to the city but has a speed limit of 60km/h so instead of a 20 minute ride, the whole process wastes an hour of your time! To top it off, the bus TV which plays a 5 minute long ad that runs on repeat, enough to drive you mad. We recommend you hop into a taxi and avoid the bus if you wish to stay sane. The taxis in Singapore are really cheap and a trip would only cost around $20. Upon arrival, the staff at the check in counter reported computer networking problems and as such, could not check us in. We waited around 30 minutes whilst they walked around muttering to each other until one of the more senior staff approached us and asked if we would like to take a seat in the adjacent bar for cocktails on the house as an apology. This was a nice gesture but would have been appreciated much earlier on! The rooms are big and grand. They are nice but really just a standard new modern looking hotel with no real style. It is certainly the opposite of boutique! The carpet in our room was badly stained, a surprising find given that the hotel is relatively new. We feel this place will not age well at all. The beds are huge and really comfortable. The bathroom, toilet and shower are still really new and clean - very nice (from a very fussy hotel bathroom reviewer!). The view was not so great from our room, we were facing the construction. Our room was on level 27. There was complimentary in room wifi, although we noted this was meant to be a paid service - for some reason, we got it free. The pool was beautiful, a unique feature that makes this hotel stand out. Get here early in the morning to enjoy the water to yourself before all the children and families visit. The views of Singapore are amazing. Surprisingly, there are no gym facilities. The proximity of the hotel to The Shoppes in Marina Bay Sands, which are a part of the hotel and casino complex is a major attraction. They are however, still under construction and we opted to go to orchard road instead to shop. The big brands are all opening up including Prada, LV, Miu Miu. If you wish to go elsewhere to shop, you will have to walk a distance to the MRT or just take a taxi.

Constructions are maybe ready in couple of years, at the moment the hotel is only one that's ready, if you have seen the views from hotel's around they are all computer images, there are dozens of bulldozers and machines working as I write this...

We think this is no problem, because if you really don't like other tourists watching, you can use the sunbeds on the lefthand side of the pool. We didn't mind the other tourists having a look at the pool. Marina Bay is not a SPA, it is a tourist attraction. Somehow we think it's just fair that people who cannot afford to stay at the hotel get a view of the pool (swimming is for hotel-guests only). When you enter the pool area (either from the hotel or the skypark) you have to show your room-key. Other hotel-guests described this as \"harrassement\". To us it made sense, that you somehow have to prove that you are a hotel-guest. We enjoyed the fact, that we could move between the hotel and the skypark as often as we liked. The friendliness of the staff was as we expected it. The hotel is quite new and some facilities are not open yet. For instance the lounge (where you have breakfast and cocktail-hour when you book a club-room), was still on the ground floor (must be really nice when it's next to the pool). Some restaurants were not open yet. The only thing we really found disgusting was a lack of a shower next to the swimming pool... Apart from that our stay at Marina Bay Sands was a the highlight of our trip to Singapore!", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tahiti, French Polynesia", "Title": "\u201cPoor service, too big, bad hotel\u201d", "Author": "etoileco", "ReviewID": "UR87000282", "Content": "I agree with the other reviewer- the hotel is too big so it looses any personal touches.

Half the jacuzzis were broken and the pool was dirty- while swimming with googles on the water had paper and plastic floating in it. Reception felt like I was at large convention center with no personal touches, long lines, no where to sit, tons of people and even the people from the hotel could not direct us to the concierge. It is 10 minutes walk from the main city but the concierge could not tell us how to walk there (pleasant across a pedestrian bridge- we found it on our way home). If you want great service, personal touches, and don't want to feel like one of the crowd, don't stay here. Definitely not worth the money, even to swim in the infinity pool. BY the way, if you stay for one day only you can only use the pool while you are checked in your room- you can not use it while you wait for your plane and there is no where to change your clothes if you leave later than checkout.

On the day I left I a letter to the GM as below: Dear Madam / dear Sir, I would like to inform you that my stay at your hotel has been the worst experience in any three star hotels and above I have ever stayed at. The worse in my 21 year business career. Here is a brief summary of the key issues -- not all -- that I faced during my horrendous five night stay. \uf0a7 I had to line up for over 10 minutes to check in the hotel. \uf0a7 At check-in: o my reservation could not be found; then o my reservation was found to had been cancelled; then o my reservation was found to have been changed; then o my request for a non-smoking room, king-size bed and high floor could not be met; then o a room (non-smoking plus king-size bed) was found but on a law floor (the eighth). I was told I would be informed the next day if a change would be available. I was never informed of any change; then o I was never asked for my business details (address, e-mail etc) which is unique for a hotel of your standing; then o I was never offered a complimentary or four -- payment newspaper as is the practice in the same class hotel; then o I was told that breakfast \"should\" be complimentary and I would be told later. I was never informed; then o I was not told by anyone that the gym is not ready yet and that only a temporary one is available. \uf0a7 I am sure that you have received many complaints with regards to your coffee shop, but here are mine: o Service at the coffee shop and at the lounge adjacent to the coffee shop is minimal. For example, if one only orders a drink, no snacks or tissues are given unless they are requested. o The breakfast fruit is of poor quality o The lining up waiting time for breakfast is absolutely ridiculous -- at least 10 minutes. o The hotel does not stick to \"set -- which would -- four -- sets -- table\" principle, as such when I order a coffee in the morning I had to ask several different waiters. It was the same case when I ordered a beer at a different time; I had to ask several waiters too. \uf0a7 Top Floor Bar. I understand that the management of this particular outlet is separate from that of the hotel but I believe that the security guards outside the bar and outside the innovators next to the bar are hotel staff -- at least they weren't the same uniform. Mr. Peng, who was the supervisor on the night of the incident should be able to provide further details on what happened on the evening of Tuesday 2nd of November at about 10 PM. I was making a call on my cell phone in a quiet but open area. I was dressed in a suit. I was not speaking loudly. One of the security guards interrupted me several times in a rude manner to tell me to exit the area. Ultimately I did, but the attitude was incredibly rude. Then, I gave one of my name cards to one of the guards because I wanted to speak to the supervisor. I had to wait at least 30 minutes and then I had to ask for the supervisor again as opposed to him looking from me. Only an oral apology was provided. No written note or apology in any other form was provided. \uf0a7 When I asked for a complaint form or opinion form, I was just told to go to the website but was not provided with any specific instructions. In fact, I was not able to easily find and where to complain or voice an opinion \uf0a7 when I asked for a check out extension to 2 PM, two days before checking out, someone at the front desk and said they would get back to me but they never did. \uf0a7 In conclusion, if management has no management skills you should shut down the hotel, we train your staff, and then reopen. Overall, the facilities (except for the gym) are good but the soft skills do not exist.

Booked online a week in advance for a 3 day stay. The hotel runs a concierge at the airport arrivals terminal. I had forgot to print my voucher which was easily remedied by the staff. Moments later, I was on my way to the free shuttle to the hotel. Hotel is massive and beautiful. Location was difficult to get to due to the F1 races at the time. Check-in was a breeze and done in under 10 minutes (this was midweek). I had read the TA reviews and had already prepared myself for the worst. Not so. I was given a room on the 44th floor (what hotel catering to Chinese gamblers has a 44th floor?) with a view of the ocean. Unfortunately, the view was accompanied by a massive construction site. I would have opted for the city view given a second chance. The room was nice enough. Bathroom included all the necessities and more. The bed was comfortable. The big minus was the very expensive internet. At 275 USD a night, internet should easily be included. Of note was the turndown service, which operated in an almost clandestine fashion - I never saw them, although my room was always clean upon my return from a night or day out in the city. The casino is large easy to get to. All who enter have to display their passport (locals are charged a daily fee to enter). Plenty of baccarat tables and slots. Blackjack tables are somewhat hidden towards the rear and start at a lame 35 SGD minimums. Ordering a beer at a table is next to impossible (the waitresses seemed to be severely understaffed) and very expensive. Dealers were pleasant. Live music was also on hand with covers of David Guetta, Akon, and Lady Gaga which contributed to the atmosphere. Despite being a large and attractive casino within 2 hours of me, the overall feel fell well short of the Bellagio/Wynn/MB/Mirage. The gambling experience was lacking, impersonal, and production-line-like. Room service was on point - everything arrived before the '35 minutes' promised by the operator. I highly recommend the Malaysian fare. The nasi lemak and goreng were particularly good. Dined at 'The Nest' in the hotel. Food was hardly anything to write home about. I was surprised by the bitterness of the dishes, but I'm confident this has more to do with regional tastes than anything. In a nutshell, the value just wasn't there.

First night, obviously, someone had slept in our bed. A staff? A guess that was not happy about the room and ask a room change? Next, we had not enough towels for the number of guests. Everyday we had to ask this \"extra\" towel. My girl spilled something on the pillow and the pillow was never changed. A sticker from the airline felt on the floor and was never removed. Room service? Overpriced. I got a burger. No one ever asked how I would like it cooked. So I got a small chunky super-over-cooked burger. My girl ordered a chicken curry. When we realized it was served without rice, we ordered extra rice. We are still waiting for it. After calling for the table to be cleared from our room, we waited patiently for... too long. We finally decided to clear it ourselves and put it in the corridor. The swimming pool at the top floor is... well, a mess. Luckily, it is the world\u2019s largest outdoor pool at that height. But it is NOT the glamorous pool of the website. You will get dirty loungers (The hotel is brand new) and imagine an overcrowded pool with lots of noise.

Driver just sat in her seat. No signage to tell you that there is a check-in desk where the coach pulls up. No evidence of our 2 night booking.

Room OK, not opulent, beige and modern, super comfy bed and big plasma, no bath!, Now some of these things I would never mention usually, but when you are paying big bucks and it was a treat for us, they mattered. Only 1 normal tea bag. All the rest were herbal. No UHT or fresh milk, only powdered. Hair dryer cord not long enough to be used in a power outlet near a mirror. Lifts not air-conditioned. Skypark or Business Centre, not labelled on the lift button. Typos in the Room compendium and shopping map absent. Maid and Mini-Bar both entered the room when the DND was illuminated. Check-in girl did not know where I could do 'money change'. No restaurants open on pool deck during the day, except for the 'Members Only' one. Staff few and far between to try and arrange a drink, sandwich by pool.

Think property is aimed at conference guests and casino gamblers. Armies of beautifully groomed staff stand around doing nothing. They look like nervous rabbits. By the time we checked out no-one had smiled, said good morning, how was you stay, happy honeymoon. The exeception was the Bell staff, particularly the fellow who chatted to us while we waited for a cab after we had checked out.

Only negative was that the TV wasn't working and the hotel maintenace couldn't fix it when we checked out the next day (quite disappointed considering how new and expensive the hotel is) We then went straight to the top floor for the main attraction - the 150m inifinty outdoor swimming pool. The pool was relatively small due to the high numbers of other pool users. But we didn't care as we were in swimming 200m above ground overlooking Singapore City/marina. You actually feel like swimming in the sky! Breathtaking. However, eveything else was average. The hotel boasts loads of chic and upmarket shops but apart from the stores on the main promanade, most are yet to stil open and the shopping centre itself is half finished with construction still ongoing (foodcourt consists of 3 market stalls!). Overall, it did seem overpriced for what we got as it felt that the hotel/shopping centre isn't 100% finished and the service isn't 1st class. But am happy to have stayed for 1 night to experience the outdooor pool and downstairs casino. Would I stayed at the MBS again??

Superficially, the hotel looks grand. However, reality catches up with a guest very quickly. Here is a quick litany of the problems that my family suffered during our stay. A lot of things, even basic ones, do not work properly in the rooms. This ranges from design errors to poor workmanship to poor maintenance. For example, the AC in our children's room did not work. In order to restart the unit, the engineer would open the sliding door to the balcony in order to rebalance the air. Still it would stop after 5 minutes. AC is not a luxury in a place like Singapore. Worse yet, the chain lock on the door, which uses an internal mechanism got jammed after latching. As a result, we could not open the door to our children's room, which presents a severe fire hazard. Worst of all, we complained about this to the front desk manager, who promised to look into this personally, but did nothing. When we returned at the end of the day, not only was the chain still jammed, but there was no voice mail or note explaining what if anything was being done. We could only conclude based on this negligence that it was NOTHING. Beyond these problems, the hotel was clearly opened well before it was ready. The staff is not well trained, particularly those involving guest services. There were other nuisances. Everyone knows that this project placed the parent corporation under severe financial strain. It shows in how they nickel and dime you for everything from $30 internet access to $25 charge for accessing their sky level. For what you do receive, there is too much hassle factor, namely the crowds and long queues for everything like breakfast. I could go on about the location being somewhat inconvenient, no turndown service, etc., but I think you get the picture. In short, shame on the Sands, shame on Singapore, and be warned about making a visit, at least a family one to this hotel unless you do not mind being a guinea pig. Macau is not Las Vegas and Singapore is not Macau.

There was no turning back as we had booked before reading all the poor reviews on Tripadvisor. I would have to agree with all these reviews. To put it politely (note the subject), this hotel is rubbish. We booked a Suite and a Horizon Grand Room for the family. This is a brand new hotel so the rooms are so so, standard of a 4 star hotel. The lobby is overcrowded, restaurants and bars are a disgrace and the swimming pool (the resaon why we booked this hotel) is an absolute joke. If you go swimming, you'll feel like an animal in a zoo! With the right management this could be a good 4 star hotel: the hardware is definately worthy of 4 stars but the service is probably the poorest I've ever encountered and believe me, we stayed at a good few hotels. Let's start by checking in: 1. Queued up for 30mins. and were told that the rooms weren't ready yet (it was already 4pm). We were told they should be ready within the hour. 2. An hour gone by and queued up for another 20mins. and were told that only the suite was ready. So we took the suite first and waited for the other room which we were told would be ready within the hour. 3. After 90mins. we queued up for another 10mins (as it was getting late there was less people) and was told that the room was still not ready. No apologies - nothing. After refusing to give in for the third time and demanding to see the manager a room suddenly appears. Now where did this room come from? 4. You can calculate the time we checked in to the room. Surprisingly, checking out was the opposite, very efficient in fact. However, there was no service at the front of the hotel (actually, there was no service anywhere in this hotel). I could see doormen, porters and parking valets but was there any help? You guessed it. We were taken to the airport by family living in Singapore and they used the valet parking.

The Infinity Pool at Skypark is an impressive piece of design, so having the chance to swim there might be worth it to some. Rooms are very spacious and new, with nice views. In-room meal service was good, but expensive. The Bad Odd drainage systems in the bathrooms, which are incredibly noisy if people in other rooms shower. Also a really strong, bad smell coming from the drains, like they need to be cleaned (although I can't figure out why that would be since the hotel is so new). Price Gouging You'll need to pay S$30 for 24 hours of internet access. $S20 for six hours. Breakfast at Rise is around S$40+, same for in-room meals Poor Hotel Design This would be my main complaint. Not much the hotel can do about it now, but it suffers from a number of poor design choices. The biggest is the lobby, which doesn't have any of the relaxing character of a good 4-star hotel lobby. Picture trying to check in at a kiosk in the middle of a busy mall, and that's pretty much the general feeling. They've recruited a classical stringed quartet comprised of short-skirted ladies in heavy makeup, but the effect is more unsettling than soothing. And because the lobby is so highly trafficked, expect show your room key to the bouncer at the elevator to your room. Suppose this means decent security, but it's just a weird feeling to be questioned for a key every time you want to go back to your room. The taxi queue t near tower 1 is real snarl of cars. The architect inexplicably put the main exit for the basement carpark right next to the entrance, so even if you manage to get a taxi, expect to wait a while before you can actually get out of there. There is another, quieter taxi queue near tower three which is highly recommended. For breakfast, give the restaurants a miss and do in-room service. The lines in the morning are incredibly long, and service isn't so great. The staff are real efficient with getting the bill to you, but you have to get real aggressive to get any coffee or tea from the wait staff. There are plenty of them but they spend most of the time talking to one another. I've had to stay here for 6 nights, which is a bit rough.

I just finished a 3 day stay, and the place was really great. I had a \"horizon premiere\" room, city view. THe room was very large and spacious, very comfortable bed and sheets and an especially nice pillow. Nice bathroom amenities, big walk in shower, and I repeat lots and lots of space. The city view is worth the extra money. The staff were friendly everywhere. I wasn't too pleased with their not having a single check in line, but rather lots of individual lines, where you don't know if your line will take 5 minutes or an hour. The pool is the main attraction. THere is nothing like it anywhere in the world, 57 floors up, and HUGE. Amazing place, well worth the extra money to experience swimming in that pool. No problem getting a lounge chair, and the other guests seemed to be respectful and not running around screaming, as others have written. Meals are expensive in the hotel: the dinner buffet was 85 Singapore dollars, which is a lot of money. It was truly world class, and great service and everything was made real fresh, lots of imported cheeses, the highest quality beef I've ever seen at a buffet, etc., but it was expensive. You can walk over to the shopping mall where there are a few reasonable restaurants, but it's still expensive. They did have some \"kiosks\" there, which were very cheap, but not a great standard. THere are also two restaurants inside the casino, which are very reasonable: one called The Nest (the better one on the 2nd floor), and some kind of noodle bar. They had Singapore style food like $9 Singapore dollars for a full meal. Very reasonable, and i think the Nest is open 24 hours too. THere is no convenience store nearby to buy cheaper food, but there is a shop in the hotel lobby where they had some snacks available at high prices. Yes, the hotel is expensive, but the room is great, and that pool is one of a kind. It's expensive, but it's not a crazy price. It's a fair price for the experience you get there, which you can't get anywhere else, especially with that roof deck and roof pool. You kind of have to take taxis to get there, but it's not far from downtown and Clark Quay areas. THere is an MRT subway station maybe 12 minutes walk away, a new closer station is under construction, open in 2 years they say. The only reason for the high number of poor reviews might be people upset at their gambling losses in the casino.

This hotel is the most appalling hotel experience I have had in more than 30 years travelling experience. We made the reservation based on the assumption, mistakenly so, that being the latest and \u2018greatest\u2019 hotel in Singapore it would far outweigh the comfort and luxury of the likes of the Ritz Carlton which was the last hotel I stayed in when in Singapore. Indeed the experience we had can be categorised as nothing more than a nightmare. We were at the end of a 23 day holiday where we had travelled around the globe dropping in at Las Vegas, Noosa Heads \u2013 Queensland, Sydney, Langkawi and finally Singapore. Frankly the experience ruined the last few days of our holiday! Problems started from the moment we tried to make the reservation online. Their service failed and we were advised to call the telephone booking service to sort the problem. Rather than be helpful they directed that we merely send an email. Having carried out their instructions a further attempt to make the reservation on line succeeded; however, this time, being less than five minutes from the failed attempt, the rate had gone up and the final account was increased by hotel tax and GST, there is no mention of this on their booking site. Needless to say when a copy of the booking was forwarded to them and an explanation sought \u2013 it was ignored. Having checked in, which was an interesting experience as there was no bellman to deal with our luggage; we found the room to have a spectacular view of the city. Although this was blighted by the filthy windows \u2013 yes inside \u2013 they were covered in hand prints! Additionally the room was furnished with sub-standard furniture, essentially it was more \u2018budget\u2019 than Five Star. As we had booked a Club Suite we expected the usual refinements to be in the room IE flowers fresh fruit etc., \u2013 none of it! In fact the lack of object \u2018art was staggering \u2013 there just wasn\u2019t one piece! Calling for the management to attend and explain just why the room was so poorly presented resulted in an immediate upgrade. We thought that this was a positive move until we actually arrived in the new suite! It was so sparsely furnished it looked as if someone had either stolen the furniture and or effects, alternatively it looked as if they had stopped furnishing it less than half way! The Front of House manager who dealt with the initial complaint about the standard of the first accommodation promised he was address all the other matters. Furthermore he assured us that he would also address any other issue we had. We addressed a plethora of issues and matters by email only to be ignored. When finally, after several reminders had been sent, he responded he indicated that he would address all matters on the 15th a day after we would have left! This statement lead us to escalate the matter to the general manager. However it turned out that the general manager was off site for a few days. The case was taken up by a Senior Manager \u2013 there is little point in going into detail here about how the matter was handled other than to say that it was far from satisfactory and the degree of arrogance displayed when trying to settle the matter beggars belief. Having refused their offers they still applied them when we checked out! In summary when we booked this hotel we expected to find a hotel akin to the Burj al Arab \u2013 making such an assumption was a huge mistake. What we found was a basic budget hotel, albeit it had the most amazing rooftop infinity pool, the standard of the accommodation was appalling as was the way in which management handled matters if, indeed, they didn\u2019t just ignore us! What you will find is that several of the staff will try and help although they have no back up or support. What you will also find is;- There is no Club Lounge The Theatre is not open The Spa is not open The gym is not open \u2013 although two bedrooms have been made into temporary facilities There are workmen on site And many other facilities just do not exist", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cUncommonly horrifying service\u201d", "Author": "cejekw", "ReviewID": "UR84085002", "Content": "Here is a recap of our nightmarish check-in experience: 1) The scenario we arrived at ard 2pm: the lobby was littered with groups of people standing around with their luggage at their feet. 2) The \"official\" check-in time is 3pm.

Resorts world is probably ideal if you like the \"tacky Disney themed\" thing. Marina on the other hand is all about class and luxury. Despite its size (2000+ rooms) it doesn't feel crowded. There are lots of people around the public areas, but still it seems very clean and organised. The floors to each room (we were at Tower 1) felt very private. The room itself is what you'd expect from a 5-star: - Modern appliances (TV, room controls, etc) - Ultra clean - A luxurious bath (we got upgraded to Horizon Grand room) - Ultra clean - Very comfortable bed, linen and pillows - EXCELLENT city view - 36th floor is high enough - Aircon temperature that is accurate (they allowed 3 adult people to share two twin beds in the room at no extra charge) The link to the casino, shops etc. are just so well laid out. Everything has high ceilings, everything is clean. There is sense of class without the snob. As for the skypark - there is nothing like it in the world. The view is amazing - if you go for a swim during the morning there aren't that many people. It is extremely well designed. Because the hotel is pricey it keeps out the riff raff who would typically pee, scream, etc at public pools etc. The pool is ultra clean and the ambience was relaxing. Worth repeating this point again, unlike other hotels, the pool here did not have riff raffs. Only negative was quality of the breakfast buffet at Rise restaurant. Apart from the fact that you had to be up early to avoid the queue, the food was just not up to an international buffet standard.

But any time spent there quickly reveals a management under stress and staff unable to cope with inadequate and badly thought-through facilities. What promises comfort and glamour delivers an experience that reminds you you're just a cog in a vast money-making machine. The hotel is designed to impress at first glimpse rather than to promote anything like relaxation: booking in and staying there was so stressful that I and my colleague booked out early the next morning with out even 'enjoying' breakfast (see below for why!). With so many things wrong, it's hard to choose, but three areas stand out - 1: the big sell, their rooftop infinity pool; 2: service and complaints procedures; 3: breakfast facilities. Pool: The rooftop infinity pool is the hotel's top attraction and has amazing views - but also three downsides: a) day visitors stand around at the back (right behind you if you're on the sunloungers) snapping away at the views - bad news for the self-conscious b) the pool is subdivided into smaller pools by underwater 'walls' so you can't swim more than a few metres. It's too crowded and shallow anyway (4ft). c) From tower 2 there is no direct access - you have to go all the way down in the lift in your dressing gown, cross to another lift and ascend to the 54th floor. So what looks like one thing - the boutique infinity pool vibe - turns out to feel more like a crowded lido. Excellent for a one-off, or if you're a day-tripper up there (the views really are something), but not somewhere you feel like returning to in order to relax. 2: Service management Having booked a sea view room and been given a city view, we were dumped in another room temporarily while things were sorted out.. and just left there. The room smelt of smoke and there were cigarette butts on the balcony. Here's the worst bit: trying to contact front desk, I was kept on hold for fifteen minutes, listening to lift music. This happened three times so was not just bad luck. When I finally decided to complain to the duty manager, front of house staff would not put me through - that is, they put me through repeatedly to 'someone else' who had no authority, and who would not identify themselves unless challenged. For all the staff's perfect manners, this strikes me as a management system reacting badly under extreme pressure. On our way out, a porter hinted that we weren't by any means the first to leave early - capacity was too high for as yet untested facilities. A pity management weren't listening to him. Which leads us to the third big problem.... ....3: Breakfast. If queueing for over an hour for a lobby breakfast is your idea of luxury, you're booking the right place. And that's a big understatement: when I and my colleague finally checked out in disgust at midday, there were still people queueing up to eat. Again, staff confided that the facilities simply weren't adequate for the numbers - but why? Can't hotel designers count? So doesn't Marina Bay have anything going for the traveller? Well, yes.. As a glamorous location stuffed to the gills with designers shops and casinos and top restaurants, the Marina Bay Sands experience is worth a single night of your life - if you're not in search of a romantic or relaxing location.that is. My tips: a) Book without a breakfast deal. b) Take a room in tower 1 or 3 for direct pool access. c) Get there early - 3pm is check-in - head for the rooftop pool and enjoy sunset. Then troll around the designer shops and casino or whatever, enjoy the room, and perhaps a 7am swim as the city wakes below... and d) - get the heck out of there! Believe me, you'll really appreciate a calm, simple, well-run city hotel after this.

Nothing to 'wow' about and certainly expect more. They don't even have bathtub in the room. It has really been a while since I last stay in a hotel of such standard. 2. Service - Where do I even begin?? For one, the staff here are very unfriendly, they hardly smile at you and everything is communicated to you in icy tone. Information gathering is also poor. For example, i drove and self-parked in the convention and casino building. It seems that only have to pay $6 for 24 hours parking, which in my mind is petty since guest should park free, but anyway as I checked out, I try to enquire whether there is a complimantery ticket for me to insert into the exit slot. A concierge who is a PRC and can hardly speak English just look at me and give me some incoherent answer. My patience gets the better of me and I simply walked away. I ended paying $26 for parking. 3. Location - So close yet so far away is most apt here. Suntec and Marina Square is not that far but you still need a cab. At least getting a cab here is easy. 4. Food - Some saving grace. The breakfast buffet at Rise is ok.

Everything from the 1 hours check in waiting time ( we still did not get the room we had pre-booked weeks in advance) to the low class toiletries in the bath room, makes this a hotel stay I would like to forget. The pool side menu comprise of twisties from a bag and draft beer in a plastic mug.. No food or drinks are served at the pool side. Now tell me, what other hotel do not serve cocktails by the poolside. Then onto the mini-bar in the room. All items are subject to a sensor, which means if you touch it, you bought it. No chance to put in your own bottle of lets say champagne, or as was the case for my wife and I, the breast milk for our daughter. The breakfast was crowded and not very good. Low quality food and very little choice. Compared to what you get at the Fullerton or the Shangri-la this was beyond bad.

I would recommend for those travellers looking to spend time in the casino or not wanting to do much else apart from stay in a hotel room or a short trip to check out the Skypark which does have great views and is open to visitors. Its location is not the best and the closest MRT is a fair walk away amidst much current construction. The rooms are quite spacious and the service was of such excellence (sarcasm to be noted here) that every day when we put the do not disturb sign, our room was nevertheless miraculously cleaned and tidied but bar fridge was not restocked. Hotel management should take note as we could have claim items to have been stolen/taken while the DND sign was left on and the room still accessed by staff.

Pool really is stunning, with a sensible end reserved for adults only, so other guests could take refuge away from our noisy kids. Choice of snacks and drinks poolside is pretty limited (no coffee!) but service was fine. \"Lack of privacy\" did not register - maybe because it was mid-week and pretty quiet. Only used housekeeping to ask for an additional 2 bottles of complimentary mineral water - arrived within 5 minutes. Did not try internet. Location is good (walking distance to the Flyer) but note taxis charge a SGD3 premium to pick from the hotel. Breakfast - we had this in the main lobby and arrived just after 8am.

My reserved room type was not updated in the reservation system until I show her the email(between me and the reservations team) that I printed out and she promptly help me change to the room type that I wanted. Very efficient and friendly! I stayed in an Horizon Grand room with the Marina Bay view. My room wasn't done up properly when I first went in. The bed sheets are quite crumpled and there is even a plastic takeaway bowl of unfinished Cheng Tng left behind by the previous guest in the fridge. The postcard had a message written by another guest and was still in the folder. Sound insulation was not good as I can hear the guests next door when they were in their room. The bed and sofa were very comfortable though, all the equipments were very easy to use with simple-to-understand instructions. I visited the SkyPark in the late afternoon, and ALL the staff I've encountered at the SkyPark look very stern and unfriendly, and they all talk to people in a very unhappy and unfriendly tone, as if everyone owes them a living. Some parts of the SkyPark are restricted to hotel guests only and when people want to enter, the staff will ask to see their room key in a very unfriendly tone and just wave them past in a very condescending manner when hotel guests show them the keys. I mean, people paid good money to stay in MBS, I think basic courtesy (like a smile, or thank you) is not too much to ask for, especially in the service line! Even the lady that I order my drink from in the SkyPark just leaned on the wall as I approached her and hand me the menu with a 'crooked' hand when I asked for it. It's really abhorring, just thinking about the service of ALL, and I really mean ALL the staff I saw at SkyPark. Something is really wrong here, the only things right here are the infinity pool and the view, that's all. At night I requested for a bucket of ice, it took about 1hr and two calls before it arrive, enough said. Didn't visit the casino so couldn't review. The next morning I was supposed to go to Rise Restaurant for breakfast but the queue was too long, hence I was directed to one of their convention hall CORRIDOR for breakfast, which is euthanasically called \"Bayview Breakfast\" as the space is facing the Marina Bay. Queue was just as long, if not longer and food was very very mediocre. I mean, if MBS knows how many rooms it has, it should design its breakfast cafe/restaurant so that it can accomodate to the influx of guests in the morning! Simple logic?? Extremely disappointed. Check out was hassle-free, just fill in a form, drop into a box and leave, that's all. However getting the car back from valet was not very efficient. The valet took about 30mins to retrieve my car, maybe that waiting time needs some improvement, especially if there is another appointment to be met by the departing guest. Overall, I feel that MBS can hardly justify the price that it is charging for the level of service and F&B it is providing. I've only had the very \"basic package\" of room and breakfast and I already had so much bad experience, really cannot imagine what else I'll experience if I'd stayed longer and requested for more things! The only saving grace that the hotel has maybe is the view from the top as well as nice interior decorations, but how far can these bring you?

My rating reflects a comparison with 4 and 5 star hotels that I use on average twice a month for business trips, mainly in Asian capital cities. I found the Marina Bay Sands to be heavily overpriced for the quality of the room and standard of service, even allowing for the discount I received as a conference attendee (I paid SGD300 for an \"atrium deluxe\" room). The quality of room fittings was average and far below what I would expect for the price from the likes of a Shangri-La, Intercontinental etc. There were problems in the room such as a broken light in the cupboard and a defective shower head. Although the room was non-smoking, there was a tobacco smell in the room and from the bed linen. As I was in the hotel for less than 24 hours, I did not raise a complaint with the management. Neither was my feedback requested. The check-in experience was poor. There was a 15-min wait for check-in with only two check-in counters working for Tower 3. I waited 25 mins (outside) for the shuttle bus from the airport, although the queue for taxis was not the hotel's fault, and the shuttle bus is free. I had a room service dinner and the quality was on the low side of average. While I found the hotel to be overpriced from my perspective as a business traveller, the hotel is obviously more focussed on tourists and in particular casino visitors. That's fine, although if I had visited as a tourist, I would have been disappointed to have paid my own money.

Our first impressions of the hotel were great, We were given a room facing the city and were impressed with the service on check in as our room was ready even though we arrived very early in the morning. No queues and prompt service. The room itself was large and very well equiped with an amazing view. The bedding was very comfortable and we did not hear any other guests on the rooms either side. The hotel is an experience in itself with the skypark and large array of shops just off the lobby area. The hotel obviously has some issues as you might expect with the sheer number of guests coming and going from the hotel. We saw a number of guests who were complaining about delays on check in/out but did not experience any problem ourselves. We did experience some long waits for the elevators on a couple of occasions and getting a taxi to and from the hotel can be difficult depending on the time of day. One cab driver told me that many of Singapore's cab drivers are starting to avoid the Hotel because of the delays. One thing we did not like was the high cost of food in the Cafes in the lobby ($80 each for a buffet meal.) Another annoyance was the noisy house-keeping staff. On both mornings of our stay when trying to rest all we could hear was the banging of doors on either side of us. It seems that the cleaners did not have keys for the rooms and so every time they go in or out of a room when cleaning the door bangs loudly shut on its lock without closing properly. This happened so many times that it became a major annoyance.

The good things will be - the excellent view of Singapore from the 49 storey, overlooking the Singapore River and the skyline, and the spaciousness of the rooms. N then comes the myraid of the bad.. I expected MBS being a new hotel to have all their hardware to be new and functioning. However, it obviously did not seem so. First thing, the TV cannot be switched on. After fiddling for a while, realized the wires behind the TV was loose, so adjusted it myself. Second, the air-con is existent, but has a mind of its own. It cannot be adjusted to a warmer temperature as the air-con controls keep moving back to a freezing cold temperature of 21 degrees. So, in the end, I decided to swich off the air-con because by then, I had already caught a cold. -sigh- Thirdly, the DND light panel was not working. We did not want to be woken up by housekeeping knockin on the door next morning, hence we called the hotel staff to ask if the panel can be repaired. Staff came, inspected it for awhile n said cannot be fixed, n will call for a technician the next day. So a hand-written \"Do no Disturb\" was scrawled on a piece of paper n slotted outside the door. I am surprised they do not even have a door hanger thing that says \"DND\"?! So, next day DND was there, but it seems that the repairman did not see the huge DND sign there n knocked on our door. Hotel staff did not bother to call us first to let us know the repairman is coming. Poor service standards.. I stayed at other 4,and 5 star hotels before, n smetimes when we requested for additional amenities from housekeeping n the DND sign is on, the staff will call us before knocking the door to let us know that they are outside our door with the amenities. But not this hotel, as they are too job-oriented and want to finish their job fast. N being such a huge hotel, they only provide bottled water on the check-in day. Requests for another bottled water will not be entertained, even tho' u are sick(like me, thanks to the air-con) and there are no supermarkets around MBS. The staff will helpfully says u may boil ur own water in the room. Wow, that's nice. Stayin at the club room entitles you to access the club lounge at the first floor - Fuze. It is just small area of about 6 tables.. I expected i to be more spacious since MBS is soooo huge. But no, only a small area is allocated to the so called \"exclusive club members\". Maybe it is so exclusive that, MBS purposely made the area so small then. The canape selection from 4-6pm is also pathetic, with only 2 hot selections, one selction of bite-sized pies, n 3 types of cheese, crackers, n veg sticks. Gosh, if I compare the canape selection of the lounge at MBS to Pan Pacific, then PP seems like a buffet spread. N staff was slow in replenishing the hot foods as both selections of hot foods were finished n guests were opening the covers to find nothing - surprise ~ The operations are still very raw with the staff not being sure what other departments are doing. Because of their lack of knowledge, and not double-checking with the other staff, we were charged 2 times for the room. The staff had charged the room to the credit card when we checked in. N we thought it was MBS way of doing the operations. However, when we checked out, the staff wanted to charge us again. We told them we received an sms from the bank saying it had been charged but the staff insisted that it was not charged yet from the hotel accouts and will be charged.. So, the card was swiped, and true enough, when we check our credit card, it was indeed charged 2 times.

I then rang room service again and complained as to why the room had not been properly checked before we were allowed to occupy it. they were apologetic and offered to give us a better room, so my poor inlaws had to quickly pack and move to a new room in their night clothes at midnight. it gets worse, the new room was not better - it was the same spec room but lower down. i made several calls to the concierge to log my complaint and asked for a gesture of good will as my father in law was not impressed by this first impression of singapore and this so called five star hotel who seem unable to carry out even basic room checks before allowing people to occupy the rooms but in the end no one from the front desk customer relations bothered to call us back and apologise or offer us some token to make us feel better. as for my wife and i, we had to call room service after having our room turned down as they hadnt even bothered to wash the tea cups and replace with new tea bags, or give us fresh bottles of water even though these were all standard complimentary items which should be replenished daily. so in all, a really sorry and unsatisfactory experience. the only plus point was the novelty of being able to have a swim on the roof, but to be honest this is not a five star hotel by a long chalk. i am not sure how long they can play on the novelty of the roof garden, as all the negative feedback builds up since there are so many well run truly 5 star hotels in singapore. the only way they are surviving right now is because singapore is booming.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA missed opportunity.

Advantages: - Amazing infinity pool and view from the 57th floor - Spectacular building - New - Did I mention the view? - Some of the staff TRY to be polite even if they aren't good at their jobs - Rooms look pretty good at first glance. - Rooms quite well sound-proofed! Disadvantages: - Built to a price - you can see if you look closely in the rooms that this could be better for this class of hotel. It is far from dreadful, but the details are missing - low pressure water in the rooms, the curtains don't close properly so if you are working strange hours you might be woken up by the light. Feels like they rushed it together, and with such a big project it's understandable (though not acceptable) that they couldn't do the detail of a smaller hotel. - One side of the hotel has balconies, but no seats? Probably just used as a nicotine station for smokers perhaps? Who knows - Service pretty shocking. It's not that they don't try, but they are just not on the ball. I had to move room 4 times! I had asked for a city view room and after an hour of waiting (with a reminder call to reception) in my room at 2am they moved me to one, sadly it stank of smoke (I'm not that sensitive, but trust me it was bad), then they moved me to a new room, but back to the wrong side again! Finally I ended up in a city view room (smelled of smoke again, but totally bearable so I stuck with it). God I'm sounding like a difficult customer here! - Staff hover a bit too long for extra tips. It was embarrassing with one bell-boy who offered to make me tea, show me my TV etc, when it was 2:30am and I'd just moved into my room. I just wanted to sleep! - Room service food is very average indeed, yet expensive. - You almost always have to call them twice for anything - e.g. Laundry collection. They are not outwardly rude, but they don't really understand customer service. Something's not right somehow. - They try to be like Las Vegas but it's clearly not. The service isn't there, and they try to be a bit stuffy with the celebrity restaurants, when in reality in America they are a bit more reasonable with allowing people in and accommodating peoples' needs. If they cut the \"exclusivity\" vibe a touch, it might happen more naturally rather than feeling so contrived. - Many of the staff don't speak English. Of course I wouldn't expect that in France, Germany, China etc but I thought that they would in Singapore? Conclusion: Only stay here if someone else is paying (as in my case). Even then, you can do much better in Singapore. That said, the infinity pool is truly spectacular. I'm not sure if you can buy access as a visitor, but if you can then stay elsewhere (there are plenty of great hotels in Singapore) and then visit for the pool & view, it is worth coming for that. It's the sort of place people will continue coming to because of the fact that the building really is a landmark. One final thing - there is the possibility that this hotel is having some MAJOR teething problems as it is new. Things MAY be different in 12months time under better management etc. Read the other reviews and I'm sure you'll get the picture. I'm sure the reviews will echo this if the hotel improves, but right now you really can do much better in Singapore.

The room had no drinks in the mini bar, and no water 4. We didn't get the papers whilst other rooms did 5. The taps were running brown water for the first hour 6. No hair dryer 7. The pool is so packed it reminded me of a public pool, on top of that tourists were freely walking around the pool area including skanky looking personnel taking photographs of the pool and the view, there was absolutely no privacy hence I wasn't comfortable to take a swim 8. Breakfast was a nightmare, the queues were so long that we got ushered to an alternative breakfast venue at the convention centre. The queue there was even longer than at the hotel and it was possibly about a 15 minute walk. Food was mediocre. 9. As breakfast too longer than expected due to the queues and delays. Hence we got back to the room at 11 am which was check out time. I called for late check out and was told that it was not possible. I had to become nasty before I was given an hour's grace. On top of that, when I called the operator the first time to be put to reservations for the late checkout, I was put on hold for 3 mins and when i was finally put through, it was an invalid number. We were considering the Fullerton and we shouldn't have given Marina Sands a chance, it was such an utterly disappointing experience that I will never visit it again. I met a friend at the bar at 5.30 pm and she angrily told me that she was still waiting for her room. Absolutely horrifying. I passed a letter of feedback to the General Manager and left my email.

Getting through the reservations hotline to a human voice, however, was a task nigh impossible. As something had come up and we had to postpone our stay for a week, I called to request for the postponement. The automated answer system assured me that my call would be \u201cattended to in approximately 3 minutes.\u201d This is a lie. I waited 15 min before the system hung up on me. I tried this 5 times before giving up and driving to the Sands to sort it out in person. Check-in The website and booking confirmation stated to go to the lobby at Tower 1 for check-in. When we got there, there was a long queue at the main desk. However, there were guest relations staff who actively channelled guests away from the queue and toward other counters that they opened up in the other towers to deal with the crowds. We managed to get ourselves checked in within 40min. It turned out that they didn\u2019t have any more of the Horizon Grand rooms we had requested for (high floor, city-facing), so they gave us an upgrade to an Orchid Suite on the 4th flr (\u201cgarden\u201d-facing). Currently, the garden is still a dustbowl and at such a low floor, you only get to see the expressway. The traffic noise is quite noticeable, but I wasn\u2019t personally affected by it as it was just like white/background noise. Room The room was reasonably large, though not as large as some other suites I\u2019ve seen. The bathroom, on the other hand, was huge! There was lots of room for a shower stall, bathtub, toilet, 2 sinks\u2026with more left over for swanning around in. Very good for people who like to take eons in the bathroom primping for a night out on the town or theatre. Oh, the large TV is located in the centre of the room and can be swivelled round such that you can watch TV from the bed, the sofa, AND the bathtub, should you so wish. That was cool. The bed is asian king size, not the huge king size ones like you get in the US. It was nevertheless comfy. The suite came with a Nespresso machine, which was much appreciated. We had to call concierge to refill the Nespresso bullets though, as somehow housekeeping had neglected to do this before we checked in. Speaking of housekeeping, there were some minor quibbles: the bathtub had some black grit in it, and the shower stall had some clumped hair on the floor, there were only 2 towels and no towel racks, but otherwise nothing major. For a 5-star hotel, this should not be the case, but I understand that they are still getting the hang of things so we should expect them to improve with time. One gripe we had with the service was that we requested for ice 3 times over the course of the evening and night, but no ice appeared. At all. On the third time, we asked why there was no ice. The reply was that they had run out of ice (?!?!). On further probing, it turned out that they had run out of ice buckets, because if you ordered a vodka cranberry from the bar, it came with ice. So we told them to just bring us 2 glasses with ice, no need for the bucket. We waited\u2026 No ice came. We gave up. Pool This was the reason for the visit, and boy was it worth it. At a height of 57 storeys, you better bring a sunblock with SPF >50 cos you\u2019re going to soak up some serious rays. We caught the NDP fighter jet formations preview from the pool. Very cool. The helicopters were so close, we could see the textures on the wheels. But back to the infinity pool\u2026 it\u2019s something you need to experience; words just don\u2019t do it justice. Yes there were screaming kids, and yes there were snot bits floating around in the water, but man, the panoramic view of Singapore from that high up just can\u2019t be beat. Breakfast at Rise Buffet brekkie for 2 was included in the package. It was very good quality and variety was above average for a breakfast buffet. There were freshly made omelets, a small selection of dim sum, variety of salads, congee with all kinds of toppings, the usual cooked breakfast foods (eg. sausages, pancakes, etc\u2026), different types of cereal, many flavours of jam/preserves, too many types of breads and pastries that there was no way one person could sample everything. Juices are plentiful and you could even take a paper cup of juice or coffee to go. Highly recommend you get there by 8.45am; once 9am rolls around, a queue of hungry hotel guests quickly starts to form outside the restaurant and believe me, you want to be on the happy end of that queue. Conclusion For the price we paid (based on the Horizon Grand room ~$500), the experience was pretty good. But if I had paid the actual price of the Suite (~$800), I would have been disappointed with what I got. For this kind of price, I would have expected service to match.

I chose the hotel because of its location and convenience, plus the fact that it offers plenty of activities to do from dining, shopping, gambling and gazing over the SkyPark\u2019s Observatory Deck. I had read the reviews from Tripadvisor and I was a bit worried because of the negative reviews; but was I proven wrong! From the moment we checked-in, the receptionist was very warm and friendly. Everything went by in a breeze and we soon found ourselves in one of the higher floors with a spectacular view of the city \u2013 exactly what I requested for. I was so pleased that they were able to accommodate my request and my partner was absolutely enthralled with the view\u2026and that\u2019s just from our room! The room itself (Horizon Grand Room) was huge! We were thrilled to see the curtains automatically opening up and revealing our breath-taking view of the city whenever we slot the card in its designated place. The furnishing were not over-bearing; it was simple and yet elegant with a modern touch. We loved the many, many mirrors! It was situated in such a way that we didn\u2019t realize how many mirrors were placed the 1st time we came in. It made the already spacious room seem more spacious! The sheets smelled good and it was apparent that Marina Bay Sands did not spare any expenses to make their beds hard to resist and hard to leave. The down was genuine, the sheets were silky, the quilt was wonderful to the touch and the pillows were all so very comfortable. It was exactly what one would expect from a luxury hotel such as MBS. We also loved the bathroom! I believe this is the 1st time I have ever seen a his and hers separate sinks. The amenities were complete and the soaps smell really good! Not to mention that on top of the bathtub that they have provided, the bathroom comes with a separate toilet and shower. The shower itself is once more very large and spacious, there\u2019s even a corner where you can actually sit down and let the steam from the hot shower refresh you. No doubt about it, this is one of the most gorgeous and generous rooms I have ever been to. The SkyPark is also something I cannot fail to comment on: The view is the best! Singapore is a city of lights and towering buildings \u2013 the SkyPark\u2019s view was so breath-taking I literally forgot to breathe! And the pool\u2026wow! The lights underneath it made the pool so beautiful and romantic and the fact that it\u2019s an infinity pool gave literal sense to the term: \u201cbeing on the edge of the world\u201d. One negative I have to say is that the place is really crowded, it\u2019s open for public and for a hotel guest it kind of gives the impression of feeling exposed to the world. The pool should be for hotel guests alone but we found numerous loop holes whereby outsiders can easily come in the pool area as well. Another thing is that for MBS to promote a \u201cSkyPark Package\u201d; they should at least have staff on stand-by for those who actually availed of the package. No one offered us the complimentary glass of wine nor did we find assistance from any staff to take us for the 1-time photo experience . We ended up empty handed as well, without any Souvenir Cups. MBS should have ensured that all guests who availed of this promotion get to enjoy what it had to offer. It was just too bad that didn\u2019t happen \u2013 it would be hard to track down hotel guests when the place is bustling with so many outsiders as well. Still, the view pretty much made up for that but I hope in the future they can improve on the SkyPark\u2019s operations. We were able to dine in buffet-style at the Rise and the food is also very good! However, the breakfast at the Rise was very crowded, we had to queue up and wait to be seated for about 20 minutes. I guess since it\u2019s a new hotel they don\u2019t have that much dining areas for all their guests. In the future I hope to see more choices and less waiting time. The Shoppes At Marina Bay Sands were mostly open \u2018til very, very late but the presentation of the building and the fountain was quite tacky. They even tried to mimick the indoor gonodola which is very famous in The Venetian but it ended up only as a poor adaptation of the original. The casino was crowded, much to my surprise. The 1st floor is the only smoking area and because the ceilings were low you can really smell the stench of smoke everywhere. The people they actually let in the casino were a bit under-dressed and some were even spitting on the ash trays. Kind of grossed me out there; but, it is a casino and the atmosphere was very inviting so we ended up gambling for a couple of hours. The staff were a mix of different races and may I point out: how Singaporeans talk may seem quite staight and the tones are hard but it doesn\u2019t mean they are being impolite. All the locals who have served us were fantastic and very friendly. I think this is something foreigners must note lest they get any negative impression with MBS staff and service. They were also kind enough to allow us a late check-out, without so much as a hassle nor an explanation why we needed one. All-in-all, I would say that I made the pefect choice to book with MBS.

I had been in Singapore numerous times in 2009 and 2010 and had been constantly hearing about it from the locals. It is truly a stunning architectural creation, one that single handedly redefined the Singaporean skyline. The hotel is composed of three towers, 57 floors each. I stayed at tower 3, which is a good five minute walk from the reception. Contrary to other reviewers, my check in went well and I was upgraded to a top floor with city view. They have little pimped out golf carts to ferry guests to the towers, but they didn't work at the time I checked in. The elevators in tower 3 were outright filthy, still being dusty from all the construction. I even complained about it, but besides an embarrassed look by the hotel employee, nothing was done. I chalked this up to the hotel still being new. The room itself was large and spacious with minimalist decor. The windows were large, ceiling to floor, and offered a truly magnificent view of the city. However, the room was awkwardly set up; the bed was off in one side and the desk was diagonally opposite to it. And that was it. No other furniture, no decorations, just dead space. Frankly, the room would have been much nicer had it been smaller! The bathroom was quite nice, even though the hot water did not work for two days during my stay. Again, I complained, and the second time something was done about it. As all persons interested in the hotel know by now, there is an infinity pool at the top, the largest one at that height in the world. The pool is really breathtaking and a visit is almost worth it just to visit the pool. The pool is only open to guests and not to their visitors. Ridiculous, if you ask me, but the reasoning given at the time was that the hotel was brand new and there was great interest in seeing it. I accept that, but I felt unwanted as I was asked to show my card at the elevator at the ground floor, upon entering the sky park area (top of the hotel), and numerous times inside the area! Not the best way to make you feel wanted. At the time of my stay, there was only one bar open in the sky park, which constantly ran out of beer. All drinks were served in plastic cups and they also had a very small selection of snacks. Again, not the end of the world, but I would have expected something classier. I must say, however, that there was a restaurant and maybe even a bar under construction. The breakfast area is far too small for a hotel that size, and you could easily find a lengthy wait. However, there is the possibility to have breakfast at the bar in tower 2. The selection for a hotel this class is not excellent, but by no means poor. The hotel has a shopping mall and casino across the street. The shopping mall is the most ridiculously high-end mall I've ever seen; in all my travels in Europe, North America and Asia, I have never seen so expensive items on sale. They have *boutiques* of high-end watchmakers Breguet, Vacheron Constantin, Patek Philippe, along with the more pedestrian Rolex, Omega, and IWC. Very nice eye candy for a WIS. There are also world-class restaurants; we took our clients to Guy Savoy, who has 3-star Michelin restaurants in Vegas and Paris! Of course, we paid accordingly. I had a bottled beer and some french fries at the bar next to the reception. Apart from having paid 45SGD, they took forever to arrive (who knew a bottle of beer was so hard to fetch?) as did the bill. There was also utter confusion when I asked to put it on my hotel bill. Another complain I had is the parking area in the front; it is far too small, and they did not have a place where our rep could drop us off. We always stopped at the valet area and always had some guy complaining. A tip for checking in and out: there are counters in towers 2 and 3 that can handle that. During my stay, they were never crowded and always manned. Where the hotel fails is in its execution of customer service. Guests are constantly asked if they're guests, waits for any services are lengthy, and generally there is a lack of a personal touch that is obligatory for this price category. The problems of the hotel are not really structural, although there is some of that, and could easily be remedied by better management and staff training. I had hoped my bad experiences were due to growing pains of the hotel, and I am sad to see that there has not been any significant improvement since.

As the hotel is new, everything in our spacious room was clean and sparkly, which was nice. However, some parts of it were not very well thought out - minor inconveniences such as the fact that the hair dryer can't be used in the bathroom and the toilet flush is inconveniently difficult to reach. The best part of the hotel for me was the pool which was uber cool with the best views in Singapore (and mind you, I'm Singaporean...). However it was also super super crowded with many camera touting look-see-ers, which reduced the hip vibe for me substantially. It is a nightmare getting into the hotel by car - everyone and their vehicle is squeezed into a relatively tiny driveway and is forced to valet park because the car park is a distance away.

However, my overall experience was more positive than expected, and I wondered if previous guests had overly high expectations of a hotel that is after all, newly opened and is not 100% completed. Surely some allowance should be given to a hotel that is still ironing out its teething problems? Parking was a pain. I understand that only the carpark beside the casino is available at this point, since the other is still under renovation. The signs to the carpark that was not opened was displayed - misleadingly so. We had to u-turn twice and ended up having to ask the valet parking staff about it - wasted half an hour on this. The queue to the only carpark was supremely long, so we gave up and opted for valet parking at SGD15/night for hotel guests instead. Considering their high parking charges, I guess this could be considered reasonable. My mother-in-law checked in the room before we arrived, so I can\u2019t comment much on that. There were no complains, so it should have been a smooth process. Our room was on the 44th floor in Tower 1 (where the main entrance is), and that was a Horizon Grand room - 2 queen sized beds in a pretty big room, and has a big bathroom and great city view. That evening, my mother-in-law brought us to view the Atrium Deluxe room in Tower 2 which her friends took for the same night, so that we can see the difference between both rooms. The beds are smaller of course, and same goes for the room. It does however, come with a balcony which overlooks the East Coast Expressway (ECP) since it was on the 12th floor. The bathroom is also smaller, but is still considered quite big for a standard room. It would have been better if the shower area is also separated from the bathtub. As for the SkyPark, there\u2019s generally good views of the city and our port on the other side, but it will definitely be nicer once all the construction projects are completed. Hotel guests get complimentary access to the SkyPark - 2 guests per room keycard. We found out later that as guests staying in a Horizon Grand room, you are allowed to bring in more guests to the SkyPark and the infinity outdoor pool. There were 5 of us going in with 1 keycard at one point. Most of the time, we were allowed to pass through the check points just by showing the card, whereas most guests had to get their cards scanned. Twice, we saw some guests having trouble getting their cards scanned, but the issue seemed to be rectified pretty fast. The 1.2m deep, 150m world\u2019s largest outdoor infinity swimming pool (at this height that is) is on the 57th floor. I must admit the visual effect of water extending to the edge is really quite cool. There were also jacuzzi situated on the other side overlooking the sea and port. There were a few that were not working though. There were many people in the pool and jacuzzi, but were by no means overcrowded. Do note that pool access is restricted to hotel guests only. Towels are provided. For photography buffs, please note that tripods are generally not allowed. I heard that small and light ones may be permitted, but I didn't see any in use. I carried a monopod and was not stopped. Prams are also generally not allowed. We did see one, and overheard that only hotel guests are permitted to have them. SkyPark access hours are from 7am to 10pm only. Overall, it was a pleasant stay, and we didn\u2019t encounter any bad service reported by reviewers on Tripadvisor. The housekeeping staff were quite polite when we encountered them twice. The rooms are nice and comfortable, but I did expect better decor. Our Horizon Grand room however, did not come with a bar fridge, which surprised both us and the reception when we enquired about it. Pillows are too soft, or should I say flat? A pillow selection menu would have been a nice touch.

We arrived early and spent no more than 5 minutes in the queue to see a receptionist. The lady on the desk was very helpful and found us a higher floor than the one we'd been allocated, with a city view. We were also upgraded to a standard Atrium Suite room (without me even having to say the word 'honeymoon') and told that the room was ready immediately - almost an hour before check in time. Everyone was polite and helpful and made us feel so welcome. The room itself was amazing and had a floor to ceiling window to view the city from. We were in tower two, and the lobby is in tower one, but its no distance - I have no idea what people are complaining about regarding distance of the rooms from the lobby - there are clearly three towers in this hotel so you have a 1 in 3 chance only of getting a room near the lobby...

The parking is highly expensive and its very troublesome to when you wanna get out of the hotel, as we wouldn't be promised the same parking lot if we had to leave the hotel for a while, thus we had to walk from the casino side though we paid $15 for the whole day.

I stared blankly at the guy behind the check in counter for a few seconds and after an awkward silence, I replied \"I informed your hotel in advance that I would arrive at 8am and was assured that the room would be ready. What do you expect me to do now?\" The young guy replied without emotion \"All our rooms are fully booked. There is no room available now.\" After being on a plane overnight, I was tired, hungry, hot and sticky. I could NOT believe that this brand new 5-star \"world class\" hotel which was supposed to offer \"out of this world experiences\" to its guests would have such poorly trained staff with such poor service attitudes. My partner tried to help the guy by suggesting that he call us when the room was available and the guy agreed and took down our number. We made our way to the nearby Fusion Cafe for breakfast. Despite being hungry and thirsty after a long flight, the food was horrible. The omelette was only 2-fingers wide after it was rolled up and placed on my plate and I could just about count 5 mini-cubes of mushroom that the chef put into into my mushroom omelette. The french toast and dim sum were cold and rubbery. The coffee was burnt. And to top it off, after we finished at about 10am, we still had not received any call about our room. We walked back to the check in counter to enquire on the room and were told \"There are no rooms available. Nobody has checked out yet as check out time is 11am.\" I looked at the line of people queueing to check out and asked again \"Are you sure nobody is checking out yet???\" The reply was \"Some people are checking out but their rooms are not made up yet.\" Again, my partner calmly requested that they inform Housekeeping to expedite cleaning up our room and call us when it was ready. We then went to the SkyPark to take a look at this much-talked-about feature. It was an utter disappointment. The cushions on the deck chairs were stained and dirty. The pool was overcrowded. There were fallen leaves all over the floor; evidently nobody bothered to sweep and keep the area clean. There was one miserable bar there with only 1 table and it was stated \"Hotel Guests Only\", which meant that we couldn't even sit there for a drink because we hadn't checked in yet. At about 11am, we still had not received any call about our room so we went back down to the check in counter to ask. Again we were told (with an impatient tone) that the room was not ready yet and if it's ready, they would call us. I was seething at this point because I was exhausted and fed up with the unempathetic response of this hotel's staff. It almost felt as if they felt that I was disturbing them non-stop. I repeated again that I was told by THEIR hotel staff that my room would be ready when I arrived 3 hours ago but have been kept waiting without any apology or gesture to make things more bearable. I had once stayed at Mandarin Oriental and they did not have a room for me when I arrived, and after apologising, they immediately offered me a complimentary spa treatment so that I could \"freshen up\". At MBS however, the response I received was \"We only have one room at 7th floor.\" I replied \"No. My reservation is for a room on the upper-levels.\" The lady behind the counter breathed out a sigh as if to say \"You're so troublesome\" and then clicked away at the computer before saying \"I have another room on 9th floor. Is that ok?\" I blinked at her and was truly at a loss for words! My partner, who has been very calm and patient so far, asked her \"What does your hotel consider as Upper-Level floors?\" Then she replied \"Above level 22 is upper level\". We looked at her and said \"So 9th floor is NOT upper level right?\" In the end, we had to wait AGAIN. We went to the casino and retail section to see what it looked like. The whole retail strip was dusty and dark, and the bathrooms had poor lighting and smelled of urine. The store assistant at the Apple shop was rude and arrogant - he didn't even bother to look at us when he talked to us! Finally at 12 noon, we still had not received any phonecall and we were convinced there HAD to be rooms available by now! We went back to the check in counter and the entire lobby was swarming with people making beelines to check in / check out and there was another looooong queue at the taxi stand outside. We went up to the counter and asked about our room, producing our passports again for the 3rd time. The lady asked \"Anybody call you to say your room is ready?\" I replied \"No. I have not received ANY call but I'm very sure there are rooms available given the long queue of people checking out or who have already checked out and are queueing for a cab.\" Without emotion, she clicked away at her computer and finally said \"The room is ready.\" Whilst I was totally pissed off that there was no word of apology nor had anyone called us earlier, I was more relieved to finally have a room that I just took the keys and went up. In the room, there was no bottled water, fruit nor flowers (which I thought would be standard at any 5-star hotel in Singapore). The bedroom slippers were too small for my partner's feet (and he's just a size 8!) and after I got out of the shower, I realized that I could not blow-dry my hair in the bathroom. The only wall sockets in the bathroom were two-pin sockets but the hairdryer was a 3-pin plug. In the end, I had to dry my hair beside the bed, standing by the wall. The internet connection was slow and patchy so I gave up trying to check my email after half an hour of connecting and re-connecting. Before we made our way out for a late lunch, I turned on the \"Please Make Up Room\" light so that the housekeeping could give us a turn-down service before we got back at night. When we arrived back at the hotel at 2am, the room was not made and so we had to re-use the damp towels from the afternoon (there were only 2 towels in the room). My partner had to work that night and wanted to turn off the lights except for the desk so that I could rest, but it turns out that the one switch to turn on the lights, turns on ALL the lights and also turns off ALL the lights at the same click. So in the end, I had to sleep with my head under the blanket. The next day, we decided to check out using the Express Check Out facility to avoid the long queue. We left our luggage at the Baggage Counter and went out for lunch with family. When we returned in a cab to pick up our luggage, we were told by one traffic marshall to wait at the side further up and they would bring our bags to us. But just as the cab driver was parking at the side, we heard a series of loud slams on the trunk. There was another guy, likely the valet guy, slamming on the cab's trunk and screaming \"Eh you cannot park here!\" The cab driver wound down his window and told the guy that we were instructed to wait at the side for our bags, which would only take 1-2 minutes at most. The guy shouted back \"No no no! You cannot park here! You go outside and wait!\" At this point, I wound down my window and told him \"I am a guest here and I'm just waiting for my bags. We were told to wait here by the traffic marshall.\" He shouted again \"Cannot cannot! Want to wait, go outside wait and U-turn come back!\" I couldn't tolerate it any further and blurted out \"Your hotel has VERY POOR service and bad attitude!\" The guy seemed a little shocked and then said in a lower tone \"Go outside and U-turn come back. Thank you ah..\" I was really at a loss of words. Did he think that by adding the \"Thank you ah\" at the end made him polite?? All in all, my trip home was totally RUINED by this horrible hotel and poorly trained staff. The hotel building itself was spanking new but the quality was BAD. It was so obvious that the construction was a rush job and the detailing was poorly finished. I daresay that the hotels in China have even better quality finishing than MBS! The whole hotel just reeked of \"cheap\" from the dodgy lighting to the distasteful carpet and mid-range brands of equipment used in the rooms. Perhaps they were in a rush to complete on schedule and were trying to cut costs due to the over-budget from earlier years (when sand prices went up in Singapore). It was really such a disgrace. I have never felt more embarrassed to be a Singaporean, knowing that tourists who come to my country and stay at this hotel would have such a nasty experience. To all those who visited Singapore and had unfortunately stayed at MBS, I offer my sincere apologies and hope that you would visit my country again in future, but yes, please stay at another hotel. Any other hotel would be better. To the management of MBS, I hope you are reading this and will do something about your staff and the facilities of the hotel. On hindsight now, I wish the IR bid was won by the Keppel Land/Harrah's Entertainment group instead. They would have done a better job on both the construction and operation aspects for sure... because it just can't get any worse than it is now at MBS.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai", "Title": "\u201cThis is not the Singapore you know or have heard about\u201d", "Author": "Asiaexpat41", "ReviewID": "UR75375363", "Content": "I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a business meeting.

Lots of people standing around but no one knows anything or does anything. Honestly, I am not sure why they have all these people hired. There are 3 people checking keys to make sure you only go to the elevator if you are a guest but ask a question and no one can help. The hotel is not finished yet - no signs in the elevators telling what is on a particular floor. The fitness center is in a temporary home in the hospitality lounges and only opens at 6:30 am. When asked why we could not get in earlier they said there is just no way. Made no sense at all - the casino is open 24 hours - I don't need an attendant to work out - just open it - it is not near any hotel rooms, no one will be bothered. The one nice thing is the pool - again, if you can put on your headphones and drown out the multitudes of people. The views from the top are stunning. Pay your 20 SGD and go see it - avoid the hotel. The breakfast, if not included in your room, is 48 SGD and there is no deviation, even if you just want a piece of toast. The location - you are far from everything. There is not even a convenience store close. When you only get 2 bottles of water and a Coke is 8 SGD, you need a convenience store. On the first morning, I went to take a shower and the water was freezing cold. It would not get warm. I complained and they eventually sent someone to \"fix\" it. It was a warm shower for the rest of my stay - not a hot one. The rooms are average - there is nothing spectacular about them. The beds are not comfortable. It is really a basic layout with no character at all. I had a seaview so that was nice but that was about it. Housekeeping - not sure what they did in the room each day - they did not vaccuum, did not straighten anything - I guess I am lucky the bed was made. They also do not offer enough towels. When I was checking out, I called for a porter and was told it would be 45 minutes. Well, no time for that, so I lugged my bags down and even when I got to the first floor, no one helped. If I had been at the Shangri La or the Four Seasons, I would have had people clamoring to help. I then had to wait 45 minutes to check out. They said I could use express checkout but I did not trust them enough to get the bill correct.

We had an unforgettable experience, in the wrong way with all the wrong reasons. YES!! it was my fault cause i failed to read the reviews here before booking :-( and all the wrong reasons are as follow; 1) If you drive, I would advise not to, normal parking charges SGD$28 for a day and their valet SGD $15 for 24 hours with a disclaimer, 'if the hotel valet is full you will be redirected to self park at elsewhere which is not very nearby the hotel or another stupid valet park over at the casino side\" EVEN if you are staying in the hotel, priority would not be given to you. EPIC failures. 2)Checking in and out takes approximately 45mins, checking in was slightly longer and I did not check in at the peak hour of 3pm, I did it at 5.30pm and eventually got my keys at 6.15pm, i checked out at 11am started queueing and got it done only at close to 11.25am. Service failures. Oh they have the express check out system with a liner in it stating that you authorize them to deduct whatever you have spent on the credit card you checked in with, \"would you take this risk\"? I didn't. 3) There is no communications between their \"priority service thru the room phone\", the guest services at the registration counters and their valet guys, the system failed totally. As i was forced out of the hotel car park by the valets, I was supposed to be parking with the casino valet, not knowing the way there, I asked 1 of the valet from the hotel side, sadly he gave me the wrong directions. I ended up self parking in the south car park which was exceptionally far from where i stayed and you now have to pay for the parking bcos it wasn't free. So all in all I paid for the valet and now i have to pay for the self parking in their car parks. which means $15+ $28 just for parking. I wasn't pleased, I wanted them to rectify this matter because all thanks to their chaos i ended up in the wrong car park. I called their \"Priority sevices\" thru my room phone told them the whole incident, they said no problem approach the front desk registration counter they can help, i went down repeated the whole story to the front desk guys they say maybe the phone services didn't know that they couldn't and I have to approach the valet guys, Okie the thing is i stayed in tower 3 and the valet was in tower 1, make a guess of how long you have to walk from one end to the other and then repeating the story once again to the valets. Due the the valets not giving the priority to hotel guests, and directing me to the wrong place, my wife and I missed the night scene from the skypark. It took almost 1 1/2 hours to get my car parked when i reach at 9pm. Consolation was the valet unwillingly asked me to fill up my details on a record sheet and gave me a complimentary parking ticket. All was ruin and the ticket didn't helped much. 4)Room was spacious but was very dirty given the pedigree of this hotel, I had stained armchairs, potato chips crumbs all over the carpet and strands of hair on the bath towel. The view from my room was facing the city and i have to say it is breath taking but that's all you can take away from the dirty 5* room. If you asked me, you can stay there if you have SGD$550/night to burn with high level of tolerance and you must love sufferings. The chaotic mayhem would spoil all the happy mood that you have initially arrived with. There are plenty of hotels in the vicinity of the same value with miles better quality.

We arrived at the hotel at 12.30pm and there was already a long queue forming. It took us an hour to get to the registration desk and we were informed that our room was being cleaned, and that we will receive a phone call on my mobile once the room was cleaned. We were provided refreshment vouchers at the Bayview Lounge located at the convention centre across the hotel, which was probably a modus operandi of the hotel to hopefully distract guests from the check in delays. After waiting close to 2 hours and having received no call from the hotel, we decided to walk back to the hotel to check the status of our room. After waiting in another queue for key collection for another 30 minutes, the first thing the counter staff asked was if we had received a phone call. In other words, don't bother me if no one had called me. True enough, the response was that our room was still being cleaned and we were advised to go to the Bayview lounge or the shops. That was already close to 4pm, 3 hours since we were told the room was being cleaned. We had no recourse but to stand around and wait. Mind you, this hotel does not have any seating at all in the lobby. The scene is just a pool of people standing around and you get the feeling that you are at an exhibition hall. While waiting, we could not help but overhear the conversations going around - angry guests disappointed that hotel had misled them into thinking they were booked into city facing only to be told otherwise, disappointment with bedding arrangement in the room, inexperienced staff not able to handle queries - the list goes on. No one could quite comprehend how a hotel like this and under Sands Management could fail to deliver on customer service by such a wide margin. Granted the hotel was running at full occupancy, however you would have expected that the management would have stacked the right resources and planning against the anticipated demand as this information would have been privy to them way in advance. They obviously have not got their act together, or simply do not care. We were finally given a room close to 6pm, and that was only after \"begging\" the hotel to just hand us the key to an uncleaned room as my 2 young kids were totally exhausted standing around. Even this took a while convincing the hotel staff to release the key as up to that moment, they checked the system and said the room was not ready. When we got to the room, however, it had been cleaned. By that time, I was livid but kept my calm and told myself to just enjoy the rest of our stay and that nothing else should go wrong. How wrong can one get! 1. We booked a rollaway bed during reservations - it was not in the room. Was told sorry they cannot provide as hotel was running full occupancy and there was no more available. 2. We asked for an extra pillow and blanket - was told the same 3. Our friend who checked in same day as us called room service at 5pm to send some cutlery to his room as they were dining in. He got a knock on his door at 11pm - the staff had finally made it to deliver the cutlery - 6 hours later ! Wonder why they even bothered. 4. Hotel confirmed late checkout till 6pm for us. We were not able to get into our room after swimming at 12.30pm. Had to go downstairs to reactivate the key card and had to wait for the slow elevator and queue all over again. 5. No newspapers provided, which we have come to expect as a given having stayed in so many hotels. Amenities in the bathroom were limited - one set and that's it. We booked as 2 adults and 2 children. Bathroom only had 2 bath towels. 6. Instead of bottled water already placed in the guestroom, hotel staff came to deliver 2 bottles of water in the room and those were the only ration we got throughout the stay. 7. Be careful of the minibar. Any item removed for more than 30 seconds would trigger a debit against your room account as having consumed that item. As the minibar was stacked to the fullest, our friend who had bought a pack of milk for his toddler asked the staff if some items could be temporarily removed to accommodate the milk - was told he would be charged $20 for this service. This is utterly ridiculous! Marina Bay Sands had clearly not placed emphasis on wowing customers with positive customer experience. This will be our first and last time staying at this hotel. Architecturally, the hotel is superb from the exterior and boasts a fine skyline for Singapore .

Boy were we so wrong! My partner was so nice as to book a stay at the marina bay sands during national day on 9th august 2010 and also to coincide with my bday on 8th august. She booked the hotel on May 12th 2010, hotel just opened end of april 2010 by the way and she made a kind request that the rooms faced the padang where the fireworks were to be held and the view was cofirmed via email, only thing that wasnt confirmed was the high floors which was subjected to availability, which was fair enough. So the day came and we were excited, we knew that the place would be massively packed with ppl and took it in our stride, we got there early at 12pm and check in was surprisingly smooth, we were at tower 3 by the way. We waited for about 5-10 mins to check in and the lady told us were situated on room 3221. We assumed that we were already given the view of the fireworks but when we opened the door, we were facing the opposite side! So of course, we went downstairs and asked them if they had made a mistake and thank goodness we had that email on the phone and we talked to the manager by the name of Mr Jason Chan. He attended to us and he said that the city view rooms were all booked. We showed him the email specifically stating that the city view rooms were promised, just not on which floors. And here comes the crunch, he just said, sorry it was full and we cant do anything about it, and in addition the person that we communiated with a few months back regarding the view was Mr Mohammad Mahatir of customer guest realtions, Mr Jason Chan said that well, if i was in his shoes, i would have never have promised that. To me i thought that was suicidal customer service. I guess that was when we got very angry and he then gave us a discount on the rooms, charged us standard rates and gave us free breakfast coupons and a late checkout. Me and my partner were just wondering, why couldnt have they just told us simply the city view rooms werent available way in advance and we could have gone elsewhere since we booked it in the month of May! And in addition, how could they charge us a premium city view but gave us the seaview instead! That was very disturbing and i think the entire staff at marina bay sands needs overhaul. So once that was settled, we thought we had to make the best of it since we were already there and we wanted to go to the skypark to catch the views. We expected it to be packed but the skypark ended up like a public pool on a weekend. The marina bay sands obviously didnt know how to handle the masses for this sort of event has they had revenue on their minds and just booked the place 100% solid. Everywhere we went within the building or in the elevators, ppl were just saying, this is ridiculous, this is unbelievable, waiting for elevators for 30 mins just to get up, obviously crowd control is a major issue on big events. Why book the place 100% solid where 70% of the ppl are unhappy when you can make the place 70% full and have 100% ppl in there happy? I aint sure which is a better alternative but the latter sounds much better. In addition, by allowing non hotel guests into the pool area where its already packed with hotel guests is pretty dumb as they should have just allowed the non hotel guests at the skypark area on the other end and just have the area cordoned off foor us, i mean, they pay $20 and get to see what we see as well? And we paid $500 per nite for it. Now for the other stuff within the room, i thought when i read the heater issues, i thought it was funny, me and my partner just laughed, but to our disbelief, the heater in our rooms werent working either, not sure if this was a form of retribution quite frankly, but basic ammenities not working are just unacceptable in my opinion for the price that the hotel is asking for. All in all, facilities wise, its gorgeous, the pool is stunning, but it takes so much more than that to make this hotel a wonderful one. The service here is terrible to say the least, they obviously cannot manage the huge crowds expected during National Day and coming from an Integrated Resort that boasts on attracting up to 100,000 visitors a day, its appaling and just overpromises and under delivers by a massive mile. Me and my partner will definitely not stay here again, i think the biggest disappointment was on my partner's expression where she took great pains and effort to plan this day for my bday and everything just went downhill because the place was full, EVEN though we had a written confirmation of the city view, thats pathetic and I hope Marina Bay Sands will improve themselves for their future guests as we will definitely not be part of it next time. By the way, Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carlton, service is impeccable and the price is the same or slightly cheaper than the marina bay sands and on top of that, breakfast is included and valet service is free for hotel guests, as compared to us paying close to $30 for valet, completely extraordinary!

From the moment we arrived it was like they were going out of their way to make our stay unpleasant. The valet (no self park), service was overwhelmed so we sat in the car, fighting the taxis for somewhere to wait. The bellmen managed to lose our bags for over an hour somewhere between the front door & check in. The girls at the counter were clearly out of their depth, even with 3 of them trying to check us in they messed up our reservation and sent us home again for our passports when it turns out we didn't need them. Finally, back at the hotel, the room was a good size and the city view is nice, but it's really dark so I spent the stay searching for more lights so I could see the bottom of my suitcase. Waiting for ice for almost an hour felt like forever as the TV system is really limited, the music part doesn't work at all, the wifi was down and there is no ipad dock. The silence was deafening until we heard other guests shouting in the hall. Sick of all the waiting, we gave up on the champagne in the room idea and tried to make the best of things. We headed up to the much vaunted Sky Park looking for a nice romantic spot to enjoy the sunset. No chance there, it was completely over-run with people, (less than 10% of the rooms were occupied so imagine how bad it will be with a few conferences in town). Turns out they were letting the Sky Park experience tourists in to the pool area, so there were hoards of camera toting people in shorts standing around shouting at each other. Understaffed and utterly unorganised, the food menu consists of BBQ crisps, Twisties and some cold wraps, clearly the F&B up there isn't finshed, but seriously Twisties as 1/3 of the menu options at a 5 star hotel?!?!? There was no music here either and the romance was fading faster than the light. We then went to dinner at one of the new \"celebrity chef\" restaurants, (they are actually named this on the directional signage). This was a very poor shadow of it's sister restaurants worldwide & desperately needs some TLC from the man himself if it has any chance of surviving. To call it expensive is an understatement, but you are supposed to be paying for a Michelin Star experience; sadly it isn't even close to that at the moment. Breakfast the next morning was the usual hotel buffet restaurant, but with 20 times the usual amount of tables and just one toaster and one egg station to service everyone. We gave up on the queues & found some average pastries. This is going to be disaster zone when conferences are on, so if you stay here on business be sure to get to breakfast at the crack of dawn, better still stay somewhere else & take a cab to the convention centre. Staff materialised and we were presented the check without asking for it, so took this as a firm hint that our 20mins of occupying the table was all the time we were getting. Due to our earlier adventure, we didn't even bother trying to get help with our luggage from the room, but had to schlep it half a kilometre (no exaggeration the hotel foyer is huge), from tower 3 where we were staying, to tower 1 where the valet is to get our car back. Of course there is no valet pick up at the tower 3 entrance, that would be too logical and you would miss out on the cold feeling of final frustration as you sweat waiting, and waiting, for your car at the opposite end of the hotel.

For me, I occasionally bring my kids (2 & 4y.o.) out for a single day weekend 'staycation' so my tolerance of imperfection is far higher than those on an expensive vacation trip. For whatever reason that I have forgotten, we have decide to pick 31/7 (last day of offer) as the day we will try to 'enjoy' the offer by MBS to Singaporeans at large (399$/night on the premium room, with breakfast and $50 spending credit). Well, unknowingly, its the full dress rehearsal of our national day parade that's happening just across the marina at the big field. A few days prior, realizing that its the rehearsal, I emailed the front desk asking for a room facing the city. Its subject to availability but well, things turned out fairly ok for me. Anyway, the key search-phrase, PACK! With the casino running 24/7, hundreds if not thousands of Diamond members having chalked up tonnes of free points/rooms. Last day of the local stayer offer. NDP (national day parade) rehearsal. 'Pack' is an understated word. Was told the check in time is 3pm. Arriving at 2.40 the queue was already like 150pax long. Having stayed in a fair number of 4/5 star properties, it's the second time I encountered such 'vibrancy' at a good class hotel. The last time was at Venetian in Macau.. another Sands property (that tells where all the exciting asians go for vacation!). 1 hour wait and got my room registered. But was told I was placed in a Orchid Suite, and the room will only be ready in 2 hours. Fine, it was a good sunny day so brought the family up to the roof top. Knowing that the hotel starts checking in at 3pm, extremely surprised that the swimming pool is already packed with people! Skipping the in betweens, by the time I got my room its 5.30pm. They were supposed to call me once the room is ready, but knowing how busy these ppl are we decided to just pop over to check the status and got our key. Ok, the upgraded room is excessively huge and impressive. Got the city facing room on the 50th floor, and since its a suite I get to see the other side (sea facing) as well. Overall decently furnished. But for some reason the bathroom was locked up and when the porter came with our luggage, told him about the problem and he went about to settle it for us (which he did). So leaving the chap to help us sort out the room, we went up to the roof top swimming pool. Granted the hotel is packed for the day, I have a nagging suspicion many staying guests are bringing their friends around and packing the roof top garden to the max. There are hardly any pool deck chair available and if one is opened up, you just have to snatch it! Crowd control could have been better. I think they shld really close up most of the roof top place to just hotel guests, especially on a day like this one where the hotel is so pack. Pool water was surprisingly cold on such a good sunny day. Anyway, when the NDP rehearsal started.. The roof top is really a good place to be. You will probably think that the jet/helicopter flypasts were planned with the Sands in mind.. Watched the fireworks in the hotel room and again, the blooms were like literally opening up at your eye level! Amazing view even better than what I got at Mandarin Oriental two years back! Had no problem with the bath/hot water and so forth. Well furnished bathroom with 4 towers (most hotels give you 2 or 3 max if its close to 5 star). Hot water was abit slow in coming (half a minute or so?!). Tried to order room service. The menu stated that anything less than $30 would incur a $5 delivery charge. But that's moot this round, after getting to the in room dining recept within 3 minutes, was told the hotel had a gas-cut and is unable to provide any food. 'Anything that you don't have to cook' --> 'Let me check for you... err sorry sir there is nothing the kitchen can send out now'... And unfortunately, the nearest shop/7-11 is like a km away at esplanade! Breakfast in the morning?! Well, the missus had the foresight of bringing us there early as crowd is expected. Got a very 'cold' table after 15 mins wait --> for some reason the hotel decided just to blow tonnes of cold air out of this air-chute near our table (other air chute seems not to be used). Nevertheless noticed that the hotel was preparing for this huge influx of guest. They opened up the other two restaurants for breakfast and set up a 'breakfast by the bay' across at the convention center. Spread was good and very comparable to the nearby 5-stars. Had some issues during check-out with the $50 credits that was part of the package. The system did not recognize some spending and tried to get me to pay for it. But upon explaining to the lady the problem, she just took the initiative and took $50 off my hotel bill. All in how I felt about the stay: 1. That Sands was badly designed. With so many guest rooms, the dining facility is hugely insufficient. Maybe the opening of the expo center will alleviate the situation but that is yet to be seen especially if guests need to walk across so far just to have breakfast. 2. Sands was overly ambitious in putting out this local-stay offer. The infrastructure is unable to handle such high occupancy rate at the moment. Maybe we are the beta tester (u get a good rate so don't come harp on the services! we let you stay cheap to help us debug the problems!). Drive-in entrance is heavily bogged. Valet service for all hotel guest is simply not a good idea. 3. Information flow and system is not well set up. Frontline staff were not told of major issues (e.g. gas stopped last night) that they could have faced guests grievance of. 4. Insufficient preparation. If room service has been stopped, and no alternative available, the hotel shld have prepared alternative solution (e.g. pre packed sandwiches). 5. Crowd control left too much to be desired. They shld close the roof garden for pack days. Why I am saying this place is very much 'un-singapore'... well, my normal comment, as a singaporean who travels a fair bit on work/leisure, that singapore establishment (e.g. SIA) usually have a good operating procedure and infrastructure, but lack guinea service mindset. Sands was just the opposite. The Standard operating procedure are totally undefined but the staff tried their best to be helpful. Comparing to the earlier guests that found the place miserable.. I guess the main reason I didn't feel that way was the excellent view of the parade flypast and the fireworks that literally bloomed in front of our full floor-to-ceiling window. If I have not gotten the good room I probably would have felt alot more miserable and not so neutral in my comments. But having stayed in quite a few of the hotels near the marina (e.g. Ritz, Oriental, Conrad).. I would still rate the Sands favorably. Not sure why but I never had good impression of Ritz (Sg, KL, HK, etc). Oriental was more expensive and the rooms are much smaller. Conrad gave good obliging services but again when I was using it I was a diamond hilton member and that gets me alot of perks. Would I come back again ? Maybe in 6mths or a year. Let's hope they sort out some of their infrastructural issues and figure out how to solve those inherent systematic issues. 8-P", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cThank God my stay went well, despite a reservation problem\u201d", "Author": "Edges", "ReviewID": "UR73223772", "Content": "Curious because I did not get any confirmation number after making a reservation almost a month prior, I finally made a phone call to confirm it the night before my check in day.

I started panicking, but the rep was good at handling my case. He helped me with my reservation and I finally got the three rooms that I needed. I was expecting the worse from then on, and the image of being stranded in Singapore with extended family members without a room kept crossing my mind. The stay was uneventful. My room, Horizon room on the 38th floor, was huge at more than 60 m2. One could easily fit in four king beds in the room. The room and the bathroom were sparsely furnished, too bland for a five star hotel charging this much. There is no turndown service in the evening - I didn't request but I never had to request for such at other similar establishments in Singapore. The service level is definitely low here. The housekeeper did not even understand when I told her in English to come at a later time in order to clean my room. One of the perks of staying at this hotel is being able to go to the Skypark at any time for free. The pool and jacuzzi have stunning views of the city from the 57th floor level. There were too many people watching though, there is no sense of exclusiveness at all. Only in house guest are allowed to use such facilities, however, people are roaming around to see them using the facilities. It felt like being on a public beach where a lot of people can't swim.

I don\u2019t mind paying a little extra for something special but one thing I hate is being ripped off. And at the moment this hotel is ripping people off big time. I booked online and part of the deal was an upgrade on the room. This was not offered at check in but after pointing it out to the check in staff we were given the upgrade. The room was ok but nothing special for a 5 star hotel, the bedding smelt damp and although a non smoking room, cigarette butts in the balcony flower bed and a coke bottle with stubs in it.... No bottle opener in room, extra charge for internet, no ice machines or ice buckets.

The bloke and I stayed here for two nights (at a rather expensive cost of $440 SGD p/n) and didn't enjoy it one bit. The three page complaint letter that I have fired off to the hotel manager is summarised below: When we arrived on the 9th, we came via the free airport shuttle that the hotel provides. We were unceremoniously dumped in the parking area and told to go up to reception. There was no signage, no porters to assist with our luggage and frankly, it was a horribly unwelcoming and smelly area. Once we struggled up the escalator with all of our bags, and arrived into the atrium space, we had to navigate our way to the reception desk, again no signage so we almost ended up going the wrong way. This was an issue as frankly, after a 14+ hour flight, I do not want to have to drag my bags around the very large reception space trying to find reception. Once in room (4494) there were: 1. No towels in the bathroom 2. The toilet smelt of one-week-old-kimchi-eating, dead rat. I asked them to fix it and apparently someone came to the room, yet it was still stinky when we checked out. To the point where I preferred to use the reception toilets. 3. Filthy dusty windows on the inside (I discovered this by leaning against them to take a photo in my, rather expensive, silk dress). 4. No in room dining menu, we presumed it wasn't yet available like most hotel amenities, but it actually was. 5. No mini-bar price list. 6. Internet is extra @ $30. Other issues: 1. Hotel restaurant (the only one) closes at 10pm, and rumours had it that they had actually ran out of food as well. 2. Most things are not open such as the Skypark restaurant & bar, and most of the shops in the shopping center bit. 3. The gym is in one of the hotel rooms which is very disappointing. Its unlikely that you would want to use it. This poorly operated space is also the only refreshment option available if you check out, but have a late flight and want a shower. 4. No Spa, in room massage is also not available. 5. Concierge service is appalling. They have not done any of the tours, lack local knowledge, and the best restaurant they could recommend for me when the hotel one closed, was jumbo seafood in clarke quay (which is mediocre). I was extremely disappointed with my stay, especially as we had paid so much to stay there. Had I only paid $150 for example, it would have been fine as I would not have had expectations such as having somewhere to eat, a gym and spa for example. This hotel does have potential though, so maybe stay here in a year when everything is opened and it has had time to bed down a little. Or stay there now if you don't mind paying an extortionate amount for no amenities, smelly room & rubbish concierge. I would recommend the Fairmont (stunning bathrooms) or the Fullerton (colonial elegance) as an alternative to this hotel.

I was very aprehensive after reading the reviews and considered booking alternative hotel, glad I didn't. Check in was fine, no que and I was early at 9.30am, at the airport I had been picked up by the hotel mini bus, the driver was looking out for me at the bus station, a rather hot and wet passanger after a 12 hour flight from London. The driver took an alternative route as the freeway was pretty heavy and a comfortable well airconditioned bus allowed me to cool down and watch the city as we drove by. As I said check in was quick and easy, Beverly sorted out all the paperwork, checked my preferances and allocated a kingsize room on the 31st floor overlooking the sea. The room was spotless, a balcony a surprise. The bathroom was well appointed and I had NO problem with hot water. The bath was a welcome luxery after the long flight. I managed a short sleep in the firm bed with feather pillows. I took the lift to the 57th floor, a spectacular rooftop pool, garden & observation deck. Non residents can access the observation deck, but pool & gardens are exclusive to hotel guests. I had a very pleasent hour in the pool and reclining on the many deck chairs with towels redily available from pool attendents, and a life guard was on duty. The views are spectacular and the pool is open to guests from 07.00 until 22.00 so you get to see the city and sea in all its glory. It is true that this area is not yet complete, they are still constructing the restaurants, however I found this no way reduced my awe at the experiance. I was able to purchase drinks and snacks on my room card. I had a buffett dinner in Rise restaurant on ground floor, not cheap but good quality and good service, I am sure staff are still learning, but again I had no issue with the quality of food or service. Breakfast was also taken in Rise, again buffett style and as good as any other hotel in Singapore, Orange juice appeared freshly squeezed and chef's on hand to cook fresh omelete's, no major ques, good range of styles of breakfast. My last morning involved me back in the pool, nice and quiet as not too many other guests, observation deck is also NOT open to the public until 10am. Check out is earlier than I am used to, 11am rather than noon, however staff quite helpful with offer to store luggage, I chose to take the free shuttle back to Changi airport, today it was a full sized coach, departed from lower ground floor where regular shuttles depart for Orchard Rd and Changi Airport. A convention centre, casino and shopping centre is also part of the resort, that includes a canal the length of the building and San Pan rides. This centre is not yet complete, shops still moving in, but many open, the theatres and museum also remain to be opened. If going to the casino take your passport, you will need it to get in. Overall I was impressed, I will return next year to see how the resort improves with completion of some facilities. All staff were helpful, a smile and a quiet word when requested, security staff patrol the lift area's to ensure only guests get through, also the 57th floor is secured and guest area's clearly identified and managed, I did enjoy the spa pool in the garden with sea view! DO NOT worry about previous reviews, while I never doubt the integrity of Tripadvisor reviewers and have always relied on them myself, I look for the positive ones to get a balanced picture, often a disappointment leads to poor review and perhaps hypercritical advice to avaoid a hotel.

MY SAGA: On arrival, they were no one taking care of the luggage from the taxi although there were several \u201cdoor\u201d people they. When I ask one of them, he said, you need to check in first. He directed me to a check in. after a long queues, I was told it was a wrong counter; the other counter was right on the opposite site. I again asked any help with the luggage, the answer \u201cyou have to ask it over there yourself\u201d almost 45 mins was wasted We were given a key to the room. No one take us to the room. When we arrived we found the room was on the lower floor directly opposite a construction site. After many calls to the hotel, we reach the \u201ccorrect\u201d person, we will than allow the change of room. Again we have to go down to the receptions and line up again for a further 20 minutes. Again given a key. That is all. We were expected to move our luggage myself . After many many protest phone calls, I was than told someone will come and help us. By this time almost 3 hours were wasted. We than decided to cancel our second visit for the 9th of July and the 18th of July. You cannot believe this: after giving the merry go round they will not let me cancel saying that I need to ring a different reservation number dedicated to reservation. I rung the number and after more then one hour I got no result. By the way to ring this reservation number the hotel changes 45 cents for the call. They will not put me through from the hotel operator. I was than ask to contact American express in Australia, I ask again the operation to put a reverse call. She said that it is not the hotel policy to do collect call or to put calls to the reservation. On principal I like American express to refused the 45 cents I was change for calling to cancel my booking. This is to send them a message. I want them actually to send me a change for the refund Please note that in more than 40 years of travel this is the first complaint I make.

If you're still reading and considering The Sands after that comment, you must be a masochist and I will elaborate a bit more. Basically, the place is huge, but huge in a BAD way. Takes a long time to walk anywhere, the casino is mediocre at best (faux opulence and 1 cash cage in the sprawling complex), the skypark is nothing more than a glorified, over-priced observation deck, though the pool is very cool, but can only be accessed by hotel guests. Technically the hotel out of the City Limits (like 5 feet outside and who even knew there were city limits in Singapore) but the taxis actually charge a SURCHARGE of $3 to go anywhere from here because of it. I'm guessing the $3 dollars doesn't mean a lot to you if you're staying there, but its just salt on the wounds of a horrible experience. Not only are the physical buildings under construction, apparently the entire customer service structure is as well. The staff seemingly can't handle the simplest request, haven't learned basic customer service skills, like greeting and saying hi. The skypark is way way too overpriced and given the poor customer service in other parts of the hotel it didn't surprise me to see some curly-haired manager at the skydeck box office refusing to give refunds to tourists who paid $20 each to go up to the observation deck only to have a flash thunderstorm hit by the time the line to the elevator moved enough to let them up. These people hadn't even gone up yet. It started raining (pouring) and this \"manager\" kept telling them its policy not to give refunds unless there a dangerous situation. I've never seen anything like it at a supposed 5-star hotel. It was really a disgusting display and has turned me off to this place for good. I have stayed and will continue to stay at the Ritz-Carlton across the river. Its customer service is absolutely amazing. One more thing...not sure if its a heavy-handed government rule or strictly a casino rule, but no short pants on men allowed. I tried to go into the casino with short pants (pleated with belt and polo shirt, no beach wear) and they refused entry to me. Then I watched as some 20-something girl with short-shorts and flip-flops go in and they told me the pants rule is only for men. This, in tropical 105 degree heat and after I had watched curly hair skydeck manager berate guests for wanting a refund because of the downpour. It was just one bad moment after another. At one point, I was so angry with the hotel, I filled out a complain form, only to watch the desk manager look at it after I was gone and roll their eyes. I'm sure it will never make it to the right people and as such the hotel will continue to be a failure until they can figure out who's paying the bills.

Other than the 150m long pool, there are also heated jacuzzis facing the sea, offering guests the chance to have a dip no matter the weather. Had a few friends over one weekend for drinks and we had a ball of a time until security chased us away at 10pm for closing. The pool and restaurants area are segregated from the observation deck which is chargeable, but during the weekend when I was there, visitors were allowed to move freely throughout the entire skypark, however security was tight to ensure only hotel guests were given access to the pool. Lots of families and rowdy kids that spoiled the \u2018chicness\u2019 of it, but since this is a 2500 room hotel I guess it\u2019s not possible to totally keep kids out.

The driver said to us\" do you need me the help you get the trolley\" , signalling he is going off otherwise and shall dumped us free and easy in the ugly basement to find our way to the lobby using the trolley... god knows where is it.. Mind you there is only one trolley and if luckily we are the only couple, if there are more than one couple, we may have to fight for the trolley. That really shocked us and we were at a lost and my husband's face changed and sternly said , that would be helpful, considering we have 2 big luggages and 2 big box of gift for friends and have no idea where the lobby is.. Noting our change or mood, he led us through some short cut under the escalator to the lift, nearly knocking my head while moving under.... The glass lift was dirty with oil stains on the glass panels(not cleaned for weeks) The checking in process was messed up with lots of walking here and there, waiting and confusion and it is indeed not easy to write all of it down, in short again, the staff are ill-informed and unhelpful and very patronizing. Basically nobody really cares if you are here or not.. CHECKING IN = WORST EVER We arrived around 1 am and only to be checked in to a proper room at 215 am. All in all the best part of thewhole night is the driver, whom has offered to show us the way to the lobby. THE LOBBY = DULL AND UNCLASSY The lobby looks like they have a budget cut with stained marbles all over (Maybe it is the design ) , too poor to polish the marble flooring, so dull , and the paintings and ornaments looked cheap..nothing the sort like a casino hotel.... THE ROOM = BASIC AND PLAIN If you are expecting some similar experience like that of sort of luxury hotel in Vegas or Casino Hotels in Macau, there is nothing there to dazzle you, the room is very basic furnishing , no frills, Carpet looks cheap, bed is lousy with loose springs and not flat, be prepared to get some backache.. ( Oh, we had paid for a PREMIER room, which is suppposed to be better than the basic class...) Carpet is supposed to be clean considering they are so new but looked like they have been used for quite a while already, thin and worn looking. No complementary drinking water, ... toileteries looked like some 3 star hotel packaging.. . We had asked to check out at 220 am because there was nothing similar to a 5 star treatment from the momemt we stepped into the hotel. And we were told that we will be charged for the first night irregardless of the reasons. We decided at 230 am to check out first thing the next morning although we had booked to stay for 4 nights and never return to this hotel. CHECKING OUT We asked for a feedback from the counter and the form literally reads : \" Dear Guest, we appreciate your Positive feeback and welcome your Constructive comments.... etc.... Trust that you can imagine the kind of mentality the management has by putting such wordings in their feedback form. We have wrote that if they need some negative feedback for improvement, they may call us. This has totally dampened our spirit to even visit the casino, because i doubt it will be any good under the same management.. Well, blessing in disguise, we checked in at the Capella , Sentosa the next day at a fraction more but and i must say, it has lived up to stars fully with excellent service and quality room and amenities. We had a good time there for the next 3 nights. This above is only a summary, there are more issues not detailed here, ,my advice, don't waste your money, for 5 star experience stay at the Hilton, Conrad, Fullerton or Capella even if you want to visit the casino... you will be thankful.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and not ready to welcome guests\u201d", "Author": "kkdoo", "ReviewID": "UR67792198", "Content": "I stayed three days at Marina Bay Sands for a conference, from what I heard the organizer was quoted a special rate of 300 SGD++ per room. Other delegates warned me not to take rooms in Tower 3, due to it's distance to main lobby & casino, most importantly there were a lot of complaints coming from guests in tower 3 (telephone not working, no hot water, air con, TV, and etc). Room was clean as expected, there were few constructions ongoing in the hotel (including the sky terrace). The view to the bay looks OK from the 21st floor, the more expensive your room type the better view you have. I wont recommend the garden view, as what you can see at this stage is construction site. Some of their housekeeping staff are not fluent in English. The hotel looks not 100% ready for operation, the only one that looks ready in MBS is it's casino.

Painful for when the wakeup call goes off. Totally annoying I'd you get freuqent calls. Figured lobby bar would be better, service was horrible. Plenty of staff but no one follows up for additional drinks. It almost felt like lots of staff with no one in charge. Buffet lunch also lacked the attentive level of service expected.

For the price they are charging ($399++) , I would expect more value, especially during this soft opening stage. Maybe we are just too excited to try out the new hotel. This is what we get. 1) Firstly the website is not clear on the description or differences on the rooms types. Pictures are also limited. Eg. Atrium deluxe, Atrium premier or Atrium Grand. It would be good to know the room size or other information like if the rooms has a bathtub with a view, separate sitting area, balcony ..... Than people will know what they are paying for. 2) They are a brand new hotel but such a disappointment that they do not have DVD players or complimentary in rooms internet. (probably they would want their guest to spend more time in Casino) 3) Its so strange that the hairdryer can only be plugged and use on the writing desk instead of the bathroom. 4) The magnifying vanity mirror is also kept in the wardrobe instead of the bathroom. 5) Writing desk is also missing of the writing paper, envelope. 6) We forgot to put DND and the housekeeping come knocking at 10plus to clean room. They did not even realise that we are due to check out on the same day. Why waste time and effort to clean the room. 7) No newspaper provided. (not even the complimentary TODAY.) 8) Pool is not ready, most shops and restaurant not open yet. A plus point would be rooms are clean and they have friendly reservation staff. Lastly for this price it is definitely not worth it.

During my recent four night stay, it was a continuing comedy of errors, including: (1) my placement in a double/double room, even though king rooms were available (I was eventually moved); (2) even on the full 'hot' setting, all I could ever get was warm water in the shower; (3) poorly trained staff. One example: The floor supervisor having to bark orders to her staff--while I'm in the room--on how to perform turn-down service; (4) poor ventilation in the elevators and on certain floors; (5) loud traffic noise in rooms on the golf course/ocean side all day and night, due to a major road that parallels the hotel; (6) limited channel selection (18), although they do have Fox News (rare in Asia); (7) electrical glitches, resulting in occasional power outages in the adjoining expo/convention center; (8) major billing issues. Despite three separate discussions with the front desk, they continued to want to bill me for five nights instead of the four that I was there; (9) poor value. Before staying at the Sands, I spent one night at the Conrad, which was S$25 cheaper, with a higher-quality room and far better service. To be fair, some of the bugs may eventually be worked out, as the staff gets more familiar with their jobs and more of the development is completed (they currently only have the casino, about 20% of the high-end shops and about 35% of the hotel rooms open). The wireless Internet service was free. And the casino is nice, as long as you are comfortable with showing your ID three times to get on and off the floor, and are prepared to pay S$50+ per hand at most tables.
