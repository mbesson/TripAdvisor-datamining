WHAT ARE THEY THINKING? Cook~outs, swimming,tanning,my family thought the place in a nut~shell, was a dead weekend. Nothing but POLICE and DRUG ADDICTS AND DRUNKS WALKING AROUND. We actually went to Old Town down the road for most of LABOR DAY. Let the live~ins have their cook~out and swim in the GREEN MOLDY pool. Maybe next yr.they will be prepared for a V.I.P. Holiday.

Such a bargain. We had two double beds, en-suite shower room, air conditioning, TV with movie channels and ESPN. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Superb location, just off 192 immediately behind Capones Dinner Show (not very well signposted so just drive around the back of Capone's and you'll see it!). We've stayed in USA (and Orlando area) several times in the past and have paid much more for worse accomodation. Yes, the decor is dated and the furntiture could be a bit more luxurious but at \u00a36 each per night you can't really grumble! A real gem for those on a budget.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, AL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room for the Price\u201d", "Author": "sazbuff1", "ReviewID": "UR18418078", "Content": "Great room for the price, an older motel and no fills, just basic, clean, friendly staff.

Don't be fooled it is basic accommodation and does not offer breakfast nor shuttles to the nearby attractions. Rooms were a bit smelly (maybe mold?) but beds clean and comfortable. Housekeeping very good and we had no security problems. If you don't have a car, it will be hard to get to the attractions. There is a local bus (56) from outside the hotel to Disney World. For Universal, you need to take a cab which is about $30 each way. V close to Nike Factory store, mini golf, supermarkets so handy for families.
