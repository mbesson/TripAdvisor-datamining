We know Spain well and this was an area we hadn't given enough attention. We speak Spanish and love the authentic Spanish way of life (not the Costa del whatever).We liked the look and location Cal Mestre and decided to send an availability request. They have a good site with lots of information about the region and some good links. To our dismay, we learned that the owners were Dutch (we live in NL). Although this was somewhat of a negative selling point for us, we decided to give it a go anyway. Thank goodness we did, we had a great time. Cal Mestre:- We missed a turn and took the \u9225\u6e27ery tourist\u9225?route to Les Gunyoles d'Avinyonet. Our own fault, but when we arrived in the village there were no signs directing us to Cal Mestre. The locals were able to enjoy our trips around the village. We could see our target, we just couldn\u9225\u6a9b get there. You would have thought that they, seeing a Dutch number plate, would have pointed us towards our destination. Could it be that having Dutch people running a \u9225\u6dd0asa Rural\u9225?in their village is not so popular? Anyway, we didn\u9225\u6a9b meet any problems when we visited to village bodega and the local chemist \u9225?it was a little disconcerting at the time. Lesson learned: don\u9225\u6a9b just print the route provided on the site; bring it with you!- Cal Mestre is beautiful, both inside and outside.- Plenty of parking spaces.- Marian  Martin welcome all their guests with warmth and enthusiasm, but they leave you to decide how much contact you have with them and their other guests. I have stayed in places where not joining the guest table made me feel uncomfortable. Not here, when we declined the offer on arrival, Marian kindly made us a late supper and rejoined her other guests. We introduced ourselves, but felt free to do our own thing then and throughout our stay.- We actually only dined at Cal Mestre on the day of arrival (supper), we enjoy exploring the local villages/towns and their restaurants.- Breakfast (incl. your choice of egg dishes, prepared to order) was fine. I would have liked to see more local fare (e.g. Spanish ham  chorizo from the local butcher), but that\u9225\u6a9a me. There was more than enough choice, with fresh fruit on the menu too.- We had booked a larger room: \u9225\u6dd5arraf\u9225? Lots of baggage needed for 4 weeks travelling and we tend to buy and receive (visiting friends) quite a few things as we go. The extra space meant we could leave all our belongings out of sight and have the bedroom area to relax in. Tip: If you ask, Martin will let you store some baggage (or your bikes) in the garage. Saves carrying it all up to your room!- The bathroom was lovely and large, we soon got used to the strange step into the shower (great view from there too).- Everything was beautifully clean and remained so.- We didn\u9225\u6a9b actually use the pool, just took in the sun from the lounge beds. Beach towels were kindly provided for our use.- We also didn\u9225\u6a9b use the sauna or music room, but they looked both inviting and professional.- There\u9225\u6a9a a TV room with a library of novels and reference books at Cal Mestre. We had our own reading materials and like to read a Spanish newspaper; but if our stay had been longer and/or if we were travelling with children, these facilities would have been well used.- Bikes are available for hire and there are various biking routes throughout the Penedes.- Both Marian  Martin are quite knowledgeable about the area and there were lots of info./brochures/books in the entrance hall. A local map was made available with restaurants  suggestions for sightseeing marked clearly and discussed. Marian also kindly booked our tour of the Codorniu vineyards for us.- During our visit we met guests from Norway, Italy, USA, Netherlands and Scotland, so there is enough variety. No Spanish guests during our stay, but you can meet Spanish people all day \u9225?br/>Area:- We arrived just as the harvest had started and were able to enjoy the Penedes in full swing. Tractors with flashing lights, filled with grapes took over the roads and gave us a real feel for the importance of the vineyards, both from an economic and way of life perspective. Tip: Watch out for those tractors in August/September, they can be found on the motorway-type roads too!- Visits to Bodegas Miguel Torres  Cellar - Codorniu helped us understand the process behind those great Cavas  wines. - We also visited the local Cooperative, where many of those tractors drop off their loads, the process was interesting to observe and we were welcome to take photos. An experience worth the time. - We were just in time to join in the annual fiesta in Villa Franca del Penedes: traditional processions, street entertainment and just great local colour. Well worth the visit.- We drove along the coast and enjoyed the fantastic views, stopping at small villages and taking in the sights, without having to stay in the really touristy hotels.- Many other things could be added to this list, but these were the highlights. We\u9225\u6a92l leave others to fill you in on the rest \u9225?br/>Marian  Martin seem to have found a balance between running a hotel and actually finding time to enjoy living in Spain too, it shows. Congratulations go to them for taking the chance and making it work.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR367494149", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SodaBread"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d602180-r6560769-Cal_Mestre-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "602180", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
