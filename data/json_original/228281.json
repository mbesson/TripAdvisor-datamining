{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great average hotel but very noisy! The service at the hotel was great! We have booked true internet and everything went fine. Even when we arrived later than 00 pm the staff was still friendly and helpful. The rooms are fine and clean, but very noisy! It was hot in Berlin and if you did open the windows you could hear the highway. Airco would be a great +++ It was noisy but the beds are very good so I got a good sleep. The bathroom is to small, certainly if you are whit two people in the room. Breakfast was also fine, great avarage + hotel, great value! Easy to reach with public transport. So it's not the grand luxe but the service is very good. Fine, small hotel. It would go back to this hotel", "Date": "Aug 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR531387969", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Tomzie"}, {"Content": "Very Loud We stayed here in July of 2006, and the weather in the city was very hot at that time. Our room faced the A-100 autobahn, and the noise was tremedous if we had the windows open. It was too hot to sleep in the room with the windows closed, but too loud if we kept them open, so it made for a very long uncomfortable night.Breakfast was quite adequate, staff was friendly and helpful, and our room cost was about 70 euro per night. Not a bad place to stay, a bit out of the way perhaps, but a much better option in a cooler time of year than in mid-summer.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR489494860", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d228281-r5727169-Prinzregent_Hotel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "228281", "Price": "$89"}}
