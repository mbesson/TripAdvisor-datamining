The times my family and I have traveled to NYC (plenty of times) we have stayed at hotel Riverside Studios. It was not a fancy hotel AT ALL...but it suited our needs. The room was always decent (clean sheets, mini fridge, bathroom) although we did have to share a bathroom with other tenants. Fortunately, we did not experience anything extremely horrible that other visitors did. It was a good place to crash at night. Anyway, I was planning another trip out there and was trying to book a room at this place but saw that all of their dates were booked online. So, I decided to call and see if I could book a room. The person who answered the phone told me that they were no longer allowed to rent out their rooms since they got in trouble with the city of New York. I guess this ties in with the police officer story that someone shared on this page a while ago. I am sure many people will be happy that this place has closed its doors to the traveling public; I, on the other hand, am bummed out. It was the cheapest hotel (in a nice area), I could find in Manhattan, close to everything.

I stay in hostels a lot (shared rooms with bunks, shared bathrooms), so am used to \"roughing it\" a fair bit. I really try to give fair reviews on Tripadvisor. Hotel Riverside Studios is the most disgusting place I have ever stayed. Someone described the lobby as resembling a \"crack house\" and I would agree with this. The hallways are mouldy, carpets peeling, wires hanging everywhere. The general state of cleanliness is well below par. The entire hotel is dusty, dirty and smelly. The room my friend had booked was a double for two. The bedsheets were stained, the carpets were dirty, I saw a huge cockroach scuttle along the floor and couldn't even tell my friend because she'd rather sleep on the subway than stay in a room with creepy-crawlies. The shared bathrooms were VILE. What looked like oil stains all over the bath, the toilet blocked, I actually felt gross using the water to brush my teeth. The worst moment of all was coming home after a night out and seeing a huge RAT run along the entrance to the hotel. It sounds like I'm making this up but I in no way am. Now that my friend and I are away from the dump that is Hotel Riverside Studios, we can laugh about it, but it kind of ruined our trip. We wanted to spend no time in the place at all and after a day in NYC sometimes all you want is a nice shower and bed. DO NOT STAY HERE! The website tricks you with nice pictures but it's a lie.

And nothing is more frustrating than stumbling out of your room in the middle of the night only to remember when it is far too late that the toilet paper is in your room sitting on the dresser. Nevertheless this place has one of the best locations ever for the price. You can not beat the convenience to the city's attractions and the hop skip and a jump literally from the subway. I am on here now planning a trip with my 11 year old son to NY this summer and I plan to stay here. I already know what to expect so I will prepare my son for the minimal amenities. I don't think he'll care once he falls in love with NYC.

I stayed here twice: In January 2010 and January 2011. I paid under $50.00 both times and liked it better than the $50.00 to $60.00 rooms that I had been renting at Howard Johnsons in New Jersey (Clifton, Parsippany). The staff was much more courteous. They personally showed me to my room when I couldn't find it and helped me when I had trouble with my key, staying until they were sure I got it. No one looked down their noses at me like the staff at more than one Howard Johnson (I've been told that I can pass for late teens/early 20s), I didn't overhear any maids screaming at families with young children to hurry up and check out a good 10 to 15 minutes before they needed to and none of the staff came into my room and kicked my things under the bed. While I have seem hair in the bathroom and shower, I have never seen boogers, feces, blood or bedbugs. I will agree that the hotel and its rooms are a bit dingy and they definitely are not a nice as your average chain hotel room in New Jersey. However, this isn't New Jersey and it is not a chain. This is New York City and, for this price you get your own room (many NYC accommodations within in the same price range are bunk beds in dormitories) that is within walking distance of both a major subway line (stops include both Times Square and Penn Station, the former being a transfer point to Grand Central.) and Central Park. No either driving into NYC with its tolls and expensive parking or driving to a NJ Transit station, paying for a ticket (and possibly parking) and then having to keep your eye on the time because the NJ Transit stops running fairly early. And while I would ( and have) pay for a more expensive room if (and when) I had the money, the nicer places I stayed at had their issues as well, including an extremely confusing hallway system in a Days Inn (96th and Broadway) and a oddly positioned toilet in a Comfort Inn (Chelsea) that caused me to accidentally hit my head on the bathroom sink more than once (and, no, I had not been drinking). The same hotel room also had something in the air that made me feel sick. I blame the hotel because I always started to feel better once I'd been out of the hotel for an hour or two and always started to feel sick again within an hour of getting back. Symptoms never reappeared once I checked out of the hotel. Also, a lot of NYC hotels within that strata (comfort inn, holiday inn, days inn) are not quite as nice looking or spacious as their suburban counterparts because they're in old, converted buildings, something you might not see as often elsewhere. Bottom line, unless you're either willing to drop a good deal more money, use a large number of hotel points or stay in a less favorable location, this is what you will have to deal with if you want to stay in Manhattan. There's a reason Manhattan residents grumble about paying large sums of money for the privilege of living in box-like dwellings.

But looking on the bright side of how cheap it was in a good location in NYC I decided we could grin and bear it. But I have never in my life experienced such a horrible stay in a hotel. The place smelled so bad upon walking into the lobby. The guy at the desk could barely check us in because him and some bums that were hanging out there with him were hitting on us the entire time. Then we go through a series of hallways that look like they were from a horror film to get to the elevator, which looked like a door to a closet. Once inside the elevator, you can barely breathe it smelled so bad and you had to hold your breath. There are people that live here apparently because the place used to be an apartment building, so some peiople still live here for around $50 a week. These people could be mistaken for homeless people though which was sad. But they had signs that made no sense taped to their doors, also flags and signs with obscene gestures and profane language on them!!! The room was awful. Decor didnt match, was broken and stained, and looked like it came from salvation army. I SWORE the bed was wooden when I sat on it, it was so hard. There were dead bugs behind all the furniture. Outlets hanging out of walls. Only a sink in the room..so then we went to check out the shared bathroom. Pubic hair everywhere. Feces on floor, on toilet, on walls, and near toilet paper holder. A sign was on the door saying \"If you don't like the dirty bathroom CLEAN IT YOURSELF\"!!!!! My friend and I were so upset that we tried checking out, but would not only loose our money but everywhere else nearby was too expensive since most halfway decent places didn't have rooms. So we decided to deal with it. Woke up in the morning with the worst back pain in my life thanks to the bed. I had bites on me that I assume were from bed bugs. Squatted when using toilet and showered in flip flops. The water kept going from ice cold to burning hot when showering. The people who stayed there kept banging on the bathroom door when you take a shower. The heat in the room didn't work. I cant believe we made it out alive.

It's an old tenement, there are travellers renting rooms and folks who live there permanenly. But that's true about most hostels on the upper west. Yup, the johns are shared.

Maybe a lot of work. The bathroom with a tub has a problem with privacy. The shower curtain for the shower/tub doesn't completely block yourself from the person across the building from you. If anything, the windows are somehow strategically placed to show more of yourself to the adjacent building than you want. The toilets are a bit tricky to flush and you would have to push on the lever completely down if you want any work done.

The pictures on the website are incredibly deceiving and give the impression of a real gem at the door of Manhattan. Well, let's make it clear, it doesn't look anything like the website. Oh well, maybe the outside entrance does, in some way... Kind of... Once inside, I was quite taken aback by the apparent bad temper of the giant at the check in. Rather impressive, unpleasant and making you feel rather unconfortable. It all relaxed quickly though, after agreeing on some imbroglio on my booking. Next surprise, the room lock didn't work, and we therefore had to wait for the housekeeper to fiddle around with grease and a flourish of tools before we could actually make a move in. In the room, we then realised that, despite what we had been told, there was no shower/bath, just a sink and the two beds... Oh, and a fridge and a TV... The bedroom and WC were actually shared with the rest of the floor, and in rather manky condition... The stores on the windows didn't shut. and the window, with a direct view on offices both sides were stained with a yellow layer of I don't know what. The climatisation was pretty uneffective and making a hell of a noise. The fact we were there in September, just avoiding the very hot season was certainly a bit of a life saver there... One thing though, the beds were spotless and the room generally clean (apart for the windows) and well taken care of. And the cornershop nearby helping, the fridge did manage us to stock a respectable quantity of beers to share very nice late night and early morning moments... Well, if you're on a budget, if you're a bloke travelling with your mate, go for this one and enjoy yourself, Lower Manhattan is just a short walk/taxi ride away and you will probably spend little time in your room...

We needed cheaper accommodation than we had and the Hotel Riverside Studios was fairly close by and looked clean and was very reasonably priced. I had not read the reviews as we were in a hurry to get somewhere at a cheaper price. Initially this hotel looked better than I expected but it became clear that first impressions were deceptive. The room we had (a double) was absolutely freezing due to the fact that the shutters on either side of the air-conditioning unit, which is fitted underneath the window, did not shut completely so the window is effectively open all the time. I told the man on reception who looked at me like this was one in a long line of hassles he could live without and then showed me how the radiator worked, although the radiator, he said, only works when the temperature drops sufficiently outside. He went and got us an extra blanket, somewhat grudgingly, but it didn't really help. The radiator finally came on at about 1 am, I know not because the room flooded with warmth but because the hissing steam that came whooshing out the side valve woke me up and it was impossible to stop it. I would not recommend staying here with children because the radiator, and the valves, heat up to the point of scalding. The radiator went off after about an hour and the room was freezing again by the morning. The rest of the room was just depressing. The window looks onto an alley so it is very dark, there are no curtains, just some broken old blind. The bed is horrendously hard and there are no chairs to sit in. The only advantage is the sink which means you can spend less time in the bathrooms and on that note - The bathrooms are grim. I realise that sharing with strangers is never going to be the ideal situation but the bathroom facilities are just inherently dirty. The fixtures are broken, the shower curtains are old and on occassion, cling to you (very unpleasant). The floors are tiled and there are no bath mats or paper for cleaning the floor so the floor is always wet and dirty. There is a cleaner but I had to remove someone else's hair from the plug because the shower filled up when I used it. To top off this delightful experience one of the bathroom windows, which is next to the shower, is wedged open and appears to look on to a wall and a window which looks like it has been pasted over. It is not possible to pull the curtain in front of the window so I assumed I was safe to use it undisturbed. Not so! Half way through my shower on the second day I looked down to see I had an audience of one watching me in the shower, lovely. The rest of the hotel is very run down and smells odd.

There's a reason this place is so cheap. I've stayed at hostels that were much nicer. The good: PRICE - you won't find places this close to the action in Manhattan for so little money. LOCATION is great. The neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet - street full of old brownstones. Very safe. The subway is 2 short blocks away at 72nd st. and Amsterdam Ave. There are stores and restaurants nearby, although we didn't partake in any of them. Hop on the subway and Times Square is 3 stops away. Central Park is 4 blocks walk. AMMENITIES: wash basin in room (nice for washing hands, brushing teeth); Refrigerator was new and worked very well. Sorry - that's it for the \"good\" stuff. Now on to the bad...... BATHROOMS: Where to start? No heat; bugs; exposed wiring hanging out from walls (up high); cracked tiles; tubs desperately in need of reglazing (cracked porcelain, etc.); only the rim of the washbasin for setting your things down (you really have no option but to set your things on the toilet cover or the floor); a couple of hooks for hanging things, but they are up very high, which is fine if you happen to be tall. The light, which stays on 24/7, is behind you when facing the mirror (not great for applying makeup; bring your own mirror). We stayed on the 3rd floor at the back (3A8). There was a bathroom right next to our room. There was another one around the corner from us, and another up the corridor toward the elevator. All three were similar to the description above. The one around the corner had a non-flushing toilet. The one up the corridor was tiny and had a nasty drain in the middle of the floor with bugs crawling out of it. We used the one closest to us. The door handle on the door to \"our\" bathroom was broken. You could pull the handle in/out through the hole. In order to close the door, you had to pull the whole thing toward you until the knob couldn't go any further on the outside of the door, then you locked the door with a sliding bolt. That worked fine until on the second night, somebody else used the bathroom and broke the door handle entirely. We found pieces of it sitting on the floor. Now the only way to close the door was to have somebody push it closed from the outside because the hole for the doorknob was too small to grab onto from inside the room. The doorknob remained broken and on the floor for an entire 24 hour period until we checked out. Also, you are given a roll of toilet paper when you check in. You have to remember to bring it with you to the bathroom, or just leave it in there (but there is no where to set it near the toilet, so you'd have to either balance it on the edge of the tub or set it on the floor). Yuck. The shower worked fine. The water pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water, even first thing in the morning. It was a bit squicky standing on the rough surface inside the tub, but it's perfectly functional - just cosmetically ugly. THE ROOM: We had a large room with 2 double beds. These had to be the most uncomfortable, squeaky beds I've ever slept in, and I've travelled extensively. You could hardly breathe without hearing the bed squeak. There were no plastic mattress covers on either of our beds. I did check for bedbugs and found nothing. Each bed had two very flat, flimsy pillows. There was a flat sheet on the bottom that needed to be re-tucked often. There is a flat sheet, velour blanket, and NASTY bedspread on top. I don't know if it was just the design, but that thing looked like it hasn't been washed in a couple of decades. We peeled off the bedspread rather than risk touching it. There is a nightstand between the beds with a clock radio, a phone, and a lamp. I can't comment on the functionality of the clock radio because I unplugged it in order to use the electrical outlet behind the bed for my phone charger. There is an armoire with a TV that works, but only gets a few stations, like TBS and some local channels, but no Weather Channel, cable news channels, or anything similiarly useful. The TV remote does not work. There are two upholstered swiveling chairs, but no table that you could use to eat or set your things on. There is an old cast iron radiator for heat. I could never manage to get the temperature right in our room. The first night, the weather was mild outdoors and we roasted in the room. The second and third nights, the weather had turned cooler and much windier. We froze. The windows are old and leak lots of air. There is no insulation in the walls. If the forecast for your stay is \"cold and windy\" bring your flannel pajamas and extra blankets. I slept in my polartec jacket and gloves the last night and was fine then. There are no grounded electrical outlets. There were only two outlets (except for the one that served the refrigerator and the television together) that worked. I brought along a power strip, but was unable to use it because it is grounded and wouldn't fit the plug. There is no mirror in the room. There is a closet with one hanger. There are mini-blinds over the windows, but no curtains to help keep it warm or dark inside. There is a very tiny waste bin under the sink. The carpeting is fairly industrial looking, but seemed clean in our room. The hallways, on the other hand, were dodgy. There was trash set out - left by guests for pickup by the housekeeping staff, and lots of paint flakes and debris. It looked like the corridors hadn't been vacuumed in a while. That's it for the description. We also had one rather strange thing happen while we were there. Our first night was Thanksgiving Eve. We went to bed early because we had to get up early for the parade the next morning. At about 12:30am, we were all awakened by the sound of someone walking around in the room above us. That went on for about 30 minutes. Then, just after 1am, the person started VACUUMING the room. The vacuuming went on for 45 minutes. I am not kidding. I must have checked my clock about 47 times during this ordeal. Finally, at 1:52am, I decided I had enough and went down to the lobby to complain. The desk attendant told me the room above was vacant that night. I responded by saying, \"well, either you've got the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre going on up there, or a vacuuming ghost.\" He promised to check it out. The vacumming stopped 10 minutes later. We were supposed to be checking out today, but we left a day early because we were all cold and miserable, and didn't want another night of discomfort.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel I've Ever Stayed In - It's Dilapidated!\u201d", "Author": "chaenny", "ReviewID": "UR50154876", "Content": "When I booked the hotel for $85 on Thanksgiving eve, I thought it was inexpensive, but how bad could it be?

If you are fussy about staying in a clean environment, do not stay here. My profession means I travel a lot and I am used to very cheap hotels yet I haven't come across anything like this before. The room itself was big. Two double beds. An attempt at giving the room a cheerful feel with bright bedcovers was immediately undone by the massively uncomfortable mattress and wheels that meant the bed moved! I didn't dare sleeping under the covers, luckily it was very warm during our visit. Talking of warm, let me tell you about the air-con. It's a window unit that makes an ungodly sound and only when stood directly in front could the effects be felt but it did give small relief. The room didn't feel like it had ever had a proper clean. I wore socks or flip-flops when I was in the room as the carpet had visible stains. The sink was disgusting, practically orange with rust and scaly taps that have long lost their sheen. There was a decent tv in the room, which drowned out exterior noise - I often heard doors slamming during the night. The ceiling also had a lovely damp patch right above where I was sleeping, a charming sight to drop off to. Now, the bathrooms. I've seen reviews on this site complaining about the shared bathrooms, frankly this is an oversight and complaining in unjustified. Complaining about the state of said shared bathrooms is totally justified - they were foul. I don't mean dated or aged, I mean filthy. The bath looked like it hadn't been scrubbed for months, disgraceful. Wear flip-flops, sandals, crocks and preferably a gas mask at all times. I had read reviews of rats and cockroaches so was dreading my visit. Luckily, I did not come across any, but I had my eyes open the whole time and I wouldn't have been surprised if I had. I believe the building also houses permanent residents, so expect surly looking old men shuffling around casting evil looks in your direction. The one good point about this place is its location. It's a lovely neighbourhood near great restaurants and bars (Cafe Luxembourg, Citrus, 'Cesca....etc etc) and only about 15-20 minute walk from Times Square.

The building seems like one of the oldest in the city so don't expect anything fancy. The building has a ton of character and is actually quite interesting to walk around in. The room I had was clean and comfortable. It's seen better days so don't expect anything shiny and new. However, all I wanted was someplace safe to leave my things and a clean bed to sleep in at night. This is definitely what I got and for what I paid - it was worth every penny. If you like the finer things in life you won't find them here but overall me and my boyfriend had a wonderful time staying here. I read reviews about bed bugs, strange odors, old men, rude staff and dirty bathrooms however I didn't encounter any of these. The bathrooms were shared but I found them to be very clean. The shower was in need of replacing and was tricky to figure out but me and boyfriend had a great laugh about it.

It is only 2 blocks away from the subway and also from the top half of Broadway (on which there are some great places to get breakfast). It is also only 4 blocks away from central park and close to the museum of natural history. The subway station is on a busy line which goes pretty much everywhere in Manhattan so this is a great place to see everything there is in NY. You can also walk to places like Time's Square.

However inside you are greeted with extremely tired decor and service, which puts you more in mind of a Soviet prison, than of a New York hotel. The building does not appear to have been designed as a hotel - in fact it does not seem to have been designed at all. The corridors are tight and claustrophobic with stained white walls which look like an Okhrana execution chamber. The elevator is old fashioned, slow and noisy, with a door you have to push. Then we come to the room. I am pleased to say that the sheets had definitely been changed and cleaned, which is good as they were the only part of the room which had. The furniture was a mish-mash of old finds, apparently from numerous house clearances and auctions, which were cobbled together to make a strange impression - chipped wood picked out against the stained, whitewashed walls. The sink was not usable - this had not been cleaned in weeks, and had all kinds of soap and skin residues in it. The TV worked...sort of. The cable selection was limited, but what do you expect for $120 a night? That is just about all that can be said about the room, because there really is not much more in it. The only other thing to note is the air conditioning, if you can call it that. The window remains closed, as does the blind - you cannot see out because of some horrible gunge which have accumulated on the panes. Therefore the room gets hot, so you turn on the window-mounted cooling system, which sounds like the coming of the apocalypes. Tip: air-condition the room while you are out, and it will be cool for your return, so you can turn the A/C off and hear yourself think. The location can hardly be faulted, especially not at this price. To find a hotel on W71st, when you are in the price range of Newark airport hotels is fantastic. It is (if you are a bit intrepid and have a day to wander) walkable from all the New York City sites, but the less energetic have only a 10-minute walk to the Subway at 72nd Street. Overall, while I would not necessarily recommend this hotel to a friend, and while it is not a nice place to stay, I think the benefits of its location outbalance the drawbacks of its state.

The key is your expectations. The hotel is clean, but for the first couple of days, I had bugs (not bed bugs) -- my guess is that if the building has bugs, the cleanest room will have bugs too. The room I stayed in was drab but clean -- meaning that the floor and counters were all wiped down. That said, the paint was peeling and the walls clearly had not been painted in years and the carpet was very old. On the other hand, I paid 60-70 a night which is two hundered dollars less than many hotels in the area. The location is great. It took me a couple of nights to get comfortable but I never once saw anything on the bed and the sheets were changed daily. Recommendations: If you just need a bed/shower and can deal with sharing the shower/toilet and very basic accommodations -- consider it. If you are looking to have any kind of romantic involvement -- find a different place. If you will freak out at the sight of any other creatures -- don't even consider it. This goes for most any hotel room: If you do stay there, hang everything in the closet. Keep your bags and luggage sealed. Don't leave your stuff in piles anywhere.

The room was definitely nothing to write home about, but it was good to call home and have a quick laugh! Just don't forget to bring your toilet paper into the bathroom, because there certainly isn't a backup supply. A word of advice, bring your own backup pillow. And some sleeping pills. The matress was awful! The pillow needed to be replaced, it was so thin it was useless! Really, those are the worst things.

My husband and I are on the \" we'll never stay here again\" side of things. From the sound of some of the review - there are obviously many different types of rooms you can stay in, and maybe that makes a difference. If this place really wants to become a hotel, though, then it needs to refurbish the rooms and make them more uniform. What we got was a room not much bigger than a dorm room. Stark white walls, no artwork at all, no mirror or sink in the room. Even if it was clean, it just FELT dirty. Pillows that were the thinnest, barest pillows. And the shared bathrooms... oi. I will say - never really had to wait. BUT- we had to carry our own toilet paper! They supplied it for us, but in our room. We had to take it w/ us when going to use the bathrooms. And the one shower on our hall- no where to hang my stuff. Luckily, I took very little w/ me and was able to precariously hang my bag and towel so that they weren't on the floor- because when I showered, it didn't DRAIN! By the end, I was standing in an inch of water. Trying to dry off and get dressed while standing IN water was quite a test of my balance. And patience. It was also quite hot while we were there- and there is no central air and the bathrooms are not air conditioned either. Very uncomfortable. We've learned our lesson and will be sure to always book earlier so that we don't get stuck at this hotel.

I reviewed it thoroughly on tripadvisor before reserving. The double room cost $100.00, including all fees. The hotel is close to the Hudson at 71st and West End Av. It's about a 15 minute walk from Columbus Circle or Strawberry Fields, 30 minutes walk from Times Square. The Subway stops 10 minutes or less walk away at 72nd & Broadway. Of course, taxis are quicker, but I eschew them. The outside looks fine and it's on a nice shaded street with old and new apt. buildings. Inside, the desk clerk was surly, but someone friendly took us up to our room. The hallway on the 2nd floor (I was in room 2B4) was dank and smelled of smoke. The bathroom was nothing fancy, but clean (there are 2 shared baths on that floor). Close the window when you use the shower or there's no privacy. The room itself was fine. It had a sink, color TV with limited (about 15) channels, a small fridge and a queen size bed. The sheets and floor were clean. The window faced a dark inner courtyard. Other than sleeping, we were in the room about an hour. Our floor in the hotel was quiet and we were very tired from lots of walking, so we slept great. There's a Whole Foods at Columbus Circle (Time-Life Center, an awesome place) and the night before we bought breakfast food and ate at the park along the Hudson River to the West of the hotel. Watched the boats, bikers and joggers go by. By the river, there's a pier, restaurant and a park. I'd also taken an early walk to 80 & Brdwy and bought great bagels and coffee at H&H, which is open 24 hours. Then checked out by 9AM...all in all, a great experience for the price of a C-note.

My dad booked the hotel online because it was cheap and since he was paying for it all I didn't really have any input. When we got there I cried. Seriously. Every horrible thing you read about this place is 100% true. The air conditioning that was supposed to be in the \"suite\" was not installed. The tiny rooms were stifling and cramped. My sister and I shared half of the \"suite\" on a pull out bed. She and I both had itchy, watery eyes after the first night. One of my eyes became extremely red and irritated after the second night. I decided to stop using the pillow (even tho I had covered it with a \"clean\" towel from the bathroom), and instead used a balled up t-shirt to sleep on. My eyes miraculously cleared up. The shower had absolutely no water pressure (altho I hear this is not uncommon in the city) and the drain didn't work, so after a 10 min shower that didn't get you clean, you were standing in a foot high puddle of water in the dirty, grungy tub. I wore my sandals in the shower. Actually I never took my shoes or socks off in the room at all except to sleep. The bubbling ray of sunshine at the front desk was the most miserable man I have ever met. He was there every time we came and went. I suppose if I had to spend that much time in the hotel I would be miserable too. He couldn't even recommend an ice cream shop in the neighborhood, which by the way is the ONLY saving grace for this dump. Then again, my dad and stepmom were fine with this place and looked at it as just a place to get cleaned up and sleep. They have stayed there since and will again.

It was sparsely furnished but clean and the bed was comfortable. Although we did not have a private bathroom (I don't think any of the rooms do), our room had a washbasin and there were two bathrooms (one with a bath, one with a shower) right across the corridor. They weren't lined with marble, but they weren't sick-inducingly disgusting either. The room was spruced up each day by a maid, and we had a small fridge, TV and telephone in the room along with a pleasant view of the private garden of the apartment complex opposite. The nicest thing about the place was that it was reassuringly busy, with a reception desk manned 24 hours by fairly gruff but helpful staff and a terrific bellboy. The neighbourhood was quiet but not dangerously so, and there's a smashing deli/cafe about a block away. The subway (1,2 and 3 lines) was just up the road, with stopping and express trains right into Times Square, 5th Avenue, TriBeCa and other typical tourist destinations.
