The rooms are small but i think it is considered a standard size room for this money in Rome. We arrived for a vacation with my father. we had booking for 4 nights. At the beginning it all seemed quite decent, though the receptionists (each one of them) couldn't even broke down a simple sentence in English, Although late afternoon on the first day the air condition broke down. While reporting this to the reception, the first reaction was a denial which was followed by a promise that it will be fixed by \"bed time\". \"Bed time\" arrived and the air condition was still not operating. The receptionist offered us a different room, and while escorting us he \"realized\" that's it is actually a general problem of the whole hotel. The stuff kept lying to our face threw all the first two days on which we decided to leave. That was probably the worst costumer service experience i have ever had.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roenne, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat and cheap hotel\u201d", "Author": "Resell01", "ReviewID": "UR72813494", "Content": "All in all a great little hotel, situated in the very centre of Rome.

It was quite a walk (with luggage) from the Rome Termini, about 700m although the hotel is nicely located among shops, supermarkets, cafes and even a flea market (during mornings) outside its doorstep. My friends and I were given a triple room on the first floor and the windows managed to block out most of the street noise. Despite my fears in reading the reviews, I found the stay quite pleasant. The staff could speak basic English and were quite helpful ( esp during a unprecedented bathroom flooding incident) in answering queries, acceding to requests and carrying luggage down the steps. The room was alright in size, considering there were three beds, with a safe, working fridge and air-conditioner/heater. My only gripe was that the TV was not working during my 3-night stay there due to some decoder problems. Breakfast was sparse - cold hard bread, meats, cheese, spreads and a coffee machine. Tables were clean and promptly cleared by the helpful chambermaid so no problems there. In all, not too bad for a relatively budgeted tourist-class hotel with no-frills.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot a good choice\u201d", "Author": "Joolsie66", "ReviewID": "UR23327859", "Content": "We were very disappointed with this hotel.

The staff at the desk were not helpful and did not care. The breakfast consisted of a roll and a coffee machine. The 'restaurant and bar' area were only open for breakfast. Moreover, our A/C doesnt work for 2 days, and the temperature outside was 40C. It was very hot in the room and we cant even sleep at night because it was to hot in the room.

List of problems: we were travelling in 6 (3 men, 3 women, not married to each other) we booked 3 rooms with double occupancy. The girls decided to all stay in one room, leaving one of the men on their own. We told the hotel up front we were doing this and initially they had no problem. 2 days later the hotel wanted to charge the man in the single room and extra charge of 30 euros per night for his single occupancy. The clerk that asked us for the money claimed that her manager told her to ask. We asked to speak to that manager and the manager REFUSED to speak with us. We checked out early. We felt harassed and that the hotel was trying to rip us off. Other items to note: buffet breakfast did not have a good selection - lunch meat, bread, crostata, nutella, pre-packaged dry toast. Other hotel we stayed in at least offered cereal and yogurt.
