We arrived here at 2am, bleary eyed due to airport delays. We had to ask the taxi driver to help us find the front door \u2013 we seemed to have the wrong address, with no well-lit hotel lobby, just a bright sign on the wall saying \u2018Hostal Oriente\u2019, above a suspiciously deserted, rainy city square! But no, he pointed out the small intercom on the left of the door, with one button clearly marked \u2018Hostal Oriente\u2019. We hadn\u2019t managed to warn them we were late, so were greatly relieved when a voice came through the intercom, and the door clicked open. The building is shared with other residential apartments, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s quite a select area of the city, and besides, the hotel front door, and every guest room is securely locked. Once inside the pleasant woodlined lobby, make your way to the first floor, which is where reception is. We were extremely grateful at the patience of the night staff \u2013 our Spanish isn\u2019t great, and neither was his English, but he slowly explained things and checked us in. We found out later that 2am isn\u2019t that late in Madrid, it\u2019s a very nocturnal city! The younger staff on duty during the day spoke fluent English and were equally helpful and patient, explaining where to find the things we needed. Most capital cities are expensive. So affordable rooms are either tiny, or some distance from the city centre. However, we found the rooms here big enough for us both, plus suitcases (which were swallowed by the huge walk-in wardrobe) with surprisingly high airy ceilings, and an en-suite bathroom you could actually stand up and turn around in! On the subject of the bathroom, I suffered a cold shower on the first morning, before I realised the tap over the DOOR governed the water temperature, as well as the tap over the bath! Our room had windows opening onto an internal courtyard, which is a fairly typical Spanish custom. No great view, but fresh air, and no traffic noise. Even the front rooms should be quiet, as the square outside is pedestrianized, which is very welcome in such a nocturnal city. And what a location! That deserted square at the front turned out have the opera house on the other side, plus the \u2018Opera\u2019 metro station, plus a taxi rank which was very handy. There\u2019s a \u2018Proxima\u2019 convenience store selling food just across the road. It\u2019s about 10 minutes walk through pedestrianized streets to the main metro station at Sol and Plaza Mayor. The palace is 5 minutes walk past the opera house. Best of all, the streets between the hotel and Plaza Mayor are awash with great restaurants, as well as a chocolate shop recommended by several guidebooks, selling the ever-popular chocolate con churros. We ate at a different restaurant every night here, and there were still plenty we hadn\u2019t visited at the end of the week. Bear in mind that the nocturnal habits of the city mean that shops don\u2019t tend to open until 9.30am, which can be a challenge when you\u2019ve popped out to buy your breakfast. We quickly learnt to buy our breakfast the night before. On the subject of late nights, the yellow airport bus runs all through the night (every 30 minutes), only costs 2 Euros per person, has lots of special racks to carry everyone\u2019s luggage, and terminates at a central location with plenty of taxis available. We saved a lot of money by getting the bus from the airport to the city, and only then taking a taxi from the bus terminus to the hotel. A taxi all the way would have been 30 to 35 Euros. I highly recommend this airport bus, rather than a taxi or the metro. Anyway, enough about Madrid.

We kept the window open all the time and, per our request, the cleaning person didn't use it in this room any more, but still the smell was way too intense.

The rooms that our friends and ourselves occupied were extremely clean, as were all areas, and comfortable. Our room was on the front of the hostal and street noise was heard into the small hours, whereas our friends' room on the back was quiet. It is possible to leave your luggage there while you go off and explore, as we did on our last day. There is a coffee machine in the general area on the second floor, and a table where you can sit and eat lunch or breakfast, which can be purchased from the supermarket opposite. There is 15 minutes of free internet in the same room. McDonalds is virtually next door and serves very good coffee at a reasonable price. The location of the Oriente is superb, just a short walk away from the Palace and Plaza Mayor, from where we got on the Red Top bus and also the starting point for the excellent Sandemans' free walking tour. The Tourist Information Office is also in this location. Both of these were excellent starting points for exploring the city, especially the walking tour, learning a lot about the city from Anouschka, our enthusiastic guide. A tip from her worth sharing is that the Palace has free entrance on Wednesdays for those with an EU passport - but be prepared for long queues unless you get there early. She pointed out the Chocolateria San Gines, just around the corner from the hostal Oriente, where you can enjoy churros and hot chocolate or coffee 24/7 - very nice but very filling - 6 each is rather a lot, we couldn't eat them all! We bought a two-day red top bus tour ticket and did a tour on each day, including transport to the Bernabeu stadium and extra tours in the evening to see the city lit up rather than booking extra night tours for that purpose. You can get to all of the major sights on the red bus. We also purchased the ten trip metro ticket from the airport which can be shared between your party and this worked out well.

The room was nothing to write home about, clean but small. Decent selection of cable channels. Reception was unobtrusive and spoke limited English. No restaurant on-site but tons right in the vicinity. However, as previously mentioned, walkable to almost all major sites in the old part of Madrid. El Prado Museum would've been maybe the farthest, at 20-25 minutes away, but the Madrid metro is excellent. Overall, Hostal Oriente represented good value for a clean, decent property with an excellent location. My room faced the inner courtyard so there wasn't any extraneous noise, but walls are relatively thin so I could hear snoring from another room (!) I was happy with my stay and would recommend. Travel tips: (1) It\u2019s worth checking on-line to see what events are on during your visit. You may be surprised to learn of the many free things available. For instance, I lined up with the other (cheap\u2026 er, budget conscious) artlovers at the Prado Museum. Usual entry is \u20ac10 but the museum is free from 6-8pm. The line moved quickly and within 10 minutes, we were in. Invest \u20ac3.50 of the money you saved on an audioguide, an excellent resource for giving the history and interesting backstories of the many Biblical and mythological-themed works. (2) Another valuable freebie is Sandeman\u2019s city tours (www.neweuropetours.eu). Done by excellent passionate freelance guides, there are free walking city tours (guides work on tips only) as well as reasonably priced paid tours in 14 cities across Europe. (FYI, the guide must pay the tour company \u20ac2.50 per passenger, so remember to factor that into your tip). The 3 hour walking tour I did was an excellent orientation to the city. (3) Using the metro from the airport to get to Hostal Oriente was an easy 50 minute trip. Yes, you have to change lines twice, but I arrived in the early afternoon and the cars were never overcrowded. Madrid offers discounted 10-trip metro cards. There is also an unlimited 2-day tourist metro card that is roughly the same price. However, note that trips to / from the airport will require a \u20ac1 supplement.

We only dealt with the staff either early in the morning or late at night, and the one man we dealt with only spoke Spanish, so it was a little difficult communicating with him (but not impossible). The one negative aspect of our stay was the air conditioning; as soon as we turned it on, a strong unpleasant odor (likely stale tobacco) filled the room. However, we got used to this pretty quickly and it didn't bother us for long. Otherwise, the rooms were great value for the price we paid!", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Pimlicogirl", "ReviewID": "UR73689650", "Content": "I chose Hostal Oriente because of other reviews on tripadvisor, and I feel like I made a good choice. We stayed for four nights at the end of July, beginning of August, during Madrid's hot summer, and the AC functioned very well. Our room, although *quite* small, was clean and well-maintained. Towels and sheets were changed daily (although I would have liked the option to skip that, simply because of the waste involved). You do have to put your hotel key in to activate the electricity, which means that AC does not stay on during the day -- but it's a matter of minutes, once you return, to get comfortably cool again. (I say this not really for myself, but there are others who have little tolerance for less-than-frigid rooms when it's hot). The staff were incredibly helpful with suggestions for where to eat and how to get around. I speak Spanish, so I have no idea how good their English skills are. The best thing about this hotel is the location: steps away from the Opera metro station, a short walk to the Royal Palace in one direction and a short walk to Puerta del Sol in the other. If the temps are a bit cooler than they were for us in the summer, I'd say you could even walk to the Prado in about 20-25 mins. Even if it is hot, the metro system in Madrid is wonderfully efficient, easy to use, and cheap (1 euro trip, no apparent limit on transfers), so you could duck underground to save some time and/or strength. The area where the hotel is in is safe, if incredibly busy -- there are lots of people around, all the time. The hotel has free wifi (you need to ask for the password at the desk), as well as a couple of public desktops for guests to use. The walls are a bit thin, so if you have neighbors, you'll hear them. Most people are out and about all day though, so this wasn't a problems for us. All in all, if you are looking for a good base for exploring Madrid, this is a good one. It's a good value, in a great location.

Aside from these minor annoyances we had no complaints about our stay at all, finding the hostal excellent value for money. The major plus point of Hostal Oriente is its location, which we found perfect for visiting most of Madrids sights. It is within a 100 meters from the metro station Opera, and only a 5 minute walk to the Palacio Real, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor & The Gran Via, a truly ideal location and one of the cheapest in the area as well.

Initially we were worried sick as we thought it might be right on the borderline of being a hostel and a hotel but once we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised at how lovely this cheap little hotel was. The entry is a bit offputting as the reception is on the first floor of a building shared wth appartments but once you are inside the d\u00e9cor throughout the rooms and public areas is very nice and fresh and the whole place is spotlessly clean. The reception staff were very friendly although they had very little English but it was easy to make yourself understood. Our room was a pretty decent size and very modern with a good sized cupboard and a french window looking onto the street below that was excellent for people watching! Double glazed windows meant that the noise at night wasn't too bad at all. Although there was no breakfast there were drinks machines in the public area and the free internet was a nice touch. The best thing about this hotel thouhg was the location, right in the heart of the old city next to a metro station and minutes walk from the palace, cathederal, puerta del sol, plaza mayor and surrounded by restaurants and caf\u00e9s.

It is a great location - within walking distance of most of the sights. The staff member who let us in had no English, and we have no Spanish, but we managed to make ourselves understood. Our room, 104, was a good size, clean with a small bathroom. The window faced onto a courtyard that was more like an outdoor shaft or chute. The room had a very strong smell of incense which we later realised came from a craft shop underneath. Not a good room for asthmatics. It was also oppressively hot, even though it was late November. We had sleepless night because of some very loud whirring sounds from the shaft, the heat and the smell. We decided to ask to be moved. Another staff member could not have been more accommodating and gave us a fabulous room (207) overlooking the Plaza. It was noisy at night with people having fun on the street and in the morning with rubbish collection, but we didn't mind 'cos it was bright and airy with no smell. There is free wifi and the use of a computer on the second floor. Towels are changed daily. We asked for extra pillows but didn't get them - I think the chambermaid didn't understand me.
