Dollars plus taxes without breakfast. Had a room in the back side of the Hotel overlooking a parking lot. Nevermind about that. Positive remarks. The room was big, with 2 double comfortable beds. The bathroom was also quite big. Wifi internet was free (quite low speed but worked properly) Negative remarks. There was no safety in the room and every time you needed to go to the reception, ask for the safety, sigh the paper, escorted by the front desk assistant etc. Closet was a joke. A corner before the bathroom turned to a closet with a hanging rail and an iron board. OK take it easy. It's not that it's a big deal but when you pay almost 180 dolars per room some amenities should be in average level. Carpet was old and decoration also looked very tiring. The point that make me rate this hotel as a poor one was the Breakfast issue. We had breakfast and we payed almost 90 Dollars! Breakfast was 15 per person plus taxes, plus gratitude (adult), half price for children under 12. My second son is 12 and 1/2 and honestly I've told to the waiter who charged him as adult! Alright someone can say it's no big deal but another waiter the day of our arrival mentioned,depending in the quantity the consume!!!. That was funny. When you're paying more than 370 canadian dollars per night for 2 rooms, it's really ridiculous to pay another 90 dollars for breakfast. And the Breakfast buffet? Bacon and eggs, 3-4 types of cereal and some fruits. One type of yogurt, no bread we had to ask the waiter to bring us some, no water, same call the waiter, no cheese selection, as a matter of fact not any single piece of cheese, no ham, no, no. Croisant? Yes. They must have been there over a week. It was really ridiculous. Because we were travelling from Europe we only had one adaptor to charge our mobile phones. We've asked in the reception for a spare, they told us go to the store! The store was inside the Hotel, selling basic accessories in double or triple price. We've bought a single adapter for 5,8 dollars (Could got 4 in a pack in the airport for the same price, silly me). Staff of the Hotel, Front desk, concierge, average level, cleaning in the room was very good. If I will stay again in this Hotel? I don't think so. Location was right in front of the lake but you needed a good 10-15 minutes walk to get to Front and Yonge street where you can tell that center of Toronto starts. P.S. Coffeemachine in the room? Yes. Hair dryer? Yes. Did they operate together in the 2 plugs in the bathroom? No!

I requested and received a higher floor room (6th floor) because I was concerned about noise from the street. It turned out to be fine with the higher floor. Curtains had two closures to shut out the light but the room had 45 degree upper windows which only had sheers. I'm an early riser so it really wasn't a big factor. Buddy's room had a great view of the harbour but of course he paid more for it. The buffet is a fair priced breakfast with good choices of sausage, bacon, potatoes, fruit, cereal, etc. For $15 for Toronto that's not bad. The pool and roof balcony was great with available service on it for drinks. Great way to have a coffee in the morning or a night cap later in the evening. Yes it did get a little crowded in the afternoon but it was too hot for me by then anyways.

The buffet breakfast (which is extra) has a wonderful selection of fresh fruits, cereals, breads etc, but the 'hot' entree included in buffet rate, was always luke warm and kept warm for far too long.

On the second day of stay, I left the hotel so that I would miss any situation that might come up. On returning at 4:00 PM, my room was not cleaned at all. I reported this to the manager and he immediately sent housekeeping up to my room. When I saw the maid who took care of the \"entire\" floor, she was almost in tears and \"actually\" running from room to room. I told her to just take the trash and give me some towels and we will call it even for that day. The point of all this is, its just not the hotel that can look bad, but how MANAGEMENT run it. Sure, I will tell others about The Radisson.

I stayed in a corner studio room with a glass wall offering a view over lake Ontario, islands and the marina. Even the bathroom had a glass wall. A telescope was provided in the room to have a better look at the harbour islands. I booked a romance package so we had a chance to enjoy sparkling wine and strawberries in the room. Other amenities included an electric fireplace, plasma tv, coffee maker and special adjustable mattress - - which you may make harder of softer using the attached control. Standard rooms are also large and offer lake views. Especially nice is watching the sun rise over the Ontario lake while have breakfast in the restaurant. It gives a resort feeling and you forget that this is one of the busiest cities in North America. Breakfast was delicious with fresh berries, fresh juice, hot toasts, omelette, ham etc. A glasswall separates the restaurant from an open terrace with an open swimming pool. The pool opens only in summer months, so i didnt have chance to use. Instead i used the terrace for taking pictures of the lake Ontario and the CN tower. We were desperately looking for a smoking area, but unfortunately smoking is allowed only outside. We went to Pier 4 restaurant for dinner - right next to the Admiral on the pier as its name suggests. Excellent stakes and fresh fish and seafood. Peep in to look at the \"fishing\" decor as well. Harbourfront is a land reclamed from the lake (original water front was at the level of the Front street) and represents a park area with open cafes in summer and skating ring in winter. It is a good idea to take lunch or dinner cruise on Ontario - thus you will be able to take \"postcard view\" pictures of the Toronto skyline. The harbourfront has a very relaxed atmosphere compared to the neighbouring business district. Though it took us 15 min to walk to our partners' offices in one of the main towers.

We walked from the Rogers centre (5min) to the subway stop (another few minutes ) which can take you more or less anywhere. Staff were very friendly. So friendly in fact, that when we checked in they gave us the keys to someone elses room! Eventually got our own room that had a spectacular view of the CN tower. Room clean, plenty towels, bed comfy, fine . Agree with a previous review about the pool. We were there on a Sunday and myself and 15 y o daughter went up to the pool. We both felt really uncomfortable up there - it was packed with a young crowd, drinking. I must state that there was no shouting or messing about, they were all very well behaved, it was just there were so many of them there was no space. Apart from that, the hotel was extremely quiet in the night, breakfast the next day was very good, and all staff we encountered were helpful and friendly.", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Service\u201d", "Author": "kat0333", "ReviewID": "UR8273670", "Content": "Staying at the Radisson was the worst travel decision I have ever made. My boyfriend and I booked in advanced over the phone and were looking forward to a great weekend in Toronto unfortunately staying at the Radisson proved to be stressful. When we arrived we decided to pay for the hotel/park so that we could enjoy the day. First off our vehicle did not fit into the hotel's parking garage. The only solution that the staff gave us was to park a block away for 15$. This did not seem too bad but once we got over to that parking lot we were informed that there was no in and out privledges and we would have to be out of the parking lot by 7am or else we would have to pay another 15$ even if we were leaving at 11am. This was ridiculous and we had all of our belongings in the vehicle. After arguing with the front desk staff we were given a room early so that we would not have to leave all of are valuables in the vehicle a block away. The problems did not end here either. A few days after returning home I was checking my visa bill and sure enough both myself and my boyfriend were both charged for a room at the Radisson. This made no sense at all. I booked the room and needed to give them a visa number to hold the room. Once we arrived my boyfriend gave them his visa to swipe and pay for the room. This was not a problem until we both got charged for rooms. So far the staff and management have not been very helpful. I do not know if this is because we are in our early 20's or if this is the service that they alwasy provide. I would not recomend the Radisson to anyone I know not because of the facility but purely based on the service we received.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201cO.K - Watch out for outdoor pool ( open to public)\u201d", "Author": "lovelatte", "ReviewID": "UR8255637", "Content": "Positives - location is o.k Here are the negatives- 1. Outdoor pool OPEN TO public. When we arrived on Sat it was full of 20 year old party people and alcohol was served. 2. The parking is also a lot which is open to public. You have the p3 (third floor) but I don't like parking with same acess as public esp if you have any valuables in car. 3. The ventalation in our room was terrible. There is no fan in washroom and AC blasted on top of you. Some of the washroom smell was ventalated to living room. This might be just our room but bad experience.

I have stayed at many conference hotels before and they are not necessarily what I would choose for a holiday. We were very pleasantly surprised. The location is fantastic. We had a room with a view overlooking the harbour. The room was fully equipped, spacious and clean. So quiet it was lovely. The bed was amazing. My husband had spinal surgery 18 months ago and the bed on holiday makes or breaks our holiday. This was the best we have slept on at a hotel. Far better than the overrated Sheraton sweesleeper. Each side of the bed has adjustments to how hard you want the bed to feel. great toy. The Hotel is ten minutes walk from the CN Tower (Don't miss it, it cured my fear of heights) and fifteen minutes from the entertainment disctrict. Reception staff were efficient but the Concierges were wonderful. they really made our stay special. Small touches like the free mineral water replaced daily meant that you really felt welcome. We walked into the city each day to find breakfast but ate at the hotel on the last day. The food was very good and excellent value and the atmosphere was lovely. The service was attentive but not intrusive.

After reading reviews here I was very hesitant to stay at this hotel but am I ever happy that I did! The rooms were just as they show online and I loved the view! The pool was not open (disappointing but understandable since it has been still quite cold, just happened to be there on a warm day) You can tell that they have recently renovated as everything looks so fresh and clean. The staff were nothing but friendly to me and were happy to bring me extra towels when I asked. The restaurant is glorious overlooking the water and the food was just scrumptious! I really enjoyed having a lounge available in the evening to relax at after a long day of sightseeing. Location was fantastic being by the water and by all of the attractions. We found it quite useful to be able to leave the car parked and to take the trolley right outside of the hotel and to the subway to get us around - good job Toronto on your transit systems!
