The owner treated his employee like he was an idiot for not knowing how to fix it. However, the clerk was nice enough to give us a room closer to the pool for our \"inconvenience\". A couple of days after returning home, I was looking over my statement online and noticed that the hotel had charged us twice for our stay. I called the hotel immediately and the man that answered the phone said he had to take his daughter to school and would call me back. No call back that day. Called my bank and they have credited the charge while it is investigated. Called the hotel back and was by clerk that all I had to do was fax a copy of my statement showing the double charge. Faxed the copy to them and received a call back from the owner stating they would not reimburse because there is a credit on my statement. I explained that the credit is from my bank because I disputed the charges and per the bank rep he would need to repay the bank as he's been paid twice. He refused to reverse my charges stating that the bank already took the money from him. I gave up and decided to let the bank fight it out with him. He will have to repay as he only has one receipt signed by me. I will NEVER stay here again. Do yourself a favor...pay a little extra to avoid the trouble.

(I thought as a member I could get a better deal than what was offered.) The room we got, while clean, was near the road and had NOWHERE to hang clothes that were on a hanger except right under the TV stand. Even though it was a non-smoking room, there was a musty smell when we first arrived and the only blanket was the comforter on top of the bed. (This had a hole in it). We did have some difficulty with noisy neighbors, but given it was over New Year's, I'll discount that. Most ABVIs have breakfast--this one does not. The parking is difficult to maneuver out of. Our room key demagnetized one day early(!). (Trying to tell us something?) To top it all off, we had asked the front desk clerk early on in our stay if we could have a 12:00 check out. He said no problem, \"at no extra charge\" We were surprised, when we received a knock at 11:00 from someone asking us if we were leaving or were staying another day. He was surprised when we told him of the arrangement. I only give this a 3 star because the hotel is on the beach, the room was clean when we got there (although our bed was never made over a three day stay) and there is a nice lounge area near the pool.

I checked in and went right to my room. It was a large single room with tiled flooring. It was very clean, but had a very musty smell. There were 2 tiny cakes of soap in the bathroom and no shampoo. One of the 2 lights by the bed did not work. The room had an older tv, but was in good working order with a large number of channels from which to choose. Aside from the lingering odor, the room was ok.....and $119 for two nights is a bargain these days. Besides, the motel was directly on the beach and was attractive on the outside. My 2nd night was a nitemare! No fault of the motel, directly anyway. It seems they registered a large group of people around midnight. For a good 2 hours, these people hollered back and forth. The ones in the room above me made one heck of a racket all that time. One of their car alarms (just outside my room) went off 4 times. That led me to believe they were breaking into cars. They were not, however. Just wandering around the parking lot and making a lot of noise. My second day, I decided to ask why I was not charged $35/nite. I was told that price was for just a few rooms that I definitely would not want to stay in. He even told me he would show me those rooms to prove that I wouldn't want them!

It was his dilligence at getting us the best rate and the exact room we needed, that closed the deal. He showed us the rooms and walked with me around the property. It was the weekend and we came with no real plan. The hotel looked really nice, and when he showed us the room, all I can say is that it smelled good, nice tile floor, bathrooms with no rust or water stains from a drippy faucet (yeah, you know that hotel), no sign of mildew or mold. Free of sand, and neat looking room with fridge, micro, HBO and internet. Our room overlooked the pool so my kids could come and go without me having to follow them everywhere, and the beach was a hop away. Upon entering the room, my toddler immediatly, accidently, locked himself in the bathroom. Brian was there in a minute to let the little guy out. At 9:00 PM, when I couldnt connect to the internet, he was there again. A man constantly swept sand and debris from the parking lot, stairs and walkway. Renovations were going on all day near the swing that overlooks the ocean. Can't wait to see what it turns into next year. We asked for some extra towels and things, and by the time we got back from breakfast, everything was there. I have to say, this was truly our best Daytona Beach vacation, alot due to the hotel. Small and quaint, it provided the 'family' vacation we were looking for. Never crowded, always a place to relax. We did go up and down Atlantic Ave. stopping in to different hotels. Iiiiick. Condensation building in the hallways, puddles and sand on the broken cement floors, doors that don't really close, much less lock, and sandy gritty beds that make you wonder. Have I mentioned the smell??? What IS that smell anyway? We will definatly be booking next year, or sooner if possible. And one more little detail that really made our day----On our last day, of course the kids HAD to feel the waves one last time. Van packed as checkout time came and went....

The rooms are small and cheaply furnished. They are also over-priced. The motel owner / manager seems to be a complete neurotic and follows the guests around - when my friend challenged him we were told he was checking for extra guests for which we had to pay (there were only two of us in a 2 bed room!). There are only a couple of rooms with ocean view and these are grotty too (small windows) - the rest overlook the car lot.", "Date": "October 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cnever stay here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1714832", "Content": "we have reservation for this hotel but the owner of hotel tried to screw us over. we was booked at 90 a night but when we got there he wanted to charge us 199 a night. our room was suppose to be with 2 double beds but he did not give us that room he gave us a room with queen bed and no room to move around. the room was a dump the owner will not work with you.never stay there", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Americas Best Value Inn - Daytona Beach North", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d241011-Reviews-Americas_Best_Value_Inn_Daytona_Beach_North-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$49 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1400 North Atlantic Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32118</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "241011", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cb/e6/b1/exterior.jpg"}}
