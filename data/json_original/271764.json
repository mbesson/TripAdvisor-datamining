Our room had a tiny bathroom with a tiny bathtub shower combo, but it got the job done. No breakfast, but some tasty cafes nearby.

All this can be reached within 30 min walk. The people at the hostal is very friendly and smiley and they are always available for any question and will always give you advice for whatever you need. Rooms are basic and clean. We had private bathroom, a big bed and a closet, no need for more. The only problem is we had a double room (couple), it was a big bed but with 2 \"one-person-mattresses, maybe add a note if you want a big mattress.

The rooms are a decent size and are cleaned every day. The hostess, M. Antoinetta, is very accommodating. It has free WiFi. The Bad: Worst beds ever. do what ever you can to avoid the double beds. The walls are tissue paper. You can hear a pin drop down the hall. The pipes are loud as hell. Meaning that you are able to hear bowel movements and showers for everybody above and around you.

First of all, the hotel is located almost in the core of the city\u2019s heart right behind the Thyssen Museum, with its quiet street accessing two of the most major roads in the area. You can\u2019t beat this easily \u2013 being right in the centre but not near central traffic mess. The hotel, though it doesn\u2019t match in \u201cperfection\u201d with its location, nevertheless its whole deal is still pretty unbeatable too. The \u2013 circa 1940 and even backwards \u2013 entrance hall strikes you with a little bit creepy feeling \u2013 not the best welcome. The staff is not that knowledgeable of the ways around but they provide any assistance they can, they smile and they keep the room very tidy. The room itself had no view and it was as small as anyone can expect from a two-star hotel, but it was clean, always warm and the large double bed for single use, as well as the whole rouge d\u00e9cor of the room, made up for that. The amenities were minimum \u2013 better bring yours \u2013 but the shower was more than satisfying for such a hotel \u2013 perhaps the best curtain-shower system I\u2019ve seen for ages \u2013 and the water was always hot. More surprisingly good additions were the ample number of jacks for recharging my devices, the choice of having a safe-box and most of all the free wireless internet access \u2013 without needing a new password every 24h. Apart from the details mentioned above, the only thing that could have interfered with any guest\u2019s peace of mind, is the almost non-existent room noise insulation from the noisy wooden floor of the corridor outside and the old heavy doors of the main entrance, but I am a heavy sleeper \u2013 especially after the unstoppable everyday touring of the city \u2013 so this lack didn\u2019t bother me much.
