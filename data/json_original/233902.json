The bed was very comfortable, the room was exceptionally clean, and the lavendar toiletries were a nice touch! The staff was excellent...they spoke great English and treated us like queens (they also gave great restaurant recos).

Our room had furnitures and curtains from the last century, but this actually gave it a romantic appeal. The room was located in an annex some 75 meters from the hotel reception and the main building. That was a good thing. It was peaceful and had windows facing a narrow canal only rarely trafficed by gondolas. We almost felt that we stayed in a room in a private Venetian appartement. The area in which the hotel was located was perfect. We have been in Venice before, and the number of tourists is an obvious deal braker when it comes to the romantic ambiance we were looking for. But the Santa Marina hotel was located on a relatively peaceful piazza only 3-5 minutes away from the famous San Marco square (\"to the left\"), 5-8 minutes away from the busy seaside (broad) walkway Fondamenta Nuove, and 5-8 minutes away from the Rialto bridge (\"to the right\") and the very (!) busy shoppping area that surrounds the bridge.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "avignon", "Title": "\u201cDon't go there!\u201d", "Author": "Vero L", "ReviewID": "UR128129247", "Content": "We booked a deluxe room and they downgraded us when we arrived.

The second reason not to stay there is that in five morning I only once managed a hot shower. And in this five days not once were the only 2 glasses in the room washed. One of the plastic cups was used the first night, and it was never replaced. I would have thought that a 4 star hotel could at least provide clean water glasses. And still another reason to take a chance some place else is that cash disappeared from the safe.

I like to be able to make a cup of tea just before bed time :( The hotel reception staff were not very friendly or welcoming and didn't seem interested in assisting, and even rudely advised someone to go and sit and wait as they were busy and need to wait. I didn't think it was necessary to speak abruptly to the poor guest. The hotel had free wifi internet access in the lobby which was very handy.

We checked into room 501, which is on the ground floor of the hotel. The room was tucked behind the front desk. Our windows, which were described as having a \"courtyard view\", opened into the interior dining area. We needed to keep the windows closed and the shutters locked for both safety and privacy. As the air conditioning is only available in summer, our room became quite uncomfortable. The shower was tucked into the corner of the very small bathroom and there was no shower door or basin to stand in. Instead, there was a semi-circular shower curtain. As there was no real shower floor, the water would flood both the bathroom and bedroom when used. When we asked the front desk how we could successfully shower without flooding the first floor, they said it has been an ongoing problem. We did ask if there were other rooms available, but there were not. I was even willing to move to another hotel but the front desk gave up after calling just one other hotel. In the morning, we were awoken by the early morning staff setting up the breakfast buffet and later we were able to enjoy the bustle of all of the guests dining. I suppose we could have just opened our windows and grabbed some food from the tables directly outside of our room. We did contact the management by email (the desk staff said that they had no latitude in these matters), and we were told that as Venice is a historic city, the rooms in the hotels are often \"elastic\" in nature. They offered us a 15% rebate for our inconvenience which we declined as being just insulting. My feeling is that while some latitude must be given to old hotels in terms of the accommodations, there is no excuse for a hostel type room in a 4 star hotel. I would also say that while the breakfast was adequate, it paled in comparison to the breakfasts provided by our hotels in both Rome and Florence.

We overlooked a waterway, and could actually see the gondoliers passing by our window. We had two major issues with this hotel. The first is that they were having work done within the hotel, and we were woken up early each morning to the sounds of the work crew. We were especially surprised one morning after breakfast when we went back to the room to find a workman in our room. We immediately spoke to reception (who weren't aware that anyone would be in our room), and they handled that issue. The other problem we had was that on the last night we had ants in our room. A previous inhabitant had left crumbs in the table between the glass overly and the edge of the table, and a large number of ants had made their way to it.

We initially booked a room in the annex & upon our arrival Max said they had overbooked but we could have a free upgrade to a room in the main building (right above the front desk). The room was the CUTEST room in any hotel I've ever stayed. It had fabric covered wallpaper and traditional Italian design. The continental breakfast was filling and the cappuccino was ok. I did hear another guest say that you could ask the girl to make it fresh behind the counter instead of using the machine. The location was GREAT. We walked everywhere, to the Rialto bridge, to St. Marks Square, the Vapereto, etc. We even used a nearby laundry mat that laundered our clothes & delivered them to the hotel for us while we were sight seeing. One afternoon it rained cats & dogs so we bought a bottle of champagne and drank it in the lobby while researching a place to eat. We found the place with THE BEST MEAL WE'VE EVER EATEN IN OUR LIFE in the L'Osteria di Santa Marina which is right in front of the hotel.

Upon arrival, we were nicely received at the front desk, the ladies there were very friendly and gave us a map for Venice and tips & hints where we could go. The first two rooms given to us didn't have a view, they were quite dark, due to the fact that the windows are very small - which is due to the venezian architecture of the house. In the parent bedroom, the matrace of the couple bed was not so good and the bed size was not that large, so we requested another room with two single beds put together. Both the reception and the luggage person were co-operative and helped us find the room we liked. Nonetheless, our sons' room didn't havea view at all and there room was quite dark and small. In turn, the decoration was nice and we liked the different style of each room. Also the nicely decorated entrance area of the hotel, with sofas, desks and a good ambiance is perfect to relax after long walking and sightseeing days. I was expecting more from the bathrooms, they were praised a lot at the website and also the photos of the rooms on the website looked nicer than the rooms actually were. Our bathroom didn't have a window and the hairdryer was broken. The bed day covers weren't super clean. At night, some ventilators were making quite some noise and if you have the room towards the backwards canal, it gets noisy very early, because the garbage ships start quite early. What we liked least was the breakfast experience. Breakfast is served at a covered terrace with heating columns that are turned on if it's cold. There is no italian coffee, just instant coffee from a coffee machine. The buffet is not very attractive, instead of fresh fruit, canned fruit salad is available and some cheese and ham. It seems that the breakfast room doesn't have a kitchen, a paravent is placed in front of two doors where personell has to fold this paravent several times until they can access these doors, all seems a bit complicated. For instance, the waitress got really annoyed when the coffee machine went out of order and this waitress was super stressed and not very friendly. For the room prices, we would definitely have expected a better breakfast with a good italian coffee and personell with a smile on their face - particularly in the morning this really makes the day start better!

It was a relief to be able to speak to someone in english, and it reduced the stress level of being in a foreign country. All staff was warm and gracious, helpful and quick to accomodate. Rooms were very satisfactory, clean, and lacked nothing as far as I was concerned. The continental breakfasts were very good, plentiful, and the wait staff efficient and hard working. The location of your hotel was centrally located to all activities and attractions that we required to see. A very friendly,appealing, and inviting outside look about it. Many, many thanks for all who made our stay most enjoyable. I could not think of one thing to make your hotel better! And I would highly recommend to anyone I know will be traveling to Venice.

The Hotel entrance was nicely decorated in Vanitian Style. The room was clean and overlooked the square. One negative thing to say was I personally did not think the room and bathroom was up to a 4 star standard compared to other hotel's I have visited through out the world. Apparently the hotel has not got double beds so two single beds have to be placed together for couples. Apart from that, the stay was perfect. The staff were extremly helpful and spoke excellant english. Breakfast was in ample supply and was served until 10.30am. We took advantage of the free excurison to Murano, a taxi picked us up from the back of the Hotel where it took us to the Murano Island, but be expected to find your own way back, I suggest a bus ride which cost a few euro's and leaves every few minutes. You can purchase a bus ticket from the local tabacco shop located near the bus stop. One tip for you. If you fancy a sit down with a caffe', dont bother walking for hours looking for a cheap place to have a seat and a caffe', take advantage of the cafe' opposite the Hotel!

The only slight disadvantage of a room with a view is the noise of boots late at night and first thing in the morning. This may irritate you if you are a light sleeper. I would say that the night porter was a bit rude. When I asked for some hot water he said no (I had a sore throat and wanted to take a lemsip ). I thought this was a bit off given that it is meant to be a 4-star hotel. I asked why this was not possible and he then went on about people asking for hot water, then tea cups etc in order to have sneaky cups of tea in their room without paying for them (there is no kettle in the room).

We checked in and - much to my surprise - the room was perfectly adequate in size. It was also elaborately decorated. Perhaps the low occupancy of rooms in January meant that we were able to have one of the best, but I don't recognise the hotel from some of the reviews posted here. There was a reasonably good breakfast was in the well-furnished dining room, but the hotel does not serve other meals. My only disappointment was the the staff weren't terribly forthcoming about suggestions on where to eat (they simply pointed to the closed restaurant across the square), which is a pity, because there are good places to eat in Venice, even on a tourist budget.", "Date": "January 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Santa Marina Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d233902-Reviews-Santa_Marina_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$145 - $689*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "233902", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/56/f9/56f9f5154dbb3fe519a5263a724bab4e5large.jpg"}}
