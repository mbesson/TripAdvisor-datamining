For this, Hotel Kap rated pretty well. It's on a relatively quiet street that isn't a terribly distant walk from the centre, and was indeed inexpensive. I would note that other travellers should definitely be aware of the very steep stairs - we totally underestimated how difficult it would be to carry a heavy suitcase up them! The staff were also friendly and let us check out in the evening as we had to leave before the front desk opened. The room, however, was definitely budget style. The sheets on my bed were ripped and stained, the shower had mold in it, and the hotel only provided a tiny sachet of soap and shampoo.

Our room was never made up by housekeeping before 4:30 PM. Hotel maintenance over the years has been patchwork and marginally-skilled DIY. I'm pretty tolerant, but this was too funky for my style. Bed sheets were an odd set of 2 horizontal sheets. This was uncomfortable in the night as they'd slide around and get tangled. Bed was very soft. Bathroom exhaust fan only worked one night, then died. In a very humid climate, this caused nasty steamy room. Bathroom sink is cracked. Toilet had no cover on it. Drains stank. Mildew stains in the shower and on bathroom wall. The table in the garden had the same drink rings on it during our entire stay.

Our family room with bathroom was very comfortable. The very steep stairs ( not unusual for Amsterdam) were quite daunting at first but by the end of the week they didn't bother us at all. Carrying large suitcases up those stairs would definitely be a challenge. The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from the Museumplein ( Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum) and Albert Culptstraat Market. It's about a 30 minute walk from Centraal Station ( thankfully away from the crowds and congestion) or a 15 minute tram ride. We had tram passes as part of our IAmsterdam Card package but only used them twice. The city is extremely walkable. We were happy to find a laundromat just a block away from the hotel. The \"Carousel\" restaurant just around the corner makes awesome Pannekoeken and is also great place to stop for a beer in the afternoon. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.

Room: I stayed in a single room which was quite sparten and basic, but clean. It included a single bed, a wash basin and a shower but without a separate toilet. A communal toilet was located along the corridor not far from my room. Admittedly it was a bit depressing returning to my match box sized room! The room did include a very small TV. My room was on the top floor which meant climbing a very steep staircase - but this is typical for Amsterdam traditional houses. Service: The people running the hotel were very friendly and welcoming and happy to answer questions about where to go and what to see as a tourist. They were also helpful pointing out where the nearest tram stop is and how to get to and from the centre. Breakfast: My room rate included breakfast which included a small selection of cereals and breads and coffee and tea. The small breakfast room is located on the ground floor towards the back of the hotel. I found this to be adequate and suited my needs but I wouldn't rave about the breakfast. Location: Located just off one of the outer canals in a quiet street. To get to most tourist sites you would need to take a tram (which run frequently) or taxi. If you want to be within short walking distance of central Amsterdam, you may prefer to stay antoher hotel located a little closer to the very centre. Value: I found the hotel to be very good value. Although acommodation is very basic I found the hotel rates to be very reasonable for Amsterdam. Therefore, I was willing to accept going without any \"luxuries\" in order to get this good hotel rate. I think this ideal if you are looking purely for a base to drop your things, are willing to accept basic accommodation, expect to spend limited time in your hotel room (sleeping only) and will spend most your time out exploring Amsteram.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallinn, Estonia", "Title": "\u201cNothing special\u201d", "Author": "TomasTT", "ReviewID": "UR114085529", "Content": "all premises were worn out, like time has stopped there long time ago. breakfast was average (somewhere I read they offer nice rich dutch breakfast, but then half of the world is offers that \"nice dutch breakfast) Room was clean but oldish.

However, please be advice that their given instructions on how to get to the hotel by tram from Amsterdam Central Station posted in their website and from the letter I received from them was very misleading. As i quote from their letter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cross the bridge back across the water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Seriously, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to cross any bridge at all. The good news is, they edited their instructions already but as a precaution to future visitors, it pays to study the location of the hotel in a map because its really easy to find, they just mess up with their instructions. The room that i reserved was a double with shower and toilet, was pretty spacious but disappointingly the interior was outdated. The bed that was pushed together to make it double was old yet clean smelling. The TV was pathetically small, it was 12 inches so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite hard to watch a program while sitting on the bed. The noise on my next door neighbour was audible and quite annoying especially when I got to rest early. As for the toilet, it was hideous. The sink has cracks on it, there is no holder for the shower, the air exhaust was very dirty which make it very noisy and lastly the toilet bowl was pretty outdated and very funny because the water out of the bowl is in front. Every time I use the bowl I have to constantly flush so as to get rid of any unwanted smell. It was really terrible to use that kind of toilet bowl. (please see pictures) With regards to their breakfast buffet, it was decent continental breakfast which includes bread, cereal, yoghurt, cheese, meat, hard boiled eggs, crackers, marmalades and muffins. As for the drinks, they served coffee, packed powdered chocolate drink, one kind of juice and tea. As for the internet, I have to pay extra 5 Euros valid for my entire stay. The connection was fast every time I use my laptop or iphone in their Lounge area but terribly slow or mostly no signal at all when I tried to access in my room at the 4th floor. Overall, my experience in Hotel Kap was acceptable in a way that things work out just well. It was just pretty sad that the establishment has the upper hand in terms of location but the management failed terribly to upgrade their basic amenities and left the room in their decaying worn-out state.

The neighborhood is very quiet and residential, with kids out playing in the street. We did lots of walking and felt totally safe, even late at night. Beautiful Reguliersgracht is right around the corner, and there are lots of good restaurants nearby on Utrechtsestraat. We also discovered a couple of pubs we really liked in de Pijp, a few minutes walk south of the hotel near the Heineken Brewery (Cafe Berkhout and Gollem II). The staff was professional and competent, and while not overly friendly, they were polite and we weren't expecting the hotel staff to be our new best friends anyway.

Breakfast is decent, with an assortment of cold-cuts, cheese, eggs, bread, and cereals. Breakfast is included with the room and its served 8:30 AM - 10:30 AM.

There were two single beds whereas we would have preferred a single big bed, but it seems this is typical in many Dutch hotels.

Speaking of small, when you sat on the toilet your face was in the sink, really, not exaggerating. Adding to this it was stinking, when we reported this to the front desk, his solution was to put some drain cleaner and that was the end of it.
