Pros:Location, about a 30 minute taxi ride from most Beijing tourist attractions.The price of $ 82.00 Can. (including breakfast for 2).Friendly and helpful staff.Good, plentiful breakfast.Cons:Very dirty carpets in hallways, less so inside the rooms.Low water pressure for showers.No in-room drinking water.There are some points worth mentioning.Our room was rather large with 2 single beds a desk and 1 chair (a second chair was supplied upon request). The bedding was clean and so was the bathroom. The carpets however where not and we kept our slippers on at all times.The bathroom was large with plenty of counter space and a sufficient supply of soap, shampoo, etc. but a minimal supply of toilet paper.The staff, although friendly and helpful, has a limited knowledge of English.The little store inside the hotel is rather expensive compared to the stores just around the corner, however they are willing to bargain.Overall not a bad hotel considering the price.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR955374901", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RenMar1"}, {"Content": "Well kept and Clean This hotel is located in a hutong (alley) , It has a charm of a old Chinese building but since they had just completed upgrading their rooms and interior late 2006 their rooms meet most western standards.The bathroom was clean and the room was well kept .But the door to our room did not close well and had to be forced .They had a good spread of western , local dishes and fruits for their daily break-feast and if you are looking for some peace and relaxation after a long day of sight-seeing ,there is a small cafe in the lobby where you can rest and chat over a cup of coffee or beer.It is a above average TOURIST HOTEL.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR354930492", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tourbugSingapore"}, {"Content": "Very good bargain We were there from Sept 18 to 22nd of 2007. The exterior was exquisite and we were pleasantly surprised by the interior, considering we were paying only 300rmbs per nite. Apparently, they had recently renovated. The rooms we were in (party of 3) were nicely refurbished. The size was quite acceptable. The staff was helpful and many spoke good English. The location was fairly central, within short distances of the tourist favorites (Forbidden city, Tianamen square, etc). Breakfast was included with our rooms and though choices werent exceptional, it was a satisfactory meal. I think the hotel maybe poorly managed in some ways because easy repairs were left undone. A lock plate on a hallway door jamb was twisted, rendering the door uncloseable. It remained that way on the day we left. The toilet flushing mechanism in our bathroom wasnt closing properly, causing a continuous run of water into the bowl. That also was left unrepaired. Finally, somehow there was a leak from the bathtub onto the bathroom floor. A cut and sealed section on the tub indicated it had been ineffectively worked on. As well, this remained unattended. These were all relatively easy and very necessary repairs and yet mgmt sat on its hands.A few more negatives is that the rooms had no safe and no fridge. However, on the plus side the hotel provided room internet access at no charge.I would probably return to this hotel on future visits to BJ becoz of the price and central location. I hope the needed repairs would be attended to by then. Cant complain too much when they charge so little.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR183245725", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Coolpete101"}, {"Content": "bon rapport qualit\u8305 prix   showReview(21900988, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR742696798", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "steftours"}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u6b0d\u4eb1\u9287\ue043\u7d7f\u9287\u4ff1\u4e9c\u9287\ue1ba\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137       \u6d93\u20ac\u9423\ue044\u7568\u9287\u52e9\u510e\u9288\u3083\u5142\u9289\ue0a0\u5157\u9289?/a>", "Date": "Sep 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR272022124", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9287\u70bd\u5031\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288?> \u9287\u70bd\u5031\u9287\u00b0\u5011\u9288?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "Gut        Hotel Frontansicht", "Date": "Mar 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR543707990", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Schoerlchen"}, {"Content": "Das Hotel ist sehr sauber   showReview(14132783, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR386629255", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kihomine"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d647994-r21922001-Traveler_Inn_Huaqiao_Beijing-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "647994", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
