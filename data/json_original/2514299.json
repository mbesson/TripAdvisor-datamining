Being a bit of an ald hand at it now, I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones - it is clear that they have made the effort to try and make it a little more homely (decorating the halls and walkways with pictures and mirrors), and are genuinely helpful and polite, and most importantly on the ball (if you request something with one receptionist you can be sure it will have been passed on to the others).

I opened the door to the \"bathroom\" only to find a closet with a tiolet, sink & shower in it. The sink was so close to the tiolet, you could actually wash your hands whilst on the tiolet.

Firstly , there were two cups & one was filthy, it looked like someone had not even bothered to wash it.

Patel the manager was so helpful both times we stayed in Sept and October, giving info on post offices and local barbers who wouldnt rip a tourist off in London! He didnt try and sell us anything through the hotel, but had info displayed should you want it. When I asked for a hairdryer they bought me one that was brand new in the box and the other staff offered also to carry our suitcases up the stairs for us. I would say the rooms are 'tired' as with all we saw of this type- around the 70-80 pound mark, but the rooms were spotless and cleaned daily. The curtains were old and didnt quite meet and the ceilings had a few plaster patches on them, but that we could live with. They put breakfast on for us before it was meant to open and we appreciated that- Patel also had a great sense of humour and remembered who we were \"Welcome home kiwi's from New Zealand !\" as soon as we returned the 2nd time, a good memory considering we had only stayed 2 days previously.

But fortunately the horrors of the hotel was nowhere to be found...We were 6 people and stayed in two rooms (quad and double), during a peak of activity in the weekend of NFL International Series @ Wembley. The quad room was rather small and a bit crowdy at times, but the overall standard was good. The double room appeared a bit larger than the quad room (strangely), and the standard here was equally good. The reception had been given wrong information regarding the number of beds in the double room, but instnatly agreed to switch rooms as soon as a new room with to single beds became available. The continental breakfast was a bit rubbish, but you can't really say you're surprised. That brings me to the overall perspective. You get what you pay for, so when the overall rate for 4 people in a quad room for three nights comes out to \u00a3255.00, and the rate for two people in a double room for two nights comes out to about \u00a3170.00, you can't really complain about the smallest of things, especially given the convinient location of the place. You should expect a clean room, which was provided to the fullest with dailly cleaning and changing of sheets. You should also expect a service-minded staff, which also was provided in full. Other than that, every other aditional service, is just a bonus!! So to sum up. the Blair Victoria isn't the best hotel in London, and not the best in the nearest surrondings either.

We arrived at 10.00 in the morning, dropped out bag off without inspecting the room. Arrived back at the Hotel at 9.00 in the evening and was given our room key - Room 7. Well what greeted us can only be described as a total slum. Our room was Tiny, Cold, Damp, Smelly. Not to mention the filth ( looked like it had not been cleaned for some considerable time ) One pillow had blood staines !!!. Well the best bit excluding the bathroom was the state of the hair dryer. The plug at some time had over heated and burnt the wire, thus exposing live wires. When I pulled the cable the wires fell out of the plug !! After complaining we were transferred to Room 16. Slightly better but still filthy, curtain rail was hanging off, bathroom was very small and really needed a good clean. The carpets and walls were dirty as was the cups, kettle, etc. Not a very nice place to spend a night. In the morning we made our way to the restaurant for breakfast. Well you had to se it to believe it. The restaurant ( if thats what it can be called ) is down a narrow flight of stairs in the basement of thebuilding. The carpets covering the stairs, like all the others withing the hotel are thread bare and filthy. But nothing compared the the restaurant. The cups, plates, knives, forks, table cloths are discusting. The dust on the chairs was so thick you could write your name in it. Check it out if you do visit this place, look for D & A on one of the chairs !! We just turned around and walked out. After getting our bag we went to recepting to complain. Well the chap who denied he was the manager was totally rude and totally dismissed us as being fussy. My wife told him that we had taken photes of the filth around the place whic really did not go down very well with him. We were actualyy physically pushed out of the door and had it slammed behind us !! Can you believe it ?? a hotel pusing you out because you complain about the filth !! Well I went back into the hotel to voice my oponion about having a door slammed behind me and was then told by the chap ( who says he is not the manager ) that we are only complaining because we are Racist ???? Yes we are a White British Couple, and yes he is of Asian origin, but at no time was that mentioned or more to the point should he have accused us of being racist.

The hotel is very good for visitors who need internet access with \u00a35 a night WiFi access that I didn't have any problems connecting to from the hotel room. The room was small, but clean, and featured storage units, wardrobe, tv, bedside cabinet and en-suite bathroom, which appeared to be recently refitted with shower, toilet and sink. The view from the hotel room wasn't appealing, overlooking over buildings in a yard, but then it is November, and its dark by 4pm in the evening, so that wasn't a problem. The major problem for me was the noise. I was next to the staircase and I could hear every whisper, and every footstep, the walls are thin so you can hear people next door if they are noisy, or have the TV up loud. The hotel appeared secure, and yes you had to leave your doorkey with the reception, but I did not find that to be a major problem.

The best thing about this experince was the price of the rooms, all this set us back next to nothing. the rooms had everything we wanted, large and spacious. decore in the rooms were very good and didnt feel like we were in a BnB.
