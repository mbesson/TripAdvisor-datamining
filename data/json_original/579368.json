BED BUGS!!! This was among the top worst hotels I have ever stayed in. First of all I made reservations two weeks in advance for 3 non smoking rooms, when we get there our room is filthy...literally has not been cleaned with dirty beds and vomit on the floor, it also reaked of smoke. The maids came and cleaned the room apologizing for the mistake. We still refused to stay because the smoke smell was so strong. They moved us to another room that was not as clean as I would have liked but we made due. After getting unpacked I found a dirty pair of socks in the floor that did not belong to us, gross! My grandparents came on Thursday and paid thru Sunday, they had to leave on Friday due to my grandmother getting ill, the front office clerk refused to give them a refund for Saturday night saying the payment already went to the \"corporate office\". The huge problem was bed bugs, after the second night my husband broke out with bights all over his body, by the third night myself and our children also had bites everywhere. We went to the office and they refused to give us refunds or hear us when we said they had bed bugs. We regretably stayed the fourth night because we had already paid and did not want to spend more money.... This is when I actually felt something in the middle of the night and threw the sheets back to find two bugs... I got my whole family up at 5am and put both the bugs in a ziplock. I went to the office that morning with the bugs and they refused to give us a refund, they also argued with me that they did not in fact have bed bugs!! I tried to get a refund for my grandparents and they told me there was no corporate office and they would refund him by sending a check to him, that remains to be seen as he has not yet recieved it. Also they said they had WIFI, they did in the first building but not in the building we stayed at. As for the breakfast, plain donuts and coffe, THAT WAS IT! Not to mention the fact that it was disgusting. The only good thing about htis hotel was the location and the pool. I would NEVER recommend anyone staying here.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe plan on staying here again.\u201d", "Author": "Elbee417", "ReviewID": "UR114719512", "Content": "I was very pleased.

But now they have new managemnet and things are on the up-swing if you like Branson Mo and like to spend your money wisely then the caprice is for you I mean hey its not the ritz but i dont need the ritz at Branson I need a clean room with an indoor pool, hot tub nice people and someone who cares about my stay there even though I only paid $45 to $50 dollars a night before tax I mean really if you have stayed at the caprice and was dissapointed in the past 2-years give it a go again. I'm sure these new people will be able to do more with the place when we all come back and hey we have a stake in this also if the small hotels go away and we all have to pay the big bucks then thats less we have for our families to spend at Branson and enjoy thereselves sure I would love to stay at the raddison but for $125 a night no thanks i\"ll take the caprice and show tickets and take my family out to dinner...... okay caprice folks thanks for the great stay and we will be back so keep up the good work because my grandpa had only one saying that stuck with me forever (if it was easy everybody would do it) hope to see alot of families visiting branson this year I will be back in july for more fun see ya at the caprice.....", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dardanelle, AR", "Title": "\u201cWe'll stay here every time!!!!\u201d", "Author": "JMMH", "ReviewID": "UR25646312", "Content": "We came to Branson in mid August and someone had told us about the Caprice.

The breakfast consisted of donuts and toast with juice or coffee. The outdoor pool was nice and well kept. The indoor pool area was fantastic, but there was way too much chlorine in the water. We only went in once though as it was so hot it was more fun outdoors. The parking lot is small and takes some manuevering to get in and out, but there is an access onto Green Mountain out the back which helps you beat the traffic. Overall, it is a basic place to stay with an outstanding price. My kids loved it as we were able to walk across the strip to Pizza, go carts, and ice cream.

In the past three or four years we have visited Branson probably 5 or 6 times a year and would not stay anywhere else. LOVE IT!! Have gotten offers for rooms at more elegant hotels and we've decided that the Caprice was our place. They always welcome us with open arms and remember who I am whenever I call for reservations.

The furnishing are dated and the bathroom is tiny, but how much room do you need in a bathroom. The parking lot is rough. The hotel has all exterior corridors. My only concern was that the locks on the doors were very basic. I prefer the bar type locks in addition to the deadbolt. The reason I booked this hotel, besides the price, was the indoor pool. The pool was great. Very new and clean. My kids loved it and it was the highlight of their trip. If you go for the pool try to get a room closer to the pool.
