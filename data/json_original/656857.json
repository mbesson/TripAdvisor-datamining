However, this was a special occasion and so I chose a hotel that I thought would be relatively handy for sightseeing and not what I would describe as cheap. Just to make sure, I booked a 'Junior Suite' at a cost of \u00a3528 for three nights. Reception looked promising, check in was dealt with pleasantly and we were shown to our room by a porter who looked after our luggage. The 'Junior Suite' consisted of a long corridor leading into an ante room containing a wardrobe and a couple of chaise long.......guess this was the 'suite' part of the deal. The ante/dressing room was separated from the bed room by a floor to ceiling, sliding, wooden framed, glazed partition. A couple of panes of rectangular, coloured glass were missing.........no doubt one of the previous heavy handed tourists. The bed room was pleasant and the whole place was furnished in the 'faux antique' style. Repro, distressed pieces of furniture that played their part as long as you didn't look too close. Off the bedroom was a small 'utility' space for getting luggage out from underfoot, quite useful. Also off the bedroom was the bathroom. Real marble this time but to be frank, not very well done. The bathroom was satisfactory containing a toilet, a bidet, wash hand basin and a spa bath/shower with a fully glazed screen. Unfortunately, after having tried the spa bath and its not very convincing water jets, water began to appear from under the bath and gradually spread behind the toilet and bidet, almost to the door. We put down the shower mat to stop the water going any further and reported the issue to the front desk. They promised to get someone to look at it . True to their word, someone had be in and re-sealed the obvious joints round the bath with silicon. When we next checked .......you guessed it, water was seeping out from under the bath. We told Reception as we checked out. We could have had a transfer to the airport arranged by the hotel but I couldn't see why we needed to pay 10 euros more than getting a taxi from the taxi rank one minutes walk away. We weren't able to eat in the hotel other than breakfast. This was probably the highlight of our stay at the Romanico. It was taken in the roof top breakfast area and gave an impressive view of the roof tops of Rome...........if roof tops are your thing. It was actually very pleasant, as was the buffet breakfast. The seating areas around the bar were pleasant but the bar prices were not. We actually found another hotel (name of which I can't remember, sorry) with a 'Blue Bar' which was much more reasonable and provided us not only with drinks but olives and other nibbles as a part of the service..............for considerably less than our own hotel. Don't forget you will have to pay the government 'visitor tax' prior to departure....not a lot but embarassing if you're down to just your airport taxi fare having spent all your euros on two liquers from the hotel bar!! The overall experience wasn't unpleasant but I definitely expected more, and won't be rushing back.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vicenza, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, good location.\u201d", "Author": "nats-dk", "ReviewID": "UR127507913", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in a triple room.

We thought it was a complete joke! The location was good and all the staff were lovely and friendly and very helpful - but I am afraid that this is where the good points end! If it wasn't for these points, we would have been plain miserable. On arrival, we were offered an upgrade to \"the best room in the house\" for an extra \u00a350 per night - we agreed and were very excited - until we got to the room. If that was the best room in the house, I'd hate to have seen the bog-standard rooms! The paint on the walls was falling off, the TV didn't work (and was never fixed) and it just looked generally a bit shabby and dilapidated. The website says it has been recently refurbed, a big selling point for us, but we did not see any evidence of this at all.The shower was an awkward unsatisfying dribble and the products provided were decidedly 2 star rather than 4. Just so u know, I have never felt compelled to write a review of a hotel before but this hotel was so blatantly not a 4 star. By far the worse part was the breakfast which did not consist of barely anything! There was gross bimbo style bread (the type you get in spain when yr desperate), 3 types of anemic looking cereals (all gross), dry croissant things, some cake, yoghurts, cheese and ham (all poor quality), no fruit at all unless u begged and they reluctantly bought you out a bit- it reminded me of the sort of continental breakfast you suffered on school trips - not when paying premium rates for a supposed 4 star hotel. I could bang on about this hotel for ages, but I'll spare you all the details - just one other point. When snowed in with the freakish weather of last week in Rome, we tried to order from their in-room menu for room-service. We were told that the hotel does not have a restaurant and that one can only order drinks. The website is extremely misleading as it states there is a restaurant on the roof as is the in-room menu which teases u with food you cannot order (the menu is actually for a restaurant up the road). Insult was added to injury when we spotted a laminated notice with the menu saying that guests are not permitted to bring in food from outside the hotel into their rooms! Absolutely ridiculous especially given they do not offer any food for their guests themselves! I will end this by saying that the spa is average, badly organised and the steam room smells of B.O. We are judging this hotel by its star rating which it does not even slightly deserve and thereby we give it 2 points - simply for the lovely staff and good location.

My wife and I visited the Hotel Romanico Palace from 15 November 2011 to 22 November 2011. This was an extremely horrible experience and I would therefore like to warn others against using Hotel Romanico Palace. We arrived at the hotel late afternoon on 15 November and was assigned room \"118 of the hotel employees, who also made us clear that the hotel room safe was safe to use. We were at a four star hotel, so we chose to follow the hotel instructions. This would prove to be extremely unwise. As we left the hotel room on November 16, we had placed our valuables there among 700EU, before we left the room I entered my pin code no indication either in the passport or elsewhere, while locked my wife both closets, which hotel Safe is located. When we came back again towards the evening, my wife noticed that the closets were not locked anymore, we wondered what caused the hotel staff would have to open our closets. But as things in the closets so untouched out, it was at our amazement. We had not yet opened our safe. Next morning on November 17th when we would leave the room, we opened the hotel safe box and quickly realized that 300EU missing from our wallet. As we remember our amazement from the evening before, we were aware that someone had gained access to our hotel safe and a stolen 300EU. When something like that happens you will always be in doubt, maybe you have made a mistake or you have forgotten to locked the safe box, because you are on a four stars hotel, there is video surveillance and electric door control. If there had been thieves in our hotel room, the reception would let us know. ect. We decided not to say anything at the reception, but to take all our valuables with us, and before we left the room, we mark the hotel safe box so that we outside could see if anyone had been inside the box while we were away from the hotel room. We locked our closets and marked them so it was possible to see if the closets had been opened. When we got back in the evening, we could fast see that our closets had been opened, while we were marking the hotel safe box had been broken. There was no doubt their had been thieves at our hotel room. We approached the front desk and told about the theft, which promised to control the electric door locks and video surveillance. At the same time the receptionist informed that this had never happened before in the hotel, and that all employees were trusted employee who had been there for many years. Yet I decided to \"google\" hotel on the internet, and soon I found here on Tripadvisor a similar incident in March 2010 when an American family had been stolen 200USD. I took my computer with me down to reception and asked them to explain why they not informed about this review on Tripadvisor. The receptionist told me that he knew nothing about the incident, and after reading it, shaking his head and laughed. I told the receptionist that I could not see anything funny in being robbed when you were a guest at Hotel Romanico Palace, and that their safety should be taken seriously. Then the receptionist offered me a cup of coffee in the hotel bar, which I refused. Subsequently day on November 18 we went to the police to report the thieves. In addition to notification and a receipt, the police would not do anything in the case, we called the police to visit the Hotel Romanico Palace, but the distance to the hotel at 50m seemed insurmountable for the officer. When we got back to the hotel we asked the front desk how it went with the investigation. The receptionist who was the same I had spoken with the evening before, could tell that there was nothing to see on video surveillance as well as on the electronic door lock. So no one had been in our room besides cleaning staff. And it was not possible to open the hotel safe box without the pin code which I had used. Hotel Romanico Palace had no boss (manager) key for the hotel safe box and therefore had no access to the hotel safe box: told the receptionist. In that case of the American family, where the hotel receptionist had used a manager key for the hotel safe box, could not be true. It was therefore concluded that my wife and I stood there and lied and we could not have been robbed. My augment with evidence that someone from the hotel had acquired departure for the hotel safe box would not fit. Simultaneously, reception's ability to understand english very bad, actually it was no longer possible to communicate understandably with the reception. The next day when we stayed at the hotel, I tried to obtain further information about Hotel Romanico Palace, hotel safe box, I found that on the back of the safe box was given a service code COD # 20696, as a handheld terminal or a PC via a USB connector on the underside of the keypad on the safe box, could provided access to the SETUP menu on the safe box, and thereby provided access to the information entered. The \"Italian\" reception at the hotel could tell that this was only used by the company that had service on the hotel safe box, and that they had no sense of anything like that. And this was it indeed be true when they say so. After I came back from Rome, I found this on Youtube, it proves that at 50 Laptop Safe box, only need a paper clip, a 9 volt battery, and 2 min, then the box emptied of value. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Q3aDy-BUc Apart from all hassles with Hotel Romanico Palace, had my wife and I a wonderful trip to Rome, a few pleasant days in each other's company with beautiful weather and fun. It remains only to ask yourselves: Why do guests on Hotel Romanico Palace get their money stolen. ? Why have Hotel Romanico Palace none trust to the complaints ? Why should hotel Romanico Palace lie of past events. ? Why was it not possible to see the video surveillance at the hotel. ? Why was it not possible to see the printout from the electronic door lock at the hotel. ? Why do we repeatedly see the receptionist speak in walkie-talkie outside the hotel. ? Why do thieves not only take 20EU 50EU and it will probably never be discover, or maybe that is the reason why there have been so few complaints. ? I must commend the cleaning, it was good, you can say too good. I really can not recommend visiting Hotel Romanico Palace, we welcome all our holidays with our wife, family, children and friends. A nightmare with theft from a hotel safe, a hotel and police are neglecting your review. That movie can we see Saturday night on the television.

This is not a four star hotel. We got there and half of the hotel had no hot water (my room included) - I had a cold and needed a hot bath, I protested at 2pm on Thursday and again on Friday several times. They changed story every day with a different excuse, it was plain obvious they were just trying to buy time, this is inexcusable and the management should really be replaced. The last straw was Friday coming back at midnight having been told before leaving that hot water would be back in 40 minutes time (this was at 9pm) and find no hot water still. I packed everything and went to reception saying they either deal with it or I am leaving and we want our money back also for the last night which we would certainly not spend there. Somehow magically, at 1am we are given another room on the other side of hotel with hot water (however, been downgraded with a horrible bathroom with mold). I say I still want my money back for this and I am told \"you have to wait for the morning to speak to management\". Fine, we go to sleep and early morning my husband goes down and he is now told \"management is abroad\" (!!) and we cannot give you money back because the booking was via lastminute.com.

It was fine, but not as posh as it's trying to be, is the best way to describe it. It's a lovely location in a lovely neighbourhood not far from the Via Veneto; and just a couple of blocks away from the American Embassy compound, so handy it that's your destination. Also walking distance from Santa Maria della Vittoria, home to Bernini's statue of St. Theresa, which was definitely worth seeing. There is a taxi stand a block up the street, and a lovely fruit and veg stand selling amazing fresh produce on the opposit corner. The hotel is pleasant and clean, but the rooms are small, in spite of the grandiose nouveau-Ancient Rome decor. The lobby lounge/bar is very pleasant, and the place where the air conditioning works best in the building. The barman is charming and service is pleasant; he is quick to refill the bowls of nuts and snacks while taking your drinks order. The booze, however, is Expensive! Our room was on the front of the building, and the traffic on the street can be noisy in the evening. The rooftop breakfast room is a nice spot with great views over the city. The breakfast is adequate, but Continental only, not full breakfast, and the service was a bit hurry-up-so-we-can-get-out-of-here. Also, this is the one place in Italy where we encountered bad coffee. I was shocked, but because coffee in Italy seemed uniformly excellent. However, avoid the coffee urn on the breakfast bar, it's awful, and instead order a cappucino or macchiato - they will do one up for you fresh, and there was no extra charge. Drawbacks: no free internet, 5 Euros buys you an hour; no newspapers; no coffee/tea making facility in the room. Also, which I found a bit offensive, a sign in the room informing you that bringing your own food or drink into the room is forbidden! I'm in Italy and I can't bring a bottle of wine into my room to enjoy a quiet drink with my husband, or some snacks for my son? Needless to say, we ignored the sign. This rule struck me as particularly niggling, trying to force you to use the lobby lounge; and when combined with the lack of internet, began to make one feel a bit nickle-and-dimed.

We stayed in a standard double room: Room 222. The room was a little small, but for Europe, that's to be expected. We had no drawers or dressers, just two small closets built into the bed for us to hang up our clothes. We kept most of our stuff packed in the luggage. The bathroom was nice - no tub however. But it was clean and classy, so we were happy with it. The bed is rather firm and the pillows are as flat as pancakes. When I chatted with friends who were staying at a Marriott near the airport, they experienced the same thing with their bedding. Must be the Italian way. We got used to it even though we would have preferred a softer bed. My only real gripe with the hotel is that they didn't inform us that there would be a city tax to be paid upon check out. It would have been helpful for them to mention that to us, especially because they require it in CASH. We had to turn over our last euros that were for our taxi to the airport and then have them call a more expensive cab that could take credit card. Not the best way to end what was otherwise a pleasant stay. The hotel is nearby the American Embassy, a close walking distance to the Spanish Steps and the Villa Borghese.

The room wasn't big but it was more than enough. The staff at the reception were always willing to help with directions, restaurants etc. The breakfast was what we expected- a basic continential breakfast, the big bonus is the view from the seventh floor of the hotel. The only problem i remember is that once (out of 4 times we ate there), the hot water and the coffee weren't very hot- however, i did see the hotel staff fixing the problem after a few minutes. I presonally got the breakfast as a part of a deal, so i don't know the exact price, but one of the other guests told me that it's 25 euros. As I've already written, the room wasn't very big. It had a few other problems: the shower wasn't working too well (the tub didn't drain quickly enough) and the toilet was making a lot of noise when the water refilled. The TV was a small blurry LCD screen, but it did have a few international channels. The hotel lies on a busy street, so there is some noise 24 hours a day (especially because of how common scooters are in rome). The hotel is served by 2 elevators, so there weren't any problems in this regard. Perheps the construction which is mentioned in one of the reviews is one of the elevators, which is the bigger one and seems extremely new. The big advantage of this hotel is its location: around 10-15 minutes from one of rome's metro stations- which makes accessing most of the city extremely easy. Also it's in a walking distance from trevi's fountain, the spanish stairs and the Pantheon. In addition it's just a few minutes from a bus station and there are dozens of restaurants nearby. The hotel offers airport transportation for 80 euros, but it's possible to walk 2 minutes to the nearby taxi station and get there for 40. There is Wi-Fi, but it costs 20 euros per day. In conclusion, this is a good 4 star hotel, great if you want to explore rome more than you want to stay in the hotel. Not perfect, but great value for its cheap price. I'll recommend it for anyone who looks for a cheap hotel in a central location in Rome. *I have to add a short review about the cafe just next to the hotel, which does not appear on tripadvisor. Stay away from it- for the price of average coffee, a piece of cake and average service you can get a full meal in one of the nearby Italian restaurants. I also have to say that the hotel staff did not say anything about it, we just ate there once because it was so close to the hotel.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aviano, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, OK price\u201d", "Author": "Niqueh12", "ReviewID": "UR116158135", "Content": "The hotel location was great, just a few blocks from the Spanish steps and from there we were able to see Trevi fountain and the Coliseum by just following the signs.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel on our last trip to Rome in 2009, and were pleasantly anticipating a repetition of the experience. This time, our 2 adult children (daughter 28, son 26) were with us. I communicated directly with the hotel several months ago to get an appropriate family room. We arrived late morning to store our bags until we could check in. When we got into the room,it had 2 large beds, rather than the one large and 2 twin beds that had been promised. When I went to the desk to complain, they told us that there was an appropriate room (that had been promised), but it wasn't available until the next day. Neither room had any drawer space to hold clothes, which was rather awkward for a week long stay. Neither room had adequate hanging space for more than 2 people. One of the reasons we had enjoyed our first stay was the roof-top terrace breakfast. This time, there was less variation; there was fruit choices, including fresh fruit salad, the first time. This time, there were some limited number of whole fruit. The cold cut and cheese selections had some variations last time. This time, it was standard, with the only cheese every day being Swiss. The breakfast staff was entirely friendly and approachable. The front desk was polite, but not particularly welcoming. The internet was acceptable, but not entirely reliable. With 4 adults, it would have been nice to have had at least 2 keys to the room so that we could come back independently on some days. (Children in their 20s sometimes cover more ground than their parents near 60.) For some reason which I never understood, they said they could not provide us with 2 keys, which were electronic and not physical. This caused some scheduling problems. I asked for 3 extra pillows the first night, which were removed and had to be requested again. I asked for 2 extra towels a day, which were provided once. (I didn't feel like bugging them every day.)

The break fast itself was ordinary, (croissants, some cakes, cereal and fruits). Capaccino was excellent, they even made some designs on it. Coffee on roof top was fun. Staff was friendly and at times also entertained and engaged with my 5year old son. The room was huge, biggest one we got in italy, had a jacuzzi. Rooms were kept clean. Since many folks had warned us against theft in general in italy, we did not leave any important belongings, such as money, passports etc, however from the looks of it, hotel staff was good and trust worthy. The location was average. The closest metro stations were barberini, reppublicca and termini. Termini is about a 20 minute walk and barberini and republica are about 15 minutes. The bus stations are pretty close, we simply took 63, 52 and 910 to the station. Took a little while to get used to the bus routes, but figured it out eventually. The hotel does give the impression that there is a charge for everything, which may make a budget traveler slightly nervous. The hotel in this era should provide free internet, and if nothing atleast a common PC for customers to access. (I had a bed and breakfast which I paid half the cost provide such a service, so would be hard to think a 7 story hotel would not do that). The only other negative feedback I had was, the hotel can get a little noisy. Rome being the last leg on my trip, I was very accustomed to noise so not a biggy. The hotel is at an intersection, so buses and cars can get noisy. Also, air only works in summer and is off in off season like late march to mid april. One more thing, there is a city tax you have to pay in cash at the end of your stay. The hotel will not tell you that when you check in (They should). But since I had read about it, I was prepared. I think its 5 euros a night, so if you have an early check out, make sure you have that cash so you don't have to worry about finding ATM when you have a train to catch in the next hour.

Being American I understand the difference between what we are used to in the States and what is offered in Europe and this is not a fault of the hotel's. We upgraded to a \"suite\" and were comfortable but understand that a suite at Romanico is equivalent to a standard room in the states. The decor is tasteful but looks to have been done somewhat on the cheap. Molding and door frames didn't quite mate with the walls and the feel was of a more modestly priced establishment. The room and hotel itself was very clean and neat. The staff were extremely helpful and professional. The bar wasn't staffed during it's advertised hours but a drink or coffee could be obtained by speaking with the front desk. This was moderatly inconveniant. The bartenders, when on duty, were great and made some great cocktails. The free breakfast was small (no hot food) but very appetizing and a great way to start a long day of sightseeing. The breakfast area was located on top of the hotel and offered some splendid views. The location isn't horrible but not as conveneniant as some of the pricier hotels on Via Veneto. If you're able to travel on foot the location isn't a big game changer but at night if you want to step out for a late drink or bite to eat it's about a 4 block stroll to Via Veneto, although there are some resteraunts and cafe's in the local area. Also, internet access isn't free and must be purchased by the hour. The logout procedure is not always successful which causes minutes to be used up. Something to keep in mind...those euros add up after a while. All in all I can't say that I was disappointed in the Hotel Romanico just not overly thrilled.

AVOID AVOID AVOID\u201d", "Author": "Nandj2011", "ReviewID": "UR97729395", "Content": "Ok, To keep this as brief as possible, my partner and I booked the Hotel Romanico for our anniversary and were looking forward to 4days in Rome. Upon booking the hotel we thought we had secured a great stay, our package included airport transfers, breakfasts and coliseum tickets (the coliseum tickets were a big draw card as we wanted to avoid queues and with pre tickets it would have been perfect) From our arrival to departure things got worse every day, our airport transfer didn\u2019t arrive, after two calls to our hotel they finally said someone would be sent. We waited over an hour in the airport, upon arrival to the hotel no apology was offered and we were told the Coliseum tickets were not able to be booked. (I had given the hotel enough email notifications about our stay to insure the tickets were booked) I could go on forever with things they did not do- but in short, stay somewhere else if you\u2019re looking for a relaxing weekend without any problems. Avoid this hotel at all costs, my wife and I have stayed at a number of hotels across Europe and never have we experience problems like this. The main reason for posting this review is to prevent others from experiencing these problems; it just ruins your holiday! In the end we had to buy our own Coliseum passes and wasted over half the day queuing to get tickets, we then had to claim back the money from the hotel. Total hassle and ruined a day of site seeing. Staff: Unhelpful and rude, no manager to assist during our stay, bar tender was the nicest guy and should find another place to work, the hotel is bringing him down! Room: Our bed was hard; air conditioning unit did not work and was never fixed during our stay. (We advised the front desk every morning but nothing was every done about the air conditioning) Location: Close to the Spanish steps and train station but so are loads of other hotels, nothing great about this place and next time we\u2019ll be avoiding this hotel. Breakfast: Just basic stuff, nothing to write home about. All in all, the worst hotel experience and we have stayed in plenty over the last 10years. We live in London and travel Europe regularly and this was so bad it's prompted me to write this review. (You may be interested to know, I've sent a letter of complaint to the hotel and also emailed twice, it's been 2weeks and still no response. I\u2019ve called to speak to the manager Alessandro and left messages for him to contact me but still nothing. Shows what they think of their customers) You have been warned; if I was you avoid this hotel.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCould be so much better, badly managed hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Disco13", "ReviewID": "UR97142722", "Content": "Booked on-line through lastminute.com and thought we got a great bargain.

I bought a trip to Rome for my partners christmas pressie. We are both well travelled people and my father was an airline pilot so needless to say i have stayed in many hotels before. I booked directly with the hotel which i advise you to do. I had a package deal consisting of picking up from the airport to the hotel, drinks on arrival, a lovely room and tickets to the colleseum, paletine hill and roman forum. The room is slightly on the small side but was plenty big enough for the two of us. It had lovely high ceilings which made the room feel bigger. In the room there were all your basics and had thick towelling robes, plenty of towels, toothbrushes, shower gel etc. There was a jacuzzi bath and rainfall shower. Yes you could hear traffic outside but what do you expect your in a city! The hotel was very central for visiting everything. It is about a half hour walk to the colleseum or the vatican with lots of sites on the way. The trevi fountain and spanish steps are the nearest. There are great restaurants at the end of the street like Harrys Bar, Venetian and Cafe de Paris. I would reccomend this place to anyone wanting to experience Rome and be central to everything.

I chose the Romanico Palace because it professed to be a really good quality 4* hotel with great service. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. The hotel emailed me two weeks before the trip to ask if we would like to uprgrade to a suite. As I had read a number of reviews saying that the standard rooms were small, I agreed to the upgrade at an additional cost. When we arrived, to say we were disappointed would be an understatement. The suite was still a very small room and not really what we had been led to believe we would get for the additional money paid. This was made worse by the fact that the shower in the bathroom was broken and whilst still functioning, the shower head would not stay upright, meaning my partner had to prop it up against the cubicle. We advised reception and they said they would send someone along to fix it. When we arrived back from our day out the following day, the shower had still not been fixed and so my partner complained again only to be told that as it was the weekend, and they needed a special part, it couldn't be fixed. My partner asked for another room and they said they would see what they could do. Needless to say, nothing else was done about this and we continued for the whole weekend with a broken shower. There is also no room service to speak of even though this is advertised in the brochure and in the descriptions on many web-sites. When we asked for this, we were told that they might be able to find a sandwich but couldn't promise. The comlimentary bottle of wine we were supposed to get with our booking didin't materialise and generally we found the staff to be completely indifferent to our not unreasonable requests. For a 4* hotel, I would expect the rooms to be fully functional, a full room service offering, (if it is advertised which it is) and for complaints to be dealt with satisfactorily which they weren't and for the staff to be polite and courteous when, in fact, on many occasions they were surly and unhelpful.

They booked us at another sister hotel (the terrible Anglo Americano) and told us to check back later that evening or in the morning to see if there was an open room. While they paid for the taxi, the fact that we had to move all our stuff, unpack and pack again was extremely inconvenient, especially for a long weekend. But we had no choice as we hated the second hotel. The concierge both times (a separate one for check-in each time) acted like they were doing us a favor and were not very gracious. I wasn't angry, nor did I complain, but a little sympathy and kindness would have gone a long way. The hotel is also quite far from anything and if you're not used to walking, taxis can get expensive after a while. If you're from NYC, the distance to the metro (Barberini) is about a ten minute walk, but a leisurely stroller will probably take 15-20 minutes (or a family). We also weren't told that breakfast was part of the stay so we missed breakfast all three days. I definitely don't think the service or the amenities warrant a four star. This is a 3 1/2 star at best and only because you have to excuse the room size for European standards. For US travelers, this is probably not even on par with a Holiday Inn. I would spring for a nicer hotel that is a little more central if you really want to relax in Rome. We were supposedly upgraded \"deluxe\" room, so if the regular rooms are a step down from what we got, then the hotel is likely more a 2 1/2 to a 3-star by US standards. The amenities were fine - clean bathroom (which was the best part of the room). Beds are a bit hard and the linens are definitely three star quality. Don't expect this to a heavenly bed.

The TV was useless and looked over 20 years old - channels were missing and/or fuzzy! The complimentary WiFi advertised did not exist!

We were on the fourth floor which would not have been a problem had the lifts actually worked! During our stay we heard talk of other guests getting trapped in the lifts and the one time we tried to use them we were very nearly stuck ourselves (doors would not open at ground floor and after several minutes waiting we had to frantically press the buttons to try get the lift to go to an alternate floor which it eventually did and we escaped!). The kitchen was closed for our entire stay so no food was available except for breakfast which was poor! We were told to go to the restaurant around the corner (to be honest the very fact that they recommended it put us off going there!). The roof terrace advertised and which looked so lovely in the photos was closed for our entire stay! It did not look like it had been open for some time! They were clearly under staffed also as the doorman was also the barman - this meant lengthy waits at the bar for a drink and when he did turn up he did not speak a word of English so if you could not point at it you were out of luck! The receptionist kindly booked us on to an English speaking tour of the city which turned out to be a complete waste of money comprising an Italian speaking guide who did not seem to know anything at all and a very, very hot bus with no air con!

We arrived approximately 90 minutes early and were told that for an additional fee we could have access to our room. We elected to wait. We had just completed a 20-hour trip and were exhausted. When we finally got to our room, not a minute before check-in time, we found two standard sized beds, not queens as I had reserved. I returned to the main desk and requested another room; the deskman gave me an unpleasant smirk and said that my room was a double queen and that no other options were available. Too tired to argue, I returned to our room for some sleep. Shortly thereafter, we heard loud banging on the door. As I got out of bed, the door opened and a man was standing in the doorway. He had somehow opened the door. He seemed as surprised as I was and ran. Once again, I visited the front desk. This time a new man was at the desk and he simply replied \"impossible.\" Given that I had prepaid my reservation we opted to stay at Hotel Romanico, but we were cautious and used the safe religiously. We had no other problems. As for the room, like most European hotels, there is no real closet. Our room was of decent size but you had to step over suitcases to get from one side to the next. There was not place to sit in the room, other than on the beds (the small wooded chair in the room was not comfortable). The beds were rock hard, seriously. Even my college student kids who can sleep anywhere complained about their backs hurting from the rock beds! The bathroom had a clever arrangement in that there was always ample hot water and a good shower head, but the base was very shallow with a slow drain so that you were forced to turn the shower off to avoid flooding the bathroom. My dad used to call these \"army showers\" where you used water sparingly in an on-off fashion. Unfortunately, my son ignored this condition on several occasions. There was a sign that it is \"forbidden\" to bring in drinks and food from the outside. We ignored this sign. Across the street there is a nice lady who sells cold drinks and fruit as much lower prices that the hotel. The breakfast room was lovely with a view overlooking the city; the food was standard. During our stay, tour groups would be given a hot breakfast, while other guests would be limited to the continental fare. The breakfast manager would stare and seem to scowl at guests who ate too much or lingered too long. We ignored him as well. To get internet, you are required to buy a ticket, 5 Euros for an hour, if I remember correctly. The location of the hotel is a bit distant from old Rome, but within walking distance to spanish steps and Trevi Fountain. The hotel is very close to the American Embassy. Taxi to Vatican is about 15 E. The bus line stops directly across the street from the hotel and is very easy to use; bus pass for entire day is 4E. When we asked about a bus schedule, the vendor laughed and said, Rome bus-no schedule. We always felt safe walking, even very late at night. We returned to Rome four weeks after our initial stay as we were departing FCO to return home. We opted not to stay at Hotel Romanico. We chose a closer hotel that was actually not as nice. The trade-off, however, was worth it as we were more spontaneous with popping in and out of the hotel,not having to walk quite as much. My advice is that if you chose Hotel Romanico, consider making a reservation that is not prepaid to allow yourself to move if you have a problem.

The hotel was beautiful, the staff was amazing, and location was perfect. I first researched where to stay for over a month. I looked at all kinds of reviews, the star ratings, the amenities, pictures, I even looked at the satellite views of the hotel street and ended up picking the Hotel Romanico Palace. My husband and I were celebrating our 25th wedding Anniversary, so it was special to us. Neither of us had ever been to Rome or Italy and it really wasn't the top of our list, but it was within the top 10. What a GREAT CHOICE!!! About the hotel, we were greeted with excellent English (as our Italian is very limited), a great room (looked just like some of the pictures from the website), a spotless facility, and the friendliest staff (and townspeople) that we could have ever imagined. Everyone at the hotel (and surrounding area) were so friendly. The complimentary breakfast was perfect. The in-hotel bar had excellent service, excellent English, great beverages, and a beautiful setting. Please be friendly to the bartender, he is a GEM.) The hotel is a short walk to the Via Veneto, one of the main streets in Rome. You can see the American Embasy from the back (it faces the Via Veneto). Rome (according to several reviews prior to us going, views while we were touring the city, and street views of some of the hotels before we went) has a bad grafitti problem. NOT ON OUR STREET. NOT AT THE HOTEL ROMANICO. EVERYTHING THERE WAS PICTURESQUE AND PERFECT!! We took tons of pictures of our room and from our room windows (but I won't bore you with those). PLEASE STAY HERE!! You won't regret it. (A quick side note, on one of our tours during our 5 nights here, we were asked by our tour guide where we were staying -because they drop you off back in front of your hotel when you are done -and we told her the HOTEL ROMANICO PALACE, and she said 'ooh, that's a NICE hotel! And she was sincere!) The surrounding restaurants (as there isn't one in the hotel for lunches or dinners) were out of this world. They were reasonably priced (by European standards) and the food and wine was absolutely AMAZING!!! If you get the chance to go to LA LAMPADA, please do!! We loved everything about this restaurant (it was suggested by the concierge at Hotel Romanico). We tried almost everything on the menu, and it was all FANTASTIC. We also LOVED RISTORANTE MARIANO (both restaurants are just around the corner from the Hotel -short walking distance and frequented by locals). Their Tortelini was the best I've ever eaten in my life. Someday, we will go back to Rome, we will stay at the Hotel Romanico Palace again, we will eat at La Lampada (probably many times) and Ristorante Mariano. I wished it when I went to the Trevi Fountain!!!!", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, great spot from which to explore a great city\u201d", "Author": "jessicarrgh", "ReviewID": "UR74621104", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews about this hotel on this website i was a little apprehensive about booking a long weekend stay there. However, once i had dealt with the hotel directly and got a really good rate on a suite (due to august being considered low season) we were convinced to give it a go. The reception staff spoke perfect english and were very helpful and quick to respond to all our queries and to sort us out with a discounted price. To be frank, i really can't understand how the negative reviews of this hotel have come about. Perhaps the hotel has had a miraculous improvement in between then and the time we stayed there, or perhaps people had very different expectations to ourselves. Personally i found the staff extremely helpful and polite and any coldness people may have mentioned i think is actually a high level of professionalism in the reception staff. Of course it lacks the 'family fun' feel of other establishments but this is quite clear from the website and size of the hotel alone. The room was spotless, and cleaned spotlessly every day we were there. Our clothes we had left messy were always folded on the chair or bed. Breakfast was perfect for our needs - there was a large selection of cereals, fruits, cheese and meats, yoghurts, pastries, breads, spreads and cake. There was tea, coffee and juices too. Obviously the earlier you got there the better the selection but i did see staff topping up supplies late in the morning. If you are expecting a full english breakfast or fry up then you will be disappointed - but surely this is not the kind of breakfast you would expect in continental europe, and it certainly isn't the kind of breakfast i would want before a day of sightseeing (and as a vegetarian). The staff gave us recommendations and showed us where things were and were generally very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is not in the middle of everything, but it is only on the very edge of the middle of everything - it is not miles out of town. It is a five minute walk to barberini where there are lots of bus stops and the metro, and another five minutes or perhaps even less to the trevi fountain area. From there the spanish steps and piazza navona/pantheon areas are within easy walking distance. Of course the walk back in the blistering sun is a little uncomfortable but it really isn't a long way to walk and you can time your day/walks around the heat easily. It also meant the area was lovely and quiet and lacking in the huge masses of slow walking tourists in other areas which meant a good night's sleep. The suite we had came with an amazing view on its terrace and even a hot tub on the terrace too (which we used cold most of the time as a very refreshing end to a long day of sightseeing). It came within our set budget of 600 euros for three nights at a centralish roman hotel and we really couldn't have asked for more.

Tea, coffee and fresh juices were also available. Only downsides of this hotel for me were, no coffee making facilities in room and the bar/ lounge area consisted of tables and chairs in keeping with a bar/ cafe/ restaurant that is there were no comfortable chairs or settees to rest in after a long day walking the streets. Also there are no leisure facilites such as swimming pool or gym, but we knew that when we booked. Bar prices were very expensive but probably no more than in any of the restaurants or cafes in the City.

Our room had a small balcony (not all rooms do), a great view, and a fully tiled bathroom with a deep tub and a jet spray shower. After our full days of touring I completely loved soaking my feet in that tub! The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was perfectly clean which is very important to me. I booked through American Express Travel and I did email the hotel in advance to ask for rooms on the fourth or fifth floor. I did pay for the upgrade they offered but it was definitely worth it. Breakfast was included and what a way to start the day! The views from the roof are just beautiful. The staff was especially friendly and kind. The food was abundant and I ate THE MOST tender salami I have ever eaten and the plumpest freshest olives I have ever eaten. Breakfast also consisted of all you would expect (breads, cereals, juice, coffee, fruit, pastry--even cake!). The front desk was also fabulous. They spoke great english (thankfully) and were very helpful. We were told where to shop and sight-see and how to get there. The hotel is near the Villa Borghese and my husband and daughter enjoyed going there for a run at least three times. Everything else was within a moderate walking distance which we did not mind. We had drinks at the hotel lounge which was very comfortable, beautiful and relaxing.

When she returned to her room one afternoon, she couldn't open her safe. When she called the front desk they sent up an employee (bell boy) to open the safe using an \"emergency code\". When the gentleman left, she noticed her money missing (not saying he stole it, but someone had stolen it earlier which is why the code had not worked for her)! She immediately went down to the front desk to tell the staff. The staff was shocked but each time we mentioned it the response was, \"No one has the code but you and the man working the front desk who has an emergency code.\" Well, OBVIOUSLY the gentleman who came to open the safe for my mother had the universal emergency code and I'm sure most every employee has had to use it a time or two. My mother asked to speak to the manager over the next three days we were there, but he was never around (apparently) when we were in the hotel, so he left a message with the front desk saying....you guessed it....\"No one has that code but you.\" ARGHH!! No apology, no responsibility, no compensation, not even the descency of contact from the manager. We paid for two rooms for five nights and were treated very rudely. We had other issues as well...room keys not working and wifi not working (paid for it and were never able to use it and never reimbursed -they claimed it was a problem with our computer even though others were having trouble), never an apology for any inconveniences but more of an attitude of, \"Here's the squeaky wheels again!\" whenever we approached. Believe me, I don't like to be a squeaky wheel. I hate confrontation and I try my best to find the positive in every situation...especially while I'm trying to enjoy my vacation. But this was RIDICULOUS and completely unprofessional! The staff were amiable and very helpful until we complained about the stolen money on the second day.

Most of the staff is very friendly and attentive but one desk clerk in particular looked like he had never cracked a smile in his entire life. Would I stay there again?

I apologize for the lengthy review, but in my opinion, it deserves much better ratings! When selecting hotels for international leisure travel, we look for the more quaint boutique-style properties that feature ambiance and local-charm. We prefer to stay away from the chain-properties as the rooms tend to be identical regardless of the country (or continent for that matter) where it is located. Romanico Palace was not my first choice nor was it the hotel that I had originally booked. I had been debating between Romanico and another boutique property which received MUCH HIGHER ratings; and that was the deciding factor for originally booking at another hotel. I presented my dilemma to a few colleagues who had inspected the Romanico a couple months earlier commented that it was not a bad choice. About a month after making the reservation, I switched to the Romanico Palace, and neither I nor my traveling-companion regret the last-minute decision to switch to Romanico. Upon check-in, Alesio showed us to room #416, a Junior Suite. It was of decent size and had additional features not found in the lower room categories, notably 2 small city-view terraces and a large jacuzzi-tub. Decor was just as shown on their website; classical with a touch of elegance - not at all gaudy or \"over-the-top\" which is sometimes common in boutique Italian hotels. Since rooms vary in size and features from one to another in most boutique hotels, Ilaria took time from her busy schedule to show me several other rooms in different categories. This tour (an opportunity that most guests wouldn't receive nor request)combined with our personal experience makes it possible to site and clarify biased complaints from others reviews: LOCATION - Rome is a large city, so no particular area is a \"central walking distance\" to all parts of the city. Romanico is in an excellent location as we walked on different occasions at a leisurely pace to Via Veneto in 5 minutes, Spanish Steps in 10 minutes, Trevi Fountain in 15 minutes, Ancient Rome in 20 minutes and the Colosseum in just under 30 minutes. We didn't attempt to walk to sites on the other side of the Tiber River, in particular the Vatican, as this would have taken too long. Many travelers ask to be close to the Vatican and I wouldn't recommend this unless they plan on spending ALL of their time there as a taxi would be necessary to get to the majority of other places-of-interest. RECEPTION/CONCIERGE - All employees were professional and courteous, notably Ilaria and Alesio. Everyone we came into contact with was knowledgeable and did their part to ensure that our stay was comfortable and all needs were met, even on a couple late-nights when we returned to the hotel at 3AM. Check-in is 2PM, however, early check-in is available for 25EURO which is something unique as many hotels require booking the room for the previous night to guarantee an early check-in. If you arrive before 2PM as we did, the hotel will securely store your luggage. Rome city tours, as well as day tours to other areas (Naples/Pompeii, Assisi, Florence, etc) can be booked at the front-desk. They can also make dining reservations at a quality restaurant serving authentic Italian right next-door (sorry I don't remember the name.) The food was superb and hotels guests receive a discount. ROOM FEATURES AND AMENITIES - In my opinion, the most comfortable and highest quality rooms were the Deluxe category. They were larger and better maintained than the standard category (which which were most likely the rooms that received complaints in previous reviews.) All rooms were of average size for European hotel rooms, slightly smaller than US standards. All featured private bath with tub/shower combos, hairdryer, bath-products and ample high-quality towels. We never had an issue with hot water, even with a large jacuzzi-tub. Safe and Minibar were in all the rooms stocked with water, soda, beer, wine and alcohol. Prices were not at all inexpensive, typical for a hotel minibar - you are paying for convenience. Each room has a flat-screen television with cable - only 1 station is in English, Al Jazeera news - but I have to ask why TV channels in English are of significant importance on vacation in a foreign country? You are in Rome and you could spend a month here and still not see all the sites! Wireless Internet is free on the public computer in the lobby and available for a fee in your room, purchased from the front desk. Beds were comfortable and featured clean, quality linens. Some rooms featured a queen-size bed, but most were two twins which are pushed together for guests requesting one bed as is standard in Europe. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room clean and tidy daily. Room-service menu features breakfast, lunch and dinner. BREAKFAST - Served in the \"Roof Garden\" on the top floor with wall to ceiling windows with 360 degree views of the eternal city. Better than continental but typical Italian/European and featured numerous breads and pastries, various fruits, dry cereals, ham, salami, various cheeses, juice and milk. Bacon and eggs available for a fee (again, standard across Europe.) Espresso is also available for a fee, and I must note, THE BEST cappuccino we had in Italy was here! PRICE - Depends on how you make your reservation. Remember when booking on the major hotel booking-engines that focus on offering (possibly guaranteeing) the lowest price - YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! They are notorious (on ALL the hotels they offer, not just Romanico Palace) for reserving the least-expensive rooms which of course will be the least-desirable, possibly very small in size, undesirable view, in need of renovation, etc. I recommend booking on the Romanico Palace website OR with a reputable agent/tour operator where you will receive the most \"preferred\" rooms at a better price than many other comparable boutique 4 star hotels in Rome. This will also guarantee that you won't be bumped or moved to another property because of over-booking (booking more rooms than are available to guarantee maximum occupancy in the event of last-minute cancellations.) Whether right or wrong in your opinion, the airlines are notorious for it and its also a common practice with hotels. CONCLUSION - If you are looking for a 5 star luxurious hotel or for a room similar to what U.S. hotel chains offer (lacking Italian ambiance) Romanico will probably not be right for you. If you want to wake up and open your eyes and truly feel that you are in Rome, and you are seeking a full-service 4 star, more intimate hotel with great customer-service, convenient location and clean, comfortable and elegantly decorated rooms, Romanico Palace will create the perfect \"Rome Experience!\"", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cOk, not as bad as everyone makes out...\u201d", "Author": "zooloo83", "ReviewID": "UR53524079", "Content": "Before I booked this hotel I went through agonising debates with myself whether I should stay or not after reading the negative reviews of this hotel. I decided to contact the hotel directly and I emailed them all my concerns. Ilaria the customer service rep, was very attentive and answered all of my (many) questions. Because she took the time to answer and the marginal discount she gave me, I decided to go ahead and take the risk! My main concerns were, the customer service, room size /views and distance and ease to look at all the attractions. Ill review each of these one by one.. Customer service As expressed earlier Illaria was very good at replying to all my emails and assured me that we would have no problems, she also reduced the price of the room for me by a marginal amount. When I reached the hotel, the staff were very attentive and formal. They were not rude at all. They were very helpful and I particularly liked the fact that they were able to call taxis for you very quickly, no waiting around at all. One negative point was that I had to remind them that we had welcome drinks as part of package, as when we got to our room they still had not asked or given us anything. They then brought the drinks up. But that is the only flaw with their customer service and Im sure Illaria will take note and fix this for the future. Room size We were give a persitge room, which supposed to have good views of the city and the jucuzzi. The room and bathroom size was ok, not very big, but I think this is probably the case for most hotels in Rome. My hubsand enjoyed the jucuzzi, so a good feature if you are tired after sight seeing and want to relax. The views however were not that great. Our room was like on the corner of the hotel, so as soon as you open your curtains you can see scaffolding and building work of another hotel, not the views they had advertised. I did express this to the staff, however she then said that this is the kind of view from most of the windows, unless you are on the top floor terrace eating breakfast. So after this experience, I would say do not not get too bothered about booking a room with a great view, as to be honest its in a built up area, so you will not be able to see the rest of the city. Distance to station The hotel is a nice place called Via Veneto. There are quite a few places to eat there, I didn't get a chance to try any restuarant properly on the stretch though. We had drinks at one bar and the drinks were very expensive like 10 euros for a non alcoholic cocktail. Walking to the station is not bad, as its down a hill and it took 15 minutes to walk. It is not 5 minutes or 10 minutes, its definately a good 15 minute walk! Also the spanish steps is about a 25 minute walk. So make sure you have some comfortable trainers, I didn't take them, so I ended up getting taxi's a bit too often! Walking back from the station was a bit difficult after sight seeing, as its up hill. Ermmmmm what else.... Breakfast on the terrace, I noticed before booking this hotel that there are a few other hotels that do this anyway. With this hotel there is a view, but not something that I would rave about. The breakfast is ok also and acceptable. Overall I would recommend this hotel to people, as the customer service was good, however don't get too excited as it is overall average once you get over the alfresco headboards!", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cWe had a wonderful stay, and the staff provided excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "StLTraveler12", "ReviewID": "UR53480200", "Content": "We really enjoyed staying at this hotel.

We had a deluxe double room, with a nice spa bath and huge shower. the only downside was that the 'double' bed was actually 2 singles together, so alternate mornings myself or my partner would end up with a leg/arm down the crack! Not the biggest room in the world but it didnt really need to be. Very clean. The best thing about the hotel is the location - just off the Via Veneto and close to Villa Borghese and the spanish Steps. Rome is very walkable anyway and there are some lovely restaurants close by if you dont want to walk as far in the evening. The breakfast was lovely, lots of beautiful fresh continental food and lots of choice, and the views from the roof top terrace were gorgeous.

We booked a vacation through travelocity and this came up as one of the hotels that fit our price range. Will comment on the things i think are most important when traveling. Location of Hotel to Cost of Hotel comparison: In a city like Rome that is very easy to navigate by train, bus or taxi, i like to find a less expensive hotel that may not be centrally located, in Rome say near the Piazza Novona, but rather something a train stop or walk away from where the city center is. Lets face it, this is not a city that requires you to go back to your hotel multiple times a day. So considering that, i loved the price and location of the hotel. Its within a short walk of the Spanish Steps and the Spagna stations, the central Termini station as well as Piazza Republica. So there are certainly things close by to start your day of sightseeing. The Villa Borghese, a must see in Rome for instance. THe only negative, not a convenience \"bar\" or place to buy a late night snack or something after returning from a day out. But there are certainly restaurants and we did find a nice little place to get some snacks a few blocks away after being there a few days. Hotel Staff and Accommodations All spoke English and had our names and room correct when we arrived. Were a pleasure to deal with and very polite. The best thing is the buffet breakfast that was included with our room. Not sure if this is always free but damn it was worth it! I love breakfast, so to have a nice spread of bread, meats, cereals, coffee, fruit and espresso all at your pleasure was just perfect. There is also an outdoor (it was covered when we were there) that overlooks the city. Eating a free breakfast, drinking my 2nd free espresso while watching the sunrise in Rome was a great way to start the day. You can buy other things like eggs and hot meats, but that would probably make you an idiot considering the amount of food you have out there for free. One downfall is that you have to pay for internet in the lounge area and no free wifi!!! I hate this!!! When will hotels catch on and realize that people need the web and hate to pay for it. Had to shell out 5 euro for an hour, which isnt that much i guess, but i would have loved to sit down with a coffee, turn on my phone and check my emails in the morning before heading out without paying 5 euro. Room Cleanliness and Size Ok the size was not all that impressive. It was in fact enough, dont get me wrong, but if you like a lot of room with a couch or a lounge chair, my room did not have. We had a room with 2 queens so possibly this is why. The room we had was enough however, we were not cramped by any means. Very high ceilings help it feel large also. The bathroom was rather small. I didnt really mind because i am not fat and im a dude, but my mom and sister (both not fat) did think it was a little small. The bright side is that that the water was great and powerful and there was this little bench built into the tub....let you sit down and relax a little bit while the water came over you, pretty cool. The ladies also complained about not having space to \"put on there face\", meaning they needed more space to put there make up. The hotel staff cleaned up the place nice every day and nothing was missing. The rooms were decorated real nice with a fake fresco style on the walls. The rest of the room was detailed in a classical way as well. My mom really liked it and thought it looked like royalty. Ok so overall i certainly like the place. I am an open minded person and have traveled a lot, so for me to recommend a hotel should mean something. Again i would say that in a city like Rome, when you should be out doing cool things and sightseing, the Hotel should not be that important. Considering the price, location, friendliness of the staff and the breakfast...this place is great.

On a good note, the location was very good although you probably could get slightly better for your money, the bar and entrance of the hotel were nice enough and the staff recommended a really good restaurant, most of the staff were very helpful. Maid service was good also but must be done before 2pm. Bad side- On arrival we were given the option of upgrading which would cost up to 150 euro extra per night. I decided as my partner and I were there to see Rome and not spend time in the hotel that we would not take the upgrade and spend our money seeing the sites etc instead. I thought we had paid quite a lot for the hotel anyway so was suprised to see that our room was very dated and quite scruffy. There was a very strong smell of damp and the spa bath had a lot of mould on the jets and generally looked very old. The electric tripped out when I used the hairdryer and we had to put the trip switches up (which were outside the room) ourselves once we discovered them as no one answered the phone at reception. The electrics as a whole look very old and a bit hazardous. As previous reviews have mentioned no iron in the room or available at all. My real issue was with the air con. I have heard that Italian hotels don't like using the air conditioning, for cost reasons I should imagine, but this hotel is on quite a busy road and when we stayed there were road works going on and scaffolding being put up so there was a lot of noise. I called the reception and asked if they could come and see what was wrong with the air con unit as there was no air coming out despite it being switched on. The room was very stuffy and airless and it was way to noisy to have the window open. After speaking to several staff I was eventually told that the air condition was switched off at the mains and they were not going to switch it back on. Very disappointing as the road works started at 7am so no lie ins for us! I wouldn't really recommend this hotel unless you are getting a serious bargin and you are not too bothered about luxury! If you do end up here, there are some really nice restaurants and bars around the block from the hotel so don't immedialty head for the tourist areas to eat or drink as you might miss out and spend far more than you need to.

They informed us at check in that we would not be staying in the Romanico Palace but at their sister hotel next door (Veneto Palace), I was already disappointed as I had read the reviews and understood this to be a poor relation. We were lead to our room by a very pleasant bell boy through a small corridor linking the hotels. We were informed that breakfast was in the Romanico Palace and so had to come back through this corridor to get the lift to the roof terrace every morning. Breakfast was very nice, fruit, cereal, bread, meats, cheese, croissants and cakes. There is nothing else that I can add on the hotel as I would be reviewing the Veneto. However when it came to leaving we went to the reception desk in the Romanico to book an airport transfer, they took all our details and asked for our room number which we had to explain was in the Veneto hotel (as we did every morning at breakfast). We were then told to go to the reception desk at the Veneto hotel to book this!! Fortunately another staff member stepped in and they booked it for us. If I had wanted to stay at the Veneto Palace I would have booked this hotel myself, it has a cheaper tariff so I feel like we have been let down by the Romanico Palace.

We loved the gold marble, big towels, glass shower, water pressure, the overall look and comfort. The location is excellent and very convenient.

The hotel is a couple of blocks from some great shopping. We were also very close to some of the tours we signed up for through Viator.com. The hotel staff were very helpful, making dinner and taxi reservations for us. The terrace patio was beautiful and open for complimentary and delicious breakfast and happy hour. The terrace service for breakfast was top notch; the terrace service during happy hour was slow, perhaps understaffed. It would have been great if the hotel would offer lunch & dinner, but we did not have any trouble finding great little eating spots. Since we were on the top floor, the moving of the chairs on the terrace woke me up in the morning. Lastly, my husband was happy that the hotel offered Wi-Fi. It was the fastest Internet connection he has ever received. Though as our trip progressed, we realized that all Wi-Fi in Italy is faster than in the US.

I had already stayed a week in Milan and had a great experience at the hotel. When I arrived, the gentleman behind the front desk told me the room wasn't ready and wouldn't be ready till 2pm, no problem, I knew I was early. At 1:45pm, I noticed he began to register guests, so I went up to the desk thinking he would be able to register me, but his response was \" Ma'm, I told you rooms wouldn't be available until 2pm, go back and wait\", not in a friendly tone, but in a real condescending and annoyed tone. Every night that we wanted a drink from the bar, we were greeted by another annoyed male employee that looked as if he did not want to be there. On the 2nd to the last day, I finished my breakfast, on the lovely terrace and decided to take a cup of coffee down to my room while I got ready for the day. As I was waiting for the elevator, the same evening bartender, rudely told me \"no drinks, you need to drink on the breakfast floor\", not only was he rude, but continued to scold me as if I was a child and waived his hand at me, indicating that I needed to go back on the terrace. The hotel is very nicely decorated, clean, not close to anything and has to either re-train their staff on customer service or hire an entire new team, in order for them to continue to attract clients. As a professional, that has worked in the customer service industry for 10+ years, I understand mistakes do happen, but there is always a rude way and a polite way of explaining errors to clients. I truly was appalled that they would have such a rude staff, considering it's a 4 star hotel and they are in the hospitality industry. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone, until the hotel is able to re-think their employee customer service skills.

Consumer websites such as this tend to attract comments from a dissatisfied minority with an axe to grind, rather than the satisfied majority; to help redress the balance, we would readily refute the more negative comments posted. The hotel is a mid-sized corner property in a safe, salubrious location to the NE of the Centro Storico, close to the Via Veneto and south of the Villa Borghese. We found the staff without exception to be courteous and efficient - they were most helpful to me in resolving a problem not of their making (Alitalia had managed to lose my suitcase!). The public areas are bright and opulent, and the decor traditional but striking, with antiques (or repros) dotted around, much gold paint and pillar-box red carpets in the corridors - not perhaps the kind of thing you'd choose at home, but fun for a short time away! The rooms (or at least the recently refurbished 'classic' ones like ours - room 222, since you ask) are of a fair size and spotlessly clean, with 'Roman column' bedposts, marble bathrooms, plenty of lighting and a separate desk area (useful for spreading out maps). No armchair though. Incongrous amongst all the gold and faux-antiquity, a silver LCD TV is mounted on the wall, with BBC World and CNN among the channels. One major word of warning: do NOT take a room facing the street, particularly on a lower floor. They may be sunnier, but the traffic noise is horrendous - something about the noise Italian scooters and buses make in particular just cuts through anything, and it never stops. After one sleepless night we changed to a peaceful room on the same floor overlooking the internal courtyard - not a thing of beauty, but then the street view isn't much either. Breakfast is outstanding - taken on the bright and sunny roof terrace with a view over the city, a sharp contrast to the windowless basement rooms used in so many hotels. Everything one could reasonably expect and more is included on the buffet (including the all-important toaster!), and they'll make you a capuccino on request. Bacon and eggs etc. are available at extra cost for die-hard fry-up fans. Sadly the terrace is only open for breakfast at present. The hotel is well served for public transport: buses 63, 630 and 80 stop right outside, and the dinky little electric 116, which is small enough to negotiate the alleyways of the Centro Storico and goes by most of the major sights, can be caught from the Via Veneto nearby. Individual tickets can be purchased at nearby tabacchi, but to buy a daily pass (4 euros) the nearest place is the Metro station at Piazza Barberini - a pleasant 10-min walk from the hotel down the Via Veneto. So far as getting to and from the hotel and Termini station, avoid the Metro and take bus 910, which stops one street away. We enjoyed our stay, and hope to return.

We complained about the state of the room and they said they would move us to the Romanico hotel the next day (the hotel we originally booked). After an uneasy night we were moved to the other room which we supposed to of stayed in the first place. The room was much better and our holiday could begin.. Rome is a beautiful city which made the poor start to our journey dissappear. At the end of the holiday we told the hotel clerk to arrange the same driver that brought us to the hotel which cost us a low 30 Euro's but the hotel clerk obviously did a huge mistake and booked us on a city taxi and cost us 70 Euro's for a trip to the airport. -WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR- There are many things to see but the most pleasant attraction is St.Peters. I recommend to go to the top and see the most spectacular view you will see in your life - specially at sunset. Try to find a family restaurant to eat and not a tourist trap where they will over charge you. 4 nights is the right amount and gives you enough time to see most attractions. The underground was efficient and is a good means of transport like travelling to the colleseum.

I have stayed in far more expensive hotels in London, LA and New York and got no where near the level of service and comfort afford by the this hotel.

To hear that the hotel is opening a new roof top restuarant which will serve evening meals is great news as it would be nice having spent all day walking around the many sights of rome to be able to come back and unwind with an evening meal and a glass or two of wine on the terrace of the hotel overlooking the eternal city.

We booked a deluxe double for our anniversary weekend, the room we were shown to was dark, compact, and in poor repair. Skirting boarks hanging off walls were dirty, no tea making facility and only 1 chair. We were not at all happy. I went to reception to question the room and the manager had a really bad attitude and basically said there was nothing wrong with the room and basically tried to ignore the fact that I was still their. I had to remind him that I was the guest and that I was not happy, it did not reflect the deluxe rooms shown on the websit to which he replied was only to get people booking. I hung on and when some new guest were arriving he got the bell boy to show me to another room, which I made quite clear that I wanted to see prior to accepting. My husband was so dissappointed he was prepared to pay for another hotel elsewhere rather than stay in that room, fortunately the other room was lighter and in slightly better decor, still no tea making facility and only one chair, but bigger. Was also dissappointed by the fact that the hotel only provided a facility for breakfast and not dinner, would have been ideal after a days sightseeing to relax at the hotel knowing you did not have another long walk ahead of you to get some food. In hindsight this was probably best given their attitude to everything else. All nourishment of any kind is highly over priced, a bottle of sparkling water in the hotel is 3 euros and only 25 cents in the supermarket less than 100 yards from hotel.

It was truly the worst room I had ever seen in terms of a hotel and this was meant to be four star! dirty carpet, tired wall paper, small oh and did I mention it was small. They did not even have an iron or service that could provide such things. I was assured a top room with free internet service this did not happen. I eventually got some internet service and sent the manager an email to which he replied the following day and after some talking here and there we were upgraded to a much better room actually it was 100 times better which made our stay wonderful. staff are helpful but it depends who you get, In terms of Location it is brilliant it is a stone throw away from the main areas however there were other hotels closer and possibly better.

Very small rooms even by big city standard If you get the suite with the jacuzzi for a good price then this would be the only stay I would recommend. My husband and I booked our stay at Hotel Romanico palace via last minute.com. It was expensive but looked nice on the website so we thought we would treat ourselves. When we arrived we were shown up to a tiny box room overlooking an ugly internal courtyard which was noisy and dark. I was really upset with the room so we went straight back down to reception and asked to move. There were no road facing rooms available (which was probably a blessing as this hotel is on the corner of a very busy cross road with lots of road noise) so the only alternative was a junior suite. The receptionist told us this was the best room the hotel had to offer. Having seen the room we agreed to an upgrade fee of 80Euros per night ontop of our already high price. The good things about the suite - a very nice jacuzzi bath on a nice balcony. This totally made our stay as it was lovely to spend time out there and the views were very nice. Reasonably well decorated but still looks abit tired. Bad things - you are directly under the breakfast balcony and get woken up every morning at 8am by chairs being scraped across the balcony floor. The road noise is very loud, even at this heigh. The bathroom door doesnt shut and the shower has jets that look nice but if you use them they flood the bathroom. When I tried to tell reception about the things with the room that need fixing he wouldnt even listen to me...just saying 'that is the best room we have!' I would not recommend this hotel. It is a 15 minute walk from Trevi fountain and there are closer hotels within the traffic free zone that would be much nicer.
