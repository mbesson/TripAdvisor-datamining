I booked the hotel because of the positive reviews, the excellent location and last but not least the baroque style. The location truely is excellent, only two blocks away from the Colosseum, several small supermarkets, a great restaurant (Luzzi) and a gelateria are all just a few steps away. However, the hotel is located in a quiet side street. The staff at the hotel was beyond friendly and even offered us a last cappuccino when we came to pick up our luggage (we had checked out in the morning and had left our luggage at the hotel as our flight was in the evening). The entire hotel had a lovely baroque design and was well managed. I read an earlier review, saying something about shared showers/bathroom but I can't really believe that. We had a budget room on the ground floor and even that came with its own bathroom. Also the room was bigger than I expected, with even offering an additional single bed aside from the requested double bed. (probably no need to mention this but I do it anyway: the room was also equipped with a fridge, flat screen TV, phone and closet. I was told there is WiFi too but we didn't bring our laptop). The breakfast was good as well, with several kinds of cereals, rolls, breads, fresh fruits, cake, croissants, cheese etc. For drinks there were water, some sort of juice (?), milk, tea and coffee with the cappuccino being really good. The room was very clean. So were the beds and the towels. We got fresh towels every day. Also provided were slippers, shower caps, the usual shampoo and body lotion. However, there were (very few) downsides to the room: - the shower door couldn't be closed properly but kept swinging open a few cm so you always ended up having a bit of water on the floor - the walls/doors are indeed thin and you can hear people outside the room clearly. - if you happen to be tall then the beds might be a bit on the short side for you (at least your feet get fresh air ;) ) - if you are short you might have to stretch a bit in the shower to be able to fully enjoy the massage shower - there was no wastepaper-basket in the bedroom (we used the one in the bathroom instead) - there was no washcloth in the shower/bathroom Long story short: we would come back again and definitely recommend this hotel. The down sides didn't bother us much. If you spend all day in the hotel room this might be different of course, but that'd be simply a waste of time (it's Rome after all !).", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk", "Title": "\u201cFantastico\u201d", "Author": "deborahandmartin", "ReviewID": "UR127002904", "Content": "I booked the Hotel Romance for a four night Anniversary break after only limited research, due to internet connectivity problems at home.

It is spotlessly clean with a decent enough breakfast to set you up for a hard days sightseeing around Rome's many sites (all easily accessible by public transport 5 mins walk from the hotel). The combination of Baroque decor with modern appliances works much better than I expected, and made for a special romantic break (the hotel only opened in 2010 so everything is still in very good condition). Another benefit is that the hotel is just around the corner from the excellent Trattoria Luzzi. We found this by chance on the first night before realising that it is top rated in the Rome Rough Guide.

We had a 1st floor room (but was really more on the second floor the way our room was situated) that was small, but decorated oh so nicely - we felt like we were in a true, quaint European room. The queen (?) bed was a bit short, but after our experience, I'm thinking that this is a common European bed size (as opposed to what we're used to in the States). The bathroom was clean and nice and the shower had multiple shower heads which felt great at the end of a full day exploring the city. The rest of the hotel, hallways, entryway, sitting rooms and breakfast rooms were decorated just as nicely - very classic European/romantic.

I picked it because its close to the metro (Colleseo) and the Colloseum/Roman Forum. You'd think that it would be noisy, but its not. Its very quiet and located right next to the police station (in case you were worried about any problems.. the cops are your neighbours!) The hotel is exactly like the photos - the rooms are a little small - your bed and a small desk with side tables and mirrors are pretty much what you'll get - but its lovely, and more than enough space. There is a safe in the room, and its all very modern, with a little t.v. to boot and a very cute french window (not the best view, admitedly, but the room more than made up for it). The bathroom was lovely - good power shower, the usual toiletries and towels provided. And what was obvious to us was that the place was VERY CLEAN - Amazing. I wouldn't say that the hotel was 3* - I'd say that it was closer to 4. The bad parts about this hotel are 2 fold: 1. there are loads of charming little lights in the room, but no main ceiling light, so the room remains dimly lit - romantic, yes. convenient - not so much... but maybe I'm just used to having more light in the room. 2. the walls aren't terribly thick. We didn't find it noisy, but on one night, we did hear \"noises\" from the room above us. Other than that we had a quiet stay. The staff are really friendly - I'd been to Rome before, but my bf hadn't, and so he asked a LOT of questions. Also, we used the metro and bus a lot (the busstop is very close to the hotel and takes you all the way to the vatican on bus no.81) and the staff were really helpful in giving us directions and providing recommendations on where to go/eat. there are some cute local restaurants in the area - which are really nice. There's one with an outdoor canopy, which you will have to queue for, as it gets very busy. But as a tip, skip all of that during the day, as the street food in Rome is AMAZING - go to little cafes for calzones and square slices of pizza with seasonal vegetables. Save the serious dining for the evening, when you'd want to be sitting down formally. great hotel, I'd definitely go there again. Good for couples - we saw a family there, but I'm not so sure that its all that great for kids. Also - free wifi - and the reception will help you checkin for your flights, help print boarding passes etc. the hotel doesn't have a pool.

All of their staff are incredibly helpful and courteous with anything from booking tours to calling taxis. They are also very pleasant to share conversation and a coffee with. All the staff spoke fluent English, there is an English gentlemen working there who is exceptionally courteous. We stayed for a total of 10 days and my wife and I will remember this hotel fondly. If we ever go to Rome again, there is no question that we will again stay at the Hotel Romance.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, comfortable hotel close to Colosseum\u201d", "Author": "markpb", "ReviewID": "UR119584102", "Content": "When I saw the photos of Romance, I imaged a quaint hotel with ageing furniture that needed a little TLC.

The main entrance is slightly hidden, but not too hard to find and the reception area of the hotel is clean with free maps of Rome available if need be. The reception staff are very polite and helped us when we needed some advice. There is also a computer with free internet access. Our room was small but adequately sized for our purposes. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern with a very powerful shower and there is a fridge in the room to store drinks and food if need be, as well as free wifi, tv, toiletries and air conditioning. Breakfast is where the hotel loses its only mark. There is cereal, yoghurts and pastries, but selection is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, this is only a minor point, as the hotel itself is very charming and the decoration although over the top, is great. Location wise you are 2 minutes from the Coliseum and the Forum, a 15 minute walk down Via dei Fori Imperiali to the top of the Forum where the Vittorio Emmanuelle Monument and Capitoline Museum is, which is also the beginning of Via Del Corso which takes you to the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain after a further 10 minute walk. For the Vatican we took the metro from the Coliseum with a simple change at Termini for the other metro line - very straight forward and easy to do, and tickets (purchased at machines in the station) are \u20ac1 each for 75 mins timed journey - which is plenty of time. Finally, from the top of the forum you can also walk to Campo D'Fiori which is great for dinner and very lively with bars etc, as well as crossing the river to Trastevere for dinner and very reasonably priced set lunch menus (starter, main, dessert and drink \u20ac10) which include pasta, pizza, chicken etc. All in all a perfectly located, clean, comfortable hotel with great staff and facilities for a city break. Finally, please note the tariff for a taxi from the airport is fixed at \u20ac40 (at time of writing) both to and from the hotel to Fiumicino. Taxi drivers will try and charge extra for bags but the \u20ac40 price includes all bags, so don\u2019t let them charge more!

We did like it very much it, but the first adjective to come to mind when thinking about our room would be 'golden'. The hotel room was a reasonable size for Rome (and Europe in general). The hotel was perfectly located and close to the Colloseum. There are some great restaurants in the neighborhood - in fact, I had the best pasta on my trip at Ristorante Papagio just around the corner. The hotel staff were very accomodating and even printed off our reservations that we had made for the Vatican Museum. The only complaint that I would have is that the walls were somewhat thin and you could hear voices quite clearly in the next room - it was compounded for us by the fact that we had a couple that were somewhat loud and stayed up late on 2 of the 3 nights that we stayed there, but that was probably just bad luck on our part.

There is a main bus route right outside the colleseum which will take you where you need to go so location wise it was very good. There were a few negative points you should be aware of. There are no tea & cofffee facilities in the room.

Especially Jeffrey, who worked at night- he had a drink with us one evening and chatted with us for 45 minutes. He even offered us his bus pass when we weren't able to buy one after hours! (Not sure what the negative reviews about the staff are- they were great). Our room was large and lovely and our view was out over a garden. The walls did seem a bit thin, but we weren't in our room that much so it didn't bother us. Breakfast was good, wifi was fast (and free). The last day of the trip when we were settling up the bill, there was a discrepancy between what we were quoted and what they presented as the bill, but Tony quickly checked the email records and found all our correspondence and honored the price that was originally quoted.

We will definitely return to The Hotel Romance the next time we visit Rome!", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location, great staff...\u201d", "Author": "alltonnee", "ReviewID": "UR75289825", "Content": "My preferred hotel in the area I wanted to book was really quite expensive for the dates of our stay so I had to find an alternative. I really enjoyed my last stay in this neighborhood as it's so close to the 'action' of Rome, but with it's own charm and personality. Given that booking a 3 star hotel in Italy can sometimes be a lottery, I was slightly concerned that the images on the website seemed too good to be true. However the moment we arrived, I realized that the website is a very accurate depiction of the hotel. We arrived in Rome at 6am, so we went to the hotel to ask to drop off our bags not looking forward to spending 6-8 hours waiting to be allowed to check-in after a 12 hour flight. We was amazed when on arrival, we was allowed to take the room at 6am!!! Not only are the management extremely polite and, it is so nice to see that their housekeeping and evening staff display absolutely the same level of hospitality. Nothing is too much for them, and their service puts to shame many 4 and 5 star hotels. I would absolutely stay here again as any tiny snags or complaints (***) can't be justified given the friendliness, cleanliness, location and great value for money. ***(We stayed twice during our trip, and the second room was a little dark with an inward wall view compared to the first room, bright with a garden view. However, the layout was lovely. The breakfast is ample, but a more elaborate breakfast buffet would no doubt push up the prices.) This new hotel deserves to be a great success, and if our stay is any measure, it no doubt will be!", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel for good price next to Colloseum\u201d", "Author": "Richard_Martinu", "ReviewID": "UR72886913", "Content": "If you're looking for a beautiful and romantic hotel, for a very good price, than this is it!! It's located 200 meters from the Colloseum and about 300 meters from the metro station. So you can be one of the first visitors in the morning. The hotel has a special atmosphere wich we describe as 'romantic'. It's perfect for a city like Rome. It really looks like the pictures on their website! Everything is very clean. The breakfast is simple but O.K. Only point is the sound of the airconditioning, but just ask for help to set the right temperature and it switches off in time.

From breakfast service to being given information on anything I needed (eg not getting lost in Roma) I was fully looked after and would not hesitate to tell my friends about my wonderful time at that hotel.
