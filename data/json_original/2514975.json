My mother rarely travels internationally and this was her first visit to Paris. Beginning with my correspondence with the hotel regarding a room with two beds, the service was exceptional. I receive an email back right away confirming the room type. Upon arrival we were greeted by the bell man who took our bags and the desk was very warm and friendly, chatting with us about our trip while checking us in. Our room wasn\u2019t ready right away, but we were early so instead we went out for lunch first. Upon return we were given our hotel keys and the room was exactly as expected. I was impressed with the size of the room, especially since it is in the heart of Paris, a place known for small rooms. In my note prior to our arrival to confirm the room type I had mentioned that we were there for my mother\u2019s birthday, when we returned to the room that night after dinner we found the hotel had left an amenity including a small birthday cake and a note. These special touches just make the trip that much more special. Being Gold Status we had free breakfast every morning which was a comprehensive buffet including European Meats, cheeses, pastries, as well as a hot buffet and egg/omelet station. The service at the buffet was great, especially Hannah! The last thing I\u2019d like to mention is the location. PERFECT if you are planning to do a tourist vacation in Paris. The hop on hop off bus stops just up the street from the hotel. It is a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe, a nice walk to the Eiffel tower and other great sites and the Metro is very convenient for getting you where you need to go as well.

It's one of the very few top category hotels and it's easy to see why, plenty of staff on reception, great location and wonderful rooms. We were upgraded to a Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es suite which was sumptuously furnished and spread over 3 floors. Getting to this hotel is a synch using the metro, exit at champs \u00e9lys\u00e9es exit taking the left hand exit and the it's straight up the champs \u00e9lys\u00e9es for less than 5 mins. This hotel is right at the centre of the Paris action, on the best road, only a few mins walk from the Arc de Triomph.

Food at the hotel ismeyewateringly expensive but no more than the highway robbery to be found at any 5 star in a top european city. As a Marriott member we had free breakfast which is just as well, the breakfast selection is very wide but replenishment is slow due to overworked staff. If I had been paying for breakfast at over \u20ac30 each I would have been very irritated by the wait for coffee, tea and replenishments which more than once were met with a \"non, Monsieur\"... Eh, a French hotel has completely run out of melon/baguettes/croissants for breakfast? Yes all these, and other provisions ran out, and the staff insisted there was one to be found, as I say my breakfast was free so I didn't complain but paying I would have found it awful, especially the idea that a French hotel runs out of baguettes and croissants, with no intention of sending out to any one of the innumerate bakeries to replenish. Breakfast provisions and understaffing aside however this hotel was a glorious respite form the busy \u00c9lys\u00e9es and the room was wonderful.

The rooms are a reasonable size for a city centre hotel and the one bedroom suite accommodated the four of us comfortably ( myself, wife, son and nanny ).

Entrance off of the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, impressive lobby if lacking a bit of personality. Service was good except for mixed experience with concierge one of whose only sin was to not seem to care or be interested. Room was good sized for Paris, fixtures and decorations all new and modern for Paris, bed was very comfortable. Two iPod speakers a nice touch. Gym was very small with 1 treadmill 1 elliptical 1 bike and a rack of dumbells, but was empty both times I went - free Evian and fizzy bottled juice was a nice touch. And the issues: initially I was very pleased to find that my room had one of those typical parisian mini-balconies which looked out onto the street behind the hotel (rue de ponthieu I believe). However it turned into a curse when I discovered that there is a nightclub on the ground floor when I was awoken by the clubbing crowd spilling onto the street below my window at 4am screaming and yelling. This continued onto almost 6am. On a Tuesday night. If you stay at this hotel, be advised to avoid the rooms that overlook this street (rooms ending in approximately 30-35 I think). The other notable issue was the lack of clearing room service dishes and other rubbish left outside the rooms in the hallway - I passed the same dirty finished dinner no less than 4 times yesterday. On a business trip I was pretty happy with the hotel, the comfortability of the bed, and the location. The lack of sleep was a major issue though. I would not recommend for those looking for a romantic Paris holiday - the hotel lacks charm, not to mention the gaggle of tech conference attendees who I imagine would also kill the mood if I were there with my wife rather than my work laptop.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "anonymous928", "ReviewID": "UR126138985", "Content": "The best part of this hotel is definitely the location!

We also went to a local supermarket one night, which provided a pleasant meal in the room away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are doormen stationed outside the hotel, but they never once greeted us or even cracked a smile. Perhaps they are just there for security and not customer service. The only other glitch encountered during our stay was the extremely late turn down service. The first night, we were exhausted from jetlag and sightseeing and we were already asleep when they knocked on the door at nearly 10. They did not identify themselves, and when I said we didn't want anything it took a while for them to go away.

It's many, many years since either of us have been to Paris and we were initially a little apprehensive given the reputation of the city for being unfriendly (I acknowledge that we live in London, which can be equally unfriendly!). We were thrilled to be proved wrong. The staff at the hotel could not have been more attentive, helpful and polite. Actually, we were treated extremely well by everyone that we encountered during the weekend. Even the Metro staff went out of their way to be helpful; a system which, I would suggest, could be a little daunting if it's something that you're not used to. That said, the numbering of the routes is really simple and easy to use one you've figured out which direction you're heading in. The hotel is in a good location, with handy access to the Metro. If you can get away with not using it, I would do so as you will gain so much from wandering around the city on foot and there really are some hidden gems down the little side streets. The hotel was also extremely accommodating as we arrived particularly early, not expecting to be able to check in, but we were able to do so. We can't commend the staff here highly enough. If your time in Paris is limited, I would recommend the Marais district for mooching around; and eating too.

Best Paris Marriott.\u201d", "Author": "surfinginflorida", "ReviewID": "UR124405231", "Content": "When we were choosing which Marriott to stay in Paris, we had a hard time choosing between this one and the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe, so we stayed at both. In this review I will compare the two because I\u2019m sure many travelers are faced with the same decision. Check-in: We tried to get early check-in to both the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel (Marriott) and the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe (Renaissance). In both cases, we had to wait for our room because they were getting special rooms available for us (overlooking the Champs Elysees at the Marriott, and a room with a curved window at the Renaissance). No problem, we left our luggage and explored Paris. When we returned (in both cases around 6:00), we were not in the premium rooms promised at either hotel! The rooms were nice; they just faced the courtyard instead. At the Marriott, our luggage was in the room, along with a welcome gift (1/2 bottle of wine, bottle of water and desserts) and our Marriott Rewards gift (1/2 bottle of wine and a fabulous cheese platter). At the Renaissance, we had a welcome gift (bottle of wine and some fishy-tasting crackers) but had to wait for our luggage and rewards gift. Rooms: Both rooms were nice, a little on the small side and comparable with amenities. The Marriott was elegant, with a nice garden tub and separate shower. The furnishings were elegant, the bed was not as comfortable -- it felt like there was quilt serving as a pillow-top on top of the mattress. The Renaissance was understated luxury -- more trendy furniture but a very comfortable bed. The bathroom did not have a tub, but had a nice rain shower head. The Renaissance was cleaner. Service: I didn\u2019t think there was any comparison in service. At the Marriott, you would never touch a door \u2013 the bellmen/doormen were extremely attentive and helpful. The front desk and concierge were also great \u2013 and it was nice to have our luggage taken to our room without request. My husband is a platinum Marriott member, and after reading the reviews of the Renaissance, we were very disappointed with our service. The front desk was great, but that was the extent. We would come home at night, and rather than opening the door, the bellman just stared at us (I thought he was a security guard trying to act hard). It took over two hours to get a bottle of wine that we were promised would be delivered in five minutes. Unless we greeted the reception area personnel first, we weren\u2019t acknowledged. Not typical for a Marriott, being French isn\u2019t a good excuse. Location: Marriott is in a better location. There were several homeless people sleeping on the grates near the Renaissance. Restaurant: Breakfast was much better at the Marriott, as was the service. The Marriott was relaxing and bright and cheerful. The Renaissance was more suited for the evening, and the morning servers acted like they had a late evening out. If I went back to Paris, I would choose the Paris Marriott Champs Elysees Hotel over the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe. Even though the Renaissance bed was more comfortable and I enjoyed the trendier atmosphere, service is #1 and the Renaissance just wasn\u2019t there.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McKinney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Dapger", "ReviewID": "UR124362484", "Content": "We stayed four nights at this hotel using my points.

One would expect a first class experience. Good luck. My wife and I stayed in 2 different types of rooms. The first was a larger, more expensive room. Although it was decent size by Paris standards, it was packed with so much furniture that there wasn't room for our luggage. It seemed like we were navigating around furniture with every move. In the end, it had the feel of a very small room, with a very high price. The worst part, however, was the noise. The room was right above a restaurant and lounge area with an outdoor patio that played music well into the early morning hours. It wasn't horribly loud, but it's hard to go to sleep, and stay asleep, with a driving beat in the background. After three attempts to move to a quieter room, we were transferred to a room without the pulsating sounds of the restaurant and lounge. Unfortunately, it was tiny and had its own unique noise problems - thin walls that allowed us to hear every word of the hour long argument going on at 1 a.m. in the adjoining room. Worse yet, there was no price adjustment upon moving to the smaller room since we had requested the change. Then there was the \"service\". The doormen propped the front door open so they wouldn't have to look at the guests coming and going, let alone actually open the door or offer a greeting. They were responsive when you needed a service that involved a tip, but that's it. The front desk staff was professional, but distant and cool. Management was uncooperative regarding the room change. Certainly not a warm, customer oriented place. If you like Marriott brand properties, there is another alternative very close by that offers much better rooms and service at a more reasonable price.

PLEASE DO READ MY SECURITY ISSUE AT THIS HOTEL AT THE END OF MY REVIEW. My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Marriott Champs-Elysees. The hotel itself is nice but not amazing by any 5 star standards. It's a pretty regular high end Marriott but nothing like a Four Seasons. If you picture 4 star then you will like it. The rooms are large for a Paris hotel and the location is great. It's right in the middle of all the action on the the Champs-Elysees. Metros are VERY close (1-2 minute) walk. From these close Metro hubs you can quickly get to Eiffle Tower, Marseilles, Louvre and all other attractions. As others have mentioned breakfast is really quite good and large. You do get what you pay for at 29 euros. Amazing shopping and restaurants are just outside the door of the hotel. One thing I didn't like about the hotel is that at a 5 star level I didn't like the nickel and diming for something as basic as wifi. They charge 8 euros an hour OR 19 euros a day for internet access. I thought that doesn't make sense for an $899 a night hotel. Best Western which is 2 star is offering it free as is 99% of most hotels in the area. The hotel does have parking at 40 euros a day. Steep but what the heck it's central Paris so everything is over the top. MAJOR SECURITY COMPLAINT: On our last night we had a random guy from the hotel walk in to our room unannounced at 11:10 PM with a black bag. HE DID NOT KNOCK. We had to chase him from our room and down the hallway. We are convinced he was stealing from rooms because of the way he entered and the way he left. He was VERY surprised to see us in our room. I notified the front desk immediately of this altercation and they said they would address it and i never heard back. I'm still bothered by this experience. I feel lucky we weren't gone or sleeping when he came in. It was NOT handled professionally and properly for the security risk it poses. IF YOU HAVE PASSPORTS ETC.

I got a hearty thank you for being a Marriott Silver member, and was treated no differently for paying for a room with pints, instead of cash. she also reminded me that the concierge could arrange for tours, restaurants, and shuttles (and Indeed I did need a shuttle 2 days later to the other Marriott property out by Disney) ... so, I got the shuttle reservation out for the way. The room was wonderful in the way that the US chain hotels are ... lots of space, down comforters, large bathroom and AC. We even had a tiny terrace from which I could see Sacre Coeur.

It was the perfect decision! I have been to Paris before but I must admit, staying at the Paris Marriott made it even more special! The location was perfect. It was close to everything and you can pretty much walk to most places easily. There are many train stations around nearby as well. So if you wish to train it instead, it is right near the hotel as well. There are heaps of good places to eat nearby and one of my favourite restaurant, L'atelier de Joel Robuchon is only a few blocks away. The famous Laduree, world famous for their macaroons is pretty much just opposite the hotel. So that was another bonus. If you are into shopping, there are many big designer shops around nearby or you can walk about 15 mins or so to the big shopping place, Galeries Lafayette. The hotel itself is gorgeous! My boyfriend booked us a beautiful room, with our bed itself separated from the wardrobe areas and this large sitting area. Where our bed was it was on an elevated floor and has a beautiful balcony that opens up to beautiful Paris streets. It was so lovely. Because it was my birthday, the hotel also had two bottles of champaign chilled and ready for us to enjoy when we got there. There was also a cake and a card personally signed and addressed to me. It was sweet and a nice touch. I am certain though that my boyfriend did a lot to organised with the hotel to make it as perfect as it was! The staff at the hotel was friendly and attentive. The hotel itself is clean and looks great and so was the room. They also have a turned down service every night with one milk and one dark Godiva chocolate placed on our pillow each night. Our rates included breakfast and the breakfast selection was great. You can also order eggs cooked to your preference. We did not have dinner at restaurants in the hotel so I cannot comment on that. If budget allows, I definitely would recommend this place to everyone that wants to have a great memorable time in Paris. This hotel is simply stunning and perfect in so many ways. And if you want to enjoy the Eiffel Tower, make sure you pre booked online before you go. It will guarantee that you get to enjoy the Eiffel Tower without being in a queue for hours and be there at the time you like.

The \"mediocres\": There was nothing really negative about this hotel, but there were a few things that you should be aware of. First, the front desk folks were less than receptive to our requests. They weren't \"rude\" but they certainly weren't as welcoming as other hotel reception desks have been. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, and we waited in the lobby for about an hour even though we arrived in the mid-afternoon (well after check in time). Our room was clean, but there were stains on the sheets, and on the bathroom floor. For the entirety of our stay (3 nights) there were two mattresses sitting in the hall outside our room.

It was wonderful! The rooms are large an comfortable. We had a king sized bed, and it was very comfortable. We arrived via the RER/Metro from CDG airport (more on that later). We exited the Metro at Roosevelt, and the hotel was just about a half block away. The entrance is SOOO small, that we walked right past it! We had to go back to look for #70. Nevertheless, as soon as we entered, we were professionally greeted and relieved of our bags. The interior reception area is very nice, and the staff is impeccable. We arrived around 1:30 pm, but unfortunately our room was not ready, even though we had requested early check-in prior to our arrival. So, we had to come back after 3pm. No worries, because we just went to grab some lunch on the Champs Elysees, then walk over a couple blocks to admire the Arc of Triumph. When we finally got to our room we were pleasantly surprised. It is indeed 4 stars. We knew to request a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the atrium area so that we would have more quiet. After a day of Paris action, the last thing you want to hear is traffic and street noises from the Champs Elysees. And let me tell you, it goes on WELL into the night. They gave us a room on the top floor (#7). All the amenities were provided including a bathrobe, which we loved. They have flat panel tv's with various world channels. Not much in the way of English language tv though. Just boring CNN international and BBC. I have an iPhone, and was impressed that they offer a remote speaker set for you to plug your device into to play your music. A very nice, modern touch. They also provided free internet service in the room. We had breakfast every morning at the restaurant, and it was very nicely apportioned. There's a chef there who will cook your eggs to order, and the variety of foods is just as good as a restaurant. Breakfast was included with our room reservation since we are gold members. They provide USA Today for those who need to keep up on events. The royal couple was getting married that weekend, and it was all over the news...snore... They have a nice little workout facility with a spa and sauna and showers. They even provide towels, fruit, and drinks for free. A nice touch. The elevators are small and surprisingly somewhat creaky, but hey, that's typical in Europe. You are centrally located very well from everything in Paris at this Marriott. We were able to walk a nice big circle around the city in one day that took us first to the Arc of Triumph, then down to the Eiffel Tower, over to the Rodin Museum, then to Luxembourg Gardens, then to the Latin Quarter for lunch. Then to Notre Dame, then to the Louvre, the Tuilleries Gardens, then back up the Champs to the hotel. Yes, it can ALL be done in one day walking...we did it. Don't bring kids on this walk though...it'll be more like the Bataan death march for them. We went back to the hotel and enjoyed a bottle of wine on our balcony and relaxed. It was heaven. Later that evening, we walked back down to the Eiffel Tower to see the light show they give there at the top of the hour. It was spectacular to see it in person, very romantic, and it only takes about 15 minutes to walk it. Previous people have posted here that there are a lot of Middle Easterners at this place. It is true, but when I was walking around down a block from the hotel and up a couple more blocks, I noticed that the Embassy for Kuwait is there...so maybe that's why. I didn't notice the staff giving them any preferential treatment, however. A bit off topic, but a comment about arriving from the CDG airport. It was easy to get to the hotel. So you can take that if you want to save a lot of Euros rather than taking the Bus (the 2nd least expensive option at around 50 euro) or the taxi (outrageously priced at 90-100+ euro). Buy a RER ticket at the station, they speak English if you don't speak French. It costs about 19 Euro total for two people. You Take the RER to Chalet Les Halles, then transfer to the Metro, direction La Defense and get off on Roosevelt. It's the best exit because it has an escalator if you've got luggage. HOWEVER, on the RER train ride in from CDG , you do go through some seedy areas of outer Paris where you'll see shanty towns. We encountered lots of \"angry\" African immigrants. There were tons of them, and they all swarmed the train and just packed it up like sardines so you could barely breathe, let alone move. The mob had no intentions of waiting for the next train. Some were particularly hostile because there were a number of passengers with luggage coming directly from the airport, and it took up precious room. Very, very rude encounter, so you've been fairly warned. You should try to get a seat in the cubicles and away from the doors, otherwise you could wind up in a booby trap. I learned this lesson, so I made sure to follow my own advice on the ride back to the airport. HOWEVER, a different encounter ensued on the way back. I placed my backpack over my head on the small luggage rank (which was too small to hold our actual luggage). And when we eventually went through the seedy part of the ride, a number of roving Arab youth got on the train looking to steal from unsuspecting passengers. This teenager apparently was casing us out, and sat right behind us. When the door opened at one of the seedy stops (there's about 3 of them in a row), he tried to grab my backpack and bolt! Luckily another French speaking couple had seen him and alerted me to the situation thereby preventing him from taking my bag. I had time to take charge of the situation, so he left empty handed. The bag was right above my head, too. But you can imagine how that would play out if he did get his hands on my backpack. You run off the train after the thief, the train leaves you behind, you run around a corner only to catch up to him and his gang of friends. Now you probably have to hand over any other valuables you've got and you're at their mercy in their territory. WATCH OUT. Keep your passport and money on your PERSON at all times! It's a shame that you have to constantly have your guard up.

I'm guessing the towel smell comes from the soap they use to clean it since almost 95% of the towels smelled like vinegar. When it did not smell like vinegar, it smelled foul.

Below are my observations: Stay We checked in on Sunday, 26 December 2010 and checked out on Saturday, 1 January 2011. We arrived at the hotel at about 12:30 PM after very long international flight. Arrival/Check-In The entrance to the hotel is somewhat small and is between the Cafe Montecristo and the Sephora cosmetics store. I never had to open the door of the hotel one time during my stay, as there is a bellman at the door at all hours. From the entrance you go up an escalator and check in is to the right. There should be no confusion between which desk is check in, since a big sign on the counter says \"Reception\". Check in time is 3 PM, but when we arrived the front desk already had a key ready for our room. The front desk staff was very efficient and spoke perfect English. We were staying on Marriott Rewards Points, and the check in staff was still very attentive and helpful. For our Marriott Rewards check in gift we chose a platter of fruit and two drinks. We asked that the gift be delivered to our room at 7 PM so that we would have time for a nap. Later, just like clockwork, the gift was delivered to our room at 7 PM. Room We were assigned to Room 422. As those who are familiar with European buildings know, the lobby is Floor 0, so in the US this would be the fifth floor. It appears that there are a small number of rooms that overlook Avenue Champs Elysee and that a large number of rooms overlook the lobby atrium. Our room had an exterior window that opened (yes the window could be opened) onto an open air courtyard. Thus the room was exceptionally quiet. The room itself was about the size you would expect in a standard Marriott in the United States. Immediately upon entering there was closet to the right that had shelves for luggage and adequate room to hang clothes. The closet also had an iron, ironing board, safe, two bath robes, and two pairs of slippers. Upon entering the room to the left there was a large bathroom. It had a large glassed in shower with both a wall mounted shower head and a hand shower. The bathroom also had a large soaking tub with hand shower. The bathroom was stocked with high end shampoos, body washes, soap, and other necessities. It had a hair dryer, a large vanity, and plenty of shelves for storing your bath supplies. Most surprising the bathroom had a 115V outlet. Though the outlet would only accept non-polarized plugs, I was able to use it charge my Ipod and mobile phone. Unfortunately it was not powerful enough to power a curling iron. The room had a king sized bed, a desk with a chair, an arm chair with an ottoman, a dresser/tv stand, and a large flat screen television. The bed was very comfortable and had plenty of pillows. As I recall the TV had about 10 French , 10 Arabic, 1 Italian (RAI), 2 German, 1 Spanish, and about 10 English language stations. As I recall the English stations included CNBC Europe, BBC One Scotland, BBC World News, Sky News, and France24 English. The room also had an automatic minibar (don't remove items or you will be automatically charged for the item). Location/Transportation We traveled from the airport to the hotel, and around Paris, on the metro or RER. If you arrive at CDG Airport, simply go to the ticket office at the CDG Train Station to buy a ticket upon arrival. The station staff we dealt with spoke English. We traveled with the Passe Navigo Decouverte, which is a smart card that does not require the hassle of paper metro tickets (Google this for more information). From the Airport, you simply take the RER Train to the Chatelet-Les Halles Station, and then transfer to the Metro Line 1, going towards La Defense. Get off Line 1 at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Station. While the hotel is between the George V and Franklin D. Roosevelt Stations, it is nearer Roosevelt. In addition, there is an exit from the Roosevelt Station that has an escalator, which is very helpful if you have any bags. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Station exit is at about 40 Avenue Champs Elysee, so you have to walk about two blocks to the hotel entrance. This hotel is located near a number of mega stores (Disney, Virgin) and is an area that sees a lot of tourist traffic- so be ready for a large amount of people on the street. Because of this the area is very busy and there are many stores nearby that could be of benefit to you. Less than a block from the hotel is a Monoprix, with a full grocery. Monoprix has snacks, fruit, and prepared foods (sandwiches, salads, etc.) for a quick, healthy, and cheap meal. A number of quick service restaurants such as Quick (my favorite), Paul, Brioche Doree, Pomme de Pain, and McDonald's are all nearby for quick meals as well. The hotel is only two metro stops from the Arc de Triomphe, so this would be an ideal start to your visit. Because the Franklin D. Roosevelt stations is served by two metro lines (1 and 9), you can get to most places faster by transit than you could by taxi. The ticket windows seem to always be busy at this station. Services The hotel offers any service that you would expect from a full service hotel. The concierge will make reservations for you at restaurants and will even mail postcards for you. There is a fitness room in the basement of the hotel that has free weights and exercise machines. We were walking a lot and did not use the fitness room, but did notice that the fitness room had free bottled water and showers for those using the area. The hotel had a business center with computers but we did not use it. There was wifi for 20 Euro a day, but we did not use it. The hotel also offers a laundry service. We found a self service laundry (laverie) at 48 Rue Berri, that was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. This laundry came in handy and meant we did not have to pack as many clothes. Food/Dining We only ate at the hotel for breakfast. As Marriott Rewards Platinum we received a full breakfast buffet each day (even on the weekend) for no additional charge. The breakfast had eggs, hot and cold meats, cereals, breads, fruit, juice, and a whole bunch more. If you are paying for the breakfast buffet it would be 29 Euro, so you may want to go next door to Quick if you want to save some money. Breakfast was served from 6:30 AM to 11:30 AM during the week and until Noon on weekends. The restaurant menu had everything from hamburgers to fish and steaks. The prices did not seem unreasonable, but we opted for more budget items nearby. From what we saw the food did look tasty. There is 24 hour room service. Safety As noted above there is a doorman that controls the entrance to the hotel, and security staff is visible in the lobby. You need a key card to use the elevator to get to guest rooms. This hotel was a quiet refuge from the hustle of Avenue Champs Elysee. I saw very few beggars in the area and felt very safe in the subway and going to and from the hotel. Overall We really can't think of any complaints about this hotel. The service was great and was of the highest quality. The room rate is not cheap, but I think it would be a good value given the location and what you get for the money.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for a quick Paris stay\u201d", "Author": "JaeTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR90575686", "Content": "I recently booked a stay at the Marriott Champs-Elysees using points, and like many other reviewers, I was happy to reap the rewards of having Marriott status.

Our room was in the back facing the courtyard, so while it was quiet, it didn't offer the stellar views of the city lights (which would have been lovely, I imagine, since the Champs-Elysees was lit for the holidays while we were there). It was a nice room, with a comfortable bed. The only thing slightly odd was the placement of the showerhead, along the side of the tub rather than at the end of it. Otherwise, no complaints. The service was great, as would be expected from a Marriott. A continental breakfast buffet was included in our stay (otherwise around 30euro). The variety and quality of the spread was fantastic - we often ate enough for breakfast to hold us over for a good portion of the day. Truly the greatest benefit of the hotel is the location. The convenience of being able to easily navigate the city just steps from the doorway was invaluabe.

This past weekend my significant other and I decided to go to Paris for the weekend for a \"just us\" weekend before Christmas. I had stayed at this hotel before and found the location to be excellent and thought it a great way to use some of my Marriott points. A few things to note really: The location is excellent. The heating/air con is from 1970 and without a thermostat. It's a strange dial and button combo that's a bit of a guessing game. We never could get our room cool enough to sleep. I cannot speak to all other rooms but the wifi signal in 121 was so low it was unusable. A few other guests mentioned the same issue so it's worth your while to check the signal in the room before unpacking if you need internet access. The Concierge is awful. As noted on here by other reviewers the concierge service was unreliable. For a 5 star hotel this is simply unacceptable. Upon arriving on Friday night we requested the concierge book us a restaurant for Saturday night. He listed a few options from which we chose Le Duc a seafood restaurant and a time of 8:30pm. We also asked that he book us a taxi for 8pm to get to the restaurant. He told us he would call us to confirm the reservation and the taxi was no problem. By Saturday midday we still hadn't heard from him but were not concerned as we figured if he couldn't get us into Le Duc then surely wherever he did book would be just fine. Upon returning to the hotel we discovered that we had no reservation for dinner nor did we have a taxi booked. Shenanigans ensued and we did eventually get in but this was not the relaxing romantic experience we hoped for. Nor once did he apologize. If you go book your own tables and transport or risk it. By Sunday night it was clear that most of Europe was having travel delays so before we departed we checked with the concierge on the status of the Eurostar trains. True to form he gave us erroneous info and told us all trains were running on time. Now if the internet had worked in the room we would have known this was not at all true and plastered all over every travel site known to man. So after one very unnecessary trip to the train station we came back to the hotel and checked in for another night. There are worse things than being stuck in Paris or so we thought. That night we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant. One very big mistake. It certainly wasn't cheap being a 200 pound meal. The things we ate in common were the beef carpaccio and the escargot. We had different mains. By 4am were almost simultaneously and violently ill. It became fairly clear that we had food poisoning of some sort. Now these things do happen in the nicest of places. It only takes one food handling mistake for someone to become ill and to be honest at that point I was pretty willing to consider it bad luck but did feel the need to tell the general manager so they could at least examine any remaining beef carpaccio and escargot and one would imagine not serve it to other guests. I called in the morning and asked to speak to the general manager and was told he would call back. More than 4 hours later and still no one had returned my call. I called again expressing just how ill we had become and that I felt this was a safety issue for other guests that should at least be known about. 2 hours later I got a call a man who was the head of guest relations, not the general manager. His name was Fabian or Fabio. When I told him how ill we had become he told me that there was no way the food we ate could have caused it because they buy there food from quality vendors and the kitchen has been inspected. So clearly Fabian has not the most basic knowledge about food safety or food poisoning or he would know all it takes is someone using an unclean spoon to cause it. But really it was his next statement that outraged me. I was most likely ill he said because I am an American and I'm not used to fine French cuisine. Nothing like adding insult to injury. And this American happens to live in Europe and my significant other spent his entire childhood in France but thanks for the theory! He also told me he had had excellent reviews of the beef carpaccio. So nothing was done. For all I know the chef was never even told. We were too ill to even stand up long enough to take a shower so we were stuck at the hotel for another night. The pain and stomach cramps were getting to a point where we really did consider going to the hospital as it was clear we were going to need medication of some kind. In the meantime we ordered a bottle of water from room service and the room service waitress upon seeing our condition was appalled and asked if we would like for doctor to be called to the hotel. Bless this woman. It would have been fantastic if say Fabien had mentioned this option! 250 pounds later we had a doctor who confirmed yes this was food poisoning and a round of antibiotics among other things. In grand total our delay due to illness cost us nearly 1000 pounds for the extra night plus the doctor plus medication etc. The hotel never once called to check on us never once offered so much as a bottle of water. In fact when we asked for clean robes they were never brought up. The food poisoning has been so severe that now two days before Christmas we are still eating no more than crackers and water. Our relaxing weekend before Christmas is now threatening to ruin not only the weekend before but Christmas itself. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I have never given a 1 star review but blatant disregard for safety is inexcusable. Thankfully we are not old nor traveling with small children or this could have had a very different outcome. I'm sure in truth one big hotel chain to the next doesn't vary greatly but I have always been loyal to Marriott feeling it was a sure bet when away from home. Not any more. Buyer Beware!

Then our problems started....the taxi i had pre ordered hadnt been pre -ordered and i had to take pot luck outside in a \"grid-locked\" Champs Elysee, to get to a surprise birthday party before the birthday boy - Not surprisingly, this didnt happen! And by the way, the extended check out that i had been given wasnt booked either, as i received a call in my room at 12.15 telling me (very politely) that check out time was midday. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very noisy, but obviously cant blame the hotel for that. Some excellent positives next. Tea and coffee ordered in our room early evening and it arrived quickly, plentiful and with the surprise of some rolls & Jam (what a lovely touch).

At first I thought there was a convention as we were the only ones not dressed in the Middle East garb. We had reserved a suite. As a Marriott shareholder and rewards member I inquired about upgrades, was told no. The suite was fine, located on the top floor, but nothing to write home about. Housekeeping never came before 4:30 the entire time and it was annoying to return to the room after touring to find the place not made up. The first night there, we received a call from our credit card company fraud dept. They said a $5900 charge had been put on the card. It turns out the Marriott Champs Elysees decided that instead of putting the 1st nights room on my card, they took it upon themselves to bills us--on the very first night--for the 4 nights we were staying. This is actually illegal. I called the front desk and was transferred to someone who said it was a 'hold'. No it was a lie. The bill was put through. I am a large Marriott stockholder and will pursue this, as it was insulting. The biggest problem with this hotel is they totally ignored westerners and fell all over the people from the Middle East. It became laughable as the concierge would look over the heads of westerners in line to deal with the sheiks, etc. Internet was $20 euros per day.

We used my husband's Marriott points - and were expecting a small room since we weren't paying for it. (I don't even know how much the room would have been had we not used the points.) To our surprise, we were put in a spacious room on the first floor, with windows that opened up onto the Champs Elysees. There was a small foyer, with steps that led down to the \"sunken\" bedroom, which was spacious. King bed, twin nightstands, desk, dresser, chair and ottoman. The bathroom was huge, with a separate tub from the shower. Shower was nice but there was a huge step down into the bath area - make sure to be wide awake or it's a recipe for a nasty fall. When we arrived, it was too early to check in. The woman who checked us in, when hearing that we wanted to freshen up, gave us keys to access the gym which had showers and a dressing area. However, we couldn't find it based on the directions she gave us. (I did find it later, and it was tricky to get to.) Had the concierge hang onto our luggage while we went to the Tour d'Eiffell for lunch - it did seem like the concierge was inundated with people and we had to wait some time before being helped, without so much as a \"be right with you.\" Fortunately, all of the staff spoke English, but I tried to at least start any conversation with \"Bonjour!\" and I think they were appreciative of that. I agree with one of the other reviewers - there were lots of Arab men in the lobby lounge that seemed to be there day and night. One was perhaps a sheik or some other dignitary wearing a huge turban; in the morning we went down for breakfast, and they had set up the area for them with all sorts of pastries, with napkins covering it until they arrived. Hours later when we checked out, the set up was still there - it was like they were instructed to make sure the area was ready for whatever second these people were arriving. Breakfast was included with our stay - it was fantastic - a nice buffet consisting of everything you could ever imagine, all good quality and fresh. From what I hear from others, it would have been pricey had we have paid for it on our own. Since this was right on the Champs Elysees, I expected it to be noisy. It wasn't - initially. It was situated next to the Sephora - and at times in the early evening they had loud music to try to lure people into the store. However, this couldn't be heard from inside the hotel unless we opened the windows. Later that night, there was a lot of activity from the world cup revelers- and it seemed like one big party outside. But again, we couldn't hear much from our room unless we opened the windows. However, at 7:30 AM, we were abruptly awaken by loud dance music that seemed to be coming from either the room next door or above us. When I say loud, I mean LOUD. We called the front desk to complain, and they said they would look into it. The music kept starting and stopping; just when we thought we would get back to sleep, on it came again. My husband went out to try to figure out where it was coming from and called the desk again. They said it was the Sephora next door, and there was nothing they could do about it. That was a bunch of BS - when I opened the window overlooking the Champs Elysses, it was quiet, with no noise anywhere. I also checked and the Sephora didn't even open until 10am. We think it may have bee the Arab sheik or whoever it was, and they figured they couldn't tell them to keep it down. So overall, nice place, nice location, but it was ruined by the loud music in the morning. I wish they would have been honest with us about its origin, rather than lie and blame Sephora. If I could be assured of a quiet room, I would consider staying there again. Glad it wasn't on our dime, or we would have asked for a refund.

We acutally only used a taxi twice, arriving and departing for the Air France bus to the airport. We found the book of ten tickets to be the more practical than purchasing a pass for the Metro. Our fourth floor room had everything we expected, and the view was of the patio area of the hotel restaurant, which was usually not in use due to the cool weather. We used the little refrigerator to store a few snacks, and as the items are automatically billed to the room when lifted off the weight sensitive shelf, we had a few charges result from squeezing a yogurt or cheese in. However, we let the desk know that we had not consumed those items, and they cheerfully removed the charges. ( we did not wait until the end of the week to check on this). Bathroom was fabulous. Great shower, luxurious tub, and towels replaced morning and evening. Godiva chocolates on the pillow always a nice touch. Very comfortable king bed. Morning coffee & tea in the lobby was appreciated. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, but chose a different patisserie most days. We did have dinner one night at \"The Restaurant\". We used a Marriott \"Dinner for Two\" certificate, though we only had three of the four courses (they only had dinner sized salads, although our waiter offered to have them create a small salad for me). It was a lovely dinner, if not as many exciting choices as some places, and would have been rather expensive without the certificate. (filet of sole, 45 euros) My husband said his foie gras was the best he'd ever had, my eggplant, mozzarella and tomato terrine was terrific, and the filet of sole and steak were good, as was dessert and coffee.

It was a spectacular blue sky day, and from the Trocadero, a festive way to say good bye to Paris. When we go back to Paris, we would stay here only if we had extra Marriott points.

We split our hotels because we were using points at both. As far as location, the Westin was our favorite. But, as far as the hotel itself, it was Marriott. First of all, Marriott upgraded us to an executive suite which was simply incredible -- first class all the way. It was a huge suite -- bedroom with extremely comfortable kingsize bed, living area, 2 flat screen tvs, bar, and luxurious bathroom. I have found that Marriott will upgrade very easily if anything is available, unlike Starwood hotels (Sheraton, le Meridien, Westin) which want to charge you for the upgrade. I also thought the Marriott, while very classy, was not quite as \"stuffy\" as the Westin. Both hotels had lovely common areas and professional staff. In regard to location, I love anything opposite the Tuilleries Garden, which was the Westin. We would go out in the early evening and just relax in the garden, sometimes with a picnic. It is easy walking to the Louvre, Place de la Concorde, Place Vendome, Opera area, and the Seine. The Marriott is also in a great location right on the Champs Elysees between Round Point and the Arch. It is nice for strolling and easy walking to river cruises, shopping, and convenient to the metro. That said, the Champs Elysees isn't what it used to be. We saw an increased number of beggars and homeless persons and an increased amount of trash on the sidewalks. However, it is still nice for the evening (or daytime) stroll, with lots of cafes to sit and watch the hordes of people passing by. I think the folks at Marriott really do a nice job with their hotels.

Nothing for this hotel was noted before we left on our trip. Upon arrival, we checked in and no one said anything about repairs/construction, we were given a room on the 5th floor.

No go. Kept happening. Ultimately, on day 4, we complained again, quite vocally (and we noticed that the person at the counter in the line next to us was also raising a stink about the same thing).

However, this hotel does not disappoint in terms of service, amenities, cleanliness and location. AND the breakfast buffet was great here, too. Actually, to be honest food in Paris is great everywhere you go. They take great pride in preparing food so I don't ever rememeber having a bad meal the whole time I was there. The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Champs Elysees; a couple of blocks from the Arc de Triumph and about a 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower.

I lived in Manhattan for five years and let me tell you; it's got nothing on Paris in terms of tourist and local traffic alike. When you walk out of the front door of the hotel, you are bombarded by the traffic. It got on my nerves a little bit but that's just me.

The only good experience we had was the restaurant called George V which is just a few blocks away from the hotel. The cuisine is authentic French and the service is awesome. However, this was one of our most expensive meals during our entire trip. I think my tea came to $9 Canadian after conversion! LOL Most expensive tea I ever had. One more piece of advice: If you want the absolute BEST pictures of Paris, head to Notre Dame and climb the bell tower. I can't even begin to explain how amazing the views are.

It bills itself as the only hotel actually on the Champs-Elysees. It is a 5 minute walk SE from the Arc de Triomphe and convenient to the Metro transit stop (FDRoosevelt). The hotel entrance is attractively tucked into a vintage facade, which could be passed-by if not for the doorman, flags and discreet Marriott signage. Inside, the lobby and reception area are modern with an atrium which rises to the upper floors. Our room faced out the rear of the building, onto a rather typical business street without a spectacular view. This may be desirable, however, as the street noise at the front of the building - along the Champs-Elysees - might be considerable. Our sleeping area, with king bed, was on a \"loft\" just a few steps up from the room entrance and desk area. The bathroom was modern and all furnishings were clean and functional. There was ample space to include a rollaway bed. Internet service is available for a daily fee. The hotel staff was VERY attentive. Our requests for extra blankets were filled immediately. The front desk clerks and concierge staff were friendly, never overburdened and always willing to please. They provided numerous tips for our travels which enhanced our stay in Paris. We only ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant, which consisted of an ample hot and cold buffet, with fruits, fresh breads/pastries and eggs cooked-to-order from an omelette chef. It was a relaxing start to our day. There are many fine dining options available nearby - and, of course, shopping options in every direction. Considering the weakness of the US dollar during our stay, it's difficult to determine the \"value\" of this hotel relative to others in Paris. Americans will certainly experience sticker shock at check-out. However, the Marriott Champs-Elysees provided us a luxurious experience, traveling as a family, that we would not have been able to receive if we had stayed at a smaller boutique property or a lesser-rated hotel.

Although the Paris Marriott is quite nice, my expectations were not entirely fulfilled. My wife and I had gotten very spoiled by the other Marriott's along the way because we had access to the Executive Lounges due to my Platinum status in the Marriott Rewards program. The Paris Marriott does NOT have an Executive Level nor lounge, although Gold and Platinum members are treated to the breakfast buffet in the restaurant each day (value is 30 Euros each). Our room (328), while nicely appointed, but small. The floors do not have ice machines and we had to call down each time we needed a bucket. The carpet was somewhat worn in the room but everything else was in perfect working order. The bathroom was large and decorated very nicely, although the showerhead was mounted \"length-wise\", so the curtain had to be drawn in order to take a shower, otherwise the spray would flood the bathroom (go figure). The A/C was long to cool off the room, which I thought was odd given the overall size of the area to be cooled. The bed was comfortable but a bit on the soft side, as opposed to the firm side here in the U.S. The hotel is right between two metro stations, Franklin D. Roosevelt and George V ( pronounced \u201cJorg Sank\u201d). I preferred using the George V station because it seemed a tad bit closer. We made extensive use of the Metro and purchased a 3 day pass, which was well worth it. We did not have lunch or dinner in the restaurant but noted extremely high prices when viewing the menu. Expect to pay well over $100 for dinner for 2, although I\u2019m sure it would be a great meal. The prices at the lobby bar were also very high. The hotel location is probably the best in all of Paris, but the Champs-Elysees is just like Times Square. It's extremely crowded and very noisy. Those that get a room overlooking the boulevard may have major problems with noise. Our room was tucked away overlooking the courtyard and was exposed to street noise when the window was open. Once closed, it was completely quiet. There are mini-bars in each room but be careful because just touching an item may trigger a charge. We did not purchase anything from the bar during our stay but used the bar to store drinks we bought on the outside. Just the placement of our items in the fridge triggered a few charges on our bill, which were immediately removed by staff with no questions asked. A physical inventory each day would be nice to prevent erroneous charges such as this. Be prepared to enter a smoke cloud when entering the lobby from the street. We had a non-smoking room. The only way to sit down to a computer is by purchasing time in the Business Center located in the lobby (I think internet access was 10-15 Euro's an hour). Right down the street at 66 Champs Elysees was an Internet center that cost 8 Euro's per hour. The hotel does not have a gift shop, but down the street, one block to the left (when exiting the lobby), is a store called Monoprix. The lower level has a well stocked grocery store. Housekeeping was good as was the front desk staff. The concierge's were very helpful and friendly. At no time did we experience any snobbery at all, each one of the staff were very friendly and spoke English fluently. Taxi fare to/from De Gaulle airport was exactly 40 Euros ($53.60) each way. Getting to the hotel by subway is a bit complicated and not convenient when traveling with heavy luggage due to very few escalators in the system, and some stations are very deep resulting in lots of stairs. Air France does run a bus service, but the stop is at the Arch de Triumph at Charles de Gaulle Etoile and is a hefty walk, and uphill.

A block or two from the best metro in the world!! Right on the Champs-Elysees, The rooms were large and spotless, beds very comfortable, bathroom nice with a big shower and bath. The staff was so helpful and not at all condescending. In fact, I felt very welcome in France. We ate in several restaurants off the George V. we just went around looking at menus until one met our fancy. All were great. We brought our morning pastries from Paul's ( a bakery with many outlets , I noticed) They were good, and easy to get. I would go into one of the shopping arcades in the morning and get fresh squeezed orange juice form a stand there.

You can get a good sized room or a small one, a room on the back alley (pretty noisy), courtyard or facing the lobby (last two are the best option so ask for that). You also have to ask for non smoking as many foreigners stay here and if smoking bothers you, the smoking rooms can be very strong smelling.

Now I don't want to come across as unfair like some other reviewers. The hotel is very beautiful and the room is nice for European standards; however it was just too small for the price. The location was top notch, with an array of restaurants and shopping at a walking distance. Aside from the fantastic shopping on the street, one cannot go to Paris and not visit the historic bakery Laduree. Laduree is practically across the street and it is famous for their excuisite Parisian Macaroon cookies as well as a menu full of sweet delights. I highly recommend the dessert called \"Creme de Isphahan\". The best part of staying at this location was the fact that the street is alive well even after midnight. It was great to do all the sight seeing activities during the day and know that the avenue would be open with shops and restaurants well into the night. The hotel staff was good about telling us about the shows (Lido/Moulin Roge). They also provided us with information about open/closing times and ticket prices.

This has the Louvre right down at one end and the Arc D\u2019Triomphe at the other. The prices at the Marriot do vary a huge deal over the course of the year based on when the major tourist season and major events, like Paris fashion week, take place. Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay. However, it can be expensive with a room around 240 euros a night. I have always been staying there as I have been attending meetings being run at the hotel. The bedrooms are a good size, not huge but a decent size, and feature the fantastic Marriot beds, loads of pillows and comfy duvet. The beds are something that everyone who has not stayed at the hotel comment on. They almost all look out over the back of the building so have no real view. But they are very quiet as a result. The bathrooms are also pretty good with decent sized bath and separate shower. The mini bar is, like all mini bars, well stocked and costly. There is a large restaurant that is ok with breakfasts costing about 22 euros for Continental and 26 for American. This seems a lot, and so worth trying to get a bed and Breakfast rate if you are the breakfast type! There is a lobby bar with very friendly staff that is right in the middle of reception so alright for meeting people before heading out, but not suitable as a \u201cdestination\u201d bar.

It was pretty quiet until our last night where there was a party going on next to us and a party above us and yelling in the courtyard. The rooms are clearly not very soundproofed. Overall, the service was good, the people were pleasant and language wasn't too much of a barrier. However, I was very surprised that they did nothing to make up for the inconvenience of the noise.

I cannot say enough about the location. It's so amazing to step out the door onto the Champs Elysees. Plus, you feel very special that it's the only hotel on the strip. There are always tons of people around, even the wee hours of the morning, but you would never know as our room was very quiet. It is on 2 subway lines (good for the touristy stuff) which is fantastic. We also stayed here on points. I can't imagine anyone paying 775E which was the listed price. It was nice and all, but for that price I would expect high end luxury!", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cNo Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3532023", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights with wife and 8 month old doughther. The hotel was ok, but the only thing that was excellent was breakfast (should be at 25 euro per person). We paid around 450 euro a night - it was worth maybe 180. For that price you expect a nicer looking lobby, nicer rooms, better towels, bathrobes (not just one, if you are two - you should not have to complaint about such things) The gym was the worst I have seen, in a smal basement they had a few cheap machines. I didn\u00b4t like the location, Champs-Elysees is realy touristy - the crowd at night-time is quite trashy. There is so may nice beautiful streets and areas in Paris so finding a better location is easy. If it woluld have been a cheap hotel offering five star service it would have been ok, but at the rates they charge, you can find much better places...

We were using our Marriott points and we owed nothing when we check out so that also enters into my opinion. We got there about 10am and were told that while we could have a non-smoking room immediately if we also wanted a king size bed that we would have to wait about 2 hours. We left our luggage and ran errands (metro and museum passes, breakfast, etc) When we came back our room was ready. It was the last room at the end of the hall. The bathroom was great and the bed was super comfortable. But when we tried to nap, there was construction going on that made it difficult. We were told that it was in the building next door and that they would try to move us. They never did, but the noise never happened again so it didn't matter. We found the staff helpful. The concierge confirmed dinner reservations for us and made new reservations as well. We asked for a late checkout on Sunday (1pm) and that was fine. Our only problem was getting a taxi at night. The security guard can't leave and spoke almost no English so we didn't realize that only the bellman could get a cab. The Marriott person for the time shares was in the lobby but my husband said he would have to check with me, and we managed to avoid the situation whenever we left. We had a great time at a very nice hotel. However, the price posted outside the hotel was 775 euros for a regular room. There is no way that I would ever pay that much, but using a points was a great bargain.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Marriott product, marred by unhelpful, haughty front desk staff...\u201d", "Author": "sarahpartridge", "ReviewID": "UR3230663", "Content": "I stayed here for one night last weekend. As a silver member of the Marriott Rewards programme, I am loyal to the brand, and will always choose the Marriott option if available when travelling throughout Europe. Therefore we always feel at home with Marriott as it is so familiar. It was therefore rather shocking to experience haughty, officious desk staff. I arrived at 4pm, only to be told that my room wasn't ready. I asked why this was the case and was advised that it was Sunday and there were a lot of late check-outs. Not my issue, I would have thought. I was told to take a seat and wait. I was not told how long to wait, nor was I offered any refreshment. I really wasn't happy. I waited 15 minutes watching others check in and receive room keys. I asked again. Again told to wait. 5 minutes later I said that I would have hoped to have been accomodated by now, this really wasn't good enough and may I speak with the Manager. I did, and he miraculously found me a room. It was tiny. I mean really tiny. Way smaller than I have ever seen in a Marriott (I should have guessed when he asked me if I was travelling alone). I rushed out of the hotel to run an urgent errand, and on my return asked for a more suitable accomodation. Another manager processed this for me and I was located in a decent sized double. Much better, as I had to spend all evening and a lot of the next day working. Ordered room service, and received an excellent response! Great tasting, beautifully presented, by warm and helpful staff. I was feeling right back at home with my Marriott experience. The location is good if you like the whole touristy, rip-off prices, Champs-Elysees thing.
