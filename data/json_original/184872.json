Charming? Um, that's not the word that comes to mind... GOOD POINTS: Okay, yes, the location of this hotel couldn't be better- off the main street two blocks, tree lighted and small park across the strett, in a beautiful and quiet residential neighborhood. The West End is a five minute walk, as is #1 English Bay Beach. A MILLION medium priced restaurants start 2 blocks away. Safeway, three short blocks, the library two. Bus connections to EVERYWHERE in Vancouver, just 2 blocks away, and Vancouver has STELLAR public transportation. Probably the best situated hotel in town for a tourist visitor. Our room in the corner of the 3rd floor was quiet. The staff was 24 hours, very friendly and helpful. NOT SO GOOD: 1) No elevator. 2) No phone. 3) No hot water maker coffee pot in the small cramped room. (Pay phone in lobby, coffee and hot water in lobby). 4) No air-conditioning 5) Slow Wireless Internet 4) Below average (or worse) room: The bed was cheap, small, and firm, and not particularly big- Queen? Don't think so, probably a full. The furniture is cheap college dorm, the bathroom adequate, but no electric next to the mirror even. The TV is small 18\" flat screen digital BUT with analog signal 10 feet from the head of the bed- so yeah, small fuzzy picture. Enough to fall asleep to. One wall outlet turned off along with the room wall switched light, leaving one hard to get at plug behind the TV. The bathroom heat could not be turned off, and no hot bath water at 3 AM. Was fine in regular evening. No air conditioning, just a fan. Probably unbearable in hot weather. We lucked out. Needed paint and patch up of holes in bathroom wall. The bed was cheap, small, and firm, and not particularly big- Queen? Don't think so, probably a full. At night, if everyone is online in the hotel, the internet is useless. Slowwwww. I had to walk 2 blocks to an all night coffee shop to get work done one night. This is not even a decent Motel 6 in regards to room presentation. For us, I had to return a broken TV to exchange for a good one, toilet paper roll fell apart (we managed to fix). I would imagine in hot weather, the room would be unbearable- no air conditioning. SUMMARY: Are you vacationing for the hotel room or the city? For us, the room was nothing more that a place to crash in after a full day of activity outside the hotel. So it worked. It was a nice place to stay- once we left the room- because the location is indeed perfect. However, the room isn't a place you want to do anything but fall asleep in. It ain't pretty. The Silvia is a better place, albeit more money a few blocks away with most of the advantages of the Buchan's location, although the Silvia is a stones throw from the main street one block over, and might not be absolutely as quiet with traffic. I'm guessing Siliva has phones and elevators, and revamped rooms at a little more money. Price them both out. You get what you pay for. Frankly, I think the Buchan is still overpriced for what it delivers. As I understand it, this hotel is run by a bunch of Dentists-- and they are cheap arses to not put a little more money into this place. I mean, come on, paint it even. I've seen better college dorms than this-- fortunately, the quality of our vacation hinged little on the quality of our room at the Buchan. Probably the cheapest deal in town for a good located hotel. So, take your pick- this or the Silvia for a bit more money. Only Recommended with strong reservations about the quality of these accommodations. In hot weather, I think I would pass, just because of lack of air conditioning-- but how hot does Vancouver get, and when? Don't even know if the Silvia has air....

When we got to our room the first word that came to mind was \u201cdismal\u201d. If I wasn\u2019t exhausted, if it wasn\u2019t so late, if I had more money, I probably would have turned around. Instead I crawled into bed and closed my eyes against the ugliness. I will say that the bed was comfortable. The next morning we went to Stanley Park \u2013 the location *almost* makes up for the hotel itself. It was just minutes until we reached the park. Additionally, the area surrounding the hotel is amazing \u2013 there are tons of fantastic restaurants offering diverse cuisine. The room was relatively newly painted. The furniture is mismatched \u2013 like a dorm room from the sixties. The bathroom is definitely outdated. There was one socket in the room, which made it impossible to run the fan (there is no air conditioning, which kind of sucked during a heat wave), tv and recharge our phones. There is no phone in the room. Internet access is expensive. Oh, and someone has made the poorest choice of window treatments ever. The curtains didn\u2019t even close let alone keep light out. I paper-clipped them shut each night to try to keep some light out. I guess my advice for making the place nicer would be to work with what you have. Meaning, the rooms are awkwardly sized and furnished \u2013 so rather than painting everything cream, paint the rooms in funky colours and play up the hotel\u2019s uniqueness. There are lots of boutique hotels that do just that. I realize this is a budget hotel, but you can repaint fairly cheaply and \u2013 at least cosmetically \u2013 remove some of the dreariness from the room. Budget doesn\u2019t have to mean ugly. Finally, on the budget point. For probably $10-$20 more per night we could have stayed at a much nicer hotel. In the end, it really wasn\u2019t much of a deal staying here.

First the good points; the hotel staff are most hospitable, helpful and knowledgeable about their city, so getting around is no problem. The hotel is situated in a peaceful locn. a block from Stanley Park, 500m from English beach, and on a bus route for North Vanc. and Capilano. Also bars and restaurants 200m away. The downtown area is a bus ride but walkable in 25-mins. Bad points; the rooms while cosy with a lot of English floral patterns, not all have en-suites. Our bathroom although tidy, had a constant whiff of mildew, which was prevalent around the bath and on the shower curtain. Plug sockets were a bit loose, and nestling under the bedside table were fingernail clippings from a previous occupant. There was no lift, so lugging 20kg bags (x 4) proved a bit energy sapping for me. Also, on one of the landings was this dreadful stench of an open sewer or a foul waste drain from outside which drifted into parts of the hotel. General points; a great city which has a lot of things to see and do. Still many areas/metro brand-spanking new after 2010 Winter Olympics. Is a tad more expensive than most Canadian cities, really on par with back home cost-wise. The city has a high profile gay/lesbian scene, and in the Gastown area near the water, is not unlike San Francisco, but without the hills. The hotel was meant as a budget stop, and budget was what we got. Other factors contributed to a positive opinion of the place, which importantly, should be borne in mind if stopping here.

They serve Northern Italian food which is delicious. Not cheap but nice for a special treat! - there is a nice sitting room across from the front desk- a cozy place to read, etc. Newspapers are provided as is hot water and tea bags. Now the negatives: - There is no elevator in the hotel so if you're on the third floor, you have to lug your bags up - There is no a/c which for our week, was a problem because it was particularly warm. There were ceiling fans but they didn't cool the room down much. After one sweltering night, we requested 2 rooms on the first floor. The staff had us pack up our bags and they moved them downstairs for us. Another strange thing in the bathrooms..you have to step up into them because they're not even with the floor.

The only redeeming part of this whole disaster was the fact I was only charged half of one night's rate for leaving after 2 hours.", "Date": "September 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cDelightful location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1438453", "Content": "I stayed at the Buchan Hotel with a large group of friends (Singles On Sailboats) who flew in and chartered 8 boats to sail the Gulf Islands. The day we flew in was quite warm, 9/5, and there is no air conditioning - some rooms had fans. There also is no elevator and hauling bags and sailing gear up to the second or third floor was a nuisance. However, the rooms were clean and the windows did open - and the location, just a couple blocks from everything, was fabulous. There is no food service but the restaurant in the lower level (NO connection to the hotel) was outstanding for dinner. We stayed one Friday night and came back a week later for a Saturday night - the staff was very helpful with maps and reserving cars to take us to the airport early in the morning. I would certainly stay there again!", "Date": "November 5, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1331202", "Content": "You can't expect a 5 star hotel for this price, but it is clean and in a wondeful location.

The hotel was established in 1926 and appears not to have been renovated since. My room had an old sink with faucets. Some rooms only have sinks and toilet and showers are shared. My room was tiny with a tiny little 13\" television, not that I was planning on watching anything anyway. The only think the hotel had going for it was the friendly staff and ample tourist information. They offer free coffee and tea, but instead of milk or cream they only have Coffeemate (this seems to be everywhere in Vancouver). There is a fancy restaurant in the same building, which does not belong to the hotel but looks interesting, though it is only open evenings. It seems that there are no good accommodations with private bathrooms for under 100$ during high season in BC. Visitors are better off staying at the Sylvia Hotel, Rosellen Suites or Coast Plaza Suites, which are all nearby, otherwise at a bed and breakfast.", "Date": "July 20, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat rates and location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR642846", "Content": "I have just returned from a vacation in Vancouver .My grandson and I stayed at the Buchan Hotel .I decided to stay there after reading a favourable review on this site.
