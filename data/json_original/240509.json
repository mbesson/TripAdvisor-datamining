It is a fairly quiet resort so not alot of loud partiers there while we were there anyway. The rooms,hotel,gardens,and pool are kept very clean. Food is good and there was always something we could find that we liked and the staff is very friendly. Location is excellent because it is right at the end of the famous 5th ave strip where you can go from bar to bar,shops and restaurants that is almost 20 blocks long! It is about a 10-15 min walk to the beach from the hotel. If your looking for nightlife take a walk down 5th ave there are dance clubs,live bands,and best of all the Coco Bongo!

This resort is very compact. Six buildings of rooms. The main buffet, nightime show stage and A la carte restaurant are all under the same roof. Walk a few steps from there and you are in the lobby or at the pool. You may think it would be easy to get around but be careful of the walkways with gaps and uneven stones. Very easy to trip even before a few drinks! Foliage is mature and beautiful. Grounds extremely well maintained. FOOD and DRINKS I would say the food was better than I expected. Always fresh but very limited variety. There are just 7 serving stations including the coffee, dessert, bread and salad bar, so actual hot food stations are just 2, sometimes 3. We never did see a lunch buffet as we were always off the resort to eat elsewhere, as planned. If we dined here three times a day everyday I would not be satisfied with selection. You can get bacon at breakfast from the omelet station. It is chopped up small for in omelets but still tasty. There was always local fare to try such as fried taco chips with sauce, or smothered pork for breakfast. Maria's a la carte for dinner had good chicken fajitas and service was great. We liked the red and white wines offered. Think good home brew quality. Mixed drinks were tasty and not watered down. The 24 hour snack bar is hit or miss depending on the time of day and when it was last stocked. It was always interesting to look under the lid. Nice to be able to pour your own beer or wine anytime of day. STAFF Always friendly and smiling. Most are very young. Service is not over the top but if you ask for something they respond willing to help. The bellman, Jesus, was teriffic. Maid always left unique towel art, some of the best I've seen! Entertainment team work very hard and are nice to chat with on the beach during the day. It makes you want to catch a show or two. ROOMS 101 and 103 Tulum building #1 We booked the upgraded Master Suite. This was to ensure us a ground floor room, patio with hammock and use of the Gran Porto Real facilities. Upon check-in they ask for proof of your booking. I had a Westjet print out but my friend at first could not find hers.They would not give her the upgrade until it could be proven through calls to Westjet and a credit card imprint, that she indeed had the upgrade. It worked out after an unwanted hassle at the front desk so be sure to print off everything! The pictures of rooms on the website are accurate enough but at first we were taken to a second floor Family master suite. The balconies are barely big enough for the two plactic lawn chairs on them. We had to return to reception and wait another hour for the right rooms to be ready. By 6 pm they were ready. Our mini bar was not stocked until the next day but after that no problem. Our fridge kept things barely cool but AC was wonderful. Both our rooms had new AC units. No smoke alarm in our room but our friend (103) had one. No DVD player but friends room had one. No table on the balcony but friend had one. If you need these things just ask. Our safe required a key and you have to sign a paper saying you will pay $100 USD if it is lost. Bathroom tiny and shower leaks water over the floor if the curtain isn't just right. Only toiletries provided are two small soap and shampoo. No hairdryer but ask at the front desk for one. We had a set of bunkbeds along with our King bed in the room, like the family suites have. If you find the King bed hard ( and it is) you can always crash on the softer bunk. We grew to like to room as the week went on. It's large and comfortable. It was clean, just the age of the resort make grout and tiles look dingy. UPGRADE Is it worth it? I'm still not sure. You have to wear two bracelets. We ate lunch twice at the Gran Porto beach grill ( basic burgers, fries, dogs, and chicken) You cannot eat at their buffet in your swimsuit, so spending the day at the beach requires a change of clothes if you plan to eat in. We used their lovely 24 hour lounge for internet. 20 pesos for 20 minutes. We ate dinner at the Italian A la carte,( best steak we've had in a long time) and the Mexican A la carte ( nothing special and the Real has a Mexican). They make you sign a slip anytime you enter the Porto restaurants. The Porto resort is very nice so I will look for a deal there first before upgrading the Real next time. LOCATION Outstanding!!! This was why we were staying here and do not regret it in the least. The lobby is open to 5th Ave. On warm evenings the lobby bar is perfect for people watching while you can hear the latin music playing from the Cuban dance club across the streeet. We walked walked walked all over town. Never did take a cab or shuttle to anything. So enjoyable to be out about town and venture off 5th to eat and shop. OVERALL Great value for prime time travel in the heart of Playa. We have stayed in much nicer places in Mexico ( Grand Palladium and the Catalonia Yucatan) but enjoyed this trip more. We knew we wanted to explore Playa for more than a day trip. Didn't mind the stroll to the beach in the least.

It was our first major trip ever and we were definitely very excited to go to Mexico. We were disappointed by the hotel's distance from the beach (about a 15 minute walk) and location of the hotel's \"beach club\" on the beach. It was annoying to have to walk back and forth every time we wanted to go to the beach (and we got some pretty good blisters too!) The beach was pretty to look at with white sand and the water was beautiful, however there are lots of rocks in the water that hurt our feet and made it difficult to get out into the water. The bar service at the beach club was good and there were tons of open chairs when we went (probably because there weren't many people staying at our hotel). The service at our hotel was great and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and tried their best to make our stay enjoyable. Our room was basic but clean. Unfortunately the food at our hotel was not good at all but we managed to find some good vendors along the street. Most of the time when we ordered drinks or even water at our hotel, the plastic glasses had soapy bubbles in them. The location of the Real Playa del Carmen is good for shopping, dining and entertainment since it's right on 5th avenue (which is great because you won't get that at your hotel!) I would definitely go back to Playa del Carmen because we had a blast but there are hotels with much better value in Playa than this one.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moose Jaw, Canada", "Title": "\u201csecond time at real never again\u201d", "Author": "dan s", "ReviewID": "UR124472768", "Content": "hey travelers we went back to real playa for second year in a row from last year to this year night and day. went for two weeks this time.staff was great place was clean but food was terrible the last five days. the last day on check out they took our wrist bands and would not give us any food or drinks while waiting in their lounge for our bus to the air port. had to upgrade at an extra $ 340. then had to change rooms cause the upgraded room was small and dark. the food my god the food from the day before was in the buffet the next day . ribs were recycled three days in a row we will not be going back there so sad loved it there and price was good", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThird vacation at the Real Playa Del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "Christoble0556", "ReviewID": "UR124034419", "Content": "This is the third vacation that my wife and I have spent at the Real Playa Del Carmen. We seem to enjoy it more and more every time that we go there. It is a small three star resort with service that exceeds any service that I have found at any five star resorts. We befriended a Doctor and his wife that were staying at the Royal which is a 5 diamond resort a 10 minute walk away. When we compared the service at both resorts, we came to the conclusion that the service was better at the Real Playa Del Carmen. Under the supervision of Bersain, the dayshift staff consisted of Sonja, Marbella, Heydi, Maria and Freddie who were all a delight to deal with. The afternoon shift under the supervision Raul had Eberito, Mateo, Michel along with others taking care of your every need. There is also Christian at the front lobby bar during the day and the very hardworking Cesar in the evenings. If you are a person who likes to meet new people from around the world, then the Real Playa Del Carmen is the place to be. It is a resort in the heart of Playa Del Carmen that due to its small intimate nature, you can\u2019t help but meet new people. This time we met some very nice people from Sweden as well as Finland and Norway. Western Canada also had some people staying there that were a real hoot. I also ran into people like ourselves that have been there before and predictably enough, for the same reasons we are repeat customers. My wife had a conversation with an older couple that have vacationed in Cancun in the past. They had found Cancun to be a place although nice was one of either beach or cement with very little greenery or vegetation. They changed to Playa Del Carmen where more vegetation is evident. Specifically at the Real Playa Del Carmen, the resort buildings surround a beautiful garden type atmosphere well taken care by the head groundskeeper Francisco, an honest lovable man that takes pride in his work. The animation team was the resorts entertainment and were a driving force for bringing many people together socially. The team consisted of four members. The spokesman Danijel from Croatia, Alejandro from Mexico City, the beautiful Raquel also from Mexico City and their gorgeous choreographer Vyaney from Vera Cruz Mexico. The shows they provided in the evenings were very interactive with the audience and everyone always has a good time. I found their international show to be very good and they were also putting the finishing touches on a new show called \u201cyesterday\u201d which was also quite enjoyable. During the afternoons you often see them busily practicing for the evenings shows. Don\u2019t be surprised if they come and ask if they can sit down and have lunch with you as they do this with guests every day. It is always interesting conversation and it made my wife and I feel more welcome then we already did. There is a lot of Mexico that I still want to see but it may have to wait a while because I want to go back to the Real Playa Del Carmen again. It is in a nice central location for doing a lot of things where you would normally need arranged transportation if you were in a resort outside of the town. For instance it is walking distance to Coco Bongo and to the ferry dock to go to Cozumel. A word regarding the house tequila that is offered at the Real Playa Del Carmen, It is called \u201cMonte Azul\u201d and I found it to be one of the best sipping tequilas I have had. It has just a hint of Vanilla in it. I have sampled many of the Mexican tequilas from Don Julio, Tres Mujeres, Corralejo, 1800, etc. which are all good but rather expensive tequilas. This one took me by surprise. Be aware that it is hard to find for purchase, I was told it was only available in Cancun. Set pretension aside, try the Real playa Del Carmen, meet new people, enjoy the animation team. By the end of our vacation we both felt as though we part of a bigger family.

We arrived Dec 31st and left Jan 7th. This was my first vacation :) As I am new to travelling, I am also new in knowing what to expect when visiting another country. I did however have a pretty grounded expectation of this hotel having done a lot of research online before arriving which included reading the reviews on this site and others. We booked the trip with the assistance of a travel agent and chose the Master One Bedroom Suite Upgrade to enjoy full all-inclusive privileges at the sister resort - Gran Porto Real on the beach. Room The rooms are adequate - bed, bathroom, couch, etc. and could use a serious upgrade. Decor and cleanliness reminded me of a college dorm party room. With the upgrade we paid for I was quite disappointed with a couple things: 1) The overall cleanliness of the room was sub-standard. The maids seem to work really hard with tidying things left laying around (make cute towel animals n' stuff), but I was confused what exactly they were cleaning. Bedspread looked like it had been in there (and not washed) since 1985 and I think our linens may have been changed once during our stay. 2) The shower sucked. Period. Could not move the shower head from a horrible direction which in addition to having to contort my body to take said shower, the floor got soaked every time. Water stayed hot long enough to get shampoo happening.... rinsed off cold. 3) The mini-bar contained half eaten food and half full bottles of water, pop and beer when we checked-in. Stayed this way the whole week. Food The buffet was repetitive and a little weird at times. Tripe soup at breakfast? Not so much. Thankful that there were at least some familiar choices at each sitting. Did always find something to eat that wasn't too bizarre. Ate a lot of fruit and salads and tried things that looked okay here and there without getting sick. 24-hour snack bar Fries, grilled cheese, nachos, cheese sauce, salsa, etc. Sounds good, right? Not if it's been sitting there since the bedspread was last changed. The only thing good about the snack bar was the never-ending beer tap after stumbling in off 5th Ave for a night cap, and meeting other travelers who were doing the same. Staff The staff are fantastic! Most of the people working at the hotel speak english to some degree. They are very friendly, funny and always going out of their way to make your stay happy and restful! The bartenders are awesome and the wait staff the best. I'm horrible with names to mention anyone personally, but there was more than one outstanding employee who provided us 5-star service. Simply the best! One of two reasons for rating this hotel 'very good'. Location The location of this hotel is PERFECT and the only other saving grace for me to have chosen a 'very good' rating for this hotel. Right at the end of 5th Avenue, which was always hustling and bustling with fun people and things to do. Short and enjoyable walk to the beach, shopping and nightlife. Loved the vibe in the front lobby bar, and could have sat on the swings for hours people watching and talking to other travelers. Nightly Shows Hilarious and fun! A great way to start the night if you're going out. Grab a bite and have a few drinks while watching their animation team do something fun. They give away prizes and have cool games. The Grounds BEAUTIFUL! I think most of their energy goes to maintaining the grounds. Kept very neat and clean. Always seeing someone sweeping, picking up garbage, etc. Lots of flora and fauna to admire. The Master One Bedroom Upgrade If you're thinking about it, forget it. Not worth the extra $. The bar at the beach club will serve you regardless of the upgrade. The website advertises, 'All Inclusive guests have full privileges of all restaurants, bars & facilities at Gran Porto Real Resort'. We had a real run-around with the Gran Porto staff to eat at one of their restaurants, and the food wasn't worth the hassle. They kind of treat you like 2nd class citizens because they know you're from the Real, using the upgrade. The only thing I was grateful for in using our upgrade was to check out the resort. We did, and wondered, 'If the same owners can keep this place looking nice, clean, etc., why don't they do it at the Real?'. Not sure what's up with that. Another thing that may be worth mentioning... They fumigate the food service area at night. I'm not sure how often, but we came back to the hotel late after celebrating NYE out and about to see someone fumigating with a backpack and hand-wand. We're talking the whole food service area/kitchen section was under a cloud of chemical 'smoke'. Kind of turned me off for being in there the rest of the week eating and drinking. Especially knowing the cleanliness standards of our room may match that of the food area. Wasn't crazy about possibly eating poison or having it all over the fixtures in there and not being cleaned off very well or at all. This may be one of the things that are common in Mexico that being a new traveler I'm naive to, even so... they should tell the guests when this is taking place and what pesticide(s) they're using. Bottomline? Great location, excellent service. Rooms need upgrading, food could be a bit nicer/fresher.

This was the worst trip ever, thanks to this resort. It is not a 3 or 4 star, its a 1 star. I am not a picky person or need pampering, just need comfortable, clean and food that was good. We arrived to find that the room we paid for not available, but another one was for more money. As I travelled with my sister, i was not worried to take the one king size bed room. That was far from what we got. It was a king sized hard dirty bed on top of blankets (to make it softer?) and then on top of two double sized wooden box springs. I have never slept on bed this bad. AWFUL!. The food was horrible. It was inedible. On day three of my trip i got food poisoning from the buffet. I spent the next day in bed ( on the horrilble hard awful bed) running to the toilet and back. I missed a very expensive day trip to the Ruins.... not fun. The food was always cold, nothing tasted like anything and i saw a chef mixing coleslaw with her hands and then shoving some in her mouth to eat! GROSS! I don't know what gave me poisoining but i had eaten nothing all day except for dinner at the buffet. HORRIBLE! Toast was cold, couldn't even melt butter on it, scrambled eggs tasted like cardbooard, nothing was fresh except for the bananas... We then booked a night at the a la carte restaurant. A little better, still yucky. Pasta with sauce that tasted like nothing... very boring. Yuck. The wine at the resort, disgusting, only one kind and tasted a lot like vinegar. The drinks.. were so so.. very skimpy onalcohol, had to ask for doubles in order to get singles.. The snack bar.. WOW...NASTY!!! cold leftovers from the nasty buffet. It was all disgusting. Not fresh, not good,. lots of it, simply disgusting. The people at the resort, very nice, good people,friendly and caring! i felt sorry they worked there. The amination team was excellent! they tried hard and were entertaining and funny. We really liked Danielle from Croatia.. we also felt sorry that the team had to eat the food there.! There is also another very bad thing... there is a time share thing in the lobby. While i was sick in bed, my sister talked to this lady ( I think Mariella?) in the lobby,she thought that since she worked for the hotel it was ok.. it was NOT OK. A timeshare thing. Go to the other resort Grand Portal and take a time share thing and then they would feed you breakfast and five you 500 pesos towards things at the resort.. After reading it, i said \" TIME SHARE\" and i didnt want to do it.. We went to canel with this lady and she came UNHINGED!angry that we dare cancel.. that her job was in danger.. blah blah.. that we COULDN\"T CANCEL! like hello!!! i can do whatever i want! Anyhow.. it was just another thing to color badly the vacation.. stay away from this scam! The resort is clean, the pool was small but nice & the workers are nice. I would not stay here again ever, nor will i ever stay in a Real resort anywhere.. they know how bad this is and yet continue to do it.

I have been to Cancun, St. Lucia, Cuba, Puerta Plata, Punta Cana, Jamaica (seven times), Costa Rica, Spain, etc. Below is my fair and honest review, including recommendations. I am from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and am a 38 year old female who traveled solo to this resort. I wanted to enjoy the simplicity of the sun and beach. However, when I arrived the weather was not so great the first couple of days, which was expected as it was hurricane season. This resort is a simple, modest three and one-half all-inclusive resort located directly on 5th Avenue. It is small and quaint. The resort is SPOTLESS clean and the food and drinks are very good. The service is impecable! I have read reviews about the food being repetative and not being a big selection and my response to that is that this resort is very small in that there are only 142 rooms here. Obvioulsy, there is not going to be as hugh of a selection as there would be on a hugh resort. All the food offered was healthy, non-greezy and tasty. If I were to make a recommendation: more food labels and perhaps try a different meat daily for breakfast, ie: ham, bacon, sausage, instead of weiners every day. I would not consider this a complaint as I was completly happy, but just a recommendation to provide more variety suitable to a typical Canadian/American breakfast. I stayed in room 418(b) which is a one bedroom located on the 4th Floor (six flights of steps). There is no elevator on the resort so staying on a level other than the first could be an issue for some. However, it was not an issue for me as I like to try to stay fit and enjoyed the hike. Johnny was the guy who cleaned my room and he did an amazing job! Every day my room was kept spotless clean with an arrangement of towel animals. One day I had five towel animals in my room. Also, at night a card at night with two hersey kisses saying, sweet dreams. The staff on the front desk were very helpful and everyone on this resort spoke English very well. I didn't experience any significant language barrier. I went to the spa on day number two and had a facial and massage for $60 which was AMAZING! The staff there are well trained and certified. The beach is a short stroll, maybe 7-10 minutes down 5th Avenue. I enjoyed the walk. The beach is beautiful! The beach club staff are also fantastic and even brought drinks to me while I was sunning in the lounge chair. I wouldn't even have to ask for another drink, they would ask if I was ready for another one. I booked the Coba tour from Maricio from Best Day and it was fantastic. We biked for two kilometers to the highest temple in Mexico, climbed the 120 steps to the top, biked back, kayaked, hiked, swam in a sonada (underground cave), ziplined, hung from vines in the jungle, had a blessing from a Mayan doctor, had lunch prepared by Mayan women and then shot tequilla to finish. It was an awesome day and quite adventurous. The entertainment staff were very friendly and nice and made efforts to make everyone on the resort feel at home. I would recommend this resort without question. To stay at the sister property is an extra $500 per person, per week. Personally, I would rather have a clean accomodation with good food and drinks and have my extra $500 to explore Playa and enjoy some nightlife, restaurants and shopping. The only negative thing I would say is that the only snack available at the beach club were nachos, salsa and fruit cocktale. As the \"day life\" on this property is pretty much non-existant, it would be nice to be able to order something simple, ie: hot dog, hamburger and fries and the beach club. I went to the beach daily and left around 10. In order for me to have lunch I would have to walk back to the resort or strip which would take at least a half-hour away from the beach and sun. Most days I pretty much skipped lunch and just filled up on frozen drinks, however, this is not ideal. I highly recommend that to offer a better quality of service and allow travelers to fully enjoy the beach that some food option should be available. I hope someday to return to Playa and maybe even stay at this property again.

We had to wait in the lobby for 30 minutes with our bags. This also happen to be the last 30 minutes of lunch. This was a very disapointing start to our vacation. We had a room on the ground floor which was very convenient, considering we were traveling with a toddler who used a stroller. Our room was considered the \"Family Suite\". It had enough space for a king size bed, sofa bed, tv, mini bar, and small bathroom. It seemed very small. We knew the hotel was not on the beach but were not expecting it to be so far. We had to walk over 10 blocks each time we wanted to go to the beach! It was a draining walk especially with a toddler. The servers were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, I felt like the resort was not well taken care of. The pool was dirty, and was not cleaned regularly. Frequently, you could see gargage and cigarrete buds next to the pool and nobody seemed concerned about cleaning it up. It seemed like the resort was filled with many local people, and a few tourists from other countries. Even the waiters were suprised to see Americans in their resort. The food was buffet style. It was not labeled and not appetizing. It seemed like the food was recycled from meal to meal. They did serve hot dogs, and hamburgers, and tacos. There was NO guacamole! They did serve nacho chips with cheese almost at every meal. The resort was also weired about giving out water bottles. We were frequently denied a water bottle and given filtered water in a glass. This was annoying since we really wanted to take a water bottle for our walk to the beach. A few times we ended up buying a water bottle from the local stores becuase they woudn't give us one. For the 5 days we spent at the resort, all the snack bar had is nachos and cheese. Overall, we were disappointed and expected more considering the positive reviews on tripadvisor.

This was worth it. We asked for a gound floor by the pool and we were directly in fornt of the pool/ resturant. Huge deck with a big table and the pool waiter keep up on us with ice cold beers and even an ice bucket to put them in. The nice thing about this place was NO TAP corona they had differnt local bottles off beers. The food was ok but you can use the grand porto's resturants which are great. Right at the end of 5th ave with out side lobby seating and a live band every night across from the outside seating. I love the night life in playa and me and my wife have been to playa 10 times and this was the best. The only thing I would complain about was the 24hour snack bar. It was just hot dogs and nachos but what soaks up the alcahol better. Try playa wings and pizza and you wont be dissapointed.

The All Inclusive was definitely worth the money - free drinks at the beach and delicious meals with wonderful variety. We were pleasantly surprised by the entertainment each night at 8:15 in the resort's restaurant. The shows were run by the Animation Team - three amazing comedians, dancers, and performers. There were prizes awarded during audience participation, there was beautiful dancing, and some skits made us laugh so hard we cried. Another plus was the staff. They were friendly, helpful, funny, and always had a smile on their face. The restaurant staff were always there to help out, and the Trip Coordinator was very helpful in organizing amazing trips to Akumal, Rio Secreto, Xel-Ha, and the Mayan ruins of Tulum.

If you want a taste of Mexico and with an AI plan this is the place! We are not picky travelers at all and for us the Real Playa Del Carmen was just right. We checked in on June 6th for a 2 week stay. After getting a room on the fourth floor in the Chichen section we decided with the humidity so high to up grade to a ground floor room and were very happy. Even though this resort is not on the beach it\u2019s location is perfect, close enough to 5th ave to enjoy it when you want and far enough that you wouldn\u2019t even know it was there. The room: For us it was perfect. Nice patio with a table, 2 chairs and a hammock. Nice little seating area slightly separate bedroom and small bathroom. We also had a fridge which was restocked daily with beer, water and pop. The maid did a fantastic job of keeping our room clean. Also the AC was wonderful but we actual found some times it worked so well we would have to turn it off and open up the windows. The bed was firm but not overly so and we never had a problem sleeping. The food: Excellent! As one of the other reviews said not quite sure what half of it was, (then complained about it?) we didn\u2019t know what some of it was either but we tried it all and enjoyed it. It was so nice to go to the buffet and eat something other than hamburgers/hot dogs like they do at the bigger more commercial resorts. We had not one complaint about the buffet food and enjoyed every meal there. The only meal that we found slightly lacking was the A la Carte. Instead of complaining and whining we just went over to the buffet and grabbed something there. The pool: The pool was great. Nice and small with enough loungers that no one ever went without. We also enjoyed the fact that they did have music playing but instead of being loud and obnoxious it was just wonderful background noise. By afternoon the water was more like luke warm bath water which we enjoyed as it soon became our favourite gathering place to have cocktail with a wonderful group of people we met at the resort. We also had the luxury of having pool service every afternoon drink wise and were delighted as it was not something we were expecting. The beach club: We knew well in advance what the beach area would be like in front of the beach club. (that is why we are so surprised by the snarky reviews from some people) DO your research! We went down quite a few times to the beach club and sat on the swings and had a drink wandered around came back had a drink. On a few occasions we filled up our bubba kegs and walked across the pier a few minutes put down our towels and spent a whole afternoon there walking back to the beach club to get our drinks enjoying a perfect beach and water. The pool bar: One word amazing!! During the day out by the pool or sitting at one of the tables on the patio playing cards they were always making you drinks and getting to know you so that when they saw you later they would remember you and ask about this or that as we would them. We also learned quite a few phrases at the pool bar that we are still practicing for our next trip. I think this is one area where management might want to lighten up on as we enjoyed the interaction with the staff here immensely and found that just because they would be chatting with the vacationers they were still working hard and doing a perfect job. When management started to hover we noticed the difference in the level of interaction with the staff immediately as the staff seemed to be tip toeing around trying not to draw management\u2019s attention. (this was not only evident at the pool bar but every where through out the resort towards the end of our stay) The lobby bar: Great to grab a drink on the way back from walking 5th ave in the afternoon heat. They were more than accommodating in making you anything you wanted or making special drinks you may never have tried before. The beer was cold and the tequila flowing what more could you ask for!! The staff: This is where we think the hotel shines the most. Never have we encountered such warm, friendly and accommodating staff and we travel to Mexico 1 or 2 times a year. I even made a point of writing down every persons name so I could mention them and say THANK YOU for an unforgettable experience. From the Bartenders, Wait Staff, Animation Team and every single person who works there job well done!! Marceloni (Okie Dokie) Sonya (cream for my Husband\u2019s coffee every morning) Omar and Mateo (never had to wait for a cocktail and wonderful pool side service) Luis and Gustavo our wonderful lobby bartenders Sonya the Omelet Chef who made the best every morning Fernando the bell boy what a wonderful and attentive employee Glendi (whose new cocktails were wonderful and a treat (thank you for the Spanish lessons) Rodrigo and Bersain great service with a smile every day The animation staff Vyaney, Danijel and (brand new) Paco thank you for entertaining us each evening we enjoyed the shows and for also playing Uno with us on a cloudy and very overcast day.

My wife and I stayed here for two weeks last January. We had upgraded to a one bedroom. The room itself was more like a regular hotel room with a long hallway, more or less. But I found it acceptable. We were located away from the pool overlooking the gardens where the local birds entertained us in the large tree. The only issue we had was with the toilet. The water pressure was almost nonexistant, so you had to flush a number of times. We did have a mini fridge, and since we didn't go all inclusive, it was nice to have. We prefer to eat at the great restaurants just steps outside the hotel. But we were asked if we wanted to add the all inclusive when we were checking in. We declined, but a few days in, we asked if we could do this day by day, and we could. This was brilliant, because we were able to take advantage of the AI when we were feeling lazy and wanted to just hang around the hotel, or maybe go to the beach club, which was a great option. So we ended up with the best of both worlds. The food at the AI was fine. There was decent variety and quality was good. I almost hate to say, but the entertainment was really, really lame. After two weeks of staying here and hearing the same thing almost everynight.....uhh. Oh well. I know they tried their best. There are two outstanding reasons for booking this hotel. #1 by far are the staff that work here. I thought the people on the Pacific side were great, but these people here are just amazing. Extremely warm and welcoming. Always a smile, from the maids, bellboy, waiters, front desk. Just can't say enough about them. The #2 reason to book here is the location. Quiet side of 5th Ave. but steps away from all the restaurants and shops. In my experience, if you like AI's on the beach with fancy water fountains and modern mega resorts that are so isolated from the \"Real\" Mexico, you won't like it here.

At the beach Bersain made sure that we had shade for the kids, chairs to sit on and plenty of fluid for the kids and us. No he did not ignore the rest of the guests. Also made sure that we were able to get a ride back to the hotel if the kids were tired or asleep (the hotel is not right on the beach but we had no problem with that because the walk does you good down there and just nice to see and say hello to the locals that you get to know) The girls who did the activities on the beach were just as great. They would do their job and then when they had a couple of minutes they would come and play with the grandkids. Gave us all a little break.

We ended up buying liquor at Walmart and making our own drinks so we didn't have to go back and forth to the bar so often. The waitstaff and bartenders were great. On our second day, after we met with our Funjet representative to arrange our return trip to the airport, we were asked to sit down with a Real Resorts representative--normally we would have said no, but we didn't really feel like we had a choice. He told us all about how they don't offer timeshares anymore because they weren't good for the customers, but they have new, better offers that we could learn more about if we went to a different hotel for a 2-hour breakfast or lunch and listened to a talk of some sort. When we politely tried to refuse, we got a little bit of a guilt trip--he said he has a family to provide for, how could we say no to the free gifts he was offering, etc. That was a complete turnoff--we understand that they have to try to sell their product, but this person took it too far. Other than that, however, we had a very pleasant stay. Just beware that if you stay there, you'll probably get sucked into the same situation.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fleetwood, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAwesome staff, hotel, and location\u201d", "Author": "MicheleGR41", "ReviewID": "UR105588055", "Content": "First of all, all of the other reviews are way off.

Being in Playa a few times in the past (taking the ferry over from Cozumel) we pretty much knew where the hotel was. Right at the north end of 5th avenue (main street from where everything is). My husband and I liked it there. It was more of an \"Old Mexico\" quiet laid back feel away from all the hussle and bustle. Which is what we are looking for. If we wanted to check out the action and night life it was right out the front door. The rooms were adequate. The bathroom was tight, but everything worked. Even had hot water in the shower (which my husband always complains about when traveling in Mexico). The rooms were clean and the bed was fine. Some people complained about the beds being stiff, but we actually slept good all week. The air conditioners are loud and could be updated. The view wasn't the best (4TH FLOOR overlooking the 24 hour service area) Would have liked something by the POOL or even on the 1ST 2ND or 3RD FLOOR - Too many stairs. But for the most part it was OK. Keep in mind this is a 2* hotel and everything will be fine. The food was good. We had the buffet every day - breakfast was the best meal of the day (everything you can think of on it). There was a main course every night for dinner - turkey, beef roast, fish, fajitas, pork, etc. Some of the food wasn't to our taste, but we never went away hungry. After dinner there is a show evey night and that was fun to watch. As for the 24 hour service area that could use a little attention. The pop was warm on some occasions or out of serve for awhile. The selection of food was minimal and maybe they should consider a taco bar with beef, chicken, cheese, salsa, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes and onions with chips and flour tortillas. As for the drinks, there was always and abundance of those. Anytime we wanted, and they were delicious. Marcielano made me specialty drinks all the time - ticket to fly - dirty monkey - tornado - mango tango - iceberg - rainbow - etc. They were the best. I wish I had one right now. I think the best part of our trip would be the nice friendly staff. We enjoyed all of you. Thank you to Sonja - our favorite waitress (and baby Kevin) Bersain and Rodricko - who served us drinks everyday at the hotel and beach club Marcielano - My favorite all time bartender (Te Quiero) Lizzy - our housekeeper Theodoro - He waited on us a couple times too I miss you all and look forward to staying there and seing you again.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING\u201d", "Author": "mexicolover058", "ReviewID": "UR103527265", "Content": "i stayed here with friends and it was absolutely amazing ! we had a great experience and want to go back as soon as we can. the food, location and rooms were all excellent but the best part of the trip was the animation staff ! danijel, vyaney, daniela and gabriel were great and so much fun ! they performed in shows everynight and they were great to watch. international and hollywood was our favourite. i recomend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great time.

Did our research, got a great deal, knew what to expect and had a very relaxing vacation. The Real in only a short walk away from the beach and about 10 minute walk to their beach club. It is however right on 5th Ave and all the activity. The resort is older and has seen better days, but it is a great vaue if you are not expecting a 4 or 5 star resort. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which was nice. Can't tell you about the basic rooms, but don't expect frills. Basic, older but clean and livable. Food is edible but the same basic things ever day. What we learned was they only put out basics in the buffet line. No tortillas, salsa etc. So we would ask for the things we were missing and the waiters would go out of their way to get them for us. One day we felt like ice cream and all we had to do was ask. Very friendly staff for the most part. Specifically Rodrigo and Andeas waiters and Reyes as the lobby bar tender. Also need to mention the beach bar tender and a young man who served us drinks every day on the beach. Sorry, can't remember their names. If you make reservations at Maria's, their sit down and order restaurant, try the flank steak. Excellente'. Maria's is actually right next door to the buffet and only seperated by a railing. Not many Americans, lots of Italians, Swedish, Fins, Canadians and yes, French Canadians. Nice people for the most part, but talk about a melting pot. Do not know how the staff keeps up with all the different languages. The Swedes need to relax a bit more, had several up tight Swedes pushing for first service. Heah, we were on vacation and just let them go. If you stay here definately try out the Cuban bar accross the street. Live music each night. It seemed like one of the hot spots on 5th Ave. The beach club is nice, lots of chairs and umbrellas. They serve chips and fruit most days. Drinks are great and cervesa is cold. I believe most of the beer they serve is on tap Dos XX's. The beach at the club isn't the greatest, lots of rocks, but their is a small lagoon about waiset deep to cool of in and or snorkle for limited fish species. The best beach is just a few steps away if you want to swim and play in the ocean. All in all this was a very inexpensive vacation and nice. We knew what to expect, and got everything we asked for. We are not super picky and realize this is Mexico. Take it all in stride, slow down and enjoy another culture. We have been all over Mexico and not sure if we will ever stay here again. It isn't because of the amenities, the hotel.

Across the board, the level of service is excellent. We enjoyed most of the restaurants and loved going to Pelicano's for breakfast and lunch, because of the outdoor beach location. The daily fresh salsa/guacamole and chips was a treat. The weather averaged near 85 degrees everyday. On the windy days, we enjoyed swimming in the moderate sized waves, even using boogie boards provided on the beach. On the calmer days, we used our own mask/snorkel gear and saw a surprising variety of fish and sea life in the rocky reef area near the pier. One day, we were surrounding by a massive school of at least 10,000 fish (3-5 inches long) for about a half-hour.....truly incredible. We grabbed a lounge by the pool everyday (instead of the beach), because it was both relaxing and entertaining at the same time.....great place to people watch. The lobby bar was kind of a gathering place both before and after dinner. The bartenders in the lobby bar were always busy and very friendly.

If you prefer a nice quiet resort with a friendly staff and all of the necessities, then this is the place for you. First off, the people that work here are great! The bartenders are always on the lookout for you, and the front desk staff, security and bellhops were courteous and helpful. The housekeeping and grounds staff keep the place looking and feeling clean. The chefs and dining staff were always smiling and accommodating. I will break it down as follows: Hotel Location: Right at the end of 5th Avenue, this place is in great location to be close enough to the shops and restaurants, while far enough to be quiet and calm when the partying starts downtown. We never felt unsafe or threatened walking around at all hours of the day. Beach Club: A hidden gem, basically right in front of the Grand Porto Real is the beach club, which shares a bar with the Grand. The only annoyance was the bartender for the Grand will not wait on you, and it took us a little bit to figure this out, but after that when you know who to go to, the service was great and the drinks too. I would only complain that the snacks at the beach are pretty much chips and pico de gallo and are not very easy to get at. Improve that and this beach is great for sun and people watching. Hotel Rooms: The hotel is old, and while I did not go to Mexico to hang out in the rooms, when we first arrived we were a little nervous we had picked a Motel 6. The bathrooms could use a little updating, and the air conditioners are weak. I think the problem may be that the pigeons sit and sleep on or in front of the air conditioners at night and this causes some noise and lack of performance, maybe some chicken wire would help! :) The beds are pretty bare bones, and it is time to install flat panel TV's, I forgot how nasty old televisions are. The room was usable, but probably close to a 2 start not 4 as advertised. I will say the mini-bar was stocked daily and that was nice. The housekeeping made nice \"towel animals\" and the rooms were clean. Food: I will try to be brief. The breakfast is the best meal. Eggs, pancakes, toast, pastries, fruits, etc...the best meal of the day. For lunch you could always find something to nibble on. And lets just say for dinner, it is nice to be close to all of the restaurants so you can get some variety mixed in. Maria's restaurant had menus and the food was a bit more upscale, but basically was the same food as the buffet, just with nice table service....check it out. To finish up, the pool was a nice way to cool off at the end of the day. There is a 24 hour club. The food selections are pretty weak there, usually what was not eaten at breakfast or lunch ended up there. My suggestion would be make it a nacho bar and have self service hot dogs or sandwiches. The self service bar was nice in the 24 hour club. All in all this is a nice budget resort and for the price we booked we can't complain, but if you think you are going to a 4 start resort or better, think again! This is the right hotel for the right person, now get out and enjoy the city and the beach and ocean.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "skinnyfroglegs", "ReviewID": "UR98945231", "Content": "My husband and I found this to be a really good time, what made it so great was the staff.

Although still a great location... right on fifth avenue (pedestrial mall with tons of boutiques and services). We were most disappointed with our first room though: hard mattress (like no head-banging on that baby!) and extremely (not joking!) loud air conditioner... we could barely hear each other yell! Not pleasant at all (I do want to hear what my lover is telling me when screaming, eh?! ;-). Seriously, we upgraded to the \"superior suite\" (for $12/night which they ended up paying for the first week) where the bed was fine but the airconditioner still loud (but we didn't have to yell anymore ;-). Ask for the \"model suite\" if you go there: it has the ultra quiet a-c.; I would have paid the big bucks to get that one (not really!), had our four sweetie girl friends (Betty, Laura, Mindy, Rose -hey, hi ladies!! we miss you still!!) from the US not occupied it. Oh, and no toilet pepper in the toilet please!! That would have been nice to know! I am so scarred that I still put the soiled toilet paper in the waste basket... and I've been home for a week already! Go figure! ...joking!! Staff was super friendly; we especially connected well with several servers and the most of all the animation team - kudos to Danijel, Vianney and Daniella! What a team! Great people! We even joined the animation team for a couple of shows (upon invitation, of course!). Too bad we can't post videos here to give you a sample of some of the skits. See the pics below though. Oh, and I found the food particularly good, tasteful and varied. We did not even bother making reservations to the onsite restaurant. I would say this is among the top two hotels re: food between the 10 other hotels where I've stayed (i.e. Cuba, D.R. and Mexico - hotels ranging from 3 to 4.5 stars). Lots to do in or around PDC: pyramids in Tullum, Xechen itza and Coba - we visited the Coba ones (tallest one in the area) and it was quite nice - make sure you reserve bikes! We ended up renting a car at Thrifty's via internet reservation ($30 US) and had to pay for entrance (about $4 US each) and gas for a total of $65 for two people as oppose to the $120 US each that the tour guides at the hotel were offering for Coba. We also visited a couple of \"cenotes\", i.e. caves filled with water; the ones we snorkeled in were open-sky types, so no worries for clostrophobia or sharks for this matter ;-0). Some of them have tiny fish that eats away your dead skin (but not sharks, you're too funny, you!)... should be fun! Again, those cost under $5 US each for admission; you could rent out snorkeling gear for under $5 if you did not have your own snorkeling gear. Best and cheapest way to travel there is the \"collectivo\" i.e. public transit: i.e. medium size air-conditioned vans with leather seats! wish we had those in Ottawa!! so you could travel outside of town for under $3, for instance to go to other cities (e.g.: Tullum, I believe), or Akumal (where you can swim with sea turtles and sting rays - which we did, and again this was cheap: free admission! All in all, this was a very nice, relaxing, fun-filled two weeks for us. Oh, and we played lots of vball (sometimes up to six hours per day... we kinda like vball... sorry ;-)). Oh, and with the hotel, we had access to the snack bar at the Real Porto Playa del Carmen... servers would come to our chairs and serve us drinks and snacks. they also had snacks, like tuna mixes with nachos, fresh fruit, and lots of variety in terms of drinks too! My favourite was \"Miami Vice\" (affectionately pronounced \"Miami Byce\" ;-) sin alcool, por favor! as I am not a big alcohol drinker. The beach was quite nice but not so much in front of the Porto Hotel which is located on the right of the large pier... but on the left of it, super beautiful beach, on the shore and in the water. (Off) white powdery sand... very nice to the touch ;-)). I think that covers most of it.

One look at the buffet confirmed that as did conversations with other guests, many of whom upgraded to the Royal or Porto to get away, an expensive option. The location of this hotel is okay, at one end of 5th avenue, a five minute walk to the beach or 10 minutes to the beach club. Plenty of chairs at the beach club but it is located at the worst part of the whole shoreline. Rocky, shored up with sand bags to combat erosion, right near all the fishing vessels. The front desk staff are very friendly but it's not enough to make up for this tired old hotel. We had a master suite which means a sitting area with balcony, dressing area with closet and daybed and a king size bed and TV in the bedroom. Very noisy air conditioner that barely put out, a teeny fridge that did not keep anything cold, not even cool. No other appliances at all, not even a clock. All the furniture was old with stained cushions, the sheets and towels were often stained as well. I was afraid to touch the bedspread. The maids changed the towels, rinsed out the shower and swiped at the bathroom counter, sometimes swept around a bit.I witnessed this first hand as they would ring the buzzer and insist on coming in if we weren't out of the room by 9am. I felt surrounded by grime, found a huge mat of someone elses hair on the floor on day 10, must have been there the whole time... We felt harrassed by the Best Day tour people in the lobby as well as the Real people trying to get us to upgrade to the 5 star Porto or Royal. The Tulum tour we booked with Best Day was the worst tour I've ever experienced, They kept us at a jewellry store for over an hour, then we had to wait for an english speaking tour guide who immediately disappeared, we ended up touring the place ourselves, learned nothing about Tulum. We had to pay extra to use a credit card to pay for the tour, never experienced that anywhere else we used a card. Internet only available in the lobby, usually one bar, very slow. It's a very small place, one buffet restaurant, one other place only open evenings. The pool was very small as well, must be some camera they used to phtograph it! Hardly any lounge chairs on the property, tough to find a seat. I really wish I had listened to the reviews instead of my travel agent. We enjoyed playa del carmen and would go back but never to this hotel.

It is the second time that we have stayed there. Last year we stayed there for the first time and we came away impressed with the intimate small setting of the resort right in the heart of Playa Del Carmen on the north end of 5th Ave. We had wanted a smaller place within easy walking distance to so many things right in the town. We got more than that. Being a smaller resort we were able to meet up and become acquainted with other guests from all over the world that we still keep in touch with to this day. As for the staff, they bent over backwards to cater to the guests. They will learn your name and greet you by name every day. If you have a favourite cocktail, they will remember that too. This year\u2019s visit actually exceeded last year\u2019s visit. It is often said that you can never go back, it will never be as good as the first time. Not so in this case. The staff remembered us. It was like a reunion. We met new and interesting people from all across Canada, Denmark, Russia, England, Argentina. We sat down and enjoyed the company of a foursome from Winnepeg approaching their seventies. The men were musicians in their younger day. Brian was a drummer who played with many different people. One of the people he played with left stating it was time for him to leave the area and go seek fame and fortune in California (more on him later). If you are looking for big resort with several buffets and al a carte restaurants, the Real Playa Playa Del Carmen may not be for you. There is only really one buffet and one a la carte restaurant but the food is as good as any 5-star resort that I have been to. There is an upgrade to include other restaurants that are not at the facility if you want. If you want a fancy modern room then this place may not be for you. The resort is older and the rooms are older but they are clean and made up every day. The Real Playa Del Carmen is appropriately designated a 3.5 star resort with 142 rooms. If you want your resort to be right on the beach and somewhat secluded , then you are out of luck here. However, they do share the beach club with their sister resort the Porto Real. It is 10 minute walk or there are shuttles back and forth all day. The Real Playa Del Carmen is definitely for you if you like: - An intimate type setting where you get the opportunity to interact with other guests from all over the world. In a small resort this is inevitable. In the bigger resorts you can spend a week there and not run into the same person twice. - A staff that will go out of their way to help you and remember you. Reyes and Jesus tend the lobby bar. If you are there, get them to make you a spiderman shot. Gustavo is there to tend to your needs in the front lobby and can have a good conversation with you regarding American football. Back in the restaurant there is Teodoro who can show you magic tricks, the brothers Bersain and Rodrigo who will make sure your needs are met in the buffet. The afternoon shift has Glendi at the bar along with Omar waiting tables in the buffet all under the supervision of Raul who incidentally always has a quick meeting with the staff before commencement of the dinner hour. I am not sure about the travel and tourism industry but in my business it is considered an industry best standard. Janeth and Andres will take care of you at Maria\u2019s restaurant where I found the food to be as good as any place I have been to in the Mayan Riviera. Mateo makes sure the resort is clean and Francisco is in charge of the groundkeepers and take takes care of the property with a pride as though it was his own. All these people make the Real Playa Del Carmen an all inclusive resort that I will always remember favourably and hope to return to. - The entertainment group was a lot of fun this year. Daniel, Daniella and Viene (I hope that is how you spell it) were a very interactive group that I looked forward to every night. If you get a chance, check out their international showcase. It was a pretty big production for the three of them to put on. - Walking tours, there were so many walking routes you can take on your own and see different things. There was no need for any taxis that you always seem to rely on when in resorts outside the city. The resort is located on one end of fifth avenue directly in the heart of the shopping district. A ten minute walk to 30th avenue will put you in the heart authentic Mexican quisine that is a fraction of the cost of the restaurants on fifth avenue. Walking north you can do a 20 minute round trip walk and get a glimpse of real Mexican living and culture. It is only a 10 to 15 minute walk to the beach and beach club where you would get to see a lot more than what you would in a secluded resort outside the city. At no time day or night did either my wife or I feel threatened by anything or anyone. Everyone was pleasant on the streets and more often than not, were willing to offer up a smile and a greeting as you walked by. Even in the wee hours of the morning. At the end of the night you could see the locals close up shop and sometimes get together right there to unwind with each other sharing a drink or a story. I felt as though I could have joined them if I wanted to (perhaps if my Spanish was better) and they would welcome me in. - A 24 hour self- service snack food and drink area with complimentary red or white wine and a self- service beer tap. If you so desired, you go down and get whatever you wanted, eat or drink there or take it to your room. An amenity I have not seen in any of the other resorts that I have been to. My wife and I personally look forward to going back there one day. If all goes well, January 2012. Oh, I almost forgot. The name of the musician that left to make it big in California was Neil Young. I don\u2019t think Brian had any regrets in not going with him. He looked very satisfied with the decisions he had made in his life and I hope to be the same way too.

Each night had a theme and if there was not something you liked on the buffet, then you couldn't have liked food. Choices every night between beef, pork, chicken and fish. Many salads, vegetables (very fresh), fruit (also fresh), home made bread, buns, and awesome desserts. Each dish had a sign telling you in Spanish and English what the dish was so you didn't end up with a surprise. Also don't forget the alcoholic and not alcoholic drinks. If you are adventureous, just ask your waiter or waitress to bring you a surprise drink and wow - great flavours. The top shelf alcohol was extra though. Maria's, the a la carte restaurant, was only open on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday as this is the off season, but didn't have to book a reservation. In the busy season it is open everynight and you have to book then. The lobster is extra and they have a very limited menu, but the food is excellent and of course the service again is superb. The portions are not big though. The staff were always sweeping, cleaning, straightening up and always had time to chat. Our first room was a little small, but we upgraded to a larger room for $20 a night more with a small fridge that everyday they would replace water, beer and soft drinks. Our rooms were serviced and cleaned everyday. I just loved the elephants, the doves, the little girl and the dinosaur made out of towels that were left on our bed and the features made out of the flowers and greenery grown on their beautiful grounds. Yes, the rooms are older, but they have the Mexican flare and decor. Each room has a TV with satellite and they have Wi-Fi in the complex. Some of their air conditioners are noisey, but mention it to them. For the great value of the complex, you end up in your room very little anway. The Real does not have over 3000 people staying there, it is small, very quiet and you walk 5 minutes to anywhere you need, to the restaurant, the lobby, the snack bar, the games area. The beach is about 15 minute walk with many ways to get there and they have a great beach bar with swings to sit around the bar with snacks with great staff and service. The beach right out infront of the beach bar has some rocks, but again a small walk to either side, you find a great place to go swimming. They offer you kayaks and floating boards on the beach. If you find the sun too hot, you ask for an umbrella and your wish is their command. Vendors do not bother you on the beach, maybe the odd young girls selling their braided belts or bracelets, but you just say \"No Thank you\" and they continue on their way. The grounds are well kept and the paths are marked very well finding your way around. The pool is kept clean, there are hammocks, a child's play structure to also enjoy. The night entertainment was not that good this last time we stayed, but mind you after walking, site seeing, shopping and being on the beach all day, we only stayed maybe 1/2 hour to watch as you couldn't wait to wake up again and pinch yourself and start another great day. You are situated at the start of the famous 5th Ave Shopping Promenade. The Real is a great location because you are very close to the public buses, Cozumel Ferry, restaurants, bars, shops. You are far away enough from the hussle and bussle of 5th Ave and close enough if you need something. Very safe area, the police constantly patrol, day and night and there are always security guards on the beach and around the entrances to the hotel. If you are looking for a quaint, very friendly, clean and fun place to stay with great food, choose Real Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed Our Stay !\u201d", "Author": "strassomatic2", "ReviewID": "UR87579560", "Content": "We have traveled many times to Mexico .....it ranged from backpacking to 5 star all inclusive.

We wanted to go home and do our own reviewing but what we were shown on Tripadvisor in the store looked above average to great reviews and we trusted what we were shown...... We took my stepson and his girlfriend away for a luxury all incl holiday and it was v important to us that all was good if not great about the hotel and location & Co-Op Travel knew this. A few weeks before travel, we checked Tripadvisor again ourselves and were 100% shocked to read some of the reviews. Spoke to Co-Op Travel store manager and she said they had not had a complaint from previous travellers apart from one about a tree blocking the sea view (more on this later..). She suggested we stick with our booking, all would be fine and if it wasn't we could contact local rep to discuss. We arrived at the hotel, we were shown room after room after room - all were dark, dingy, disgusting (broken fitments, shabby decor, filthy old bathrooms, dead cockroaches, dead flies and other critters ON THE PILLOW in one room...and so on). Even the upgrade rooms were disgusting. The staff were very kind and tried their best to help (subject always to some kind of upgrade fee of course) but they only had terrible rooms to work with......... Sorry to say but, even though I am a 40 year old level-headed (non snobby) woman, I stood at reception and cried - it was just so so horrible - and we had spent a lot of money on this trip which was supposed to be a trip of a lifetime for my stepson & co. We saw other people who had checked in same time as us - checking straight out - also horrified like we were. We called the Best Day local rep who was there in 10 minutes. He was great and sorted us out a transfer to another hotel (Sandos Caracol) which was just fantastic and exactly what we were hoping for. He was not suprised at how upset we all were about the poor quality and state of the hotel and indicated that he frequently had to move people (particulalry European travellers whose perception of 3.5 star (Cosmos brochure at time of booking) or \"The best 4 star hotel in Playa Del Carmen\" (hotel website) was way out of kilter with the reality of the hotel. Unfortunately we had no option but to stay one night while the rep sorted out our move, so we tried to be positive and make use of some of the facilities; the snack bar food was disgusting and was clearly open to the elements (including flies/critters) so that was a no-go; the restaurant food was dubious but we tried our best, however two of us started with poorly tummies almost immediately (mine lasted almost 4 weeks after returning and I am convinced it was because of having to stay that one night). Did not sleep a wink & stayed fully clothed all night without using bed covers (it really was that bad!)....We moved the following afternoon and boy were we glad we did. The Sandos Caracol is only half a star rating more than the Real Playa but there was a MASSIVE difference in quality in all parts of the hotel, room, facilities, bars, restaurants, choice, attractions etc. All I can say to poeple is to check that the reviews they are reading are put against the correct hotel - the 'Real' group have several hotels and we are totally convinced that some poeple must have put their review (for the Royal or the Porto) onto this hotel because this hotel is ramshackled and dirty, its not close to the beach and does NOT have a sea view (what was the Co-Op Travel manager talking about?!??!) and it does not have the range of restaurants as advertised (this refers to restaurants in sister hotels which you can only get for expensive upgrade). So, sorry, Real Playa Del Carmen, we won't be coming to stay with you again. We'll also not be booking a Cosmos holiday again because we don't trust their description / star ratings (3.5*) - this hotel is (European standards) at best a 1.5* hostel type accomodation. We'll never use our local Co-Op Travel again either because we feel we were totally stitched up by them in their pre-sales information and they were not at all interested in saving us the trauma by sorting out a change in hotel BEFORE we travelled.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cdifferent\u201d", "Author": "differrent", "ReviewID": "UR81626128", "Content": "I was surprised with service and location, also my family, only complain about hard beds, beside this situation, had a wonderful time", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cLooking Forward To Our Stay\u201d", "Author": "winniems", "ReviewID": "UR80464668", "Content": "I can't belive that no has posted any reviews since July.

There was an open window in the bathroom by the shower and the sink barely flowed with cold water. The refrigerator in the room could not keep items cold enough it was as if it wasn't even plugged in. There resort was not by the beach and there was only a small swimming pool.

We argued with them and provided them with a copy of our itinerary and finally got our upgraded bracelets. We went out that night and came back later and our cards didn't work for our room.

It was a little less pleasing in aesthetics than we had hoped but our rate was good--$117.00 per night ALL INCLUSIVE for two people. The purpose of our trip was to attend a wedding late Friday afternoon. Originally we were suppose to stay at the sister hotel Gran Porto Real which was double the rate (also all inclusive) but far more luxurious. But the Gran Porto was entirely booked two months in advance. First, upon checking-in, we were welcomed by mosqitoes in the room. I soon discovered that they leave the windows in bathroom open which has no screen. As I literally attract mosquitoes like bees to honey, I called front desk. But the closet with the repellant was locked for evening and no one had the key. The next day the housekeeper did spray the room. But the damage was done, I was attacked and was sporting red bites which didn't quite compliment my dress for the wedding next evening. The A/C was also noisy but since we were tired most night I only woke half a dozen times. One nice surprise is when the housekeeper arranged our fresh towels in beautiful shapes of flowers or a swan and adorned them with red hibiscus flower. I much prefer this to a chocolate mint on my pillow. Nice touch and I tipped the housekeeper at end of stay. The food is average. This is not upscale dining by any means or a tremendous buffet but the variety was plenty and fulfilled my hunger pangs. I'm a hungry eater and the all-inclusive was satisfactory. The waiters are absolutely delightful and I personally tipped them separately at end of my stay. Unfortunately the reception people were not as helpful as waiters or housekeeping. Several times I asked for the closest church and the times of masses. I got a different answer and when we arrived at the church it was the wrong time. Mass was an hour later. When I asked reception to please call and double check, they made zero effort. One person checked their binder of cheat sheets. Instead of updating it, he closed the book and said \"I'm sure it's 7pm\". Very disappointing. One nice perk is that the hotel has a \"beach club\" several blocks away where you can order unlimited drinks and cocktails. Also they have bicycles you can take out--no charge.

Being late, we retired for some much needed rest from the day\u2019s travel. The next day, we explored the grounds. Knowing full well this was not a 5 Star, our expectations were not \u201cup there\u201d but at the same time we\u2019re hoping to discover what I previously mentioned, and we were not disappointed. This is not a new resort and it is showing its age, however we were pleased to see it had what we at least expected and with a few pleasant surprises as the week went by. This is not a huge resort so the staff becomes more familiar with their guests and we liked that compared to a much larger 5 Star resorts where you get lost amongst the hundreds of other guests. There is the main buffet \u201cThe Albatross\u201d and one restaurant adjacent to it for A La Carte dining. Our \u201cupgrade\u201d provided us with access to the sister and newer 5 star Grand Porto Real\u2019s amenities ( this I highlz recommend). Just a pleasant 15 minute walk along 5th Avenue and a block down Constituentes Ave. and you are there overlooking the beautiful sand and water and a view of Cozumel Island. Overall, a good place to stay, clean, friendly and afordable.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cCentral and good value\u201d", "Author": "KnowAboutTravel", "ReviewID": "UR58251419", "Content": "Mixed reviews here at Trip Advisor!

The hotel is located at the quiet end of the strip, which for us was a god send as we tired quickly of the endless shops, barkers and pushers of trinkets. The best part was the staff. We've always preferred the small hotels over the big resorts for that very reason. You get to know the servers and everyone has a smile and an \"Hola\" on passing.

My friend and I checked in rather late took a quick look around and weren't overly impressed. The room wasn't overly clean. On the first night we had to call someone to fix the hot water because we had none, a later had to get the toilet fixed as well. As we were taking a look around we drank the two bottles of water that were in the bar fridge in the room, we headed to the front desk to ask for more and were told that you only get two in your fridge per day and to drink out of the cooler on the unatteded bar!!!! That doesn't sound very all-inclusive to me!! A little day light didn't help the situation!! It's an old hotel with staff that really aren't to interested in helping you. When we decided that this just wasn't where we wanted to spend our vacation we turned to the lobby staff to ask for some assistance in upgrading to The Royal, a sister hotel. They first ignored us after asking what they could help and helped 2 other people before turning their attention back to us. They called down to The Royal and checked to see if there was anything available, they said no, despite the fact that we had already walked down and asked them ourselves and were told yes in 3 days some rooms were available. Back to The Royal we went where they changed our booking for us. So we spent 3 LONG days atthe Real...The food wasn't great and it seemed that what was leftover from the lunch/ dinner buffet then got put on the snack bar buffet. Which is just a little counter set up with some ice and whatever random leftovers they had. Let me say this when you are hungry after checking in late and all there is to eat is open faced tuna salad sandwhich, suddenly you just aren't very hungry anymore!! Service at the buffet was good but the drinks aren't made very well and there is no selction as to having some international liqour available. As for the Private Beach Club...there is no such thing. There is a bar and servers but generally the servers were hanging out talking amonst themselves in the shade. There is no snack bar at the beach and so if you want somethng to eat you need to buy from somewhere else or walk back to the resort as it is not on the beach. The beach location is good but small, with only a few chairs. The water was great with plenty of space to swim and thes sand is soft. Entertainment staff is minimal and there were no beach activites in the 3 days we were there. The theme nights consisted of kareoke 2 out of 3 nights, however the guys that were doing it were funny and genuinley nice.

We liked the description and pictures of this resort. When we read the trip advisor we realized that people have had different experiences in this hotel, but the reviews for the last 2 years where ok. We chose this resort because it is a true Mexican place. We booked a 2 week all inclusive and upgraded our room to a master suite, which was a good idea. When we arrived the staff was very friendly. Our suite was dated like the rest of the resort but very inviting. and clean. The only problem we had during our stay was an empty fridge which the reception corrected as soon as we asked them to. We loved the location of the resort. It is approximately 5-7 min from the beach. My wife and I both enjoy walking, which we did a lot in Playa. The hotel has no elevators, so you may consider getting a room or suite on the lower level. We absolutely enjoyed both restaurants. The Albatros, which is the all mexican buffet restaurant is open 7 days a week from 7am to 11am, 1pm to 4pm and 7pm to 11pm. Maria's is the ala cart (mexican food) and is open Sunday to Friday 7pm to 11pm. Reservations are needed. They say they have a dress code at Maria's, but all it is is a button shirt for the men. The food in both restaurants is excellent. All of the staff at the resort where extremely friendly and it was them that made our stay in Mexico a great experience and gave us lifetime memories. To name a few there is Fabian the bell boy, |srael our bartender in the lobby bar, Isabel our maid and pretty much everybody at the Albatros/pool bar, Ricardo at the reception. Our advise is to treat these people the way you want them to treat you. That's what we did and it worked for us. We really liked all the staff and it was easy for us to fall in love with our little resort. We had the opportunity to visit the Gran Royal as well as the Mayan Palace. There is no way that we would have wanted to live in those big americanized resorts. Our REAL was the perfect home for our stay. The only dislike for us was the pool. It was small and not inviting at all. But we are beach people, we did not want to spend time at the pool anyways. Unfortunately for the guests in January of 2010 the Mexican federal government closed the public beach for renovating and upgrading.

The Real Playa Del Carmen is right at the top of 5th avenue, right in the heart of the shops, bars and restaurants (but at the quiet end!). Ok so first impressions I wasn't sure because the man on reception wasn't over friendly, the porter takes you to your room and waits at the door for a tip, then within minutes you get a phonecall from someone in reception who wants to welcome you and sort out any issues. Actually she doesn't care about your queries and just tries to promote the sister hotel to you and ask you to go for breakfast there so that you might consider that hotel next time. So then after unpacking, I go down to a bar to get a drink and can't see any other guests let alone a barman! Right so its quiet. But wow... After the first night you realise just how lucky you are to be staying in this quiet hotel with at least one member of staff to every guest whilst others are staying at the busy sister hotel. The staff are willing to bend over backwards to help you. We had the whole pool to ourselves every single day with a waiter constantly topping up our drinks whilst we swam. There are hammocks and sunloungers, cats and lizards, even a raccoon! And hundreds of gorgeous trees. The food was brilliant. Breakfast buffett with things like pancakes, fruit, pastries, toast, sausages and a chef in the middle waiting to cook you eggs just how you like them! Lunch was different every day, always a good choice of meat, fish and vegetables often with rice or pasta or salad. And dinner was similar then every other night we had Maria's which is the A La Carte Menu. Great choice of lobster, fish, chicken, veal, tacos (wow the tacos are great!). The main bar is open til 11 then you can drink in the lobby til 1am and then after that the 24hr snack bar has beer, juice and soft drinks on tap aswell as a bottle of red wine and tea/coffee. There is food (a small selection of whatever was for lunch and dinner) and this is constantly checked on, replenished and ice changed throughout the night. The hotel is clean throughout. The only difference I imagine is that the sister hotel is newer so modernised. Ok this hotel may need a lick of paint here and there but is definitely clean and well run. We may have been lucky by going in September. Would definitely recommend this month if you want to be treated like royalty and have the whole place to yourself. To sum up: Great food, great cocktails, great 24hr drinking, great service and great location (oh yeah they even drive you to the private part of the beach where your drinks are all included there too!)

We were a little skeptical about the place cause the price was so good. Our expectations were: clean, bug free room, decent food, working A/C, plenty of hot water. We got all that, plus an excellent, friendly staff and a great location one block from the North end of \"Quinta\", Playa del Carmen's pedestrian-only shopping, dining and bar district. The room, a standard room, was quite small, and there wasn't much space left after squeezing in the king size bed. The room did have a balcony with one chair, but the A/C unit was mounted there so it discharged hot air from the room onto the balcony, rendering it unusable for pretty much anything but drying clothes and towels. It didn't matter, because we were there for the beach and to experience the town, not to hang out on the balcony. The other flaws in the room - the shower was small and the bathroom floor would get wet when we used the shower (again not a problem because we just wiped up the floor with the bath rug, which was changed every day) and the promised in room frig was not there. Again, we didn't care, because there was a water cooler with fresh, pure water right outside the door, and because we weren't planning on hanging out in the room anyway. The maids kept the room clean, the A/C kept the room wonderfully cool, and there were no bugs in the room at all. The food at the hotel was very good, and the dining room staff was wonderful. All meals included plenty of food, and there was always abundant fresh fruit at breakfast, and of course eggs, etc. any way you want, and lots of other breakfast entrees and meats. Dinner was buffet a few times and ala carte a few times. Occupancy was down so the ala carte menu was not offered every night. The food was still good enough to keep us from dining on Quinta except for one dinner. We went out for a special meal on our anniversary, and had one lunch on tenth avenue from a local, tiny taco stand called \"Rush\". The hotel is not on the beach but you can walk or take a shuttle to the beach in front of the sister hotels, Gran Porto Real and the Royal. There is a little cabana bar there that serves beer, frozen drinks and nachos. Again, plenty of it and very friendly guys working there. They also have kayaks, snorkels, masks and fins for you to use. The snorkeling off the beach is not bad, especially next to the pier. The fish get bigger the further out you swim. Follow the pier out and you'll have a good time. The bottom there is a little rocky so buy some cheap water shoes to wear in the water. The water is very clear, waves are tiny and you can wade out a long way and still stand easily. Walk is only 10 minutes from the Real Playa del Carmen. The pool at the hotel is nice - one pool about waist deep and two other shallow pools for sitting or for kiddies. Hotel grounds are really pretty and we enjoyed watching the \"Mapache\", a larger version of the raccoon, prowl the grounds for food. This creature is cool to look at and won't bother you, but I would not recommend trying to pet this thing. This hotel is one block north of the upper end of the shopping district. It was great to walk out of the hotel and be right there. We strolled Quinta every evening and enjoyed it very much. We liked being in town much more than being stuck miles away at an isolated all-inclusive. The town is lovely and not to be missed. We paid next to nothing for this trip and didn't expect much. Room is not like you'd get at one of those huge all-inclusives, but neither is the price. So - good food, clean place, good A/C, great location, tiny room. Go for it.

Thats the best I can say for this hotel. The Bad: THE ROOM: We booked a standard room. Dont let the pictures fool you, the rooms are tiny, you walk in, you've got a bed, which takes up 90 percent of the room, bathroom, and a small patio that squeezes in 2. We didn't spend a lot of room in there anyway, but it definetly looks a lot smaller than the pictures indicate. FOOD: The food was atrocious. Basically some type of meat, in a bad sauce, every night. No variety to speak of. The food wasn't particularly Mexican, which you would hope you'd be able to try being on vacation and all. For what you pay, you may as well book a standard hotel, and just eat out every night. Trust me, the food outside this hotel is excellent. DRINKS: There was very little in the way of service, the bartenders arent exactly glad to offer you a drink (unless you want a beer, those come relatively fast) and the \"unlimited drinks\" was 1 keg of dos equis beer, that also ran out eventually. The guys at the beach club are pretty cool, of course if you drop them a few bucks, theyre a little better with getting you drinks. If you prefer an all inclusive, I definetly recommend stepping up what you would like to spend, because as always, you get what you pay for. But if you want to go budget and get all inclusive, totally not worth it, just go for a standard hotel, and eat and drink at the at restaurants and bars of Playa.

Nice king size bed with an added foam thing under a mattress pad, so the bed was really not bad. Decent water pressure and hot water. Shampoo and soap. Small balcony, which actually made for a nice little drying area for any wet clothes or saturated coolers. The air conditioner blew HOT air so things dried in a couple of hours. No fridge, which I actually thought was going to be included, but we had brought a collapsible insulated cooler, so that worked. The first night the remote didn't work for the TV and since we didn't want to be known as complainers we just decided we would stand on the bed every time we wanted to change the channel (TV was mounted on wall up by ceiling) Well, the housekeeper must have wanted to watch TV while she did our room because the next day it was replaced with a new remote. Yay! Tipped $5.00 a day for housekeeping and got towel art the 4th day on. I know it seems silly, but we really look forward to a little towel art. My only real complaint was the front desk didn't really seem to care one way or another about us. No returned smiles ever. We did not go all-inclusive here, so maybe that was a factor? Our return transportation was supposed to call us the second day to set up a return time and of course didn't (worryfreevacations) and the front desk had no idea (or care) about how to get a hold of them. Checked each day for a message at the front desk and finally got the customer service guy to call them the day before departure. Next time I won't worry about it until the end of the trip.

Upon arrival we were assigned a room too small for our family. After much room checking and negotiating we paid $100 U.S and had a fantastic ground floor master 'suite' with patio. We loved it. The grandparents also upgraded their rooms to avoid stairs etc. Baby got a crib, our 5 year old had the pull out couch and we had the king bed. We had space to stretch out and our only complaint would be that the bathroom had no tub. Our baby didn't like the shower at all. We can't say enough about the staff at this place. They were all SO accomodating and So nice. I even tipped the lady cleaning the grounds and pool area because she worked SO hard and it made such a diffrence. The food was great, not awesome but always something at the buffet for everyone. We ate almost EVERY meal here and no one got sick or tired of the fare. Once or twice the kids were hungry when there was no lunch out so we asked and they made something for us. This was before we found the snack bar. The swing bar had the BEST bartender so drink there. We were disappointed with the beach club and after a couple of days of getting palapas on the back row and surrounded by smokers we prefered to beach explore and find shade elsewhere. If you are a family with young children take your own beach umbrella. Shade is scarce and having the option to go away from all the smokers is a plus. Don't try to buy one there, not even the walmart had any for sale and we looked everywhere. Also we found that walking to the beach club was easier than waiting for the shuttle. Although it seemed that if you saw teh shuttle on the street he would take you at any time not just what the schedule said. Even with carrying a 25lb baby it was easy enough to walk. Overall we were VERY happy with the Real. We even got into the budget evening entertainment of karaoke and trivia nights. The Real is older but spotless and the staff exceptional.

My husband and I stayed for a week and really enjoyed our holiday. Here's our overview: ROOMS: We stayed in 611-A which was a smaller room, no fridge, king size bed, electronic safe, little balcony. The room was very clean, bathroom was clean and nothing was falling apart. The hotel/room itself is very \"Mexican\" so if you are expecting marble floors you won't get that here. No elevators so if you have a problem with stairs this might not be the place for you. STAFF: Staff is great, bar staff and restaurant staff really do a great job & everyone is very friendly. The day we got there our safe wasn't working so I went down to front desk and someone came to fix it within 5 minutes. We arrived at midnight and there was even someone to take our luggage & show us to our room. BEACH CLUB: The beach club is a few blocks away. We always walked b/c everything in Playa is walkable (in our minds) and it wasn't far away. The chairs were set up just right of the pier. We didn't have problems finding a chair. At 5pm you can watch the hotel workers play soccer right infront so that was entertaining! Snack bar was good with nachos/cheese/salsa/peanuts. Didn't have too many drinks but they do come around and ask you b/c they go back into the hotel bar to get them. FOOD: Breakfast was the best, omlettes, toast, pancakes, etc. Sometimes lunch & dinner were hit & miss. I think there were 2 times I wasn't impressed. Every night they would grill a different type of meat, have the regular bread, salads, veggies etc. Just sometimes if the meat was cooked a while ago and sitting on the grill it would cool off. But luckily with Playa if you don't like the food there's tons of other places to eat. We did go to Pizza Banana (around the corner by the stadium) a couple of times and it was awesome. There is a 24hr snack bar with drinks, nachos, maybe a different dessert, sandwiches, ice cream machine. We ate the ice cream a few times and it was awesome. Weren't too interested in some of the other things sitting there for a while though.. But I guess that's 24 hr food..There's little coffee machines at the bars where you can get cappucinos, hot water for tea, regular coffee, hot milk so those were handy. Didn't have to wait for someone to make you a drink. Otherwise, for the location & price we would definately stay here again. If you are expecting a 5 star, you are going to the wrong place.

I booked a double single usage...and that was a single double usage...but It was so old, not clean and very very poorly furnished!lines and towels smelled mouldy...they told me I could have used my \"all inclusive\" at the room mininbar..but there was no mini bar at all!!Concerning the other facilities: the swimming pool was pretty dirty, because of surrounding trees (though there was always someone there ready to clean it!), restaurants didn't have a lot of choice (basically rice and vegetabls), much better the breakfast buffet with delicious hot tortillas, omelettes and a good choice of croissants and cakes. The 24hrs bar was pretty disappointing: do not expect to go and feed up yourslf after a wild night, because all you can get there is..nachos!!!(You'd better go to Senor Tacombi...I'll talk about this on a review on Playa del Carmen!) BUT I have to say and (I really want to say it that), Real Playa is not that bad as you may image: there I found the best staff I have ever met in my life (I work in a hotel chain and I do mean what I'm writing!). There is a regular and free of charge \"shuttle service\" which takes guests from Real Playa to the beach (by the same hotel's chain 5 star resort) and here you can have free towels, sunbeds and of course drinks and snacks on the beach. The service on the beach was impeccable (well..apart the omnipresent \"nachos\"!!), Elizabeth is such a nice waitress, so kind...Be prepared to wait for a while if you ordered a beer or any alcoholic cocktail on the beach: because they only have soft drinks at the bar on the beach, so they have to go inside the resort to make them! The bar staff is so nice, they make very good cocktails: if you have the \"all inclusive\" try them all! There are so many chambermaids, waitresses, bartenders always kind and smiling. The maintenance, security service and porterage is really efficient: I got my safe blocked at 2.00 am in the morning, I called the reception and right after 2 minutes the maintenace guy was there ready to repair my safe!! At any time of day and night, you fill find security everywhere: in the lobby, on the beach..which means a lot to a single woman as I were! Porterage guy, Vidal, was so kind and efficient: he helped me with my 30 kg luggages, bringing them from the 3rd floor to the reception!And he was so funny and it's been such a pleasure to met him.

My back, neck, shoulders, hips, ached in the morning. No exaggeration, it felt like cement. There was no dresser for our clothes, and we could only open 1/2 of our closet due to the furniture arrangement. There was a stain on our blanket, and the room just seemed dirty overall. There were little black bugs on the nightstand! Also there were bugs in the shower. You are not allowed to flush toilet paper down the toilet!

There is no bottled water. The mirror is a rusty mess. Our friends t.v. didn't work, and no one fixed it for 2 days. Now for the food....horrible! We could hardly even choke it down.

It rated this hotel as a 31/2 star but the resort rates itself (slightly biased I think) a 4 star. NOT a 4 that's for sure. A three is more accurate. We decided on this resort because our family was going (2 adults and 2 teens) so it made it an affordable vacation package during Xmas week when prices are crazy. We were told before we booked that it didn't have it's own beach and that you would share the beach of one of the sister resorts which you had to walk about 2 blocks to. The pictures of the beach looked good in the brochure. When we got there we had a hard time finding someone that could actually tell us exactly which resort we were to share the beach with so we had to do a lot of footwork and asking before we finally found someone to tell us where we were to be. More like 5 blocks away. It was not a bad walk by any means for able people, down 5th Ave or you could walk down the beach to get to it too. We sat on the beach of the sister resort -Porto Real where we were supposed to be and we recognized it from the pics in the brocure. Then were then told by the staff that because we were staying at the Real we had to sit on the \"other\" part of the beach. We felt like we were low class or something. Pretty small part of the beach with very few chairs, hard white plastic ones mostly. The only thing we got all week at the snack bar we were allowed to eat at was nachos. That part was a little disappointing but the beaches at Playa in general are pretty hard to be too disappointed about naturally so it wasn't that bad. This part of the beach was behind the snack hut from the sun so for our part of the beach the sun set at about 3pm and we were in the shade for the rest of the afternoon. Service on the beach was good though if you tipped a couple american dollars first thing and then a buck here or there. The drinks were good and came quickly after that. The rooms were ,well what we expected for a 3 star but ours was very clean. Toilet wouldn't flush well. Food was OK but that's about it. 1 ala carte resturant but no one ever ate at it so that in itself will tell you food quality right there. We ala carte once and it was OK. Buffet was limited but okay. They had a rib and Chicken night and it was excellent. Breakfasts were GREAT here. Location is excellent especially when you have teens with you. Right on 5th Ave - always something to do. The staff we found very helpful for most things (except for telling you where the beach is). I think they water down their alcohol because we could consume a ton of dacquries and still be quite sober - which was ok with me. It was one way of getting the water you needed because the only other thing is that they would only allow 1 -450ml bottle of water per person per day (to brush your teeth with and keep hydrated in 28 degrees plus? Get real!!!!). Water shouldn't be something that is rationed and you shouldn't have to stock pile which we found ourselves doing with our partial bottles. It is an okay place to stay if you plan to do a lot of things off the resort and don't spend a lot of time in your room or around a pool (pool is small- would be great for small kids). You don't feel so bad eating off the resort if you aren't paying 5 star prices and there are definitely a TON of fantastic eating places along 5th Ave which is right out the front door. Try the Blue Lobster resturant for a lobster feast - GREAT!!! I would stay at one of the sister resorts next time but this place served its purpose for our trip with the kids and everyone did not suffer by any means and we had a vacation we will all remember. If you want the comforts of home then stay at home, if you want the luxuries of a 5 star resort then stay at a 5 star. If you want simple accomodations at a 3 star level this is the place.

When we arrived the resot itself, looked desserted.. There was No staff other than people working the buffett. This resort is very simillar to a motel style.. No elevators - so you have to carry your luggage up several flights of stairs. The food was terrible and limited in selection, even in the al le carte resturant. I ordered a salad and it came with a blue dressing that tasted simillar to toothpaste and water. The only entertainment during our entire duration was at dinner one night - and it was a staff member carrying a jar of marbels and we had to guess how many marbels were inside.. Exciting eh?? I think not.. The pool was very small, and therefore noone really used it. The only bar on site is in the hotel lobby, and is also quite limited - and has a couple muted TV's but no music. The room was dirty and the shower curtain and bed sheets had blood stains on them. There were bugs all over the room including between the sheets of the bed. We had to leave our room on the second day to have it exterminated.. There were limited towels in the room - and the water in the shower was always cold. For two days our toilette wouldn't flush (and all we were eating in the buffett was fruit - you can imagine what the room smelt like!) Finally by day 3 someone came with a plunger and unclogged it.. However they left the reamins of what was in the toillette all over the floor. The staff the worked the front desk were extremely rude and unhelpful.. One of the days we were in need of a first aid kit, as my friend had cut her foot open - and they had us told we would have to walk 4 blocks and buy a kit or some bandaids.. I thought this was outragious.. Towards the end of our duration we complained to the staff several times and eventually recieved an upgrade to the sister resort..

It wasn't terrible and it wasn't great. It was just as I expected it to be. We had a 1 Bedroom Suite - I have to say that I thought that all of the rooms were supposed to have hammocks, but I was wrong. Bummer. Our room was large for this type of hotel, it was spotless when we arrived, I was more than pleased with this. The fridge was fully stocked with soda, beer, water, and even malt beverages (this is something I have never seen in a mini-bar before). The air was cold, the toilets flushed perfectly (even though I kept accidentally putting my toiled paper inside). So, nothing bad to say really. It was sort of funny though. The night we arrived the power went out for a few hours and we fell fast asleep from our long day of traveling. When we woke up is when we realized that the power was out. We laughed it off a bit and went to dinner in the dark. The Mexican food night was actually not too bad, I was a bit worried though at first because I couldn't see what I was eating. The power eventually did come back on. We went to a great place called Alux after dinner for some drinks. You have to check that place out!! It was a fantastic restaurant/bar in a cave underground. It was just amazing. Don't forget to go there. You'll probably need to take a cab to get there. Don't let the drivers try to rip you off though, the rates are pre-established. Don't pay more than 35 pesos to go to Alux or tell the driver you will find another. Always ask before you get in what the rate is or you could get ripped off. I've been to Mexico 5 times in the last year and even though I know better, I've let myself get ripped off twice. It's so annoying! Anyway, it's nice to have the 24 hour snack bar. I love that they have beer and wine in there along with soda and, well, of course the snacks. I did have a hot dog after a late night in Playa. I loaded it up with pico de gallo. I could go on and on, so long story short. It's a fine hotel. It's not fancy. Breakfast is actually pretty good. Other than the Mexican night the rest of the dinners and lunches were not so great. In fact I think it's the first time that I lost weight on vacation. If you want something cheap and you are fine with cheap you will probably like it. If you like the 4 or 5 star properties with lots of amenities and fancy bedding you probably won't like this hotel. The location is excellent, the pool is clean and cute, the rooms are clean, and that is the gist of it.

No I am not referring to returning to Baltimore MD, rather my return to Real Playa Del Carmen. I love this tiny little resort for so many reasons. Now first off, if you are used to staying at the Grand Occidental, or the Riu Palace\u2026stop reading right now\u2026no seriously, stop now\u2026ok everyone we are just going to have to wait for the Grand Occidental, or the Riu Palace people to follow directions\u2026ok now that those snobs are gone lets talk about them\u2026no seriously Real Playa Del Carmen or RPDC as I will refer to it from here on out, is not for the uber pampered. Its pool is tiny; there is no hot tub, its not on the beach, it has one buffet (with darn good food for an all-inclusive) and one reservation type restaurant (pretty good food for a make a reservation at an all inclusive) no elevators, no boats, no lights, no motorcars\u2026ok there are boats at the beach club and there are of course motorcars\u2026made from coconuts. Anyway, what does this place have then? First and foremost, location, location, location\u2026it\u2019s in a good location. It is right on 5th avenue and at the end where it is not too busy. You can take a shuttle to the beach club (which is a bit eroded\u2026the beach\u2026not the shuttle), it is at the other Real resort down 5th ave. or you can walk around the corner to a little stretch of the prettiest beach in all of Playa Del Carmen. It is close enough to the hustle and bustle to walk; but far enough away to be mellow. The standard room is spotless, and big, and kept up very nicely. Plenty of T.V. channels (why is that a concern for so many? Are we really that enslaved to the idiot\u2019s lantern?). Great AC, and pretty good water pressure for the Yucatan. The other big selling point for RPDC would be what this resort has that other doesn\u2019t or rather what it offers at no extra charge. The safe in the room is provided at no extra charge, the bars stay open until around 2 or 3 in the a.m. The best thing about the RPDC is the club house, you have movies, pool table, foosball, 24/7 soft drinks and beer (mmmmm beer) hotdogs (mmmmm hotdogs) and sandwiches (mmmm sandmitches), and free internet access (mmmm dirty pictures and star trek)!!! This little extra mile makes RPDC stand out, it is a pain to have to go to the gift shop to buy sodas or snacks, and it costs too. Here you have a little resort, with great staff that put out that \u2018something extra\u2019 that makes RPDC a very special tranquil hole in the wall resort. Never too busy, never too crowded\u2026as a matter of fact maybe you should go stay at the Grand Occidental, or the Riu Palace. Yeah definitely, leave my little resort alone, you wouldn\u2019t like it here\u2026in the hammock, at 4a.m., drinking beer (mmmmm beer) and eating hotdogs (mmmmm hotdogs). I do have to say that RPDC has fallen into the one thing all Mexican resorts do \u2026the time share scam\u2026they bundle your resort tour with the timeshare salesperson. I am a no BS type of guy, so when I say no, you can pretty much tell I am not just being coy; but the chic selling at RPDC actually called my room to see if we had changed our minds\u2026now I am not fluent in Spanish (like some of the pretentious gits on here that go on and on about not looking like a tourist\u2026guess what you are in a foreign land, to look at things, have fun, buy things, take pictures, and go home\u2026there is this thing called a dictionary, maybe these non-tourist people should use one) ok before I digressed on that last tangent, I am not fluent in Spanish\u2026but I know enough to make sure she will never crossed my path again.

My mother and I have been to Playa del Carmen 3 or 4 times before this trip, and we both agreed, this was by far, one of the worst experiences we have had in Playa. From the beginning at checking into the front desk, the staff was not very helpful with information about the hotel and provided us with only one piece of paper that was a faint copy of hours for the two restaurants (which one of them you had to make reservations for and some days it is open and some days it wasn't-although the sheet of paper never specified days it was closed\". Our travel agent booked us a non-smoking room with 2 beds. When I asked if it was two beds, the front desk said no, it was a king but for $20 more a night, we could upgrade to a room with 2 beds. We said we would wait to see the room before making the decision. When we entered the room, it had an overwhelming smell of smoke and had ashtrays in it. We asked the bellboy about a non-smoking room and he said all of the rooms were smoking. There were not any non-smoking rooms. We asked him to call the front desk about getting us upgraded to the room with 2 beds and he said it wasn't ready yet and we would have to wait around 2-3 more hours if we wanted that room AND it would be $25 more per night (all of a sudden it went up another $5 a night). We decided to stay in the room we had and tried to make the best of it-even though it caused problems with our breathing. The bellboy said he would call someone to spray freshner in the room, but of course, that never came. Don't expect much from the room-there are no hairdryers, has little bathrooms, hard flat beds and our phone couldn't make any local calls and when we called the front desk or housekeeping, it was rare if we got someone to pick up the phone. I had someone from the states call me and it took him 3 times before he could get someone to answer at the hotel so that he could be connected to our room. It does have a small fridge which they stock on the first day with some sodas and water but they do not re-stock it each day you are there. Once we drank our bottled water, we couldn't get any more even though we were at an all-inclusive hotel. We had to buy bottled water if we wanted any after we drank the 2 bottles that were in our fridge in the room. The restaurants and bars only gave you water in little cups and did not carry bottled water. Another thing-the Real Resort website advertises that \"Total Access to all Gran Porto Real facilities including its deluxe SPAREAL\". When we asked about access to the Gran Porto, the front desk said we would have to pay $35 per person per day if we wanted access to that hotel. So don't fall for the false advertising on their website because ANYONE can buy a day-pass at those hotels. You don't have to be a guest at Real to get a day pass to Gran Porto. Other issues with the hotel: Later during our first night at the hotel, we asked if there were any non-smoking rooms and the front desk said they had some earlier but not any more. They were all full so basically the bellboy lied to us. You have to pay to use the computer to access the Internet, which is standard for most hotels, but several of the keys on the keyboard did not work such as the P, B, N and I am sure others but we got too frustrated to keep working on it, especially after we had to pay to use it. The food in the buffet was not great. It was edible but if you have stayed at other all-inclusive hotels in the Playa del Carmen area, it is very substandard to other hotels' food and their buffets. Their is a Latte machine next to the Cappucino machine, but it didn't work. I will say the Flan was excellent but that is about it. Many of the foods were odd concepts such as the brownish green small turkey legs with hard boiled eggs cut in half and mixed into the gravy, an unrecognizable fish dish, vienna type sausages mixed into eggs (which they called eggs and winnies!), and other items that if they did not have a sign, I would have had no idea what it was. And no champagne for Mimosas in the morning. The water did not work in the sinks in the public bathrooms available to guests at the hotel. One bathroom by the bar had water leaking out from the toilet and spilling all over the floor. Even after we let the front desk know that the water still wasn't working on the second day we were there, we just gave up on it ever working. The scary part is that both of these bathrooms are next to the restaurant and so all of these people are not washing their hands, including employees, and then going to eat at the buffet or serving the guests food. A very nasty environment to say the least. when we asked for change to use the Internet, the front desk was out of change. We asked how long to get to another hotel and they said 15 minutes and it actually took around 40 minutes with no traffic and our cab speeding past other cars. The \"spa\" is a small hut outside and we never saw anyone there or providing services there. Each night we were there, we had guests shouting in the halls around 3 am or 4 am with no security or hotel staff asking them to lower their voices. The staff at the front desk would consistently answer the phone first and finish that call before waiting on guests at the front desk so you would have to wait a long time if you had a question to ask them. To top it off, they have a computer by the front desk that ask for comments on the hotel. You are supposed to slide your room key to activate the survey. The card reader didn't work and not all the keys worked on the keyboard to type in a room number and therefore the survey couldn't ever start. Areas that were good: The flan was some of the best and there are some hammocks by the pool were very comfortable. The maids and the wait staff were very nice and the presentation of the food at dinner was nice in the Maria's restaurant (when it was open) and there is a 24 hour snack bar which was probably the best thing they had. I didn't think I would ever be so excited about chips and football stadium nacho cheese but after dealing with the food in the main restaurant, it was a wonderful snack to have!! Maybe some of the issues we had wouldn't bother you but compared to many of the other all-inclusive hotels we have stayed at, it was very disappointing. More than anything, the front desk staff was the worst and you just never felt like they ever \"wanted\" to be helpful. And it wasn't just us, each time I went up to the front desk, there was another guest complaining about something so during the time we were there, there were MANY unhappy guests.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cBudget Minded?

I was traveling with my two young children to meet friends in Playa. We had had reservations set and paid for through Cheapseats.com since August 2007 for a different resort in Playa. When we arrived, exhausted and just wanting our rooms, we found that Cheapseats had taken our money and then never paid the hotel for the rooms. So here we are, peak season, in Mexico and no rooms! My girlfriend jumped online and found us rooms at the Real. One of two resorts that had rooms. I was not sure what to expect when we pulled up but I was very pleasantly surprized. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to carry our bags. The front desk staff spoke adequate english and so did most of the other staff who interacted with guests. But hey, we're the ones visiting Mexico - right? When I read the complaints about non-english speaking staff, I think, well maybe YOU should should learn some spanish!! The grounds were verypretty with alot of foliage, chairs and hammocks. My kids really enjoyed the pool and playing in the hammocks. The grounds are all enclosed and moderately sized so it didn't seem overwheming to let them walk around a bit just in my sight. They loved the snack bar. A kids dream - 24 hour soft-serve ice cream! I wasn't hugely impressed, but I did enjoy the nachos. The best piece for me was their on-call Dr. My 7-year-old ame down with a double ear infestion while we were there. It got pretty bad and I was nervous about clinics, Doctors, language and payment. I asked the front desk where the nearest clinic was and I found out they have their own doctor. Well that made me nervous. A room call? Can you imagine how much THAT would cost in the states? As if it would even happen! So I agree and wait in my room with my daughter. Within 45 minutes Dr. Gustavo Ambriz shows up. He was friendly and kind. Language wasn't a problem - he speaks 4 languages! So he looked in her ears, cleaned them, talked to me about treatment, gave me antibiotics, ear drops and advice about the next time we travel. All of this for $145 american dollars! That included his tip. I couldn't have been more appreciative. She felt better the next day and we have a wonderful time at Xcaret (HIGHLY recommend it). Food was fine. Some looked mysterious to me but I'm leary about meats. Loved the papaya and the coffee. This resort was very international. I think spanish was one of the least spoken languages! There were many travelers form Europe, it was cool to get a taste of so many languages, fashions, etc... Great location near 5th but not too close. great internet coffee shop across the street! Have Fun and don't sweat the small stuff!! PS WARNING: We have been back from our vacation for 3 weeks. We have not gotten any reparations from Cheapseats. Actually we have not even been able to effectively contact them. The 1-800 on the website? Gives you all sorts of options then when you get to customer service a recording says \"sorry we're closed\".

Yes the room was not up to a 5 star standard, for example the toilet seat was broken so when you sat it would shift a bit, fridge keeped drinks slightly cool, and the beds were alittle on the hard side.

I was looking to spend about half what we usually spend at our usual mega-swank resort north of Playa. Online, the Real appeared to suffice for that, and the price was reasonable -- about the same as alot of Playa's decent hotels without any inclusive package. I read alot of reviews on Trip Advisor & other web sites, and decided the complaints were things I could live with for the price. I also knew from the reviews that I could upgrade to the Gran Porto Real if I got there and was not happy. I knew it was not in the middle of the 5th avenue party zone, but it was several blocks north on 5th avenue, and quieter. So I booked it through Worry-Free Vacations and away we flew. Total booking price for my wife and I for four days, Sun-Thurs, was less than $900 including round-trip air from Texas (got lucky with the promotions & discounts) so clearly I was not going to be really picky about the accommodations. We wound up upgrading to the Gran Porto Real for a little extra money -- not entirely because of the Real Playa, see details below. The staff at both hotels were very accommodating regarding the change, and since we changed hotels about 10:30 at night, I was really amazed at how well things were handled on both ends DETAILS: We arrived about 11:00am and had to wait till 3:00pm for our room -- not the end of the world but our luggage (and everyone else's) stayed relatively unguarded & unwatched by the bar. We left and came back several hours later, and nothing was missing. There's a little mall-looking shopping center across the street with a coffee shop, but nothing else -- looks like it's still being finished. the beach is about a 5 minute walk, not bad at all. There's a free shuttle to take you to the Real's beach club near the Gran Porto Real, or anywhere else you want to go, but we didn't take it. The 24-hour snack bar was not well stocked -- some chips, dips, very little meat & bread, but the Corona keg tap and a soft drink machine seemed to flow well enough. We ate at the ala carte lunch restaurant (Albatross I think). It looked nice and the staff was attentive. The food looked great but was bland - no flavor at all. Even the hamburger I had was boring (but not unacceptable, I still ate it). The best piece of food was a little pecan pie looking thing that appeared to have praline gooey stuff inside and strawberries on top -- that was really good. When we got our room key cards, there were no bell boys around to tote the bags -- odd for Mexico, they must have been really busy or maybe they've become so Americanized they were in a value-added process improvement meeting - HA! So after waiting through my beer & wife's mixed drink from the excellent bartender we got our own bags and set out for the room. The grounds were really beautiful, well marked for finding things, and well kept. The pool was nice and clear, had a few leaves in it but not bad, and since there are trees all over the place this is to be expected. There's a nice spot with a bunch of hammocks (hammaccas?) by the pool. The grounds are completely walled/gated with people at the rear gate to let rent cars in but keep non-residents out. Bicycles were also available at that gate. First 3 hours is free, after that it was $1 USD per hour or $7 a day if I remember right. Overall the grounds and staff were excellent. We got in our room and were a little surprised at how small it really was. \"Well, those reviews were right\", I thought to myself, maybe I should have booked a suite instead. The standard room was about half the size of a Holiday Inn room in the US. There was one desk and nowhere else but the bed to open up another suitcase so with two suitcases, one of us would need to unpack & put things on a shelf. I did that but the bed was so close to the closet it was very difficult to open the doors and get in there. One surprise was the brand new safe -- no key to mess with, it had a digital keypad & reader for the room key card. you swipe the room key card and then enter a 4-digit code of your choosing to lock it, and that same swipe & code unlock it the next time. Easiest room safe I've ever used, and no dang key to mess with. The AC was not on when we arrived so the room was hot & stuffy. No big deal, I turned the AC on and the room was cool by the time I had unpacked and figured out the safe. I was fine by this time, but my wife killed two small gray spiders on the wall within 5 minutes of arrival, and looked through the sheets for anymore -- she found none. We took a little nap on the hard bed (fine by me, but wife didn't like it) and woke up being bitten by some mosquitos. I looked for where they were getting in, and the bathroom window was open. It wouldn't close all the way but it slowed the mosquitos down. The bathroom itself was OK, but not great. There was a musty smell and the towels felt damp. Shower curtain had some discoloration at the bottom but then again so does mine at my house, so I blew it off. Wife didn't like it in a hotel though. I checked out the fridge and it was typical for the Yucatan peninsula hotels I've stayed in -- cooler than the room, but not what we would call cold here in the US. Wife & I are used to that in Mexico, so no big deal. After all, it had beer in it, how bad can that be? We set out for supper but did not eat at the hotel since we are used to Playa and have our favorite spots we like to hit (especially La Parrilla). After a few hours of walking, my wife stepped wrong on her ankle somehow (NOT at the Real) and hurt it so bad we had to get her a cane to walk with (for the next couple days it tuned out). I want to be clear about this -- This was NOT the Real's fault at all, but that meant we would not be walking ruins all day like I had originally planned. All of a sudden I wanted a nicer place to stay and eat, mainly for my wife who was in pain, and we upgraded to GPR. We've had some questions from TripAdvisor readers on how the upgrade took place, so read on if you're detail oriented (or OCD like me). HERE'S HOW WE UPGRADED TO THE GPR: We walked (slowly) through the Gran Porto Real and the Royal, both owned by the same company as the Real Playa. The Royal seemed way swankier than we had the money for on this trip, so we asked the GPR check-in staff how to upgrade from the Real. They confirmed they had rooms available in standard, suite, and ocean view but told us we needed to start at the Real where we had originally booked the stay. At the Real Playa, I told the check in clerk I wanted to upgrade to the GPR. He asked if there was a problem, and we told him about the wife's ankle that was not his fault, the spiders, mosquitos, and the room size being smaller than we wanted. He called the GPR to confirm vacancy, and informed us the upgrade would be $60 USD total per night (not $60 each per night). Seemed reasonable to us. He gave us a Real Resorts voucher for what we had already spent booking the Real Playa, and called the GPR to tell them we were on the way. He even called for a cab and paid for it to take us to the GPR, which I was not expecting. This was 10-10:30 at night and I thought it was extremely good customer service. We chose a standard room at the GPR which was about the same size as a Holiday Inn room in the US but much nicer. We were happy and I later posted a separate review for the GPR if you want to know how that was. The Real staff also worked with Worry Free Vacations to let them know we changed hotels so the van to take us back to the airport would pick us up at GPR. I had a rental car coming to the Real, and they referred that to GPR as well. Again, I thought this was good customer service especially for somebody who obviously wanted to be in a nicer place. Would I go to the Real Playa again? By myself, yes, absolutely. With the wife, no. We'd stay at GPR or ElDorado Royale instead (our usual spot).", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the Price!!\u201d", "Author": "Traveling1MN", "ReviewID": "UR12894377", "Content": "My mom and I took a mother/daughter getaway to Playa Del Carmen last summer.

This is my story: Me and my wife went to Playa del Carmen for two weeks of honey moon. And we really liked Playa del Carmen and Mexico. Unfortunately we spent 2 weeks at Real Playa del Carmen. The first room we spent the first days in had almost no pressure in the shower after telling the people in the reception two times to fix it I grabbed some kind of janitor who fixed the pressure, but the next day there where no pressure again. I went down to the reception to complain again this time the girl gave us a new room, I got the impression that this was not the first time this happened. The food at Real Playa del Carmen was the same food for 2 weeks, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Of course the where some difference of instance one day there was peas in the rise another it was corn or even small pieces of sausage\u2026 After 3 days we started thinking if all-inclusive at Real Playa del Carmen was a good idea. After 5 days we were certain that is wasn\u2019t. From now we only ate breakfast here and spent our money at some great restaurants at Fifth Avenue. We never ate at the a-la carte since you had to make a reservation in the morning to get a table in the maximum half full restaurant. The beach club, a quite nice beach, a bar with snacks, nachos, nuts and some kind of hard fluffy things, quite ok. But just next to the beach for Real playa del Carmen was the beach and bar for Gran Porto Real. This place had much better food at the beach, the hotel was built next to the beach and it is not that much more expensive. The food was good according to some of our co-travelers. One thing that happened was that we went out to eat one night, as every night the last week, when we came back to our room someone had made the bed for the second time that day and the safety box was locked. We had forgotten to lock it when we left, we called for security to open the box. Fortunate all our stuff where still there passports, i-pod, phone, wedding rings, but the only cash we had, a 50$ bill, was missing. Loosing a50$ isn\u2019t really a big deal but the thing about this is the reaction we got from the reception when we spoke to her about it. The girl sad something like, this was not right but it happened and there was nothing to do. No one really cared. I really hope that the tip-money that got stolen were stolen by the cleaning lady who would have gotten it anyway. A few other things that we experienced, a TV that stopped working a few times, ants in the toilet and a freezing pool. My advice for people who are thinking about going to Playa del Carmen add some extra money and get a better hotel than this or get a cheaper hotel and buy your food in some of the restaurants.

However, once we arrived at the Real Playa del Carmen, reality hit us hard. The service was excellent, the concierge and the bell boys were friendly. When we got to our deluxe suite (the best room they had in the whole place), the first thing we noticed was how hot it was. The air conditioning machine wasn't very good... thus we spent our nights in bed sweaty and uncomfortable. The worst part of the stay was sleeping with ants and other bugs. There was never a lonely moment because the little critters were literally everywhere: on the bathroom table, on our dresser, on the floor, in our clothes, even on our bed! We asked for a room change, which they accommodated, but there wasn't much improvement (there were still bugs and it was hot). They offered us a terminator, but we figured since we were only staying 2 nights, we wouldn't hassle them. We hated our bathroom and shower. It felt like we were showering in prison.

We found a great deal on the internet for 9 days 8 nights for less than $700 each including airfare, so we decided to book it. Knowing this hotel was not going to be the Ritz, our expectations were already in check. After reading some the reviews on this site, it seemed like it was exactly what we were looking for. Yes, this hotel is not on the beach and it is a bit of walk to the beach club, but a shuttle service is provided, so we did walk and took the shuttle when it was available, which worked out just fine. Some people on this site complained, saying the beach club was not in a nice part of the beach, but we found it to be just fine, do pack water shoes, since there were some rocks on the ocean floor. (we arrived a day after hurricane Dean, so that may have been the reason for so many rocks).......There were plenty of beach chairs and palapas available on the beach, there is a great beach bar, and Valentino who serves the drinks to you on the beach was the BEST......... always checking to see if you needed anything........ The food at the buffet was fine, breakfast had a large variety, we only ate lunch twice in our nine day stay and that also was fine. The only thing available at the beach club for lunch, was chips and salsa, so if you are a lunch person, you have to go back to the resort, honestly we ate enough at breakfast, that we did not have to eat lunch. We ate dinner 3 nights at the buffet and that too was ok, remember we are not at the Ritz, so don\u2019t expect FANCY......... We did make reservations at the ala carte restaurant called Maria\u2019s on the property, having no trouble making a reservation 5 nights, we tried almost everything on the menu and found the food there to be excellent, for an extra $15.00 you can order lobster, and that too was well worth the $30.00 extra for dinner one night. We are firm believers in still TIPPING even though it is not required, and honestly did not see much tipping going on by other guests, what a shame, since the service in the whole resort was EXCELLENT....... Playa del Carmen Is a great town to walk around and sightsee and shop, or just take a walk after dinner, this hotel was right on Fifth Avenue and truly has location going for it.......... The week we were there, we clearly were the minority, since the hotel was mostly occupied with Italians.......... I think some people cut there vacations short since Dean was due to hit and some people cancelled there vacations altogether, which made the resort not crowded. There is a pool at the resort, with lounge chairs and a hammock garden, in case you are not a beach person. The gardens around the hotel were beautiful and nicely kept. We had the one-bedroom suite which was very nice and our room was kept very clean and always done by the time we arrived back from the beach.

The buffet was good, plentiful,maybe a bit repetitive at times, but they did make the effort to introduce some variety every few days. The ala cart restaurant was booked solid but I never actually saw too many people eating in there for some reason. The hotel was not as bad as what has been stated by others. Yes, the beds were hard, but I heard they were hard all over town, no matter where you stayed. We still got a restful night's sleep. I found the staff to be very ,very hardworking and accomodating. They were the best! The dance performances at night were very atheletic and flexible and never the same routine twice. It was impressive! We booked through Nolotours and the only criticism I have is that we were mislead about a tour that was overbooked and just plain awful! It was to Xel-Ha and I will never, ever go there again! I felt like a sardine packed into the bus(which was 45 minutes late) taking us there and there was no time or room for individual questions. We were shuttled quickly into what is a huge, albeit beautiful ,natural, tourist trap, where no English is spoken and there is little staff to help you anyway. If you don't snorkle, there is nothing to do except wander for miles on a trail that goes nowhere. We got bored silly in short order and went back to the hotel , disillusioned and poorer. I did not get my refund from the Nolitours rep even though we didn't go the second half-the Tulum tour. We wouldv'e had to kill two more hours there bored and hot. The Coba Village Tour was in stark contrast wonderful. The guide showed up on time, was extremely knowledgable, spoke English and knew all the people in the village. We toured the Mayan ruins in the jungle as well as saw how a typical Mayan family lived. All our questions were answered, we climbed the largest ruin (which was an accomplishment for all of us I think (and we were all ages and all levels of fitness), treated to a tasty lunch, and not blindly rushed through the place as was the experience with the Xel-Ha tour. The guide was exceptional. His name was Jeraldo (Jerry) and the driver was Juan. We also went to Delphinus which was smaller than Xel-Ha but only dealt with Dolphins. Xel-Ha did too but it was confusing to get to them. Delphinus treated people more personally (and in small groups)and the dolphins were wonderful, entertaining and obviously very well treated .

It was located on the beach by the more posh Real resorts (terrible beach) and shoved off in a corner.

The air conditioning in the rooms is Samsung window units with remotes....not bad, but when the power went out in the area, the air clicked off and we came home to a stifling room. Again, this was not the hotel's fault. There is one restaurant here.... but they have it setup with dividers to make it appear to be three, but don't be fooled, its realy only one ; ) The food is average, but you eat outdoors in a beach style hut by the pool so keep this in mind...its hot.

It's like a 40 year old motel 6 vs. the 4 seasons ! I'm serious. Ask if they have availability and upgrade right away. Keep asking, evn if you just get the last day its's worth $20. The Gran Porto Real was awesome. Food was amazing, restaurants were good. Central air in the rooms....oustanding. Also its a beautifaul, new property as opposed to the Real PDC. Many bars to choose from as well. Real doesnt' seem to care about the Real PDC property...they spent a few $$ remodelign it and that's that. Upgrade right away of you can. I recommend it !

They were more postive then, comparing to now. Here are my honest and fair observations on this place. I hope it helps to you all. Good luck.. The Good: Well, honestly, it is not a bad hotel to stay (too sleep and eat only). Clean rooms, AC worked well. Room service was on time Local cuisine in buffet restaurant is awesome. The Bad: Terrible a la carte restaurant. Overcooked lobster for those who may not have eaten lobster before. (avoid it while you can my fellow Americans, you have had better the mall) Too far from the Beach Club. Very small pool And the Ugly: Beach Club, beach club and beach club.. FOOD: Food was not bad at all: Buffet restaurant was great with many choices. Morning fesh fruit juice bar is simply awesome. A la carte restaurant however was horrible with over-cooked lobster for $20. They know how to cook Mexican in both restaurants but don't try Italian or French dishes. DRINKS: Bad drinks, with 98% juice. Even extra doubles did not make much difference. I wonder these type of resorts use some sort of low-alcohol content drinks. So, stick with Beer if you can, or get your own booze from the town (very cheap) ads onto your drink. The HOTEL: It was old (very old), but clean and well maintained. Staff was helpful. BEACH Club of the Resort: Beach club was located in the worst possible location in Playa De Carmen and good 20 minutes walk through the shortest cut. Yes, there is a shuttle, but if you like to schedule your movements in vacation for a shuttle then try it. When you arrive to the Beach Club, which is no bigger than a volleyball court, you will be horrified with the beach itself. Left, side of the beach area is blocked with a large pier that was started to be constructed and left unfinished; a concrete nightmare (see the photo I uploaded). Right side has a little cove, with full of muddy material which I think some sort of natural occurrence ( I hope!). The beach was also protected from erosion by many sandbags that had become black and dirty. Beach club staff was nice though. So, if you want nicer and sandier beach, you will have to try other parts of the beach strip available to many other nice(r) hotels. But, if you get thirsty, then you will have to walk back to resort's Beach Club. It is very annoying and time consuming. I must tell you about the Bulldozer experience at the beach: Evidently in the middle of the day some smart individual from neighboring resort decided to teach his fellow employees how to load and unload sand with a small bulldozer. Consequently, he decided to use the Beach Club area for driving, loading and unloading the machine with sand right about 2 feet away from sunbathing resort residents, with full of gas fumes, loud sound of the machine and possibility of running over us. Eventually, after few protests from customers, he was told to go-away. What a beach experience; dirty, muddy beach, surrounded by concrete and people who may run you over with a bulldozer. ADVICE: If you are into a beach vacation, this is not your hotel. Pay extra get one of the beach resorts. Distance from the beach really spoils the whole vacation experience.

We had a great time and enjoyed the Real. It is primarily a good value. We got a great price for an all inclusive property, but you must realize this is not a luxury property. It's not on the beach and the food is only so-so. There is one resturaunt that they call two. You need a reservation for the ala carte side of the resturaunt but it's really not worth the effort. Neither side is air conditioned. The staff is great, the grounds are well kept, the rooms are clean and the drinks are good and allways available. The beach club is on a poor section of the beach and quite a ways from the hotel. The best beach is found by going left on fifth avenue from the lobby for a block then right straight to the beach. It's one of the nicest stretches of beach you'll ever see. If your on a budget but want to see the sights, avoid the tours and take the bus. The bus station is down fifth ave. about 10 blocks or so and you can go to Chichen Itza for about $3.00 rount trip. admission is only $3 or $4. The tour from the hotel is about $60.00 per person. Same thing goes for Tulum and Xel Ha. A warning, Dont use Worry Free Vacations to mexico! When we arrived at the airport there was no transportation to the hotel. we had to wait 2 1/2 hours for our bus. Adventure tours, funjet and all the others were there waiting for them. worry Free is not! We never saw or heard from a representative in the time we were there. On the last night, thanks to a dest clerk who was persistent we were able to talk to someone about a ride to the airport the next morning. Our only option was to be picked up at 5:40 am for our 10 am flight. The hotel staff is well aware of the poor performance of worry free.

We got a pretty good deal, and the Trip Advisor reviews were positive, so we thought we would give it a try. The hotel itself is nice enough. The staff are all extremely friendly and VERY hard working. I espically liked being offered a beverage while we were checking in! The room was fine. On the small side, but not a problem at all. Our particular room had issues with the toilet flushing (even after we notified the front desk). Also, the cable in the hotel went on the fritz. But those were all of the problems that we had. The mini fridge was stocked with beer, water and soda daily. The food at the buffet was fine. There were plenty of veggies and fruits. The fish entrees were especially tasty. We really liked the a la cart place, too. We ate there 3 times. At the suggestion of other reviewers, we had the lobster. It really was good! The walk to the beach wasn't bad for us (we are both in mid 30s), but it is so hot in the middle of the afternoon. Since the hotel doesn't have a fitness room, we never took the shuttle so as not to feel so bad about what all we consumed! The walk is about 8 minutes. There were a couple of issues that we had though with the beach club. 1). There is no food there. Just tortilla chips and cheese sauce. Now that is yummy, but not exactly lunch material. So, just plan on either walking back to the hotel, or finding a place to eat, or having pina coladas for lunch! 2.) The club stops serving drinks at 5 p.m. A little on the early side to us! On the positive side, the beach bar was never busy and there were plenty of palapas and chairs. Perfect for us! We can't comment on any tours or excursions, as all we did was lie at the beach and relax. Overall, we had a nice time here. It's one of those cases where you get what you pay for. But we didn't pay a lot, but I think the place is nice enough and the food and drinks were good.

My husband and I just returned last night from a trip with 3 high school graduates. We had booked 2 doubles and a single. When we checked in, they offered to upgrade us to a double and a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite with a living/dining area, a small kitchen and 2 balconies. at no extra charge. That was 518, and the double was 314-A. The gardens are so pretty, I didn't miss a view of the beach. The hotel is older, but you can see the improvements being made all the time. The rooms are not huge, but certainly large enough, with great use of space. No bathtubs, just showers, but that was fine with us. Every room has a little refrigerator stocked once a day with water, Dos Equis beer and soft drinks. Plenty of shampoo. conditioner and lotions are left each day. Our towel art included 2 swans with flower petals and a wishing well with a flower in it. The food was great! If you can make 3 teenagers from Alabama and 2 somewhat more sophisticated adults happy, you're doing it right. I wished for more fresh vegies, but there was always some. We ate 2 nights at Maria's (reservation only) and it was great. The grilled lobster ($15 extra/person) was absolutely out of this world. The kids had room service for lunch a couple of times and said it was really good. At breakfast and lunch there were always one or 2 grill stations for omelets, burgers, chicken, etc. Good variety and good food. The drinks were plentiful and as strong as you want them. The cup size was good. We didn't get out the cups we brought. There was no need. The house wine (Palacio del Carmen from Spain) was very nice. Red and white were both good and both were available all day and in the international room. This is a departure from most all-inclusives we've stayed in. The international room had table tennis, pool table, TV and a poker table. There were several types of liquor and mixers, beer and wine and deli style sandwiches, salads and desserts available 24 hours. And, also, the same type of coffee machine as in the lobby and the restaurant. Great cappucino, espresso and good, strong coffee. The beach (ask at the desk and they will tell you how to go the back way to the beach, then you can walk down to the beach club in the sand instead of the street) is great. A little rocky right in front of the bar, but you have plenty of it to choose from. The bar swings are fun and there is lounge chair service if you can't be bothered to walk 20 feet. There are kayaks to use there. We never used the shuttle, because the walk was very pleasant. We all wished the beach bar was open longer. It would be nice to watch the sunset on the beach with a glass of wine. Everyone working at the resort was freindly and helpful. Most of them spoke at least a little English, but we tried to speak Spanish at least some. We didn't have a single problem. Clean towels were always available. Big, heavy towels for the beach and the room! The location is wonderful. A small distance from the shopping and bars and all, but not in the noise and crowds. We walked into town every day. We had massages at Spa Itza (I would definitely recommend that!) One day, my husband and I walked to WalMart to get some extra beach shoes. It was about 8 blocks (big blocks!) from the hotel. It really wasn't a bad walk. The WalMart itself is worth seeing, with it's underground parking lot and liquor department. The shows were entertaining and early enough to watch and still go out in the evening. They are not professional, but they are amusing. You will recognize your favorite bartender on stage, maybe a waitress or 2. They work very hard at everything they do. We did find liquor to be as cheap at the airport as anywhere. It's easier to buy it there and add it to your carry-on rather than shlep it from the hotel. We never heard anything disruptive from our room. We couldn't even tell we had neighbors. We were on a Vacation Express package, and I can tell you it was perfect. The planes were on time, the transportation from the airport in Cancun to the hotel was on a large, comfortable bus with a bathroom and a cooler of Corona. It was all awsome.

Our luggage was immediately collected by the Bell Boy and we were taken to the reception desk to check into our room. We recieved a refreshing drink immediately. My husband asked for an upgraded room and we were given one immediately without any extra charges. We were wisked off to our one bedroom suite where we dropped off our luggage and wipped down to the beach. I was a little dissapointed that the hotel wasn't beach front but after a day or two the quick walk was no longer an issue. After all a little excersice doesn't hurt anyone. The very next day we familiarized ourselves with our new surroundings. We found out that alot of vacationers weren't travelling to the area due to the Hurricaine. We never even gave it any thought. For the first week we sunbathed at the pool, which to me was a dissapointment as it was so small and the deck surrounding the pool wasn't large enough to accommodate many lounge chairs. In addition, it only had one entry and exit set of pool ladder. We ate at the buffet, which we found an extremely wide variety and tasty morsels. The drinks were endless and the service was excellent. Wait staff would clear your eating area immediately of empty plates, gasses etc. We were very impressed that you could book an A-la-Cart dinner every day by noon at the reception desk. We ate A-la-Cart 3 times during our stay. Room service was offered on a once daily basis and of course we took advantage of that as well (draw back to ordering by phone is limited knowledge of english at the receivers end). We walked to WalMart (I was shocked to see a regular store) for more summer clothes. We galavanted down to 5th Avenue, which is the main shopping strip. The only negative comment I can make is that the shop keepers would try to haggle you into their stores (real pain in the your know what). After a while we stopped walking down 5th Avenue or make up an excuse that we were leaving that afternoon so they would stop bothering us. We took a tour of the Royal Porto Real Playa del Carmen. The suite shown was georgous!! But I honestly found the facility too large for my liking. The foyer was really too large and you couldn't have a private conversation. Perhaps that's why it was pretty empty. I loved the 24 hour service room. It was air conditioned and set up pretty nicely. The pool area was very nice. And the Real Bazar was better than the other two facility Bazars and this is where we spent our $50.00 USD gift certificates for taking the tour. But this large facility just didn't have that personnal touch like the smaller one. Our tour laster longer than the scheduled 90 minutes and we went through 4 sales men and finally made it bluntly clear that we didn't make hasty decisions when making large investment purchases. During our second week we rented a small car for 3 days @ $35.00 USD per day through Americana and visited Xel-Ha. What can we say...you have to visit and make an entire day of it. It's truly Natures Wonder! We snorkelled and then tubed down the river. After which we walked the entire park and took video and photo's. We were one of the last couples to leave the park. Tulum was also quite remarkable. Xcaret should be an all day adventure don't forget to include the dinner theatre. This was a amazing and colourful show. Over 300 actors telling a story from past to present in costume, music and singing. We will be visiting alot more places next year. The town of Playa-del-Carmen is definately a safe place to walk. We've seen single people both male and female on vacation walking safely through the streets. There is alot of Police riding through the town and on the beach. The beach by the way is so clean and the water so clear. It was fun acting like a kid for a change playing in the waves as they sometimes swept you towards shore. Other days it was more calm and you could float on your back enjoying the sounds around you. Since it was a public beach, there was so much space for everyone. No over crowding what so ever. When we returned home on May 20th we've told our kids that we are going to return to Playa-del-Carmen next year for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and we'll be taking them along too. I personally love Mexico and both my husband and I really and truly loved Playa-del-Carmen and our hotel amenities. We timed our vacation well because on the Friday before we left to come home a bus full of about 20 boys had just arrived. Thanks for such a relaxing time and wonderful weather.

The hotel grounds are lush and very well kept. Beach club was great as well - usually no problem getting a beach chair, and the bartenders keep the drinks flowing. The shore itself is a bit rocky right there, but we wore surf shoes and had no problems in the water. If you want, you can just walk 3 minutes up the beach (on the other side of the pier) and the shore is much nicer. This hotel isn't fancy, but it's not a budget hotel either.

Many stores on 5th Ave stay open until about 10 p.m., and there is an abundance of streetside cafes, bars, etc. Seems like it would be a hassle to go into town in the evening from one of the all-inclusives outside of PDC, as you'd always be paying taxi fares.

I am not complaining about the stairs I just want people that have a tough time with stairs that you may have to walk a few. Pool was OK with limited seating around it. Lots of nice people when we were there from everywhere. A lot from Europe and Canada and a few from the US.

Police every few blooks or so were nice to see, they were friendly. Beach was nice and had some waves while we were there. Some people say all the beds are hard as rocks in Mexico but I would call ours firm. We had 6 pillows and slept like babies. The weather was in the 80's and the room has an airconditioner which is the window kind.

We didn't like the coffee, however. Yes, there is construction going on but there appears to be that everywhere. It never woke us up. We loved our room (317B) and could see the ocean and Cozumel (had to climb 3 flights - didn't bother us). A/C worked and room was fresh and comfortable. Mini bar was always restocked. Towel animals left daily by the maids! There is a shuttle to the beach but we liked the 10 minute walk along the shops. Nice beach club, lots of chairs and shade. You can get drinks but only basic snacks. Entertainment guys were a lot of fun organizing volleyball, horseshoes, salsa dancing at the beach. Pool was nice - usually quiet. This is a small hotel. It's more like a \"boutique\" hotel but with more free food and drinks. It's not a 5 star but I would rather stay here than out in \"resortland\". Fun entertainment shows every night. I would recommend this resort if you like to venture out from the resort to experience the area. Due to the savings, we felt we had the freedom to eat out, but we enjoyed our meals in. Our tour company was Nolitours and their rep, Genevieve was very helpful at the resort. I would go back - however, I wouldn't take my kids. Not many young kids there, no kids program. They just opened the New Lobby and they make drinks right there while you check in or wait for your bus to leave. **While we were they, they offered to move us to the Gran Costa Real in Cancun for 3 or 4 nights if we wished - all at their cost. They are trying to get people back there since Wilma. If this interests you, ask.

I paid $750 including airfare for this AI for the week of October 14-22. Sure, we had to leave early because of Hurricane wilma but it was great while it lasted. The master suite was a series of 4 rooms. A sitting area next to the walkout balcony had a nice coffee table and two comfortable chairs. On the balcony were two sturdy wrought iron chairs and it overlooked lush landscaped lawns . We could see the pool and the restaurant from our room. As you walked thru the hallway of our room, there was a mini fridge stocked with beer, water, v8 juice, coke & sprite. Then you entered a living area with a sleeper sofa and a closet with a safe. The bathroom was adequate with a shower on one side of the living area and on the other side was a bedroom that held a king size bed with very firm mattress (I'd say Hard) with lots of pillows. No dresser or closet but a built in vanity and a television set. No clocks and no hairdryers in this room. The food was outstanding. I had stayed at the reef coco beach in January and had been very disappointed with the AI concept. The food had been so food service oriented and was the same buffet daily. The service was so so but no one ever offered you a drink or extras. What a change in this hotel. I had planned to blow off the food because the price was so cheap but to my amazement...I was timing the meals so I'd be back to check them out. The breakfasts had a great grill with custom omelettes or eggs, pancakes, french toast...you name it plus quiches, casseroles, cereals & fruits along with breakfast meats gallore. Lunches were always different. One day, hamburgers & french fries from the grill with salads and ohter entrees...always fresh fruit & desserts...Dinners were super with beef, chicken, fish, & pork every day fixed differently. Theme nights of Mexican, Italian, German, etc. The waitresses tried so hard to please always keeping the water glasses filled and asking to bring bar drinks. We left $1 tip every meal and you could see great appreciation . The hotel did have a 24 hour coffee bar but that part I wasn't impressed by. The room seemed a little dirty and the snacks seemed to be left overs. But each morning when I would get up at 5am and go down to the restaurant, they always welcomed me to come get fresh coffee in the restaruent and drink it out by the pool. Even though this resort is rated as a 2 star...I'd give the food a 4 star. The buffets were always well decorated with fruits and vegetable carvings and the chefs wore chef hats and the place was immaculate. They aimed to please. I went to the sister hotels beach club \"Porta Real\" and they were very accommodating. We had a margarita on the beach there. They were very nice to us and were playing bingo in the afternoon. The Real Playa had great entertainment too although, I go to bed early and rise early so entertainment wasn't on my menu too often. Give this place a try. Its off the beach so the hurricane probably didn't hurt it too much. In fact they were evacuating the Porto Playa and Royal Playa to the Real Playa so that tells you about its safety factor.

As i just have returned from Mexico my experience is still very fresh. First of all, funny thing is that most of the real playa reviews come from americans,which i haven't seen many of on the hotelgrounds. Most of the guests are italian and dutch. It is that we have such low standards in our european countries that we are so easily pleased? Don't think so.. Real Playa is a member of the Real group and have connections with member hotels in Playa,such as the Porto Real hotel (where i have been a few times visiting friends who stayed there during my vacation). Although Real Playa may have a star less, it is not so noticeable. For example the food. I had dinner with my friends in their Porto Real hotel and if i compare the 2 kitchens i see little difference. Real Playa has a buffet which offers enough choice. Everyday 2 of 3 kinds of pasta, potatoes in different kinds and rice. A choice of meat,chicken and fish, a fresh saladbar and 5 sorts of cakes and pies as well as fresh fruit for dessert. My room,a junion suite was spacious enough,kept well clean by the ladies of the housekeeping and had enough towels. Safety deposit box in the walk-in closet, minibar is filled every day and the tv has 40 channels to pick from, including HBO, Cinemax and Hallmark. And all the junior suites have a terrace with a private hammock which was highly appreciated. Although the pool was small (which didn't bother me at all as i went to the beach),it was clean and the water was clear. Enough seats around the pool for sunbathing and drinks are served upon request. The only thing which bothered me a bit was that the most of the staffmembers (especially the restaurantstaff) had little knowledge of english. As my spanish is not that good, to say the least, it might be handy for the management to have their staff taking english lessons so guests can have more conversation with the staff than only drinkorders.

We had originally stayed at the RIU resorts (RIU Tequila) then decided that we wanted to extend our trip one more night but unfortunately RIU was sold out so we decided to give this one a try! HUGE MISTAKE! TALK ABOUT NIGHT AND DAY!!!!!!!! We liked the RIU TEQUILA quite a bit but didn't realize just how much we appreciated it until we arrived at this hotel!

I would feel so bad for people trying out A/I for the first time at this hotel and therefore I'm writing this review to spare future vacationers from making a huge mistake!!! Playa Del Carmen has a wide range to offer different types of travelers whether they are seeking a cute boutique hotel where they can make their own choices for dining on 5th St. to those who prefer to be pampered and go all inclusive on their vacations. If one is seeking all inclusive for the first time, please don't ruin it by experiencing it here regardless of how much they are on a budget! It would be so much better to just go EP in a cute hotel and pay for food then have to eat /drink here just for value! THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!! NO CHOICES, Not fresh, just plain YUCK!!!!! Much better value to pay for your own food and not go inclusive! Sorry to have to mention this again but for just a little more, if anyone wants to experience A/I, GO TO THE RIU properties!!!!!!!! You stay in one hotel and have access to 4 other properties where food is plentiful in variety, good service where guests are #1, and grounds, facilities, pools, room are so much more enjoyable!!!! One's idea of A/I would be ruined at this property!!!! In another words : Sure you get what you pay for but PAY a BIT MORE and stay away from this place!!!!

You're in MEXICO!!! This IS a budget hotel.... the food is just ok....drinks were just drinkable.....BUT The staff is VERY friendly (Hi Allen and Juan!) the rooms are clean (small), maids were great (please tip)the grounds were beautiful and the evening entertainment triplets (two Italian girls and their Mexican MC) knew how to get the party started every eve! I won a bottle of tequila and a t-shirt!!! ;0) We were like the only Americans there. Most of the guests were from Italy. The hotel is about three blocks to the beach, and a shuttle is provided. Walking takes about 10- minutes.They allow you to use a small section of their facilities (Real Beach Club) on the beach, which has beach chairs, massages, drinks. 5th ave starts next street over and is about a 30-45 minute walk to get to the other end by the pier to Cozumel and Senior Frogs. In the evening, the walk provides lively entertainment, good food, and great people watching. Saty at this hotel and spend your money on the sites. Be warned......if someone acts like they want to help you, it's a trick.....they want you to see their time share. Listen if you like, we did and got many trips next to nothing. (Chitchen Itza, Tulum/Xel-ha, X-caret) for $120 a piece including transportation by luxury buses, meals, and drinks. We took a ferry over to Cozumel one day, and spent the afternoon snorkling in beautiful clear water. snorkle was $25 and can be purchased before or after you get on the ferry. Ferry was $9.00 each way. All in all, we had a great trip and wouldn't change anything for the world. We will come back again and again. Be glad you are staying in Playa, we took a city bus ($4.00) to Cancun and the difference was night and day. Playa is much closer to all of the fun stuff and at a fraction of the cost. btw.... our hotel was $120 a night all inclusive for two people! (YOu will spend more than that in a day in meals alone).

The place is spotless, rooms have adjustable air conditioning, tv set and radio. Master rooms have a small porch with a hammock in addition, ideal for jet-lagged early mornings. Yet there are no safety boxes, and using the lockers at the reception is a bit complicated (you need to sign in, and sometimes queue up a little), but still manageable. The pool is small but relaxing (see photo), and good for cooling down when the sun becomes too hot. Food and water are safe. There\u2019s a large and nice buffet restaurant serving international cooking, including Mexican dishes, which I found really good, far better than the small \u00e0 la carte restaurant (you can give it a try, but keep your expectations low and remember and you need to reserve seats). There's also a 24-hours snack place, which is very convenient in case you happen to miss lunch or dinner time for some reason. The staff is truly friendly and helpful. We happened to leave a handbag behind at the restaurant one night, and they found it and kept it safe in the office for us to claim it. The hotel is quite far from the beach club, so you need to take the free shuttle or walk for about fifteen minutes. You can also use free bikes. Remember that the day becomes really hot around noon, so make sure you have proper transport, or be prepared for a walk under the sun. The Quinta Avenida is definitely close, as the brochure says, just a small walk. Once again, the quinta avenida is a long road, and you may want to use a bike, or take the shuttle to reach the center, or be prepared for a walk under the sun. Avoid the Internet cafes on the Quinta, unless you want a crowded and expensive experience (which you may actually want, in fact), there's a cheap and air-conditioned Internet cafe near the hotel, just next block on the same road (1 and a half dollar for one hour). The beach club is a bit crowded, and there aren't many umbrellas, but the atmosphere is still nice. There's a toilet, a shower, a bar with drinks and small refreshments, and the staff provides free body-boards and kayaks. I've heard the beach club used to include also the beach on the left side of the pier, but as they're building a new hotel right behind there, they've closed that part of the strand until the new hotel is ready. Anyway, the beach has white sand, the sea has nice waves of intense turquoise, so in general I do not share the complaints I\u2019ve happened to hear or read. To sum up, I've enjoyed my stay at the Real Playa, in particular the relaxed atmosphere, nice staff and really good cooking. The only flaw, music.

Only one window AC unit unit to cool the entire suite. After the first day we got accustomed to it so no big deal. Clean. Ample towels. Tip your housekeeper and get extra stuff.

My advice go back to your room and order room service if you didn't make the reservations for the restaurant. Pool: small but will cool you off if you're really hot. watch out for the nasty suntan oil floating at the surface. Why are you at the pool anyways...go to the beach.

Enjoyed it very much all three times. The resort may not be directly on the beach but the beach club is a short walk or a bumpy bus ride away. The beach is gorgeous and the water is clear and warm. In December 04 there was construction of a new resort next door which will likely go on for some time yet, causing some disruption. Another thing we missed from the first two visits were the grass palapa's on the beach, they were blown out by the hurricane season in 04 and have been replaced with umbrellas which aren't quite as nice. Although the resort is not perfect there are many advantages to staying here, which is why I've been three times. First, you can walk out of the hotel at any time you choose to visit the town of Playa which by far beats the resorts that are set off by themselves. I don't like having to rely on shuttles just get off the grounds of these resorts! Secondly, there are no strict dress codes for dinner which I enjoy as I dress up for work and do not necessarily want to do so while on vacation! The food at the resort is very good, but not first class. You would get tired of the selections if you are going for more than one week. Lucikly there are many good and reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance. The staff, especially the \"animation team\" are extremely good, especially Niss who speaks at least seven languages. The night entertainment is a bit cheesy but can be fun if you participate. The rooms are clean but the beds and pillows are hard. Also, don't get caught up in taking tours out of the hotel lobby, too expensive and you spend alot of time picking up other people from different hotels. On Ave 5 in the town of Playa, walking distance, you can get a bus that will take you anywhere you want to go, Cancun, Xel-Ha, Tulum, etc. for approximately $4.00 US. The public buses are like greyhounds complete with washrooms and tv's and are extremely reasonable in comparison to tours. I have taken the buses, walked from the town of Playa to and from the hotel at all hours of the night and day, and even rode a bicycle into the poor neighbourhoods without any problem. The people are extremely friendly and I often felt safer there than at home! I would highly recommend Real Playa for everyone, other than those people that insist on everything being first class.

We are middle income folks who both work full time. We understand that we are going to a different country and that it belongs to them, not us! Our expectations at this resort were most certainly met and were exceeded. We had a ground floor with a lovely patio door leading to our private patio including a bistro set and hammock for two. I thought the room was large, and it had a living room area with a couch. There are lovely well-groomed grounds offering foliage, trees, and the pool area. The pool was a bit small, and no swim up bar. The pool was often vacant. The rooms were very clean (a bit old, but not a problem) typically there was turn-down service and the cleaning staff made different animals daily out of towels, which created a pleasant atmosphere. The beds were a bit hard but we both slept well. We left a $1.00US tip for the cleaning staff, and one needs to remember that even a $1.00 goes a long way in Mexico. We occasionally tipped the bar tender and waitress, although they most certainly do not make you feel like they are expecting a tip. Tipping is optional. The location was prime, close to 5th avenue and although there was a shuttle to the beach we only took it once because we preferred to walk. It is true there is construction at the beach and a bit of jackhammering but the beach in front of the Gran Porto Real is rocky. If you venture further past the Gran Porto Real the beach gets more rocky and has a marina.

We ate once at the a la carte restaurant and found it to have similar flavors to the buffet with added ambiance. We ventured out on 5th ave and ate at a Mayan restaurant which was very good. I read on tripadvisor that the bar to go to was the Blue Parrot, and that is true. There was fire juggling, and music which played well into the night. Not a significant amount of English speaking people, but this was not a problem as we managed to meet several English speaking couples that we spent some time with. We were told that 50% of the resort is occupied by Canadians however, there is an international flavor here, which in my opinion only adds to the ambience. Hooray to the Animation Team including Ness (who speaks at least 7 languages!!), Auridi, and George who got guests involved. One night we went to the bar at the Real Playa del Carmen and they were playing bingo too cheesy for us, so we simply went to 5th Ave not a problem. We did have one night with some very loud/rude Italians however, Ness was able to control them and involve everyone without incident!! We took one tour which was a catamaran and went snorkeling. The tour was to last half a day and lasted three-quaters of our day but again not a problem because I was on vacation, no need to stress! Just a note, a Mexican minute is equivalent to approximately one hour. Mexicans do not have the hop-to-it ideology that North Americans have, and I can appreciate this on vacation. We had no problems at all. At first we were concerned about the water but all resorts have purified water, and we frequently filled our water bottles and had no Mexican poopies due to water or food. There were very few children under 10 but some teenagers. I cannot speak to the young children activities but the over 10 yr crowd had fun playing volleyball and enjoying the beach. I took a spanish dancing lesson, and enjoyed volleyball. There are a few topless women on the beach but I understand it is not legal but the police did not enforce this during our stay. This is a great place to come for a week to relax, enjoy the beach, the beach club (they make fantastic banana mamas and pina colodas!). One improvement would be to offer hamburgers/hot dogs at the beach club but we made due with a large breakfast and pina colodas for lunch! My advice... go and enjoy if you want a moderately priced vacation at a \"middle of the road\" resort that is clean, enjoyable with very friendly staff always willing to make your vacation enjoyable.", "Date": "January 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary AB", "Title": "\u201cJust got back on Jan11/05->not great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3013831", "Content": "We returned from the real playa del carmen on Jan 11/05, and have to say if it were not for the location of this hotel, it would NOT be worth it! The hotel is alright, rooms are a bit small but OK for two people...we requested 2 double beds but apparently all they have are king sized beds so we had to share...NOT accomidating this way..but relatively clean. The food is bad. NO selection at all, and same menu repeated each day for each meal. We ate at the a la carte resteraunt one night and I got food poisioning an hour later and was up all night throwing up.......not fun! The entertainment AND BAR(which was the WORST part) closed at 11pm!! I have stayed in this area before at larger/nicer resorts and the bars were at least open till 2am! Not everyone is older and has children to go to bed at 10pm! The so called \"24hr snacks\" are old sandwhiches that are in a mini fridge that u can chance eating whenever your hungry! But thats it! The beach was beautiful! The beach bar was nice, but construction to the new REAL resort next door made jackhammering ALL day except on Sun! Now, the location was great. 5th AVE is like 10 min walk away, to shop and hit the night life (since no where to entertain past 11pm on the resort). The staff was in general friendly, but spoke very littlle english as it is a mostly european resort (very rude italians everywhere!!). However, housekeeping was knocking at the door a few times at like 7am!! And they don't speak english to tell them to stop!! SO, all in all, I would not recommend this resort, if u want the location, maybe try the Porto Real further up 5th ave right on the beach, which is a 4* resort. It is really worth it to pay the small amt. extra!!", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cIt was great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2883798", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend went all the way from Sweden to Mexico in November 2004. We stayed at hotel Real Playa del Carmen for 2 weeks and it was great. The good: All the staff were good and especially the maids (cleaned up the room perfectly), waiters, animation team (the italian ness was crazy but also very funny and nice, I can only say arriba, arriba, arriba). The beach was beautiful and the bar at the beach was perfect when you wanted to drink water, beer or a drink. The water was about 28* Celsius so it was nice to jump in to the ocean. The bad: The food at the hotel was not so good, we ate breakfest there every day but lunch and dinner we only ate 2 times. It was so cheap at the restaurants in town so we ate there instead. So the next time we go to Playa we will not have all inclusive. One other thing that was bad was the few tourists (especially the old ones) that complained on everything. At last something that you have to do when you are in Mexico and Playa: 1) The snorkleling at Playa was ok but if you really want to see something nice you have too snorkel at Akumal (turtles), Soliman (great coral reef) and of course the cenotes (crystal clear water and beautiful stalagtites and stagmatites) 2) You have to visit Chichen Itza and climb the \"El Castillo\". 3) You just have to try the real mexican food at a local restaurant, it\u00b4s the best. 4) Don\u00b4t buy the cheap tequila, buy one that is reposado or anejo, you can buy a bottle for 200-300 pesos in one of the larger supermarkets (San Fransisco or Cedraui).
