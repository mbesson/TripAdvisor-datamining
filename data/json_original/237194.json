The bed was confortable , and the room was kept clean and tidy .The bathroom was small, but it did have a jacuzzi , which was rather pleasant. The complimentary breakfast was nice , there was never a problem to get a table during our stay at the hotel. We had drinks at the hotel's bar a couple of times , a nice place to relax before dinner. The hotel's location is perfect , just a short walk from the Termini Station ( if you take the train or bus from the airport) and you can also get a guide tour on a bus from that area. The TV had plenty of channels in 3-4 languages , and the complimentary wireless worked well both on my Iphone and laptop. There were plenty of restaurants in the area , we had dinner in one right next to the hotel and it was nice to experience local tasty food . We took a taxi to Fiumicino Airport (booked via the hotel for 40 Euro) The only negative thing worth mentioning in the hotel, is their tiny elevator , that is so slow that it would make a turtle look like speedy gonzalez ! I would have no problem to return to The Alpi on my next vacation in Rome, can recommend it to everyone !", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice place with its own charm, the service makes it excellent.\u201d", "Author": "Travelingwtoddler", "ReviewID": "UR127865427", "Content": "Very nice and clean place with excellent service.

He also gave us local restaurant recommendations and helped us choose train/bus times. The room was good. Clean and not tatty as some people have said. Not too noisy, despite being 1st floor and above the hotek entrance. Bathroom was fine, but shower screen didn't seal properly so water went everywhere - more likely to be a problem for the hotel over time than any guests. Also towels were changed every day, even though we didn't want/need that! Breakfast was OK, and in continental style. It gets a bit samey after a couple of days, but that can't be helped. The waitresses in the breakfast room never once asked us whether we'd like tea or coffee, but seemed to ask the native Italians that somehow... didn't bother us though - we told them what to get us.

Only 1 of the 3 rooms had been refurbished, and it was certainly the best room. It had been decorated in a modern way with fabric walls rather than grubby & scuffed wallpaper, and a black & white bathroom. In our room the shower (which looked impressive but didn't work properly) was seperate to the toilet and sink. It was a very strange set up - the shower basically opened up in to the bedroom. There was also not enough space in the room with the toilet as you couldn't sit on it properly! You had to sit at an angle, very poor layout. Bedding was clean and the bed very comfortable, especially after long days wandering around the streets of Rome. Soundproofing isn't good, and we were woken up a few times throughout the night from noises outside. Breakfast was very good - usual hams, cheeses, breads, cakes and pastries, a great selection and very tasty too. Overall, I am confused by this hotel.

I really liked the design of the hotel \u2013 a successful mix of old and modern at the same time. The hotel and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. Our quadruple room with a balcony in 3rd floor was beautiful and spacious enough for a pleasant stay for two adults and two children (9 yrs and 13 yrs). Absolutely great bathroom, very up to date. Greatly attentive and friendly staff. Good location near and at the same time conveniently far from the Termini Station (approx. 5 - 10 minutes walk). There are lots of restaurants, ATM and a supermarket nearby. A lovely patio for the hotel guests to sit outside and relax e.g. in the evening after exploring all day the great attractions of Rome. The breakfast was abundant \u2013 plenty of everything, a perfect way to start the day. There are lots of stairs in the hotel and the elevator is tiny and quite slow, so this hotel might not be the best choice for handicapped persons or families with baby carriages. Free WiFi is a nice extra plus. The weather in Rome in October was warm and sunny and the attractions were not too crowded, it was a perfect time to visit Rome.

My wife and I arrived in Rome on 12-03-2011 and stayed at the Hotel Alpi, where we earlier made reservation for a room. Unpleasant situation occurred on 18-03-2011, the night before the checking out from the hotel. We began to pack our baggage, and accidentally found out missing of a dress. We repeatedly checked our room, remembered when we saw a dress last time or could we accidentally leave it somewhere (on arrival at the hotel during the day my wife tried this dress). After that the dress was put back into the package in the closet next to the other bags. Upon detection of loss I had dialed the reception. Only after the 3rd call receptionist sent the housekeeper upstairs, who made a visual inspection of a room. The next morning we went for breakfast through reception to inquire the exact status of our complaint. Receptionist arrogantly talked to us, not wanting to understand the situation, pretending nothing had happened. To my statement about contacting the police in case of not finding a compromise, it was said that you can go directly to the police department and nobody would even begin to investigate cloth missing by non-resident. After repeated requests to contact general manager of the hotel my call was transferred to her, who said that robbery is absolutely impossible at this hotel that she trusts \"his girls\"). I offered a compromise - pay us back spent amount of 175 Euros (strictly on presentation of a check) to settle a conflict situation, to which received refusal. There's no book of registrations of customer requests in the hotel, the hotel operates solely for gaining profit, not for customer service. Immediately after the eviction, we called police, and due to impossibility in Italy to start investigation by phone we went to the police office to write statement for theft investigation. In the end, we stood in a queue for about 2 hours and because of the departure of Eurostar train from Rome were forced to leave. We decided not to spoil our vacation and not to spend half a day on the institution of a case of robbery in another city in Italy. We believe that the hotel does not match its rating. A person who lives in a 4-star hotel should not worry for stealing things! Work of the hotel must be built with the implementation of the mandatory principle of \"customer is always right\" No representatives of the hotel have not said its regrets or whatsoever in our address. From which it is concluded that the theft at the hotel is a normal phenomenon, which is part of the business. Upon checking out payment was made, and no one even said goodbye to us. I contacted with major agencies/real estate brokers in Moscow for the sale of tours/booking hotel rooms in Italy for advice and even inquiry to cancel any cooperation with Alpi Hotel. This review will be posted in their database, which greatly affects the rating of the hotel. Notice to all Rome visitors - stay away from this hotel, do not spoil your vacations! I can assure the management of Alpi Hotel that actions to the protection of my broken rights will not be limited to this. PS. The ridiculous thing is that upon arriving back home I received an email from Alpi Hotel robot with the offer for additional 5% discount to our further staying.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Service\u201d", "Author": "rlg67", "ReviewID": "UR93824219", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in December and had multiple issues with it from the outset.

Absolutely no sound insulation between rooms and was extremely loud. I complained to reception who managed to get the guest next door to turn it off but we then had to endure the guests arguing until 2.00am. We were then woken again at 6.15am to the guests having sex. I am not talking about us just managing to hear them, it was as if they were in our bed it was that loud. I would expect some level of sound insulation between rooms considering they are supposed to be superior rooms. I complained to the reception in the morning and we were moved to a new room. 3rd night - woken up to due to being extremely cold as the heating system was not working. Phoned reception to request additional blankets at 6.15am but no one would answer! I complained again to reception and asked for the manageress. Was told that she would be there in the afternoon to talk to us. When we went back to the hotel in the afternoon, as soon as we walked through the door the manageress and one of the concierge disappeared. The other concierge told us that they had given us a 10% discount and they would waiver our 9 euro bar bill. When I asked to speak with the manageress I was told she would not meet with us as she was now in a meeting despite being assured in the morning that she would meet with is. However, she would speak to the concierge on the phone when I tried to renegotiate the discount. We were told that there would be no negotiation on the discount and that we would have to deal with it. The concierge also admitted that the heating system for the whole hotel had broken. The whole attitude from the reception staff was appalling and represented absolutely shocking customer service. What sort of manageress is too scared to talk to her guests?

One morning we were completely overlook by one of the two waiting staff, it's self service so we didn't starve but we didn't manage to get any coffee!

The rooms are a bit small but their odd L shape make them seem more spacious than they actually are, and the entire hotel is very tastefully decorated in a romantic way. The location is quite convenient in the sense that it is near the station and many pretty good restaurants; it is not the fanciest neighbourhood in Rome nor the nicest to walk around in, but it is close enough to many of the sites (and you can easily take public transport). The rooms are very quiet, at least ours was as it was facing the courtyard. The above having been said, I didn't feel the Alpi was particularly great value for money. We paid EUR 185 per night; I guess that isn't bad for a 4 star hotel in the middle of Rome, but I noticed little things that made me wonder. The toilet, for example, was particularly cramped, and no matter what you did the floor was soaked after you took a shower. The breakfast buffet is decidedly uninspiring, and there are no windows in the breakfast room (there is in general a dearth of natural light in the hotel). The internet is not free. All this stuff probably wouldn't have bothered me if we had paid EUR 120 or 130, even 150. But after having paid 185, I was left wondering if it wouldn't have been better to pay 210 or 220 and got something much nicer. It's hard to say as I go to Rome very seldom and don't know the market, but all of this is worth keeping in mind.

I was a little disappointed with our room, but we were only there for 2 nights so we didn\u2019t complain. The room was extremely dark due to having no natural light as our window opened on to a very small court yard, which made it feel very claustrophobic. Also, our Air Conditioning kept turning itself off, even though the room was still hot. As noted in previous reviews, there are no English channels on the TV, but why would you visit Rome to watch TV, so this didn\u2019t affect us. Generally the hotel was clean and very tidy, and the staffs were extremely friendly. The breakfast was what I expected, continental foods i.e. hams, cheeses, bread etc, if you\u2019re expecting eggs and bacon you\u2019ll be disappointed. One main point I\u2019d like to mention is the fact the roof terrace is not available free of charge, maybe I re-read the information on the website, but I assumed this roof terrace had a bar area where we could have a drink and eat our breakfast, this was not the case. To have the privilege of using this terrace there was a service charge of EUR10. The location was not ideal, I\u2019ve visited Rome twice now and my favourite areas are Trastevere and the Pantheon, which is a good 30/40 minute walk from this hotel.

We looked at the website and reviews and felt like we had something to look forward to. We were not disappointed - I am not sure if we were upgraded but our room was spacious, clean and decorated to a high standard. Granted the bathroom was tiny but it was clean and servicible, with a shower/bath, loo, basin and bidet. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were not great - being feather my husband is asthmatic and this could be a problem for other people with the condition. You can't see in the photo but the furnishings were lovely mahogony and very elegant. The location was fine wih only a 5 minute walk to Termini station - also a bus terminal. Breakfast was continental style and it made a nice change for us to tuck into cold meats/cheese/toast/fruit etc rather than bacon and eggs! The only criticism I would have is that the hotel advertises airport shuttle and I was lead to beleive this was included in the rate. However, this cost 50 euro each way..... we took the train back to the airport - this was very quick and easy to do for 10 euro leaving from platform 25 at half hour intervals - I would not hesitate to use the train next time we visit Rome. I would stay at the Alpi again if I returned to Rome as we felt very comfortable there and it was lovely and peaceful at night with no noise from the street. As first time visitors to Rome we had to learn quickly as we only had the weekend so other than the above tip about the airport shuttle you may find the following tips useful. The Italian waiters are very good at getting you sit down and have coffee - make sure you check the price before you do - we got stung twice and it cost us 20Euro on once occasion for 2 coffees! I would not recommend the open top tour buses unless you have the patience of a saint! Virtually every stop means a 15 minute wait while the coach people drum up more business - take into account 12 stops around the city and this is a very long time! It is just as easy to use the number 40 bus which costs 1 euro ..... the tour bus cost 15 euro ..... Don't be tempted to be fooled by the tour guides outside the colleseum who will try and tell you its an hour queue to get in - the queues can look long but trust me we got through within 15 minutes - the english speaking tour guides are italian who speak broken english with a very strong accent .... we paid for this service and are still non the wiser .......probably better to get the audio guide. The vatican city is fabulous and shouldn't be missed - this is free entry and will take a few hours to see everything possible. The Michaelangelo and the cistine chapel are in the Vatican museum - this is not free and is about 1km from the vatican city - this is not free and costs 14 euro each. Finally Rome is very expensive but it is quite easy to cut back by using the snack bars rather than sit down restaurants. We ate out both nites in restaurants and dinner for two - starters and main with a bottle of wine was near on 100 euro each night - and we didnt go for the most expensive stuff on the menu ..... taking into account the exchange rate at the moment this soon adds up.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo", "Title": "\u201cOur family liked this hotel\u201d", "Author": "mahgee", "ReviewID": "UR25203253", "Content": "We stayed there 5 nights on FEB 2009 in a family room for four.

Following a recommendation in National Geographic Travel magazine, which listed Hotel Alpi as a lovely, Art Nouveau hotel near Termini station, I promptly went to Hotel Alpi's website to check it out. The photos showed rooms that appeared spacious, new (or at least recently renovated), charming, and tastefully decorated. I booked the \"Superior Room,\" which from the photos, looked to be a small suite. When we arrived at Hotel Alpi, we waited in a long line to check-in (there was only one desk attendant, but we easily excused this. After all, this is listed as a small, family run hotel.) The lobby looked like everything we could have imagined: gleaming white marble, giant Rococo tapestries and elegant overstuffed couches. When we entered our room, however, I thought there surely had been a mistake. There was nothing \"superior\" about this room; it was a standard hotel room. What's more, the room was a cramped, dark and musty cell with outdated deep green and navy blue furnishings trimmed with 1970s peuce yellow curtains. Awful! I went back to the desk to see if we had been given the wrong room. No, I was told, this was one of their best rooms and if I didn't like it, that was another matter. I mentioned that it didn't look anything like the room I thought I booked through the website (I wasn't expecting the fresh flowers and mood lighting like in the photos, but come on!) The quick-witted concierge told me that he too looked beautiful in photos. He said very humorlessly that he wanted to make me happy. If I would wait an hour, another Superior Room on the third floor would be ready. I went back upstairs to await his call, but it never came. My husband and I moved our own bags into the new room, which was little better than the first. This room had more light, but we lost the terrace that the first room had. It was just as small and dreary (monochrome grayish brown, simply hanging a painting in the room would have done wonders for it). The carpet looked stained in places and the furniture was overworn with scratches all over it. Also, we were told there would be a jacuzzi tub and there was only a standard tub in the cramped bathroom. It's also worth noting here that the lights kept malfunctioning in our room (they took 10 Euros off of our bill for this inconvenience). We also had to wait forever for the elevator and on the last day, it finally broke down altogether with my luggage in it. I feel at great pains to say something redeeming about this hotel so ... my husband told me that the breakfast was very good. But all in all, Hotel Alpi either needs to raise their standards or lower their guests' expectations.

There was a musty odor from the dirty carpet in the entry of the room. The next night we were moved to the back of the hotel to a much nicer triple with an extra roll-away bed. The room was more modern in design and had a small balcony overlooking the inner courtyard of the hotel. My teenage son and his friend were pleased with their small double room. It also overlooked the inner balcony and there was no trouble with the air-conditioner in this room. The liked the TV etc. My friend and her son were not pleased with their room.

The entrance looks like a cozy, pleasent residence. Entrance, breakfast room, living room, and terrace very well furnished and good taste in decoration. Fourth: Room is not big, but the confort and decoration WOW!!! For a 3 star hotel you could not expect better...Flat LCD TV with internet and video on demand, ultra modern WC with large shower massage, a/c, minibar, hairdryer, safebox,etc. Fifth: Breakfast...i would give a 4 out 5.

Lots of research beforehand, and I am really glad I chose this Hotel. There were 5 of us ladies sharing one room, and I was worried it would be cramped, but it was okay. Room was lovely. It was fun chatting together before we went to sleep. There was a king size bed and 3 single beds. We had a shower and there was a hairdryer in the bathroom. We paid 220 euros for the room per night. There was a small balcony off both the bedroom and bathroom. One of the ladies was cold on the first night, so straight after breakfast, on our way back to our room, we asked for 2 extra blankets at reception and when we got back to the room, the blankets had already arrived. Room and bathroom were spotless. Staff on desk were very helpful and good fun. Breakfast was great with huge variety. We saw a few beggars and homeless, but not a lot, and no pickpockets.(though I am sure they were there.) There were gypsies sitting along the wall at Termini but they didnt bother us. After reading other reviews on Rome and the Termini area I was very worried, but was in fact pleasantly surprised. The only downside was, on our first night we ate at Restaurant Osteria(could be splelt wrong). The food was cheap but awful. It is situated further up the street from the hotel but on the opposite side. Avoid it!. Next night we ate at a restaurant just after Babbos. It was full of Italians and food was excellant. We would definitely recommend this Hotel and area. One of the ladies is planning to come back again soon to stay in this Hotel with her family", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton", "Title": "\u201cCute Hotel, Close to Termini, Graet Brekfast\u201d", "Author": "bubbagump07", "ReviewID": "UR5722283", "Content": "Stayed here in August. I loved the hotel. It was exactly what we needed. We booked directly with the hotel. Rate was decent in comparission to what oters were charging. The front desk was helpful. Room was above average. We had 4 people in a room so they added extra beds which made the room smaller than normal. However if it had been just the double bed, this room was fantastic. The brekfast kept us going all day. Some had said that the location is too far from everything to which I disagree. The trains lines only intersect at one area \"the termini\" hence this is a good location to go north south or east west. If you are someone that likes to be in the center of the activity then be preapared to pay the extra money for this convienience. Walking from the hotel to the termini, i agree you WILL come accross homeless people, etc but people this is REAL LIFE and a REAL CITY. Its nothing to worry about and if anything I felt like i was living in a real part of ROME as opposed to a Touristy area. We ended up walking a lot to the places we needed to go and also we took taxis and the metro. The combination of the 3 means of transport made life easy. I checked prices for decent hotels in the CENTER of the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. You get what you pay for and also you loose the ability to be at the axis of the transport hub. Going to Florence or other parts of Italy, then this Termini is where you will come eventually. Be on the lookout for pickpockets at all bus stops, they are in groups of 4-8 and are experts in how to distract you get away with your money.

The location was great...only a 15 minute walk to Termini. A supermarket was around the corner and there were several great restaurants right there...go to Babbo's if it's the only thing you do!

Amminities - Bars, restaurants and supermarket on the doorstep Rooms - We had a superior room which was very well decorated, clean and tidy Staff - Like most European cities they are friendly. However they are not as forthcoming as UK or USA staff so do not expect the same customer service. The staff were also helpful with suggestions of places to eat and visit Breakfast - Great, good selection but does not change all week Bad points Facilities - The hotel does not supply ironing facilities. Pack that travel iron!! Also no tea/coffee facilities so stear clear of the mini bar. So in conclusion I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

The shower was extremely annoying. It is intended for baths only, there is no shower curtain, and you have to hold the spout in hand, which really agitated my wife when it came to hair washing time. The service was standard, nice people at the desk that spoke English well. The breakfast was good, but after 6 days of the same things, it got kinda old.
