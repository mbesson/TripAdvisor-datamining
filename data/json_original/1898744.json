Little India is just that and may be more 'colourful' than other areas but it's not remotely unsafe. Plenty of cheap restaurants and nothing is far by cab or MRT.

Bathroom was nice, but again the actual toilet you couldnt properly sit down as your legs would be hitting the door so you had to position yourself another way.

When searching online for a decent priced hotel in a good location, Moon Hotel seemed to be the best value during high season. It was at least $20/night cheaper than Wanderlust which is just down the street. The bed was super comfortable, complimentary minibar was a nice touch, great wifi in the room, although you had to login every time you wanted to go online, and we had a chance to take advantage of the happy hour at least twice because we came back to drop bags off, change before heading out for the night, and it was a nice touch with very friendly service. The few minor things preventing this from being an excellent hotel is the smell that hit you in the face everytime you stepped out of the elevator onto the third floor. It smelled like something had flooded or gotten wet, and never dried completely. I think perhaps there was a sufficient level of mold in the air or in the walls, because my allergies were horrendous unless I took my allergy pills religiously. The smell did go away as soon as we were in our room fortunately, but it was kind of a slap in the face every time we got off the elevator. I would suggest re-carpeting or tiling the entire third floor would be necessary. Breakfast was decent, it was super busy, and it seemed like food seemed to run out more quickly than they got around to stocking. The first night we arrived, the in-room safe showed low battery so we were concerned that we would not have access to our valuables upon our return. When we went out that night, we advised the front desk staff, and they said they would advise house-keeping. When we returned from our night out, they had not made any changes. In the morning, I saw house-keeping in the hall, and she told me to call the front desk. I called, and they sent someone up, who unscrewed the battery door, jiggled the battery, replaced the door, and asked if that was okay. We tried the safe again, and saw the same low battery reading. We asked him to change the battery which I'm not sure why he just didn't do in the first place. We asked for a late check-out New Year's Day on the off chance that it would be possible on the last night, and they said it would be okay to check-out at 1 pm instead of noon. Then we received a call at 11:45 am advising us of the check-out time being noon. I told the front desk staff that we had been told that it was okay to check out at 1 pm, and she said she would check. She immediately called back and said it would be okay to check out at 1 pm. The hugest benefit to this place aside from the very comfortable bed was the convenient location to the Little India MRT. I think the staff just has to be a little more consistent with their customer service and our hotel experience could have been improved.

The budget and the fact it was rip-off time i.e. the Singapore grand prix forced me to look for affordable accommodation - as there were 6 of us. I looked at the Moon Hotel and read the reviews. Basically since there was little choice we came here but boy I am glad were weren't paying \u00a3300 per night elsewhere. I actually found the concept both cute and very practical. Sure the rooms are small and there is no window (at least 2 of the group did have one with a window) but it was very practical in its layout. Even those who say a case is a problem are exaggerating. A case can easily fit on the floor between the wall and the bed. And water going everywhere in the bathroom - well a shower screen would be nice but only messy people put water everywhere. And we found the staff really helpful. Our booking was slightly messed up by the online company but they worked through things. The free drinks and nibbles do exist - for the drunks among you can get 5 bottles of stella artois plus a further 2 cans of san miguel all for free. And breakfast was more than passable. We were there at 8. At most hotels if you go for breakfast at 10 you are struggling to get premium service. The big plus for me is that the moon is in the little india area and arab street and bugis are not that far away. I had forgooten those parts of singapore where there is some culture. There are two hawker stalls close by and tow quite reasonable supermarkets so everything you need. No need to go to Orchard Road unless you have loads of money. Buy a card to travle around and get it charged up. Don't buy one of those visitors passes they are a rip off. You have to pay a deposit for a card and charge it up. Short distances in the city cost about 80 cents per trip - a far cry from the \u00a34 per trip in London. You can get to the moon from changi by MRT although you need one change and then to Bugis.

I can only echo other posters comments about the size of the rooms. My room was supposedly 18 sqm but felt less, and there was no place to sit down apart from on the bed which was located on an elevated platform one-two steps up from the floor. The interior was kind of industrial chic, and I quite liked it. It's stripped down to bare necessities, but doesn't leave you missing anything. It was also very clean. The bathroom had a shower over bath and glass walls which may be a problem if you're sharing with someone you'd rather not be that private with. On a positive side, the bed was super comfy! Also, the room had an ipod dock and free drinks in a mini-fridge. The breakfast buffet was good, and every evening the lobby bar have a happy hour with a selection of free cocktails.

It was noticeably dirty, the bathroom was dirty, and it was quite obvious that the room has not been actually cleaned in a while. Their ventilation system is horrible because it would blow smoke from other rooms. They play music in halls and we could hear it through the closed door.
