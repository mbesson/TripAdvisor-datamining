Reviews looked generally OK but did warn of smallness of rooms. They were right, our room was tiny. When we asked if there was anything bigger they said not really althougn they would move us for our second night to something slightly larger. Actually our room was quite well appointed and comfortable. The decor was a bit dark for a small room. However the lighting was some of the the best I have witnessed in a hotel. Reading was easy, and that is not always possible. The en-suite shower room was again not large but well appointed and modern. There were several examples of loose fittings, loose/ detached handles and failed light bulbs in both the room and the en-suite. I reckon five minutes with a set of screwdrivers and a box of bulbs would have sorted the lot . The LG television was modern but unfortunaltly didn't work remotely because the handset was for a Philips! We got a new handset but only had a very limited selection of channels. There was no BBC1, BBC2, Channel 4 or 5. I set up the television for re-tuning and got the missing channels back. The concierge said he would do this in all the rooms. The situation is good, just a few minutes walk from Paddington one way and Hyde Park the other. The Hotel looks clean and smart from the outside, the staff could not be faulted. If you can stand the small rooms then it is OK. I marked it down for the small rooms and the lack of attention to detailed repairs of fittings and lights.

The bed went wall to wall and you had to vault over it to reach the other side of it (not that there was much point in doing this).

We checked into our room which, to begin with, had other peoples luggage in it. The Room was absolutly tiny, internet access didnt work and an absolute furnace!! It felt like i was holidaying in Spain with the heat!! After 3 attempts of the porter telling us there was no problem with the air conditioning and that he fixed it they finally decided to give us another room. This room, while cooler, was disgusting!! The bed had hairs on it and the bed linen had obviously not been changed. I actually regret paying for the hotel as it was one of the worst experiences of my life, and really did put a dampner on my holiday.
