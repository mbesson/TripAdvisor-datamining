Staff are great and helpful with the exception of Paola at the concierge desk, who was unwilling to give me a map and tell me how to get to Spanish Steps.

The breakfast each morning was outstanding and they were most accommodating for our young son. Our room was great, but it didn't have a kettle/coffee pot, which would have been nice. Nor do you get water every day (But you can get big bottles for one euro down at the hotel gym) The pool is adequate, but quite small. The location is very nice... walkable to most of the major sites and very close to the Villa Borghese. The hotel also arranged babysitting for us in the evenings.

Very nice bathroom in our room with double sink, nice walk in shower with sit and separate tub. Toilet and beday too. 2 single beds is all you can get, if 2 beds are needed. So, a bit different than North America that way. Turndown service offered each night. Quiet rooms. Ours looked into nothing more than a mechanical corridor or something. But, it was quiet. The downside to the hotel for me, really came with ordering room service. The card you can hang on the door for morning breakfast is not clear at all about the pricing. It tells you 2 main options (continental or American breakfast), it then lists the options you can choose from. Problem is, it doesn't say anywhere about items listed that may not be included, nor how much additional items cost. Hence, the way it reads is as if you can choose everything in a particular category for the price listed. The second problem for me was, the first 2 days I had breakfast delivered to the room, the fellow didn't bring anything to sign for it. Thus, I didn't know how much I was actually paying. It wasn't until the 3rd day that the room service fellow had a bill to be signed, and it was a bit of a surprise! In addition to the high prices and hidden additional charges for items, they charge an additional $5 euros just for the delivery itself. I know things aren't cheap Rome, but this is more a case of making things more clear on the menu itself. Not to mention, if you went down to the restaurant instead for breakfast, the items I wasa charged extra for, are included. Hotel is very pricy for sure. I was fortunate and got the rooms on Priceline for $215 USD a night. So, I really can't complain too much. Location is okay, but certainly not the best. Not too much very close. Train about 15 minutes, Spanish Steps about 15 minutes, a few really nice churches in the area, everything else at least a half hour walk or involves the train. The Hard Rock Cafe is within 10 minutes, and by far the best place to eat in my opinion. Food is really good and prices are reasonable. But, it can be very busy for these veery reasons. There are a ton restaurants everywhere, many even have pushy sales people on the street trying to get you to come in (even at the nice restaurants). In the evening time, there's almost no hope of getting any small snack items like pop or chips. Everything other than the restaurants close around 6 pm, and the hotels in the area (including this one) do not have any sort or store or snack machines. Pool is nice, and decent size for Rome. Many Rome hotels are small and have no pool. So, this is a bonus. No hot tub though, and be aware of the typical European bathers. Overall, the area is quite safe, hotel is beautiful and safe, staff are courteous, and rooms are large and very nice.

First time to Rome and what a beautiful city! However the hotel, we were in a deluxe suite which was dark poorly lit and frankly appeared to be falling apart with various cracks in the wall. The only redeeming fact was that the bed was comfortable. We chose the hotel as we were insistent we wanted somewhere in the centre of Rome and with a pool/spa. We used the pool once as it was freezing the spa was two rooms from what I could see and the staff were never helpful to supply towels or offer drinks. The concierge was another fact we had major issues with, their resturant suggestions were terrible. Poor quality local taverns when we'd requested an up market pizzareria. We booked tickets to the colloseium and were not informed of anything just given a confirmation number. We requested if we needed any other information eg a separate pick up point. Told just the normal stalls. We also booked a car from the airport to pick up my wifes parents, who speak no English or Italian, this is why we requested a car to pick them up. However we recieved a call asking where their car was and we were informed by the concierge that the car was still at the hotel. And was waiting to take them to the airport. We had the option of waiting for 40 mins for the car to reach them or speaking to a taxi firm ourselves that was close by. This resolution was not offered by the hotel. Our breakfast was also disappointing as we had to wait 15minutes for a table one morning as none were free, however what was obvious was that tables were free just staff were not clearing them. Frankly this experience has put us off the entire group and we will not be staying again.

Nothing wrong with the property per se', but my three star rating reflects the standard I expected for the money paid and reputation of the Westin. Rome is expensive in general, and the higher end props will be that much more, but the level of service is not reflected here. Room was a good size by european standards and was fairly well appointed, but certainly not special. Bed was very comfortable, TV offered some english but could have had a specialty chanel or two. Shower was decent, hot, and while not critical, had duel shower heads but one did not work. Not a big deal, but shows a lack of attention. Maid service was good. Generally no major complaints, but again, nothing special. Service was not up to par for one of the worlds major chains, and at $450 per night, service should be a differentiator, but was not. The doorman did not open the door once for me during my stay....now I'm sure many of you are saying well la-de-da,,,,,,you need a guy to open the door? Well no, but if you are going to have a doorman.......Front desk personal answered my questions, which I suppose is all I needed, but did not seem to be interested in actually going any further. I admit I was irked at the fact that they did not have ice machines...no problem as the front desk said just call room service. I did...four times....hey I enjoy a nightcap...don't judge. Anyway, that cost me 8 euros for the 4 trips - 2 per, not a big deal but ice should not carry a charge. At least let the guest know. As I said, we stayed three nights here. We stayed three nights prior at a different hotel, The Mascagni, also reviewed by myself, here on TA. They also did not have ice (yes I had a nightcap there as well) I had to go to the bar to get it but there was no charge. Much preferred that hotel and was less than $300 per night.

Being from NYC, I would describe the neighborhood as upper east side and Borghese as Central Park. But, if you want to get to anywhere of historic interest (except the Spanish Steps, which is probably 3/4 mile away), expect to hear the refrain from the Concierge or mostly anyone, \"take a taxi\". The nearest subway stop (Barberini) is 1/3 mile away down the Via Veneto, towards the bottom of this winding slope-like avenue. It can get a bit tiring if you want to use mass transit walking up and down the street to the central bus stops and subway station (learn to use the buses because they are the only way to get into the nooks and crannies of this city). The Via Veneto had its day (you'll see a lot of references to Fellini's movie \"La Dolce Vita\", which was filmed in the area) and is still quite nice but it is not central to most of the sites and scenes of Rome. Insofar as the hotel, the lobby is majestic and classic. The rooms are well sized with our king bed room (at the lower end of the room scale) probably 350 SF or so. Bathroom is walk-in and large. The rooms, however, do not quite match the lobby and common areas of the hotel in terms of grandeur but they are quite acceptable. They are a bit worn but, again, comfortable. Wi-fi, for my teenage sons, worked great (included in our room rate). We did not have breakfast but they have a nice continental b'fast for about 20 euros and buffet style one for 30 or 35 euros. We chose to eat breakfast at one of the local cafes on Via Veneto near the subway station with eggs, toast, coffee and juice (hey, we travelled with my kids) for about 10 euros. Expensive by US standards but welcome to the global economy. On a final sour note (addressed as much to the hotel management who may read this as any reader), when we arrived with our 4 relatively small pieces of luggage) we did not need the concierge to show us our 2 connecting rooms (and expect a tip) and then minutes later have not one but two porters show up with our one cart of luggage (each also expecting a tip).

I had stayed at another, much less expensive, literally around the corner from this one on my first day and found the two hotels very comparable. My advise would be to save your money from some great Italian meals and sights rather than staying at this overpriced hotel. The outside and common areas of the hotel are beautiful and well decorated. The rooms are average size for past Westins I've stayed at and my room was clean. Others have commented on the decor being outdated, the style of the hotel is somewhat older fashioned but don't take that to mean the furniture is unkept. The decor is just more classical than modern. The staff is not rude but is not friendly. The week I stayed I never had one person at the front desk greet me when I came in and the doorman actually opened the door for me exactly one time my entire stay. At breakfast that was included with the business group I went with, coffee was served at the beginning by waiters but often, about an hour before breakfast was to be closed, they were too busy cleaning off tables to bother with any service. Another let down was construction going on inside the hotel right outside our room. We stayed in a room on the 1st floor looking out at the U.S. Embassy. One morning, at around 9 or 10 which I guess I should be greatful it wasn't earlier, hammer started pounding right outside the door and lasted for about an hour. I was already awake but it's not very relaxing getting ready to go out with all that noise. Also, on two seperate dates (once at 2:30 am and the other time at around 8 am) a voice came over the speaker that is in every room about the beds saying to evacute the room due to a fire and to go out into the hall. Both times it was loud enough to wake me. Both times it was a false alarm that I had to call down to the front desk to figure out what was going on. There is no directory of numbers or even map of where stuff is in the hotel provided in the room so figuring out what numbers to dial when you've just been woken up isn't very pleasant.

The location is excellent for exploring Rome - we love seeing city by foot and did not use public transportation at all.

There are many restaurants, shops, etc in the immediate vicinity so it was very easy to find a place for a morning cappuccino and croissant or evening cocktail.

I walked into a small foyer filled with beautiful art, crown molding and amazing furniture. We took a right and I poured into the spacious round shaped living room. This place was massive! The room was overflowing in period furniture and art. There was a non-working fireplace, modern amenities like a Bang & Olufsen TV, and large picture windows overlooking Via Veneto. I didn't want to leave...but the tour continued! We went back through the foyer to the other half of the suite.

Fabulous. There are two other coffee shops another 50 feet from here...all good. We have been staying here for years. From the Westin we could walk or find our way anywhere easily. Taxi's were happily available to take us to/from the hotel from anywhere....different from the Hilton where the Taxi's previously gave us a hard time, going for a fixed rate..... Many restaurants are in the area...many of them excellent....I always wish I had more time to spend here. When we arrived there was a European conference of Banking professionals so there were mostly Europeans here. This was great was we enjoy the different languages and influences. Great people watching. Our room was fabulous as always, large, great bathroom, excellent sheets and bedding as well as turn down service and great pillows of all types. There were some dings but overall we thought our room as in the past was fabulous....This is a heritage hotel...anyone who expects new....should stay at a new hotel not a hotel that has been around for 80+ years...come on...you must be practical. This place is like a converted palace. Many people complain that \"for the price\" this hotel didn't measure up. Every time I read this I roll my eyes because certain cities are indeed expensive. Rome is one of those cities. When people expect \"American\" size rooms in Rome on points or discount rates through various travel based websites offering huge discounts...it is no wonder people negative feedback these large hotels. Unrealistic expectations are tough to meet for the best of businesses or hotels. This hotel has beautiful rooms overlooking the Via Veneto as well as basic rooms (read travelocity, expedia) facing an abandoned courtyard with little light and no view. It is no wonder many people who leave feedback have negativity....you DO get what you pay for here. This hotel has a GREAT location, excellent beds, and friendly service. If I had one complaint it would be that their Concierge desk should all be fired and replaced with some new blood who are all not on the take.....that said...firing employees in Italy is like in Greece...near impossible. Until then....I suggest you do your own research and ask for NO information other than a free map from this group....The faces have remained the same throughout the years (10+)and I am sure the commissions are shared. While I know many of their recommendations are good....I also know that after 10+ years of coming to Rome, much of what they recommend gets them a hefty commission and us a mediocre meal. Beware.

At that price, I could have a full meal later in the day and still have change. I would say that 90% of the guest in the hotel were American, everywhere I turned I heard American English, so it's easy to know that the staff were very fluent in English. The only real issue I had was when I ordered \"caffe\" they brought me a cup of American coffee, I told the waiter I wanted \"Normal Coffee\", got upset and 5 minutes later brought me an espresso that was cold.

However, 345 had a large wad of gum on the floor, and was about ninety degrees (30 centigrade). The a/c was not on or not working. We called down, to let them know that the room was not acceptable. They assured me that they would call back with an alternate room in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, I called down again and was told that someone was on their way to move us. The porter that came up did not speak any English (not an issue, if there were not any issues) and showed us to a room on the 6th floor, 3 floors away from our young children. Clearly, this was not acceptable, so we returned to the front desk, and they miraculously were able to find a room on the 3rd floor, 4 rooms away from our kids. No one was apologetic. The next day, we sat in the lobby for 15 minutes, trying to get someone to notice us so that we could order a drink. We finally decided to leave, as we were totally ignored. The following morning, we arrived to breakfast at 9AM. We were quickly ushered to the bar area, because we must have looked like we wouldn't complain that we were not able to eat in the regular breakfast room. In the bar, there was a limited selection, the tables were tiny, and again, we were ignored. The final straw came upon checkout, when the hotel decided that everyone should donate to Unicef. I have nothing against the charity, and am quite charitable. I simply don't want it to be placed on my bill without my prior approval. Additionally, we were charged daily for breakfast, which was to have been included in our exhorbitant rate (445 euros/room/night). When I told this to the blond clerk at the reception desk she said, \"Well, we all make mistakes. You can write a letter to the hotel manager.\" She was condescending and nasty. After a delightful stay at the Santa Caterina on the Amalfi Coast, this hotel could not have been more of a disappointment. I will recommend that none of my friends ever stay here. It's a Westin with a snobby Rome air.

(More Alpha than Ferrari.)\u201d", "Author": "Pramstroker", "ReviewID": "UR114407048", "Content": "When in Italy, my expectations are somewhat lower than other European countries. In Italy, it always seems a bit more worn, a bit more untidy, and people get to things when they can on when and if they choose. Same with the Excelsior. \"Recently refurbished\" but still somewhat worn. I should give them some slack because the hotel is in an old building. However, the baseboards are dinged, the molding has cracks, the furniture is scratched and marred, and the carpets are somewhat stained. But in Italy, I think \"refurbishing\" means putting another coat of paint over the old cracked paint and not \"doing it right.\" However, as the one-week stay progressed, my view point changed. Instead of seeing Rome as fading, worn, and crumbling I became amazed that - with so much \"old\" in the city - it's a miracle that everything is in as good shape as it is. Our room faced the inner courtyard on the fourth floor. Usually, I like a \"room with a view.\" No complaint this time. The streets around the hotel are very busy and noisy. So, for a good night's sleep, interior rooms are the way to go. The room was \"Rome good.\" It had the comfortable Westin bed, two sinks, and kind of looked like a room that you would expect if you stayed in a period palazzo. The bathroom was ceiling to floor marble and the water pressure and ability to control hot/cold was good. Irritations: The bathtub was too narrow. At 6'2\" - to maintain a safe, wide-enough stance while taking a shower, I had to stand sideways. And as with many hotels, the showerhead (dual) was too low. So, I couldn't stand with my back to the shower and tilt my head back to rinse my head. And the rail that you can hold on to was somewhat rickety. The solution was to use the separate wand shower head on the other wall. Speaking of which, as many hotels have gone more \"green\" and concerned with water use, this hotel has made no such effort. That can be good or bad depending on your perspective. However, the dual showerhead and toilet that sounded like it was using many gallons to flush used - noticeably - a lot of water. Other irritations: One day, I was lying in bed, naked, and someone from the maid staff just opened the door and came in. No knock. One night, I called room service and their was no answer. I called back and was put on hold and they didn't come back. I called again and they said they were very busy and would call back. All I wanted was a bucket of ice. I know, I'm in Europe, but in other hotels in other cities, I don't remember getting a bucket of ice to be such a big deal, especially in \"near luxury\" hotels like this. There are no ice machines on the floors and no ice waiting for you when you get back to your room. So, I went down to the front desk and asked for a bucket of ice. They called room service and was put on hold. About a half hour later, a bucket of ice was delivered to the room. Which brings to mind coffee. No near-luxury or luxury hotels have coffee makers in the room, right? Or very few. With this hotel, it is - as with many hotels - expensive to order coffee. The room service fee per person is 5 euros. So take the price of the coffee, the 10 euros, taxes, and you could rent a car for the day just for a pot of coffee in the morning. And actually, I don't mind paying that. What these hotels don't get is that people like me want coffee immediately when they get up in the morning. Being on vacation, I don't want to schedule it and \"have to\" be up when it arrives. And I don't want to order it when I get up and have to wait for it. Another couple brought their own mini-coffee maker from home. In a hotel at this price point, you shouldn't have to. In spite of the irritations, my wife and I did enjoy the hotel. Slow and few elevators non-withstanding, the lobby is expansive and ornate as are the hallways and the rooms. Like I said before, staying at the Excelsior is like staying at an Italian palazzo with air conditioning. Chandeliers, columns, gold leafing, marble, granite: all very nice. So, if you want a crisp, perfect, American-style hotel in Rome, this isn't the place for you. The hotel is located just a few blocks from the Aurelian wall and a short walk from many of the sites. The Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and the Pantheon are all very walkable. (I actually found a way to walk underground all the way from the metro entrance at Harry's Bar to the Spanish Steps!) The Hard Rock Cafe full of Americans is just a few yards away and the Via Veneto is considered the upscale part of the city to stay in. For getting around Rome, if you're thinking about renting a car, forget it! Take taxis or walk. Yes, the Italian drivers are as crazy as they are fabled to be and parking is impossible. Taxis are very reasonable, about 5 euros from the hotel to the Termini railroad station (but be careful, at the train station after a certain time, the cab scam goes into effect and they go \"off meter\" and try to charge you 25 to 30 euros to get to the hotel). Since every 10 yards there is something 500 to 2,500 years old, walking is the best way to see the city. Tour buses seemed hopelessly stuck in the traffic and the taxis are quicker only because most of them seem to aspire to be Mario Andretti. The hotel offers a chauffeur service to the airport in an S class Mercedes for 85 euros and a half-day tour of Rome for 143. Normal taxi fare to the airport is 40 to 50 euros depending on traffic. The train to the Termini station from the airport is 15 euros one-way per person. Note: coming back, there is a fare for 14 euros that takes you to a stopping point at the Termini station that is almost 2 kilometers from the main station. Don't take that one. The staff was polite enough but didn't seem particularly motivated to be pro-active. Sure, if you found them and asked them a question, they would be helpful but not overly so. The Spa staff was great. The 70 euro massage was well-worth it after many days of walking. Only problem is it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to put on the little string bikini \"panties\" that they evidently have men wear while getting a massage. :) Room service was a bit slow but the food was good. And expensive. There is a Despar market two blocks away where we stocked up on drinks and munchables. And when checking out, beware of the mini-bar charge for items you didn't eat/drink.\" We had a 12 euro charge and we never eat or drink out of the mini-bar. And almost every couple we talked to that were there with us had the same charge. It seems to be a trend. The last three stays at hotels have included mini-bar charges for items we didn't eat or drink. The W in Miami took it off but then it appeared on my credit card again. The same thing happened at the Ritz Carlton in Atlanta. I'm wondering if that is a part of \"Hotel 101\" training: add a mini-bar charge to everyone's bill even if they didn't go into the mini-bar. Maybe they figure that if \"X percentage\" of customers don't contest it and they retain \"X percentage\" of the bogus charges, then they will make \"X percent\" more revenue. Very tacky and I hate to think it's true, but it's been a constant and happened again at the Excelsior. One other item: internet. 4 euros for an hour and 15 for 24-hours. Still bugs me that for what one pays for a hotel like this, they don't include the internet. In conclusion - in spite of the irritations - I rate the hotel \"very good.\" However, if we go back to Rome, it wasn't good enough for us not to consider other hotels first. So, no, it didn't have that \"wow\" factor that makes me say, to myself and others, \"if I go back to Rome, I'll definitely stay there.\" Not a bad choice, but it's like Italian cars. Sure, Alpha Romeos and Fiats are okay but they are definitely not Mercedes or BMW.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cCOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NICER\u201d", "Author": "twinlions", "ReviewID": "UR114215298", "Content": "From check-in to check-out, this was a terrific hotel experience.

First Impressions: - classy, old world charm, expensive, first class - efficient, effective personnel This property attracted several Fortune 500 company functions while we were there and it's clear this is a landmark property. Rooms- we had an inner suite during the first stay- no view but what a pleasant surprise to stay in a city like Rome and not hear the traffic. we opened our window and had cool fresh air both nights. If you are staying here during the cooler periods and enjoy opening your window for fresh air, this room type will work for you. We still enjoyed privacy as the bed was offset from the window. - our second stay was on a balcony suite and this was probably in the top 5 nicest rooms I have ever stayed in my life. It really could be an apartment. we had to french doors and tons of room. If you are traveling for business and need a place for a meeting, this room would accommodate this and if you're a family- this is worth it. Downers- we're coffee junkies from the Northwest. We want it hot, plentiful and early. You won't get that here. If you're staying over 3 nights- you'll do well to bring your own mini Mr. Coffee and leaving it behind because coffee in the restaurant is $$$$$. And when I say $$$$$, I mean it. There isn't a Starbucks to be found and there are no local cafe's open early with take-out so plan accordingly or pay the price! Groceries- Despar is two blocks away (ask concierge for directions) and Carrefour is a bit farther but still walking distance and a bit of an adventure! Bottled water here is extremely reasonable and the wine is fine. Restaurants- if you are arriving late- bring a snack. Via Veneto has some wonderful restaurants but plan to pay top-dollar for everything. (this the grocery hint). Overall- wonderful property in one of the classiest areas of Rome. You can pretty much walk to all the destinations, as we did during our entire stay. Bring a map and don't be shy about using it. Trevi Fountain is a 12 minute walk if you know how to get there and Spanish Steps are 8 minutes, Vatican- 23, Travestere- 27, Colosseum- 25. Enjoy this hotel!

You can get fruits, candy, snacks, wine, bottled water, etc. for relatively cheap.

The bathroom was very nice, the bedding was very nice, all was good. Unfortunately, and I don't know or care if this is a Roman thing or a male thing, but every single time we walked into or out of the lobby, not a single employee made eye contact with us and said \"Buongiorno\", \"Hello\", \"Buona Sera\", \"How are you\"? Absolutely nothing. You have 6 guys standing around doing absolutely nothing and yet none of them were gracious enough to extend Service Industry 101. 2 bellmen, 2 concierge, and 2 front desk staff. Nothing. That really was the most enraging to me. It was unbelievably rude. I'm sure if I was an older white guy, I would have been given the respect. Hate to play that card but I know it's the truth. I've experienced it enough. People can say what they want about Americans, and in some cases it is absolutely true, but in my experience, our service and hospitality industry beats european hospitality by MILES. When I recently stayed at the St. Regis in Dana Point, I was treated like royalty by everyone from the bell staff to the management to the restaurant. Anyway, next - we're spending our last night in Rome after making a loop around the country and they have us booked in a bad room.

I said that is unacceptable, I am staying here twice in 10 days, I booked the reservation 3 months ago, and I am a Gold. Figure it out.\" Two seconds later he had an identical room next door to the room we stayed in the week before. I told him we don't need him to show us to the room and he kept insisting, then he stood there with his hand out. I showed him the door. No chocolates, no laundry bags, leaking shower, TV broken and had to have the engineer come up, not as nice as the room before albeit identical. Also, I don't know why anyone says you're paying for the neighborhood. That neighborhood is BOOOORING. It is definitely for the blue-haired crowd. Like staying near the US Embassy is a perk? Of course the only prostitutes and sex clubs I saw in all or Rome were near the Embassy and across the street from the hotel. Totally not surprised. Sorry Westin.

(we had taken a one day trip to Naples on the 22nd of April) To be honest, you are paying for the location and grandeur of the hotel. The location is very elegant and nice to stroll around. I consider myself loyal to the Starwood brand as they are my first choice of hotels throughout the world however I was not very happy overall with our stay. It was my father's 81st birthday and I wanted this to be a memorable trip for him so we splurged and paid the 405 Euro per night rate for a twin bedded room. (taxes included) Before we travelled I sent the hotel an e-mail to the address written on their web page asking for a nice view room because this was a special occasion for my father. Today is our third day back and still no response from the hotel ! At check-in I did mention my e-mail - the reception had no idea - so repeated my request. We were given a \"VERY NICE\" room on the 5th floor as the receptionist said. The room had windows but because the ledge is so high you can only see the roof of the building across the street. So basically no view unless you lean out of the window and bend over completely risking falling. The decor in the room was nice, amenities standard and room size was sufficient. The suitcase holding rack was broken though and not replaced during our stay. Very cheap hairdryer but at least it worked. Breakfast is totally overpriced for 29 euros per person however because of my father's walking situation we had to choose this option. Not a sufficient buffet. One stand with a chef making omlettes. The first day, we waited 15 minutes to be served coffee / tea. Upon our return on the 23rd, the hotel could not allocate a room because we came early from Naples around 11.30. They offered a room on the 1st floor and when I asked \"is it similar to 553 where we stayed two days ago\" the receptionist quickly said \"yes yes same kind of room\". Then an interjection from a supervisor behind the desk \"no not same kind of room. give me five minutes\". So we were given a new room on the fifth floor with a view of the courtyard. It was our last night so I didn't want to cause any problems by asking to change to a nicer view because my father was already tired. However there are other hotels very near so I would suggest considering those for price because this was definitely not not worth the 400 euros per night. If you want to stay on via veneto, check out the prices of the nearby Mariott or the Veneto Hotel or Eden Hotel before making a reservation here. Small notes : - The concierge, housekeepers and doormen are very friendly. - There is a small market about 3-5 minutes walking distance called Despar - Ciao Roma is a hop on hop off bus tour which departs from a stop about 5 minutes away - Department store La Rinascente is also within walking distance - Try to avoid the glass enclosed \"cafes/restaurants\" on the street - except maybe for a cappucino. Not too expensive but the quality of food is not very tasty. - If you like walking, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain are considered close.

There was ample cupboard space to pack everything away and make ourselves comfortable for the week. The marble bathroom was enormous and replenished daily.

The Good: -The room was an adequate size and clean. The furnishings were nice, but slightly worn. The decor was fine. The bathrooms were elegant and spacious. -The concierge was great with directions/recommendations and professional. There seemed to be someone on staff at all times (I spoke with the concierge as early as 7:00AM and as late as 2:00AM). Having a 24 hour concierge was extremely convenient. -The lobby and common areas were luxurious and impressive. -The bar was cool and the bartender we had mixed some great cocktails (the Pimms Cup was excellent). -I liked the hotel's location on Via Veneto. It's a 20 minute walk from the major tourist areas, but it's an oasis from the hustle and bustle of central Rome. Plus, Via Veneto offers some great options for late night coffee/snacks and cocktails (try Harry's Bar for great cocktails and atmosphere). The Bad: -Check-in was chaotic and when our room wasn't ready the woman at the front desk asked us to wait in the bar for 15-20 minutes. She promised to come in and give us an update on our room in 15-20 minutes. 45 minutes later we were still waiting in the bar (which was pleasant given the atmosphere and the great cocktails). Then, when I went to the front desk and asked about my room they seemed confused. We were finally provided with a room a few minutes later--after an hour's wait! The front desk needs some work. -At the time of check-in, the front desk told me my reservation was in order and after the ordeal above, I was given my room. When I checked out 4 days later, my rate was over 100 Euro more per day than the rate I confirmed at the time I made my reservation. I asked why, and the front desk did not have a good reason--I was in a rush to get to the airport, so I figured I'd call Westin when I got back to the U.S. When I called Westin they first claimed the rate increased because it was a corporate rate and I used my personal credit card. Then, they claimed that it was a rate based on one person occupancy and not two (my girlfriend and I stayed in the room). My biggest issue with the increase was that no one told me about it upon check-in, even though they knew I was using my non-corporate credit card and they knew two people were staying in the room (I asked for and received 2 keys). Instead, the hotel waited until my stay was over and I was rushing out to catch my plane to spring the rate increase on me (and 100 Euro per night is not an immaterial increase). Eventually, Westin gave me a refund, but I really had to fight it and I spent a lot of time getting the issue rectified. It was very disappointing to say the least. If you decide to stay at the Westin Excelsior, make sure to confirm the rate upon check-in and review your bill upon check-out. If not for the front desk/billing issues referenced above, I would have given the hotel 4-stars. Unfortunately, I'm giving the hotel 3-stars due to such issues and subsequent headaches. BTW--there are many amazing restaurants in Rome, but for a truly special and unique experience, consider dining at Hostaria Antica Roma. It's a family run restaurant located in ancient ruins on the an Appian Way. A quick taxi ride from the center city, the food, service and romantic atmosphere can't be beat. The homemade cheese spread is to die for! The pastas are great in general, but the Patina Cotidiana (from an ancient Roman recipe dating to 1st Century AD) was AMAZING. This place was so good, we ate there twice in 4 days (lunch and dinner). It's also close to the Catacombs, so you can work-up an appetite exploring the Catacombs and then enjoy an amazing meal. Ask for Paulo if you go there, he's part of the ownership and is a fantastic host. Be prepared for a great meal in a romantic setting, the interesting stories from Paulo are a bonus! He'll also call you a cab when your meal is over (a 15-20 Euro trip to the Westin Excelsior).", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cWonderful old hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "skibunny33", "ReviewID": "UR83160255", "Content": "We stayed here for one night on a whirlwind tour of the city.

So, it left us wondering what the actual best rate for the garage was? The room (227) was a complete disappointment (we had asked for a high floor and a view, of course non of this happened), old, shabby, dark, with a grotesque fake fireplace, the bathroom, although in marble, with a smell of mold and a leaking bidet and bath tub (we didn't report this, because we were under the impression nobody would care or do anything about it).

Speaking of the staff, my advice is that unless your name begins with Sheik or Lord, do not stay here because the staff will not be the slightest bit interested in you. We stood and watched great service one day as a new sheik and his family checked in, and then immediately afterwards got the service they seemed to give to \"normal\" people, which included the concierge not even being bothered to get my new wife a map - to his mind, it was good enough for him to point at it at the other end OF HIS OWN DESK, and then we practically had to beg for directions.

The location on Via Veneto is beyond the distance you would want to walk to sites in the ancient quarter, but Rome is so spread out that you need to learn the metro and particularly the bus system. Both of those systems are convenient to Via Veneto and once we learned them, getting around was relatively easy. It was also a nice quieter area to come back to at the end of the day. Via Veneto and the Westin are extra pricey for food and drinks, but if you're picking the Excelsior you probably already know that or don't care. We stayed on points, so we didn't expect to eat at the Westin's restaurant or drink much from the bar, and therefore weren't bothered by 10-12 euro beers or more for mixed drinks. Attached to the bar was a very comfortable lobby area with couches and chairs where you could have a refreshment if you so cared or just chill out. I did try the pool which is in the basement and usually wasn't busy. It felt great after a long hot day and the sauna helped relax any tired muscles.

Perhaps the indifference at check-in should have given me some hint as to what our latest experience would be like an as to had happened to this once refined and beautiful hotel. The Grand Luxe room was just slightly smaller and cheaper than the standard we had also booked, which appeared a little odd and when given teh pice difference, but as we were on vacation and only there for three nights, we could tolerate this. What was intolerable was the grime, apparently from polution, that coated the soft furnishings - curtains, carpets and headboards. The 'sumptuous furniture' as described in the sales blurb consisted of only one armchair and this had seen better days. I felt that I had to say something at this point but the indifference, verging on arrogance, at reception raised it's ugly head a further time when we pointed out concerns. Again, the short stay and busy itinerary allowed us to ignore this. Perhaps the oint where our tollerance faltered was our first morning at breakfast. The hotel had sold its soul to some large tour operators and so had no space in its restaurant to cater for the peak numbers coming in at the same time just before their coach picked them up; so their answer was to close the tasteful restaurant that sits on the Via Veneto and convert the large characterless ballroom at the rear of the building into a 'Vegas convention style' mass buffet, complete with an odd collection of poorly disguised ballroom tables that had seen there best days, and a compliment of staff that simply could not cope with the numbers; clear your own table, find your own cutlery and cross you fingers that the coffee would be warm. How could Westin do allow this to happen to their premier property in Rome? Is business that desperate? A short conversation with the General Manager of the property to simply express our displeasure was met with a response that suggested that the hotels focus had changed and rather than being a stop for the discerning traveller, the hotel must now attract the dollars of the volume operators....and in the current economics who could blame them for that? All I wuld ask is that they make this shift in approach a little more apparent on their websites and that Westin, as a group, came clean on this. The GM did all he could by offering us dinner and there was a bottle of prosseco placed in the room of one our guests on our return that evening.

The suite was exceptionally large, with a marble fireplace, marble bathroom, and separate bedroom. The celiings were at least 15 foot high, and had lovely gilded crown molding. The wall panels were in a deep red silk with the Borgehese bee embroidered upon them. The flat screen TV was a nice touch of modernity amongst the very old world furnishings. The couch and 2 chairs were dwarfed by the room, and while comfortable, lacked the scale to match the room.

The plumbing fixtures (faucets) were outdated, but the bathroom still felt very high end. The large windows open up fully, and when closed, the road noise was very muted.

However, was vastly disappointed in the menu - overpriced, mediocre quality. Would definitely not eat there again - there are too many far better choices with far better prices.

Definitely not a five star hotel experience. First, when I check in, I requested an interior courtyard room because I was afraid the ones facing exterior would be noisy in the morning. I was led to a fairly nicely room on the second floor. I asked for a room with two beds since a friend of mine was going to join me the following day. The room I was led to only have one large bed but the receptionist said that they will have someone to come up and split the bed right away. I looked outside very quickly and it was facing very close to a next door neighbor. Clearly not an interior room but I was ok with it....until I started to hear construction sound. I look outside once more and noticed there were scaffolding on my side of the hotel wall. I was livid. I dragged my luggage downstairs and demanded they gave me an interior room. They quickly gave me an interior courtyard room and the room already came with two beds. It was also slightly bigger than the room that was given to me originally. If you are a light sleeper, definitely ask for the interior courtyard room. There were several behaviors that were unbecoming of a five star hotel. For one, a hotel of this stature should replenish the body wash bottle daily. I noticed that the body wash bottle was never replenished during my stay. I ended up running out of it since the bottle was so small and had to request more. Then there was an incident that after taking away our dirty body towel, they totally forgot to put in new ones. When I got back to the hotel after a long day walk. I took a shower right away and when I got out, I noticed there were no body towels and ended up using hand towels to dry myself. Let's see, what else... The marble tile bath was nice but there were so many molds on the grout that I have to believe they never even bother to clean my shower the whole six days I stayed there. In fact, when I first moved into the room, the grout was already covered in mold. All of this is not that big of a deal. The reason for the complaint is that this hotel is suppose to be a five star hotel. One of the best in Rome. And clearly this hotel does not live up to any five star hotel's expectation. Also this hotel is kinda fard from all the attractions. It's about 15-20 minutes walk to tourist traps. The walk is agreeable enough. But if your main goal is to be close to the attractions, then this hotel may not be suitable for you. Also this hotel is situated near the end of Via Veneto which can be a bit of a track since Via Veneto is not a flat walk. So every time after a long day walk, you'll have to track upwards from the tourist traps to your hotel. Normally it's not that bad. But on tire legs, well, is kind of a drag. If you are taking taxi everywhere, then it should not be of any problem.

However, I noticed that hotel staff do loose attention to regular guests if there are VIP guests around (such as last time there was a film festival going on and they had all the stars staying there, or diplomats come in with their securities and they take the whole attention to themselves).

They charge 5 star prices but I would give it no more than 3 and that would be generous. I am an SPG Platinum member but did not get treated like one, (not that anyone should get treated badly when they go to a hotel). First of all when we checked in they refused to give us more than one key with out asking them 3 times. Then when we got to the room we were given a suite with 2 twin beds instead of one with one queen or king sized bed. They claimed that was all they had available. The room we got was in bad shape. The beds were uncomfortable. The sheets on one of the beds was stained. There was a big stain on the silk fabric on the wall as well. Our shower door was coming off, along with one of the curtain valances. We also had to have the mini-bar refrigerator replaced because it stopped working. In regards to the fitness center and business center: the fitness center is nice but every time I tried to use it it was closed or there were security guards all through it because some U.S. dignitary was probably staying there. (The hotel is right across the street from the U.S. Embassy.) The business center was nice but very expensive (\u00a36.00) for a half an hour. When you are already paying 5 star prices for the room, you should not have to pay to use the internet! The worst thing about this hotel is the staff. We did not encounter one helpful or even one very nice person at all. Especially the concierge staff. Once I called down from my room to see if he could make any ticket arrangements for us to see any of the Roman sites and he said no. Then he recommended that I ask for help at the information booth across the street. Which by the way is a newspaper stand not an information booth. Another time I asked if he could make reservations for us at the Hard Rock Cafe around the corner. He said \"no, they don't accept reservations.\" Then I asked what time they opened that night and he said they are only open for dinner after 6:30pm. Later that day we discovered that both of those statements were wrong. They do accept reservations and they open at 12:00pm and close at around midnight. Another night on our way out of the hotel we asked for an umbrella because it had been raining really hard earlier that day. When we asked for the umbrella the concierge just replied \"it's not raining.\" We said we would still like one and he gave one to us. We found out soon after, when it started raining again, that the umbrella was broken! These concierges (and the rest of the staff) are useless!! We then found out that our flight was canceled because of the Volcano so we switched to the Hotel Eden for the 4 additional days that we were stuck in Rome. So, if you like horrible service, rooms that are falling apart, and like to feel unimportant then I recommend this hotel. But if you like to get 5 star service when you pay for 5 star service then I recommend going down the street two blocks to the Hotel Eden which is also a starwood property.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for!

We were upgraded to two suites due to the platinum mebership status both were VERY large in size if you have ever travelled to euope they are about 3 times the size of a standard room. The rooms were not quite ready at the time of arrival but the front desk staff escorted us to the lounge and we had a drink on the house while waiting a few minutes for our room. The hotel itself is slightly older but kept very clean and in good condition. The view of the via Veneto was amazing from our room. We checked out the pool and spa/gym area they were all quite nice. The pool was not spectacular but we didn't come to Rome to swim so it was not a problem! I have to say we did not eat at the hotel or order room service as it was quite expensive, but not more so than anywhere around the hotel. We ate breakfast at a coffee bar across the street and it was fantastic. We also had dinner at a place across the street in a little glass street car which was also great. You need to realize that this hotel is on the most expensive street in Rome as it is the most famous street (Via Veneto) therefore if you are wanting to pay a little less just walk off the street a couple blocks. There are tonnes of magnificant resaurants and coffee shops a small walk away that are affordable. One of the best places we ate on our whole trip to italy was in Piazza Navona. In true Westin style the beds were plush the towels, robes and slippers were great and the bathroom had all the immenities! Overall this hotel was great and a true experience when in Rome.

We were told that the Excelsior was a sister hotel and since we had such a wonderful experience last year at the St. Regis, we decided to give it a go. The problem with this hotel is not the lobby, the rooms, the facilities--it is the grumpy service. We had just arrived from 3 nights at the Four Seasons in Florence, so the juxtaposition was obvious. We pulled up to the Excelsior in our car and the hotel greeter couldn't muster a hello or welcome. The first words out of his mouth were \"It will cost 70 euros to park the car here. Do you want to do it?\" Next we arrive at the front desk and the joyless lady gives us the key and asks, \"Do you want me to accompany you to your room?\" The worst offense was the concierge, Claudio, who sent us to one of his buddy's tourist traps. I'm truly sorry to be so negative. If you see my other reviews, you'll find that, in general, I really like where we stay--because I study various sources pretty well before choosing a hotel. Final complaint is that the Via Veneto is simply an unappealing road in Rome. It is quite dirty and there is a bit of riff raff at night. On the positive side, we thought our room was great. It was beautiful in an old world sense. While the decor was a tad bit too old-world-parloresque for my taste, it still was a very nice bedroom and bathroom. Additionally, we loved the breakfast which was comprehensive with every imaginable item. For those of you who have traveled in Italy over the last couple of decades, the best way to describe this hotel is that it hasn't changed its service orientation from the 80s. It used to be that all the 5 star hotels in Italy were grumpy and most have changed out of necessity.

I wanted to stay at a grand Italian hotel. It was a mixed experience. The lobby certainly lived up to my expectations and I had no complaint about our room. We stayed in the basic room and it was very comfortable. I was worried in particular about the size of hotel rooms in Rome but the room was more than adequate. When you walked in, there was a small hallway with a closet to hang clothes in that also had a set of drawers. The main room had an extremely comfortable, large king sized bed with soft sheets. There was a windsor chair and a table and a desk and chair. In the closet, there was also a safe which we always like to have in the room. The bathroom was huge and beautiful and featured two sinks, a glass shower stall, a bath (no jacuzzi) and a toilet and bidet. Also, having read other reviews on Trip Advisor about the noise in the hotel, I had requested a quiet room and they put us on the top floor in an inner courtyard. There was no view but it was absolutely silent. The air condiitioning also worked perfectly However, the halls were so scuffed and marked up and the carpets so frayed, that the hallways looked like a 2 star. Worse, was the service. The first night we asked the concierge for a dinner recommendation and he sent us to a restaurant that was a complete rip off. Without going into details, we had been in Italy for 11 days by this time and the way the owner was all over us, placing things we hadn't ordered in front of us and intimating that they were giving us complementary tastings and then, when questioned, admitted they were charging exorbitant prices for them, all led us to the conclusion that the concierge must be getting a kickback from this place. As well, when we approached the concierge about what to wear to the Vatican, he gave us the wrong information, which fortunately we ignored. My dress was too bare but I brought a sweater in case, even though they said I did not need one. They were also very curt and rude to me whenever I called the front desk for anything, including a wake up call. As I said, we had been in Italy 11 days when we came to Rome. Up to that point, we had stayed in upscale boutique hotels and resorts and had had wonderful, personal service with excellent dining and sightseeing tips. As well, the hotels we had stayed in previously were more mixed with respect to their clientele, more of a European, American mix. Even the rooms, equally comfortable to this hotel's rooms, had a European charm. This hotel, although it had comfortable rooms as stated, could have been a Westin anywhere. If you want assured, impersonal, American style comfort, this is the place. There are no suprises. It was worth the 240 or so euros we paid per night but certainly not the 350 euros which is the usual rate. It is not a special, luxurious hotel. And , next time we will risk staying in a smaller room, at a more authentic hotel. Last thing, the breakfast buffet is 42 euros per person and the room service menu is equally expensive. However, we stood at the bar at the Cafe Paris across the street and had a croissant and a cappuccino each for about 6 euros.

I have requested removal of the original review. I had some concern about staying at the Westin Excelsior after reading the reviews. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am. The room originally planned for us (top floor, street view) was not yet ready, but the hotel was able to immediately check us into a top floor courtyard view room. We found the room to be spacious and VERY quiet. Quiet hotel rooms are not easy to find in Rome, a city known for noise. Nevertheless, our room had sound dampening wall coverings, and doors tight enough that a person sleeping in bed could not hear the shower going in the bathroom. No observable street or hallway noise whatsoever. This dramatically contrasts with my experience at other Via Veneto hotels, including the Marriot and the Majestic. Carpets were clean, as was the bathroom. The hotel supplied real bedsheets instead of the horrible duvets most European hotels use. Real facecloths were also available. Service requests were responded very quickly. For example, we arrived on a Sunday, and I had a business meeting on Monday. My suit needed pressing, but the sign in the hotel room (as in all Rome hotel rooms) stated that no iron was provided because local law prohibited them. The hotel service directory stated that pressing service was available in the daytime Monday to Saturday, but not Sunday. A call to Service Express resulted in an iron and ironing board brought to our room by Housekeeping in less than 3 minutes. The housekeeper even offered to do the pressing for me. We did not eat lunch or dinner at the hotel (there are far too many wonderful Rome restaurants to eat hotel food), but as breakfast was included (after direct negotiation with the hotel at time of booking), we did have the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet, while expensive if not included, may well be the best in Rome. Omlettes, eggs, american bacon, italian sausage, yoghurt, cereal, waffles, pancakes, smoked salmon, all types of breads, pastries and cakes - the buffet had it all. The food was terrific. The lobby is dramatic and quite beautiful.

We got a 2 room suite, one with a huge living/sitting area with Bang-Olefson TV and 3 windows overlooking the fashionable Via Veneto. The bedroom was separate and with the heavenly bed. The bathroom was all marble. The windows were soundproof and we did not hear the street noise at all. But whenever we were in the room we turned the A/C off and drank in the view of one of the world's most fashionable streets dotted with cafes, good looking people, and Versace. I don't know , who would NOT enjoy that. But everybody is different. We had a free lunch in our plan and had it at the side walk cafe at Doney..the H club. Breakfast was included daily in our rate. We also got the 4th night free plan , so at 489 euros per night, that was great ! The Concierge staff was magnifico ! Esp Paolo. Hi Paolo ! He made us great reservations at nice restaurants in walking distances. It was great ! I highly recommend him to anyone travelling there.He was so helpful. We had a tour of Pompeii and Capri on 2 days. I used VIATOR and toursitaly.com. I highly recommend them. They were very efficient and the tour was well organized. Now , a WORD of CAUTION. This has nothing to do with the hotel. It is about pickpockets. I am posting it here , since so many people use this site. We were well alert and I had my purse laying flat across me, with one hand on it. My husband carried his money in the front pocket. NO CC or wallets. We had taken the taxi from the train station to the hotel on the 1st day. The driver spoke good english and was suave.When we arrived he pointed to the meter and said 25. So we got out and gave him a 20 and a 5. Then he said 5 extra for the luggage. So we looked thru my purse and my husband looked into his pockets. When we looked up he was holding a 10 and a 5 ...this puzzled us but we did not think about it and gave him the 10 that he now needed. Later, when we were in the room my husband suddenly said, when the taxi driver got into the car he looked thru his billfold, pulled out a 10 and put it in his pocket. My husband saw that and was surprised. Only then we figured out what he had done. He had ingeniously pickpocketed us ! While we were fumbling thru our purses he had put away our 20 and got out the 10 from his pocket! Con artist ! I told the front desk but what could they do?

We looked at the Starwood Hotel hoptions (Sheraton, Westin, St Regis, etc) and decided to take the plunge, even though it was a little more expensive. As US travelers, we were worried about how the Dollar would stand against the Euro. We found a great deal by going on the Westin's own website and paid less than $200 per night for our gorgeous deluxe room on the 6th floor. From the moment we stepped in the hotel, we were pampered. They took our bags and whisked us in. This was probably because the hotel elevators were so small, getting all 5 of us plus our bags in the elevator would of been impossible! The hotel was beautifully decorated and VERY spacious (more so than many rooms in the US). Our room was probably 3 - 4x as big as the rooms in an city (no exaggeration). Because we were on the top floor, the ceilings were so high that you could of easily added another room above us. Plus there was a balcony, a LARGE walk-in closest, and a bathroom that could of easily fit my whole family. My 5 year old and 8 year old kids were very pleased with the location and service. The only downside was that the pool was a little on the small side. However, you don't go to Rome to go swimming in the pool anyway, right? The hotel is very close to the Spanish Steps (especially if you know the short cuts) and a beautful park (about 3 blocks away) that houses a museum and a zoo. If you have children, this is great, especially after traveling the streets of Rome all day. It is also about 3 blocks away from \"the Bone Church.\" I don't know how else to describe it except for saying that YOU HAVE TO GO. We were also right next door to the US Embassay. What a relief!!!! As someone that brought small kids, I would recommend this hotel, especially given its location. Everything is in walking distance in Rome. We walked everywhere. Yes, my 8 year old and 5 yr old walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and the Pantheon all in the same day and didn't complain. Just be sure to stop for Gelatos!!! We also walked to the Vatican, the Colesseum, and other major attractions from our hotel. If walking isn't your thing, there is a subway stop about 3 blocks from the hotel (down the hill, yes, the hotel sits atop a steep and winding hill) RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BONE CHURCH!. My last bit of advice, bring a water bottle and take advantage of all of the free fountains that give out free, cold water. You would be a fool to continue to buy bottled water or even soda every day. Soda, especially in a restaurant, can cost you uo to 5 euros a day (now think about that in US dollars). The cheapest we found a can of Coke was in a supermarket for .70 cents/euros. Long story short, we are already anxious to go back to Rome and plan to stay at the same place.

The hotel is in a great location, walkable to the Spanish Steps and many central points in Rome, with a Metro stop quite closeby. However, the location is better than the hotel itself. While the building has a gorgeous exterior and historic interior, it is definitely an old hotel and in need of some upgrades. The rooms are pretty, decor is traditional european and looks like it's received good care since being redone in the past 10 years, but if you're looking for a modern hotel, this isn't it. We had a problem with the ventilation system in March - the cool air hadn't been turned on for the season, hence any ventilation that you got was heat being pumped into your room. Our room was on the sixth floor and got very warm and stuffy without any ventilation, so we were forced to sleep with the french doors open, which resulted in bug bites every night - not fun and not what you'd expect from a top hotel. Our second big surprise was the concierge, they were very brusk, bordering on rude (we never saw a woman at the concierge desk, all men during our visit). I agree with everyone who says they were treated like an inconvenience while asking about routine things in a respectable way. The hotel was noticeably empty when we were there, yet they still acted like this. We achieved the dinner reservations that we wanted, but it was an unpleasant chore every time. Additionally, when we arrived at 4:00 and asked where we could get a casual snack (sandwich, etc), they directed us across the street where a sandwich was 25 Euro, said that was the only place open at that time of day. We knew better and walked around the block, only to find a coffee shop with tons of sandwiches and light food within 100 yards of the hotel. Were they not aware of this, or trying to send our business to the most expensive tourist trap in town? They gym was pretty good. On basement level, so no windows, but a decent number of new machines with TV's, so quite comfortable. The pool was small but very nice and the pool room was relaxing and pretty, I brought a book down and read one evening. The spa services offered seemed extraordinarily expensive (as did the room service, by the way) and the setup seemed like an afterthought - treatment rooms were right next to the treadmills, in the hallway next to the pool entrance, etc. With two other Starwood hotels within a half mile, we would definitely explore the Hotel Eden and St. Regis next time.

Our room was cosy and nicely decorated and although it was overlooking a side street, we could still look out onto the Via Veneto to our left from the balcony. My wife wanted to rest for a while, so I took the opportunity to check out the pool.

Other people have mentioned that the staff aren't the most customer service orientated and I would say that this is true to a certain extent. We had done our reserach and knew where we wanted to go and what to see so we didn't really need the staff's help, but what interaction we did have did not overly impress me. There was nothing seriously wrong with the service received, it was just that the staff didn't seem overly interested. After returning home from dinner we decided to have a drink in the bar and found that the Irish and Italian rugby teams had been in the hotel for their after match dinner. The G7 leaders had also had meetings in the ball room the day before, so obviously the hotel books some high end clients and functions, but 18 Euro for a beer and a coke in the lobby bar was a bit steep.

This included free colour printing and use of the telephone to book our car to the airport. I found the business centre to be one of the best that I have used on our recent travels. The hotel is situated in a nice location and is a short walk to most attractions. We chose to walk to the nearby metro stop and made our way to the Colleseum before walking past some of the major attractions on our route north and back to the hotel. Our deal included breakfast, which is not always included with other hotel rates and my advice to those who do not have breakfast included is to steer clear of the hotel. At 32 Euro per person for a continental and 42 for a cooked breakfast the hotel have vastly overpriced the food that they offer. I would imagine that in the summer it would be nice to enjoy breakfast on the street terrace overlooking the Via Veneto, but compared to the breakfasts I have eaten at other 5 star hotel around the world the Westin comes a poor second. There are several places on the Via Veneto who offer a superior breakfast at a lower price. For us the breakfast was included in the rate and was perfectly acceptable, but as an add on to your rate I would avoid. Overall this was a nice hotel in a good location and provided us with a welcoming base from which to explore the beauties of Rome. There are certain issues with staff, but nothing that would be likely to make your stay an unpleasant experience. The positives outweigh the negatives on this one and I would be most likely to stay here again given the chance .", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fondi", "Title": "\u201cLoved it again\u201d", "Author": "Conbeck", "ReviewID": "UR24357051", "Content": "The best hotel in Roma.

The bathroom didn't have a separate shower and bath as other reviewers have mentioned, but the shower was great, and the bath was a good size.

We didn't eat in the hotel at all - both the restauarant and room service appeared quite expensive, and we preferred the option of seeking out smaller local cafes and restauarants as we wandered around, none of which disappointed, although those closer to the 'sights' were definitely not such good value for money as those slightly more off the beaten track.

We loved the nearby Villa Borghese which is very romantic if you're looking at this hotel for a honeymoon. The restaurants near and located in the hotel are very pricey but had delicious food. The local area also felt very safe. The staff were incredibly friendly, the check in staff were a delight and spoke English well.

We stayed on SPG points. The hotel was very nice and the room and bathroom were nicely decorated. It had all the amenities one would expect. Note: there was no clock radio, coffee maker or iron in the room. Wake-up calls always worked. Concierge staff were helpful the few times we had requests. They were very formal though so don't expect warmth. Our first night in Rome we went to Galleria Borghese and when we got out it was pouring rain. You know when its raining so hard it hits the pavement and comes back up again and causes immediate flooding? That kind of rain. Of course we couldn't get a cab no matter what we tried so we decided we might as well walk the 10ish minutes back to the hotel. Despite rain jacket and umbrella we were both soaked by the time we reached the hotel. The doorman backed away from us like we had the plague and when the concierge saw us he quickly looked away. I'm not sure if our sodden sight offended them or they were trying to save us the embarrassment of being seen in such a shameful state. I still can't decide if I'm mostly annoyed or amused - some of both I suppose. I found the location to be so-so. Quite close to Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps and a metro station. But everything beyond that is a 20+ minute walk or a cab ride. I enjoy a walk but after more than 12 hours of pounding the pavement it would be nice not to have to walk even further to get back to the hotel. Fortunately the cabs were very reasonable. If you are going to the Colosseum or the Vatican it doesn't matter as you will need the metro or cab to get there anyway but all other areas are near each other but not so near us. Plus the area around the hotel has no character or charm in my opinion. If I went again I would stay in the Piazza Navona area or for character in Trastevere. I almost did that this time but since we had points for Westin, well you can't argue with free as my husband says.

We ended up at the Excelsior because we wanted our second visit to be a little different and the Excelsior has a pool which the Grand does not. We were a little concerned about our choice since the reviews on this site have been mixed, but after our stay, I think we would come back here over the Grand. This conclusion is not based on our luck at getting a major upgrade to a very large corner suite. The suite was amazing, very well appointed and in great shape. No frayed edges here. The bathroom was equally grand with separate shower and tub. I had a chance to walk around the hotel during maid service in the mornings and got to glance in many rooms. All looked in good shape and appeared to be good size or better. The only negative I could see is that the Deluxe room bathrooms have not been remodeled like the Grand Luxe bathrooms, so they have older looking marble in colors that may not appeal to all. As for the rest of the hotel, it is grand, imperial, and overall does not come across as one of those grand old hotels that has seen its best days. Especially impressive is the spa area. Clearly renovated in the last couple of years, this area of the hotel is a standout. The gym is nice, with a fair amount of equipment and good lighting. The indoor pool was wonderful and is located in a great setting. The pool area also includes a spa, steam room, showers, and bathroom. These areas have a nice new modern look and are a fun change from the rest of the style of the hotel. The locker rooms also have a new modern look. We did not have breakfast included with our room, so we only had breakfast once in the hotel. The dining room used for breakfast has also been redone in a more modern d\u00e9cor. We passed on the 42 euro buffet and ordered a-la-carte off the menu and had a nice breakfast for two for under 30 euros. We walked to the St. Regis Grand for sentimental reasons, and it might be a little grander and more elegant, but not by much. Given the Excelsior\u2019s better location and spa, I think if we went back to Rome we would stay at the Excelsior again. Our only compliant is that we know this hotel is a Westin but given the grandeur and prices at this location it would have been nice to have toiletries from a high end designer instead of Westin\u2019s personal brand.

We found the service to be impeccable, with one small blemish: we had emailed the concierge to make four dinner reservations and he missed one, but said it was confirmed nonetheless, so we wasted a trip to the restaurant only to be turned away. That aside, we enjoyed great service throughout--room service in particular was the fastest I've ever experienced--a breakfast omelette came within 10 minutes. Yes, a glass of juice is 9 euros. If you don't want to pay that, you can get one in the cafe across the street for 3 euros. I especially appreciated the well-equipped gym and spa to stave off the damage of pasta and pastries. The machines were all very modern and well-maintained, with an impressive collection of weight-lifting options. Some of the guidebooks say that Via Veneto is past its prime, but we didn't feel that way at all. Further, it's a short walk to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, so location-wise, it's excellent. Further, there is a taxi stand next to the hotel, which we used several times a day.

We booked on the hotel web site and as SPG gold members we had hoped for an upgrade and a late check out but sadly nothing was offered! The hotel is well located to experience the \u201cDolce Vita\u201d, being in the middle of the Via Veneto. The Grande Luxe Room itself was large and classically elegant in d\u00e9cor, almost Louis XIV in style. However it seemed a little bare, lacking a bit of furniture and was not really what you would describe as \u201cluxurious\u201d. We had an extra bed in the room for our daughter but she did not like it as it was more like a camp bed and not very comfortable. Our bed was large and comfortable though and so she spent most nights trying to sneak into our bed! The bathroom was nice and spacious, if a little dark and decorated in dark, red marble with double sinks and a separate shower. There are no facilities in the room to make tea or coffee, something us Brits we would definitely have appreciated. We tried to connect to the WiFi in the room. It cost 13 Euro and is run by \u201cLinkem\u201d but the system they use just could not be made to work, a problem we\u2019ve had before in Westin Hotels. Our room was on the side of the hotel and despite being away from the main road it was still quite noisy from early on but you can\u2019t expect much else in a city. The breakfasts in the Caf\u00e9 Doney were very good but make sure you book a breakfast inclusive rate otherwise they are very pricy. We only ate dinner once in the Hotel\u2019s restaurant, there is only one, the Doney. Although beautifully presented it lacks Italian ambiance. It does have a nice bar, the Gran Caf\u00e9 Doney, opening onto the Via Veneto and we found that a nice place to go to people watch and enjoy \u201chappy hour\u201d cocktails and free canap\u00e9s from 5 to 7 pm. The Excelsior\u2019s cocktail bar in the hotel was comfy and never busy. The bar tender seemed desperate for some one to order a fancy cocktail to allow him to display his skills. The public rooms in the hotel generally were nice if somewhat underused. The existence of a swimming pool was an important part of our decision making process in deciding to stay here. It was invariably quiet, the d\u00e9cor classically Romanesque but it did have some scary looking electrics. Bare wires beside water never look good, even if they were in the process of doing a repair. All in all the hotel was just lacking something to make it special. I think it starts with the reception area which is just too cold and bare. There is no flow between the bars and lounges and the foyer. The best hotels feel welcoming and this is usually based on a nice central area where you can meet people or just sit and watch the world go by. There is no specific criticism of this Hotel but I doubt we would stay there again. Near to the Hotel there was some nice Italian fare to be had. Try La Giara around the corner where the food is more traditional and run by a lovely couple. Not big on speaking English but that was half the fun. On the Via Veneto itself, The Caf\u00e9 Veneto opposite the hotel was not as good as Caf\u00e9 Doney and rather overpriced for what we had. We only had drinks in the Caf\u00e9 de Paris and Harry\u2019s Bar which are both nearby. In the 1950\u2019s these were very much the centre of life in Rome but are nothing special these days. The Caf\u00e9 Roma was our favourite for snacks and Cappuccinos, it is on the corner just before you get to the Hotel if you are walking back from the shopping areas. Worth noting as 5 o\u2019clock approaches is the fact that you can often buy a bottle of Frascati or Pinot Grigio cheaper than a beer and a coke! Nearby the Ristorante Ciao Bella may sound tacky but was better than any of the more famous ones further up the Via Veneto. Away from the hotel we enjoyed most of the big sights such as the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps which are only 10 minute walk from the Hotel. Even further a field is of course tourist attraction number one, the Colosseum. Do not go to the Colosseum without first buying a ticket at the tourist offices or via the concierge the day before! The queues are horrendous at the gate, it can be over two hours wait, but if you have your ticket you can just go to the left of the queue, labelled \u2018groups\u2019 and go past all the tours and straight through. The tours seemed rushed and most people were not even listening. Go round slowly and sit down and just imagine the history. Sadly we found that you get excellent mobile phone reception in the middle of the Colosseum! There are no food/drink stalls inside the Colosseum or the Forum and very few toilets either, so be prepared. Piazza Navona is a good spot for a lunch and feels more Roman. We went to the Vatican which, like most of Rome, has poor signposting and unhelpful staff. We made the mistake of thinking the Sistine Chapel was at St Peter\u2019s Basilica. It is not, but nobody tells you it is in the Vatican museum which is up a hill, half a mile away! It is very busy and crowded there. Everything about the Vatican appears commercialised and geared to making money which we found rather surprising.

I was there for a corporate event 8/5-11, so room reservations were handled by our corporate travel agency. I had previously stayed here in 1998 before it became a Westin property, so was curious to see what changes may have taken place. If you've stayed at Westin properties, you won't be disappointed! The Excelsior retains it's authentic Roman flair from the 50's-60's yet has the modern conveniences we've come to expect in the States. The rooms are very well decorated, very ornate, and the bathrooms are very nice with lots of Italian marble. Maid service was very good, but be sure to lock your door or hang your DND sign on the door if you sleep late. Maid service was at 8am, and they just knocked and came right in! Only complaint I have is that you can not get an iron in your room. If your clothes are wrinkled, you must call and have them ironed for you at $6.20 Euros, which is close to $10 US per item! My advice---take a travel iron. Beds are very comfortable and the TV is a large plasma with multiple channels from across Europe. Dispite previous articles on TA, I thought the hotel employees were very nice, especially the maid service. Concierge is good at recommending restaurants. I took a Frommers guide, and they recommend eating elsewhere from Via Veneto as prices are high. They were right. Food is good but pricey. Go a few blocks in any direction and you'll save money and have a good meal. The hotel bar is nice, but a little small. The bar tenders are very nice, but drink prices are expensive, but I guess that is to be expected. Probably similar to a hotel in New York or San Francisco. The hotel is just a short 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps, which leads to multiple other Roman site-seeing attractions. We never needed a cab, but they are readily available at the hotel if you need one. You can exchange dollars/Euros at the hotel, but they charge a 5% surcharge. Overall the hotel is very good. It is about a 25-30 minute trip from the airport. Beware---the Rome airport is horrible with getting your luggage to the carousel. It was front page news about the horrible service from the baggage handlers. We had to wait almost 30 minutes, and several of our traveling companions had to wait 1-2 days for their's to be delivered to the hotel. I suggest packing a few days clothes and bathroom items in a carry-on just in case. Enjoy Rome---it is a great city, very safe, and a wonderful way to spend a Summer vacation in Europe!

Overall, we found the staff and accomodations very good. Going in, I had rather low expectations, after reading several reviews, but I found the actual experience better than what I had prepared myself for. I only booked this hotel as I was using Starwood points. When we checked in, we were early (noon), and the front desk said that they showed us as a couple, not 3 persons (our 19-year old daughter was with us). They quickly said \"No problem\" and said that there would be a 45 Euro/day charge for a cot. The call centre at Starwood had warned me about this charge when I booked, so I was ready for that. They got us into a large room that accomodated the cot, and all of our luggage, easily. I was surprised that we got into our room early, but it was great as we needed to freshen up after being on the plane all night. With a few exceptions, our experience was top notch. The only things that were a little negative were the following: - Lack of facecloths: not a popular item in Europe, it didn't surprise me, except that on the 2nd day of our 3 day stay, we actually DID receive facecloths (No, not the little towels by the bidet, but real facecloths). We did not have them when we checked in, nor on the 3rd day of our stay. - The 45 Euro/day charge for the cot. Even though I knew about the charge before I arrived, I feel it is ridiculous. Nickle and diming guests and Starwood members is not professional. The darn cot didn't even cost the hotel what we paid to use it for 3 nights. - Charge to use the internet in the business centre was a bit of a surprise. I'm used to free business centres in North America. - Charge for minibar use (38 Euros), when we didn't touch anything, made me wonder if they were trying to rip us off, but they took it off the bill when I mentioned it, and did not argue or even look at me suspiciously, so that was fine. - Prices for food and drinks is high, even for a centrally located luxury hotel. I just about swallowed my tongue when my wife told me what the price for breakfast was. I've paid up to $25 CAN for breakfast in North America, but this worked out to something like $75 CAN for bacon and eggs. WOW! On the positive side: - Staff: All staff, including the concierge staff that many reviewers complain about, were great. Everyone was friendly and accomodating. - Room was large. Bathroom was huge, had two sinks, large walk-in shower, chandelier, etc. - Walk-in closet was great. Room safe was handy. - Room was in good shape and had a large LCD TV, two chandeliers, and a couple of small balconies (with table and chairs). - Pool and spa facilities are very nice, and in good shape. The jetted pool, attached to the main pool, is not heated however. - Location and neighborhood is good. The rack rate on the room was posted as 1140 Euros, which I doubt anyone has actually ever paid, but even at 500-600 Euros (which it typically goes for), I would have a hard time justifying the expense.

Although we had the misfortune of arriving on the day of a 1-day national labor strike, the management worked tirelessly to get us checked into a room in a timely manner.

Our king bed was created by moving 2 full beds together, but quite comfortable in the tradition of the Westin \"Heavenly Bed\" (the only \"true\" king beds, as well as whirlpool tubs, are in the most luxurious suites). The hotel is right next door to the American Embassy, and within walking distance of the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, high-end shopping on the Via Condotti, mid-priced shopping along the Via del Corso, great restaurants on the Via Veneto and the tallest palm tree in Rome (this 17th-century tree is still growing in the courtyard of the ultra-expensive George's Restaurant). For the active/adventurous and fitness buffs, you are close enough to the Villa Borghese and Gardens (jogging trails, racetrack, children's playgrounds), as well as neighborhood exploring around the Pantheon and the Piazza Navona. If you make it by foot to the Piazza Navona, you are now in proximity to a bridge across the River Tiber (Tevere in Italian) to Vatican City (but take a taxi back to the hotel from the Vatican as it is an uphill walk back). The hotel doesn't have any programs for children (their \"Kid's Club\" just means that they have the capability to provide necessary items such as cribs, guard rails, high chairs, bottles and bottle warmer, children's menu, etc.), but you can utilize the concierge to recommend great places to take your children, as well as excellent places for adults. Tip them generously, for their recommendations are excellent and priceless! The on-site restaurant provides a delightful combination of Mediterranean cuisine and Roman specialties (couldn't get enough of the extremely fresh fruit and mouth-watering lemon mousse), and you can sit at one of their sidewalk tables to people watch along the Via Veneto. Room service was quick, as well as the laundry service - just be prepared to bring your own travel iron (and converter) if you don't want to pay roughly $10 USD to have a skirt pressed.

If I wanted to be highly critical, I could point out that when I called down for toothpaste (which is now normaly for those flying out of the UK for overnight hand baggage only stays, even if BA now give you steel knives and forks again!) it took several attempts to find someone to speak to and once I was connected they had run out! Also beware going for a stroll around the block as at least 6 people asked me if I wanted to go to their \"gentlemans club\", even if they were quite polite. DO beware the taxi scam and note that the fare sould be around \u20ac60 and if you do choose to go \"independent\" you can prob do better than that. I can recommend to book ahead if you arrive late to avoid standing in the queue for 1 hour as happened to a colleague.

It certainly does not match the quality of the suites and facilities. The Concierge staff in particular are real money grubbers and are to be avoided at all costs. They recommended a horrible trattoria filled with American tourists, mediocre overpriced food and no ambience. Obviously commissions and kick-backs are what the Concierge staff at this property are working for and not your wellbeing. Room service is extremely overpriced and to be avoided. Poor quality food and surly waiters.

I am particular about where I stay and there are certain things that I like in a hotel i.e. good safe location, so I can sightsee when I am not working, internet connnection, good gym, or close proximity to a park, good bed, room in good condition etc. This is a big hotel - and I wanted this. If you want small and intimate where everyone greets you or knows your name, then this is not the hotel for you. Nonetheless the staff were friendly - no they didn't take my bag when I arrived, but I am sure they would have if I had been struggling - they did help me to my room. The staff were helpful and friendly from the receptionist to the concierge. I always ask the concierge a lot of questions - and they were very patient and eager to help. The staff were seasoned - took their jobs seriously and were able to assist with my queries. Brought up an adaptor for my computer as soon as I called. The bed was comfortable, not really the true Westin beds you get in other Westins but close enough. I did not have a non-smoking room when I arrived (but I may have forgotten to ask for one in my reservation). So although the hotel was booked out, they kept looking until they found one for me - I hate smoking floors. I ended up with an excellent room (non-smoking) looking into the open air center of the hotel - there was scaffolding up outside the window, but honestly I wasn't there to look at the window and didn't even notice it until I went to open the window for some fresh air the second day. I like the fact the windows open. If I was a serious tourist though I might have asked to change rooms because of the scaffolding. The hotel is in a great location - not right in the touristy part, but close enough. Yes it is opulent, but most hotels in Italy are. I didn't think the hotel needed a strong refurbishment. I always notice if wallpaper is peeling and bathrooms are run down. I recently stayed at a very exclusive (5) star in Cannes, France which was a dump. The Westin's decor however may not be to everyone's liking, but you are in Italy so it seems fitting to have a bit of the opulence around and the room was in very good condition. Even the bathroom shower had the Westin showerhead and rounded shower curtain (exactly as the last Westin I stayed out in early January in Palm Springs). The elevator is small but each floor has a grand ballroom-like center in front of the staircase and elevators. I enjoyed walking up and down the great staircase everyday and actually preferred this rather than taking the elevator. The gym was excellent - I used it everyday. Some of my colleagues stayed in very exclusive boutique hotels in Rome and said they wished they had stayed at the Westin, particularly because of the gym. Would I stay here with my kids - probably not. But my children are still small, so running up and down the great staircase would probably not go over well, although Italians love children and may not have minded, other guests might have. When we come to Rome as a family - we rent an apartment so we can feed the kids at our leisure and have more room to run around. In conclusion, it is best to know exactly what you want before you book any hotel in Italy - the service in this hotel is good, not over the top, but excellent just the same. You feel like you are truly in Rome when you are in this hotel. I got what I wanted and I would certainly stay at this particular Westin again.", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cWonderful older hotel\u201d", "Author": "DrewInLA", "ReviewID": "UR4460829", "Content": "The Westin Excelsior in Rome was our first stop on our Italy-France trip, and we liked it very much.

I'd recommend this hotel for business travellers as it seems to cater for them and not really anyone else. We arrived and weren't treated with any special care as one expects when staying at a 5 star hotel. No one offered to take our luggage to our room. When we arrived at our room the new LCD tv system wasn't working however one phone call later and a staff member came up and reset it. I don't know what is is about these new large LCD tv screens in hotel rooms these days however most I've come across seem to exacerbate poor tv reception to the point where your eyes start to strain. The staff are helpful when you make requests. The first day we were in Rome it absolutely bucketed down. When we arrived back to the hotel we asked if we were able to have our clothes put in a drying room which they were more that happy to do at no cost. Any extras at this hotel are very expensive such as breakfasts, room service etc. It also appears very much to cater for the American business traveller who is familiar with the \"Heavenly\" marketing concept they have at this group of hotels, the Heavenly Bed, the Heavenly Shower etc. Although there is nothing wrong with this concept it becomes rather predictable. It won't be long before they have the Heavenly door handle, the Heavenly lightbulb... As I say it's more suited to business travellers who are after consistency and predictability. If you're after something with a bit of an Italian character I'd recommend trying somewhere else. In summary there's nothing wrong with this hotel however if you're staying in Rome on holiday there are plenty of hotels that are cheaper and aren't as impersonal.

Unfortunately, our experience was underwhelming. There was actually nothing wrong with our stay, but we found the staff impersonal and disinterested. On check-in, the receptionist asked us for our passports, handed us our keys, smiled, and said Room 123. That was it! The concierge brought our luggage, smiled, took his tip and left the room. There was no guest directory in the room. In a top-class hotel, I expect someone to tell me where the pool is, what time breakfast is served, what amenities are available, how to turn down the sweltering a/c, etc. Nobody volunteered anything to us except polite smiles. The hotel had a conference group staying, but you'd never know - the bar and lobby were deserted for the entire week of our stay (so it wasn't as if the staff were too busy to give us the time of day). A charming pianist played to an empty room every evening at 8 o'clock. There was no price-list for the minibar, and other reviews here had alerted me to crazy pricing. A nice touch, though - a comp bottle of wine and a bowl of clementines were delivered to our room on the first evening as a welcome gift. For some reason, even though we drank the wine on Day 3, the housekeeper did not take the empty bottle or the empty bowl away for the duration of our stay. Our room was very quiet and very comfortable (though too hot for the first few days). It was turned down every night, all toiletries were provided, and although a tad dusty after a few days, it was perfectly fine. On checking out, we asked for our luggage to be brought down. We stood by the concierge desk in the lobby waiting for 20 minutes (no, really) and all that time, nobody asked if we were okay. When we reminded the concierge, he immediately summoned one of the three bell-hops who was standing around waiting for something to do. We could not have been more obvious - we were the only people in the lobby at the time. Like the previous reviewer, we found January perfect weather-wise - 10-12F, dry and crisp. The Galleria Borghese was wonderful, and we ate in some great restaurants. We did not eat a single meal in the hotel over our seven days - we felt happier spending our money in charming, atmospheric, reasonably-priced restaurants where the staff were interested in our business.

The key things you look for in a hotel, whatever the star rating or location, are comfort, privacy and above all SILENCE in your room at night. Our first room was 225 - avoid this side of the hotel at all costs unless you intend to return to your room after 3am. The club outside the hotel called the George (see my photo taken at 3am - when highly exasperated as well as exhausted) did it's best to play the worst 100 songs of all time accompanied by amplified whoops and cheers of obviously highly inebriated clientele. Great. Next morning I asked to be moved which the staff did without any problem and most courteously although they offered no apology for what must be an all too common occurrence. Unfortunately we got DOWNGRADED to a less opulent room - but it was worth it as this was wonderfully quiet at night. Not sure what The HEAVENLY BED is all about. Fairly ordinary hotel bed as far as I could see and certainly not a selling point. The location is good for the Barberini Gallery and the Borghese Gallery and park and the Trevi fountain and Spanish steps are only about 10 minutes walk away. A previous report suggests asking the Taxi to drop you off at the Hard Rock Cafe as the prices go up when you ask for the hotel. We found no evidence for this at all having used both drop off points on a number of occasions. Either way it will only cost 7 Euros to the Colisseum, 8 to Travastere and 9-10 to get to the Basilica. Hardly bank breaking if you're paying 300 Euros a night for the room! General advice: *January is a great time to visit as the weather, while cool, is like a spring day in the UK, but sunny. Additionally - no-one else seems to be there so there are no queues worth speaking of for anything! *Don't eat locally unless you want to pay 150 Euros for a 2 course meal! Get an 8 Euro Taxi to Travastere and eat & drink like a king for 40 Euros. We did both - and guess which we preferred!

Couple of things to be \"aware\" of: Local Taxi Drivers WILL charge you move to get to the hotel as they aware of the \"status\" of those guests choosing to stay at the hotel. In multiple instances we experienced higher cab fare when requesting transportation to the hotel from other parts of Rome (e.g. Vatican to Hotel, etc.). I would suggest telling cab drivers to take you to the \"Hard Rock Rest.\" as it's across the street and you'll probably pay alot less for the cab fare. Also the hotel automatically charges each room $1.00 Euro for UNICHEF without asking you. If you would like them to \"remove\" the charge they will upon your request. In my opinion, the hotel shouldn't automatically add any \"donation\" to your bill, it should be added upon request. For those Platinum members, I received an upgraded room over looking the front part of the hotel with a sitting area. The \"ameniti\" was a choice of wine, fruit bowl, TV Movie Credit or Mini-bar credit.....no starwood point bonus.

Upgraded to a remodeled room, very contemporary with a great bathroom, specially the shower. You want to take a 2 hour bath. (There are 2 types of rooms in this hotel: the traditional ones and the remodeled ones). A personal opinion about the heavenly beds: They do not feel the same than in other westins in the US that I have been to. Matress is too hard, pillows and sheets do not feel the same than in other Westins. Had the same experience in Florence at the Excelsior there. Whens asked at the front desk in this hotel, they assured me they were heavenly beds. My wife and I both agreed that they are not nearly the same than other Westins we have stayed before. Am I the only one who think this? I dont know but I can assure you I have slept in better beds. Another personal comment: the hotel is so big that you lose the personal touch: 3 concierges at the same desk (you are almost assured you will have to wait in line) were very helpful but impersonal. You are simply one more guest of the hundreds ones. Also, prices in the hotel are ridicolous: Breakfast is 40 euros, mini bar coke I beleive is 7 euros. Crazy. A very helpful thing is that they returned our car to the renting company (we drove from Florence throught Tuscany. Great trip for 3 days). We got to the hotel and they took over. GREAT!!! Every hotel worker is always smilling and willing to help with anything: Taxis, towels, etc. In general a fantastic hotel. Tips in Rome: You are going to walk big distances, but this is what is all about in this city. Watching other people and just walk everywhere. We would only take a taxi late at night when we went for dinner after taking a shower and after walking the whole day. There is a supermarket at the subterraneum passage to the subway to Piazza di Spagna from Via Venetto. The passage is accross the street from the Marriot Hotel 1 block from the Westin. We bought water, sodas and even things for breakfast that we kept in the minibar refrigerator. Great. From all the restaurants I went I am only going to recommend 2. Great value (less than 60 euros for 2 people and great food: Assinocotto in trastevere and here comes my big tip: GRAPPOLLO D'ORO ZAMPANO in the piazza dela Cancelleria near campo de Fiori. WOW!!! Food in this 2 places was extraordinay and not the tipical pasta with sauces that you find everywhere else. Prices were very good too. Ditirambo was a dissapointment although came with great reccomendations. I didn't like it. Another writer gave me the tip about transportation to the airport. It worked great so I am going to repeat it: M.L.M. (tel: --------) is a company that for 35 euros will get you to the airport in a big Mercedes van. (Hotel wanted to charge 90 euros). For shopping, if you cannot afford the prices at the via Condotti (you have to walk around here anyways to watch the beautiful people), there is a street near the vatican called via Cola di Rienzo (finishes in the piazza de Popolo. Less crowded and you can find some less expensive and beautiful clothes. Via del Corso is very crowded but near Piazza de Popolo have stores with good prices.There is a mall called Cinecitta but it was dissapointing and far (you can get there in the subway). Ah..the subway....AVOID. Too crowded and dangerous. A friend of ours had her purse cut. She only had a bottle of water so nothig was stolen but this experts robbers wil do anything. Be careful. Almost every taxi we took tried to overcharge us one way or another. One added a suplement at a time when no suplements were legal. Many of them took longer routes than necessary. Just be aware that this happens. Buy your ticket for the Colisseum at the Palatino. There is no line and the ticket includes both things. For the Vatican you are going to wait in line because of the security check. Get there early and hope for the best. St Peters Cathedral is free. It i worth to get there early in the morning and you will walk there quick and will have the whole cathedral for you to admire In general I thought Rome was a great city with beautiful people (Ok....beautiful women, wow!!!), great shopping, lots of history, great food.

Besides it is wonderful fun to sit on the sofas outside of the Doney restuarant, drink a glass of champagne and watch the beautifully dressed Italiens stroll by. That experience alone is worth a few euros more -- that and the absolutely chaming bar staff. Another plus is that many of the top sights -- Spanish steps, Villa Borghese -- and terrific restaurants are reachable by foot. La Terrezza at the Eden, for example, is only 300 meters away.

We are blessed to travel extensively for pleasure (no kids yet) and try to stay in the best 4.5 or 5 star hotels. I had extensively researched hotels 8 months before our trip to find the perfect one (this was our first trip to Italy). I picked the hotel based on: size, star rating, opulence, location, and service. Also, we have had wonderful experiences at many Starwood hotels and thus wanted to try another one. I did not book the Hotel Eden or Hotel de Russie, for the Excelsior was pictured as having more \"old world charm/luxury\" and Via Veneto seemed to be described as a beautiful street/area. Also, prices more affordable at Excelsior for what you actually get (accomodation size, etc). Everything met our expectations except our initial room accomodations. We arrived at 12:45pm on a Thursday and they said our room was ready. I had booked a grand luxe room, with requests for high floor and view over Via Veneto. I had corresponded extensively with their reservations supervisor by e-mail in order to book the perfect room. There is a virtual tour of the grand luxe on their website (which the supervisor confirmed was correct) and she added in her e-mails that many are located on high floors and they're 40sq/meters (430 square feet). Well upon being shown to our room, I immediately realized we were given a superior double (big difference in decor and size), however it was on the 6th floor (highest) and overlooking Via Veneto. I kindly told the lady (who worked the front desk and was escorting us) that this was not a grand luxe room as described/pictured on website. She \"ADAMENTLY\" stated that is was and that we were given the nicest one due to our Starwood loyalty. Basically, she was flat out \"LYING\" TO US and I could easily prove it!! I also showed her all my correspondence with the hotel directly (e-mails I had printed) and she still continued to lie. When I kindly asked to be shown a grand luxe room, she stated we were already in one. I then asked to speak to the reservations supervisor in person. After making a phone call, the lady said that person was at lunch and would be returning in 40 minutes. She then went on to say that the hotel was sold out and this was a very, very nice room we were being given. I then lost my patience and demanded to be taken back downstairs to wait for the supervisor or even better a manager. She said if we went back downstairs we could risk losing our room since the hotel was sold out (thus having no room at all). Also, she said the hotel only had \"1\" manager and he was busy. At this point it was a good thing my husband was there to calm me down - obviously I was fuming at this point. I told her this was \"TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE\" and we've \"NEVER\" had \"ANY\" problems at a Starwood hotel, much less one this big!! I told her they either needed to get me the correct room or find one at the St.Regis (their sister property/1 mile away). If not then I would gladly seek out other 5 star accomodations in the city, who I'm sure would be happy to take the 540Euro/night plus tax that I had planned on spending. She then said there was nothing she could do and insisted once again that we were in the right room. Well, I took my luggage downstairs and immediately called the manager at the Florence Excelsior where we had just stayed (Best Hotel Ever - see review) from the concierge desk. I wanted advice on how to proceed since obviously no one was coming forth to help us. The mgr. in Florence said he had no control over that hotel ( I already knew that) but would make a phone call immediately so we were not left stranded. Well, to wrap up this already long story - our lunch was bought and we were upgraded magically to a GORGEOUS SUITE overlooking the Via Veneto, however on the 1st floor ( I took it because I was tired of dealing with the situation) and the manager (Rooms Division Manager) was very accomodating and excuded excellent customer service!! However, this was all after being led to yet another room that was not like the one on the website (right decor, but smaller). The mgr. explained that the one pictured on the virtual tour was actually not a \"grand luxe\" but a higher room category and there was ONLY \"4\" in the hotel/ none overlooking Via Veneto; also, they're reserved for families since they are the only connecting rooms. He then said the website would need to be changed in order to not mislead people (too late this time!). I found it ever so ironic that these other rooms magically became available, especially a junior suite - which had to be at least 550 square feet plus private large foyer area (next door/connected to Royal Suite!) Fortunately, the 1st floor room was not noisy at night and not even that terrible during the day - I was very surprised. We were able to walk to things very easily/quickly. Only downside to location - no cheap eating places anywhere close, which I somewhat already knew but was hoping there would at least be a pizzeria or geleteria on a nearby side street. The rest of our stay went smoothly (I had a package that included daily buffet brk. - which is priced at 42E/each, OUCH!). The food was average at best, so do make sure it's included or eat elsewhere. Upon returning to Rome, I will either stay at the St.Regis (which we visited, though location not ideal) or another 5 star hotel that is similar size. Westin obviously books a lot of groups/conferences and that is why I think they tried to dump the lower room category on us. I will definately continue my Starwood loyalty for this is the first problem we've ever encountered, and we've recently have stayed at 6 of their properties (all 5 stars) in various destinations and our experiences were \"WONDERFUL\". Hopefully this will never happen again. My advice: definately correspond with the hotel directly before booking in order to get the exact room that you're paying for. I don't mind paying top dollar as long as I receive the right accomodations/service. Please feel free to e-mail with any questions on this hotel or Rome (great city!).

I however, am more inclined to stay in newer, more modern hotels. The hotel is in an excellent location. I highly recommend to get the breakfast plan; otherwise, you will pay an arm and 2 legs for breakfast in this hotel.

As we were getting married whilst in Rome we would be spending 9 nights the hotel of our choice- it needed to be special. I have been fortunate enough to have stayed at some exceptional hotels throughout the world over the past few years most recently the famous Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, the Ritz in London to name a few. This hotel offered by far the best attention to detail and customer service I have recieved, which simply made our wedding/honeymoon all the more memorable. We had been allocated a room on the 5th floor above Via Veneto however this room had a more traditional look to it and I was aware that they had more modern rooms in the hotel after there refurbishment. I asked to change and they were more than happy to do so, nothing is too much trouble for them whether it be reception staff, in the restaurant or at the pool. As an earlier reviewer commented they don`t offer an iron, bit frustrating , instead they offer a pressing service- \u20ac8.70 for a pair of trousers as an example! My tip- hang them in the \"heavenly\" shower! The beds truly are \"heavenly\" it`s not just a marketing gimmick. The air con is great and needed at this time of year. The hotel is absolutely spotless wherever you look. Staff in all areas are dressed immaculately, true Italian style. One nice surprise which I haven`t seen at any other hotels is that if you have paid for breakfast in your room rate, you can order it in the room at no charge. If you order it for 7.00am , it will be there at 7.00am! Many of the staff were here before Westin took over and are truly proud of the hotels heritage and place in Rome`s history, does this make a difference to the way in which they treat you - I think so. I have to mention Jessica on reception she was exceptional, her father worked at the hotel for 40 years, she is in her 13th year, the hotel is home to her. What an asset to the the hotel and to Westin. As you would expect it`s not particularly cheap to get your trousers pressed \u20ac8.70 or have a cup of tea in your room \u20ac8.00 but you won`t feel short changed beacause everything is done to perfection. We`ll be going back it`s just too good.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bevchris", "ReviewID": "UR3605165", "Content": "Our stay here was awesome.

We got a massage the first night, which proved to be a wise decison, it really fought off the blahs from a 13 hr. flight. The spa was not quite what we expected, more like a gym, and a little pricey, but the massages were great and just what we needed! Carry euro, as you cannot include gratuities in the bill as you can here. It was also helpful to have currency exchange right downstairs at the concierge, and the rate was fair.

We chose taxi because of the horror stories about the metro. But the metro is a short walk away. Many excellent restaurants are nearby, but not much souvenier shopping. The hotel was a welcome treat after longs days of walking around the many sites of Rome. The wonderful soaking tub and the Heavenly bed was just like home. The front desk staff were all very accommodating and friendly. I asked for a room change because of the street noise below, and was given a much bigger room that was indeed quiet.

We usually opt for smaller, less fancy places so this was a treat. Since breakfast was not included for free stays, we went across the street and around the corner to several little places for the Italian cappuchino or expresso and pastry breakfast (2 to 3 euros as opposed to hotel's 30 euro probably great breakfast). We did splurge on drinks before dinner (not cheap) which included some very good nibbles. We did not eat dinner in the hotel since there are many small and great restaurants nearby. I am sure the hotel could suggest many off the beaten path places but we were taken out to dinner with locals 1 night, too tired to care the 1st night (ate around the corner, it was fine) and tried an internet restaurant the 3rd night. The Galleria Borghese is a short walk away and worth a visit-you can make the necessary reservation before leaving home-we saw it late the day we arrived- fatigue and all-easy to do from this hotel. You can also get to the subway a short walk from the hotel. Beware and pay attention to your guidebooks, my brother-in-law got his pocket picked on the subway on the way to the vatican. The rest of us used a few more precautions but did not go crazy worrying before or after this incident. Lastly, our luggage got lost between London and Rome. It arrived in the middle of the night and when I went down about 8 in the morning to ask if the hotel had heard anything, they had the luggage but were waiting so as not to wake us!
