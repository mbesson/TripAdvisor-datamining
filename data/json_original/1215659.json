Do NOT under any circumstances eat at the a la carte restaurant. Dreadful food, shocking service. Awful awful. Cannot comment on the buffet as we didn't try that.

The mezzanine floor was nice as it had a few tables, easy chairs and served good food and drinks away from the main restaurant. Nice and peaceful and it had free Wi-Fi. Get a room with a view of the Harbour if you can, if you use Flight Centre to sort your trip out you will automatically get a Harbour view room.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cWhere did the harbour go?\u201d", "Author": "tourismplanner", "ReviewID": "UR123676741", "Content": "Don't expect a harbour view, 50% of the rooms face onto the rear of adjecent buildings while the harbour itseld continues to recede into the distance as reclamation marched ever onwards to Kowloon;s shoreline.

I have enjoyed my stay and most the harbour view from the room. its offers good breakfast and offers almost all services a five star can offer. now it has become more expensive but still its value for money.
