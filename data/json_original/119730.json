The hotel is very secluded and semi private. Right in the marina on the breakwater but still close enough to walk to Starbucks in the morning. There are several good restaurants close by as well. The hotel itself is landscaped like a tropical jungle and maintained very well. Although it is an older property it has been updated many times and is very comfortable without being worn. The room was large and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was decent sized as was the closet and coffee area. The heating and AC was a bit aged, either on or off with very little control but the weather is so temperate in SD that I only used it to heat the room for about 20 minutes when I got in it then turned it off completely the rest of the night. The restaurant was decent and the bar very lively. Many locals (those that live on the boats in the marina) party in the bar as there are bands nearly every night. A quiet drink and conversation is out of the question as the volume is fairly high. I could definitely stay here again for a quiet weekend away.

The landscaping is lovely, but the buildings and parking are a joke. We reserved a king room and were told we had been \"upgraded\". We were given a room with two full (not queen) beds. I see from other reviews this is a common ploy at Humphrey's. We went back and insisted on a king room and were given one. Both rooms we saw had been \"renovated\" but they still had an outdated feel, with cheap carpet and noisy air conditioners. The linens were of good quality and plentiful, however. The parking seems to be a big problem too. I don't think the charge for parking is unfair, but if they charge they need to provide a space. Everyone seems to be crammed together at one end. Additionally, the shuttle driver wanted to park in the spot we were in. Instead of just asking us to move (or clearly marking the space) he made up a story about it being an illegal spot so we would move. He then parked in the \"illegal\" spot 30 seconds later.

King bed, big flat screen, frige, microwave, and great water pressure...even in the morning, very clean, very nice. I had a room looking over the pool. There is a patio outside of the room surrounded by shrubs so I had a sense of privcacy inspite of the pool. The Inn is 15 minutes from the Zoo, Sea World, Downtown, LaJolla, the ocean and great shopping. Also, I was just a 30 minute drive, without traffic, to the Otay border crossing. Park for ten dollars a day, someone from work picked me up and two seconds to cross sthe border into Mexico. Coming home at the end of the day was a bit different. I was dropped at the border gate, three nights no line to cross, over in two minutes and then a two block walk to my car. The other two nignts there was a very long line waiting to cross. Thirty minutes in line with my Kindle wasn't bad at all. Many people but it moves really fast. So, what I'm saying is this is a vacation resort but the most relaxing and enjoyable place for a business traveler. The Humphreys Half Moon restaurant is fabulous and withing walking distance are sever other equally GREAT places of reasonable price. Downtown is a great place to go, the Gaslamp area, Little Italy...terrific restaurants but a bit pricey for the business traveler. The staff? Never saw them. I left my room in the morning and when I came back everything was in place. I never locked up a thing of mine and nothing was touched or disturbed.

When I tried to speak to her, she was VERY Rude to me as well. I was later told other guests from my wedding tried to make their way to the restaurant/bar and had terribly rude service as well.

I tried speaking to a manager of the hotel that evening (yes, still in my wedding dress!) who did nothing besides look at me like I was an idiot.

By researching deals and ratings, I found Humphreys and there was a really good 48 hour sale going on. The reviews were pretty respectable so I settled on it. Check in was really smooth, and the front desk was very helpful. They gave a map so that we could easily find our room, they gave us a menu so we could see some of the dishes that their restaurant offered (Which was good so that I could see if it was worth going there since I don't like seafood), and we heard recommendations being made as to other things we should do whilst there. After reading reviews from others at different hotels, I was relieved that I didn't have to prove that I had paid for the room or anything (although I had the paperwork all ready to go just in case). The place itself was not very far from everything, and the view of the marina was absolutely beautiful. We didn't see any of the concerts by the bay while we were there but the area was big and hopefully we'll do that next time. PARKING: We found the room, and on a Wednesday we had no problem parking near our room at all (Parking is an extra ten dollars a night). Parking did get a bit crazy by Thursday night and Friday, so that's when you'll want to get back a bit early (although the walk isn't far at all it's just less convenient when you have to check out in the morning). THE GROUNDS: The grounds are very nice, with one exception being the area Caution-stripped out but that didn't bother me. I felt really safe while I was here. We were able to walk the grounds at night and we didn't feel nervous at all. We saw other people but there were no rowdy and loud voices, suspicious activity or anything like that. The only time there was a good amount of noise was in the morning because people were waking up and whatnot. There was a small fitness center located under the Ballroom by the bay, which was perfect during the week especially when everything was quite empty. The pool was unexpectedly big and I was very happy with the effect. Make sure to walk around and find the parrots that hang out above the koi pond! ROOM: The room itself was a renovated Premier King room. The bed was comfortable, the TV was a good size and had HDMI so I could plug in my phone for my own movies. There were three lamps and each turned on differently, but they were set up in a very convenient way. There is a complimentary Nintendo Gamecube in the room that can be played 60 minutes for around 7 dollars (games can be chosen on screen), which I thought was really funny and cool. The decoration was very pretty and I enjoyed the white bedspread as opposed to the cheap looking floral you see in other places. The bathroom was nice and the fan was really quiet. The bed was wonderfully spacious, although it wasn't as comfortable as back home... Now I want a king size bed. I do wish I could have found a TV guide or something since the channels were completely different than they are in the Inland Empire so I had to go through one by one to find anything. Not a big deal, just something I thought I would mention. The little patio area was wonderful because it was covered by plants and things so that we had privacy, whereas there were others that were just completely out in the open. I was very happy and surprised to see that they had a mini fridge and a microwave in the room. They came in handy the entire stay, and the fridge wasn't bulked up with anything which meant that I didn't have to remember what was mine and what was extra. Housekeeping did an amazing job every time they were there. No old towels were left, and the first day we used pretty much all of the little shampoo and conditioner and they were replaced with twice as many bottles the next day without our asking for it. Oh, and ice being free was great! LOBBY: Check out time being at 12? Marvelous! I had plenty of time to wake up normally, get ready for my day and check out. Check out was smooth and quick, there were smiles and more tips from the woman at the front desk.

We chose this hotel based on the amazing location, and equally as important...the tropical setting which was in stark contrast with the typical Vegas views. The half moon was beautifully landscaped with a lush Polynesian/Hawiian/tropical feel, and the rooms were very clean and simply decorated to match the vibe. Also, the staff was both helpful and friendly. Views from right outside were amazing, day and night. We were worried about noise from the airport due to viewing google maps, however, we did not hear one plane the entire time, and could only hear military choppers when out at shoreline park, maybe once or twice. It is a very relaxing and peaceful place to be. Now the bad. Maybe we are spoiled from our bed at home, but the beds were the least comfortable we have slept on in years, and this is after driving and sightseeing since 430 am. Also, the pool and spa were relaxing, but could have and should have been cleaner, as some algae was present, but we soaked anyway, and so did several others. Conclusion: definitely not 5star luxury, but a great place to stay if you do not need to be in the fanciest hotel, but want to relax in peace. Very convenient location, we would go back if we knew the beds were better.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ky", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "scubapro", "ReviewID": "UR123037858", "Content": "We stayed eight nights from the 23rd of Dec - 31st.

She also tipped us off on a quick med place nearby and some other things. The room was nice, had a view over the marina. Large sitting area a pocket door separates the bedroom from the kitchen and sitting area. Nice bath, marble etc. Just a plain shower but it was fine. They will charge you 10 dollars a day for parking, however you could park on the street for free if you wanted to and would only have to walk a short distance to your room if you wanted to save a few bucks. There are gates going in and out of the parking lot which are kind of a hassle so street parking would not really have been much more of an inconvenience. They had specials every night at the lounge with good music acts every night. The only thing I didn't like about that was the fact that the place was pretty small, the band very loud and it was pretty dark. Not my thing for dining. The restaurant itself is good. We had a couple of meals there and it was fine. Nothing to go crazy about but for Shelter Island it was good. So was Brigantines right up the street. The room cleaning service was prompt every morning and they always did a great job. We looked at the pool but it was only about 65 degrees each day and there were people over there early in the morning laying out in the 55 degree weather? Beats me? They must have been from the north pole. All in all it was a great QUIET location away from the hustle and bustle, but not far away. I'll be back for sure.

My husband tried calling them but they would not answer their phone so he had to go stand in the long line again to get soap. The air conditioning in the room was a joke. It provided more noise than air. We would be sweating all night, then walk out in the morning to discover it was actually cool outside. The ocean winds serve as a better cooling system.

You can honestly tell that the staff love their jobs and I cannot emphasize enough how much I felt like I was at an island resort instead of being boxed in at a cookie cutter hotel. For rooms, I recommend getting one that is towards the pier, and the suites looked amazing. I was on a budget though and stayed in a regular room. Despite the price (super cheap), the room was still very spacious, and included all the amenities that a traveler needs there for a 4 night stay.

Brian at the bell stand got me on a sweet pink beach cruiser (complementary!) For an hour long ride around Shelter Island & into Point Loma. The putting greens looked well maintained although I didn't make use of them. The pool & spa area are very pretty, very tropical setting, perfect for relaxing or playing table tennis. Junior suite has a seperate seating space~ table & chairs (slight wear & tear on upholstery) sofa (pull out sleeper? I didn't check) coffee table, reading lamp & big flat screen tv. Balcony was clean, 2 chairs & small table. Cool feature in the room was a bar area~ microwave, sink & fridge. Bathroom was well lit & ventilated, nice massaging shower head, soft but small towels. Washroom was outside of the shower/toilet, not a fan of that design feature, but no points lost for it. King size bed had great big fluffy pillows, extra blankets & pillows in the closet and another flat screen tv. Thank you Humphrey's for getting rid of the ick hotel comforters & having only fresh white sheets~ I always appreciate that. Parking is available, will fill on concert nights and is a little tight if you are parking a larger vehicle. Getting on/off property during concerts means you are walking through ticket only areas, but we were never stopped or asked to go in a different direction. Hotel staff & security were clearly visable & available to help get around during the show. Cigarette butts litter some areas of this nonsmoking property, shame, and the same room service dish sat outside my neighbors door from my check in at 5pm to my checkout at 8am.

Enjoyed showing our little guy the divers cleaning barnacles off the boats just below us. Had breakfast each morning in the restaurant; white tablecoths and a table at the window looking out on the marina. The servers always remembered our son's name and gave him lots of attention. We also had dinner there our first night (stayed 3 nights), and though we were nervous about taking our toddler into a fine dining restaurant in the evening, they were so welcoming that they put us and our son at ease, helped keep him content, and other guests actually came over to compliment us on our happy little guy. So glad we tried it; the food was delicious and they were extraordinarily accomodating of our modification requests due to our special diets.

We enjoyed it thoroughly and would highly recommend it for a relaxing vacation. The atmosphere is that of the \"Tiki Culture\" so popular in the 1950s and 60s. I could see how it would not be everyone's cup of tea. But I really enjoyed this and found it to be a refreshing alternative to modern, corporate hotel compounds. Humphrey's Half Moon Inn is located on Shelter Island which is a narrow spit of land jutting into San Diego Harbor. On one side of the island is a very large boat marina. On the other side is the harbor. Although our room faced the main road, there was minimal traffic during the day and almost none at night. We could also sometimes hear airliners across the harbor at the airport and an occasional Navy helicopter during the day. But this was far from bothersome and non-existent by bed time. Near the hotel are multiple restaurants within walking distance or a very short drive. We tried the Humphrey's restaurant for dinner on our first night. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. It was OK at best and overpriced for the food quality and quantity; and we used 25% off coupons provided by the front desk. Also, the decor is the proverbial, sterile, contemporary ensemble of gray, beige and chrome (yawn). Our table was right against a very large window which should have provided a spectacular view of the marina and lights of nearby Point Loma. Alas, the window glass is highly reflective and offers mostly muted, mirror images of the restaurant. I expect the views are quite nice during the day. In stark contrast, directly next to the restaurant is a club with nightly music. The jazz band playing there during our dinner was amazing and threw down well into the night. This place looks like a lot of fun. One of the best features of Humphrey's is the pool. It's much larger than I would have expected and sits inside the inn's lushly landscaped courtyard. Since it was built many years ago, it has a nine foot deep end. (Completely absent in modern hotel pools.) Although diving isn't technically allowed, consider yourself warned and have fun jumping into the deep end. Or, you can casually splash about in the larger shallow end. Directly next to the pool is a good-sized spa and a pool bar. Strangely, the pool bar shuts down early unless a concert is going on. I can only assume they prefer guests visit the night club or restaurant for drinks. Food is also available at the pool bar. Our room was not large, but was of adequate size and featured a good quality king bed with nice linens. The entire inn appears to be of post and beam construction with attractive wood features inside. The squeaky-clean bathroom fixtures were modern and of very high quality. Our room had no air conditioning; only a fan. We were a bit concerned about this initially, but soon learned the breezes off the bay keep Shelter Island beautifully pleasant during the day and downright cool at night; even in late July! My favorite part of our first-floor room was the small, semi-secluded patio. On one end of the room were three attractive wooden blinds stretching from floor-to-ceiling. Pushing these blinds to the side revealed a sliding glass door and an outdoor sitting area with a bamboo screen on one side and tropical plants on two sides. I thoroughly enjoyed reading on this patio in the absolutely spectacular weather of Shelter Island. Hint: if you too would like to read on the patio, bring a book light as there is no lighting in the area after dark. Every member of the Humphrey's staff we encountered was pleasant and polite. We purchased discount tickets to local attractions at the front desk which was very convenient. You can even check out a bike which is complementary for two hours. Be aware there is a $10.00 per day parking fee, but parking is quite scarce on Shelter Island.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cComfy, laid-back, somewhat retro and very unique\u201d", "Author": "zhdoerck", "ReviewID": "UR115874996", "Content": "We stayed at Humphrey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for a mini staycation, partly because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always wanted to stay there, but mostly to escape some long-term house guests for a night.

There was nothing wrong with it per se, but there are certainly better breakfasts to be had for the money (though the view and ambiance were quite nice).

The \"junior suite\" - the only option available when I booked over the telephone - was a grim, narrow room on the first floor just off the public entrance to \"Humphrey's Concert Bowl\". Furnished in what can only be described as Early Yard Sale, it featured a couple of hastily mounted flat screen TVs and a bed lumpier than your Aunt Bernice's lap. While advertised online as having a balcony overlooking the marina, this ghastly little cell instead boasted a view of the parking lot; the only way to actually SEE the Marina was to stand up and peer over the trucks and cars lined up directly beside our patio doors. I had arranged for an \"artisanal cheese plate\" to be delivered to the room as a surprise for My Beloved; we found it wrapped in cellophane and stuck in the back of the mini bar fridge. I'm hardly a cheese snob, but while a few slices of cheddar and a handful of walnuts might be considered \"artistic\" in some circles, we couldn't really enjoy it in any event, as there was neither cracker nor bread provided.... We returned to the Front Desk, hoping at the very least to move to a part of the hotel that didn't allow non-stop vehicle exhaust to billow in through the windows, but was informed by the pleasant and apologetic young lady that the place was sold out for the weekend and while we could move four doors along the hallway to a similar room, they had nothing else available. Price was not an object, I should note; I offered to pay an upgrade fee, but the place was full. To make amends, she offered us two free cocktails at the Bar. Now I will admit free booze can go a long way toward making me a happy boy, but in this case, when we finally found the Lounge/Restaurant (stuck in a flat, hideous box at the far end of the admittedly otherwise lovely Polynesian-themed property) the House Band From Hell was in full swing playing cover versions of songs that shouldn't have been written in the first place. Being a Saturday afternoon, the \"joint was jumpin'\" with pale out-of-towners scarfing down chicken wings and jugs of beer; while one is always pleased to see people having fun, the window rattling volume of the music wasn't conducive to the sort of romantic atmosphere we were hoping to find. We decided to try the Pool Bar but discovered it was closed because of the weddings and wasn't to reopen until the following Tuesday. Fortunately, a sweet young Bartendress took pity on us and provided two deliriously potent Mai Tais; these helped the pain considerably. I can't comment on the quality of the food or service at Humphreys, as the rest of the weekend was spent as far away from this gulag as possible, enjoying the various charms of San Diego about which I shall post on other pages - most of these were planned by The Aforementioned Boyfriend and were completely enjoyable. However, suffice it to say that while the hotel property itself is charming, with lush landscape and a reasonably sized pool heated to a comfortable temperature , one should beware of weddings, conventions and anything which bills itself as a \"junior\" something or other. And in future, I shall let The Boyfriend arrange EVERYTHING.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it!\u201d", "Author": "KRBresciano", "ReviewID": "UR106704169", "Content": "I personally loved this place!

The room was updated and reasonably well-appointed and had everything I needed. The in-room safe was large enough for my laptop, small fridge and microwave was perfect for my needs, the windows had been replaced and you can open the windows all the way, to allow fresh air circulation. The upgraded plantation shutters on the windows and closet were a very nice touch. The bed comfort level was so-so, though the linens and pillows were fine. They did a nice job in upgrading the units....not over the top and seemed not to have over-spent but did spend money in the right places. The mattress does need to be replaced at some point though. You could hear loud footsteps and doors banging when neighbors entered their units...but I was willing to put up with it as it was sporadic and of short duration. Bath/shower - got instant hot water, every time. As far as location, I loved it because I could take a nice 1 hour walk along the harbor and marina, everything (Sea World, Balboa Park, Convention Center, Chula Vista, Phil's BBQ, Sushi Ota, Old Town, Olive Tree Market, Cabrillo National Monument, Pacific Beach...were within 15 - 20 minutes), but Coronado Island ended up being about 30 minutes away....probably because I took Harbor to get there..maybe there's a faster way.) Parking was convenient (use your room card key), though it was $10 per day. High speed internet was included in the rooms with no hassle wi-fi connection. The restaurant next door was convenient and food was above average (only had breakfast). The tropical garden was very nice to relax in. I would stay here again, as I would avoid the convention area, downtown and gas lamp area like the plague due to their congestion and touristy-atmosphere. I prefer Shelter Island as it's quiet, relaxing, right next to the water, a very clean area, and felt safe. I avoided staying on Harbor Island as it seemed too close to the airport and I wondered about the air plane traffic and noise. My only disappoint was the General Manager, Sergio. He was a bit cold, aloof and quite frankly, a real departure from what is expected of the gracious attributes typically exhibited by professionals in the hospitality business. I was also a bit turned off housekeeping and maintenance staff's attitude towards conservation. On at least three separate occasions, I found multiple light switches and the AC fan switches in the ON position, after they left the room.

I was here for loads of genealogical research, so was usually gone all day, and wanted to enjoy the room at night. Problem was that certain things that SHOULD have been updated have not. Problem #1- During the day, my room was nice, with a sliding glass door and nice patio onto the tropical courtyard. Wooden louvered shutters slid over the glass doors, providing adequate privacy, so that was good. But at night, it was TOO DARK!! There was only a small desk lamp and a small bedside table lamp. Because the ceilings are wooden-beamed, I assume that overhead fixtures might be a fire hazard. BUT they need some extra floor lamps or something. It is just too dark to be able to do much. And I needed to work on my computer at night to plan what I needed to research the next day. #2- There are VERY FEW outlets in the room. My main problem was that I wanted to be able to research on my computer while watching TV at night. There is ONE outlet along that wall. Meaning TV and computer, or lamp and computer, or lamp and TV. Not all three. With so little light in the room already, I couldn't think about not turning on the lamp at all. So I finally had to set my desk lamp on the nearby occasional chair. #3- I believe one other reviewer mentioned it too. The cable channel selection SUCKS. Out of about maybe 20 channels, you get THREE sports channels, one of which is all Padres. And Fox News. Yay. I was really looking forward to checking out the season premier of White Collar on USA, but they don't get it. Without TNT and the occasional Law and Order there, or a few shows on the Discovery channel, I would have just kept the stupid thing off. There are some really great things about Humphrey's. If they upgraded their cable and got a few more lights in the rooms, I'd go back in a minute.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "spalover30", "Title": "\u201cTropical Paradise in the City\u201d", "Author": "spalover30", "ReviewID": "UR93981276", "Content": "We traveled to San Diego for the MLK weekend and got this hotel on a Travelzoo special discounted rate.

I'd say the location is a bit remote but totally workable if you get a bargain price as we did. The Humphreys Live bar/grill always has live entertainment nightly. The happy hour specials are priced really low. However, don't go there expecting to be in and out as service was very slow. If you're in no rush go there for the h-hour and enjoy the music. We had five plates of food, two drafts, and a glass of nice wine and the total was only about $35 with tax and tip. It is very quiet and peaceful on the grounds. You get a good night's sleep.

My first contact with the hotel was extremely negative. I made hotel reservations in late November. I then kept track of the web site to see if there was a New Year's Eve party we could attend since we were staying at the hotel. They did not have reservations for the party available on Open Table. Finally, I noticed that there was a New Year's Eve party advertised on the web site, so I called the hotel and was told that I couldn't reserve over the phone (even with a credit card) but that they would have to either fax or mail (no e-mail) a form for me to fill out and fax or mail back. Are you kidding me???? I gave the employee my address to mail me the form, and then she put me on hold for 8 minutes -- why? Finally, I hung up and they never mailed me the form so we didn't get to go to the New Year's Eve party, even though we were staying at the hotel. When we got to the hotel we asked the receptionist if there were any reservations for the party available as a staff member had told us there were, and she was quite abrupt and curt and told us we had been misinformed and that there were no reservations available. No apology, no attempt to help us find something else, just a very snotty no. That's okay, we went across the street to Bali Hai, which happily accepted our Open Table reservations and we probably had a better time there anyway. Apart from those two staff people, the other staff members were fine and did a good job. The hotel grounds and room were quite lovely and the bar and restaurant were great-the Happy Hour prices are not to be believed. It is also a nice touch that they let you use bicycles for free two hours per day.

It is clear that the hotel had upgraded certain aspects of the room like the bedding and TV's, but the room remained in poor condition with a hole in the ceiling and a myriad of un-dusted surfaces everywhere, together with mold in the bathroom and a noticeable lack of any decent lighting. Whilst the hotels upgraded rooms may be nice, the suites certainly aren't! Many words come to mind including dark, dated, dingy and dirty.

It is a little kitschy, but in that cool sort of way if you're open to that--and I am. But the ROOM! Absolutely lovely. Based on the other reviews I've read, I'd guess we had one of the remodeled ones, and it was very nicely-appointed. Totally contemporary furnishings, a snuggly blanket laid out on the bed, a big flat-screen TV, convenient fridge, microwave, and of course, coffee maker. The beautiful louvres on the sliding door to the little patio were a high point to this spacious yet cozy-feeling room. We flew in and didn't plan to get a car for our trip (the hotel is a bit out of the way for the downtown tourist destinations), but thanks to the super easy-to-use and very clean MTS public transit in San Deigo, we got around just fine, and inexpensively. I could pull up schedules, stop locations and best of all, *fully planned routes* based on my starting point and destination. Half a mile or so to the nearest stop, and we were cruising around effortlessly, and without having to worry about parking. (Well, MTS combined with the hop-on-hop-off Old Town Trolley tour, purchased online for more savings.) We even stopped at Trader Joe's for actual food items we could make in our room! But I ALSO highly recommend asking the front desk for the menu from Broadway Takeout, which serves and delivers very late into the night. Arriving after 11pm, we thought we'd make due with vending machine booty, but instead, we had a very hot and genuinely-fantastic pizza, with a burger that matched in heat, flavor, and quality... I'll only mention this because in leaving this review, I'm being asked to rate individual elements including sleep quality--and while the bed was nicely comfortable (not too soft, not too hard) the pillows were a little too much. Huge fluffy things which made sitting comfortably to relax watching TV from bed absolutely perfect, they were a little too whiplash-inducing to sleep on. I did without. And I didn't mind so much, actually. Humphrey's had reduced rates thanks to just-after-Labor-Day timing on our part, and we got free tickets to the zoo (which included the tram and sky-bucket thing) with the package we purchased directly from the hotel's website (I don't think this package was offered on Expedia or other conglomerate sites) and by booking through the hotel's direct site, I was also able to surprise my other half with chocolate-dipped strawberries waiting for us in-room on the first night (other options such as a fruit plate, wine & cheese, champagne service are available as well.) The shuttle drivers were delightful, as were the front desk staff. The lounge on-site was pretty cool, and the concert venue looks really fun--we'd like to catch a show on our next visit. Last but not least, the lush tropical feel of the grounds really does transport you to another place, and the pool area, putting green, and ping-pong table are also on our list for future enjoyment. I was expecting cute and a little sweetly-kitschy. I found an absolute gem.

The pool is nice and always clean and you cannot beat the room price & view. Especially in the off season. The renovated rooms have a large, flat screen tv, microwave, refrigerator and free high speed internet. They also have a mailing list where you'll receive great room package deals. The customer service varies. Housekeeping and room service staff are among some of the nicest people I've encountered when traveling. (The room service menu is excellent by the way and the french toast is to die for.) The front desk can be a challenge. They frequently seem to be short handed or have someone a little inept working during the prime check in/out times and if the computer in the business center isn't working, there doesn't seem to be anyone on-site to help.

By that time, there were an additional 6 people behind us - that is NOT an exaggeration! I booked through the hotel's website months ago for a waterview deluxe junior suite. Checking in, the staff starts off \"oh we have some great upgrages for you, we're giving you this larger garden view and pool view suite\" WT . . .! I booked a waterview room so I could see OCEAN, not pool water! I told her thanks, but no thank you, I booked a waterview suite, and that's what I wanted. We did get the waterview room that we asked for, but beware of the location of your room. Ours was closest to the end, nearest to the restaurant, in building A.

I thought the walls were too thin - hallway noise, but that's pretty typical in most hotels, but you could hear when our \"neighbor\" was moving things around, we think, in their closet. The patio was really too small to sit out on all the time or even comfortably (it was one of their diagonal ones), plus the chairs looked really too filthy to sit on - I used towels to cover them just so we wouldn't feel the ick factor. We did enjoy the view immensely, and is the only reason we're giving three stars instead of the one star that I wanted to give.

You could hear everything through the walls, including the people next door sneezing. As a result, we actually slept on the pull out sofa in the living room one night becuase it was so noisy. Another night an alarm was going off in another room and my husband had to call security to shut it off. The clincher was when we received a voice mail on our cell phone telling us that they made an error and didn't have a suite available for us that night or the next. Their solution was to have someone move our stuff to the adjoining hotel where they had a suite available. Since they called at 11am and we were out of town for the day, we weren't thrilled about having hotel staff pack our bags. We insisted that we weren't moving and they would have to find another option for us. A few minutes later they told us they had worked it out and we could stay in the room. It was frustrating that they made an error and though they were apologetic, we had to fight to stay in the suite. Some of the staff were very good but a few were quite rude.

There is free street parking but it has time limits to it. The view across the bay from our room at the front of the hotel was beautiful at night with San Diego all lit up. By day it was possible to see the USS Midway with binoculars plus the ferries and cruise ships. Found the bed to be really comfortable but the pillows thin and full of lumps! The top of the plug plunger in the washbasin kept coming off and the plug hole looked a bit rusty. More then time for a complete makeover. John Legend was in concert whilst we were here although being Brits we had never heard of him - it was possible to sit round the pool and listen to the concert for free. Would we come back again? Yes for the actual grounds and views, no for the rooms, even the carpet was 'walking' near the bathroom entrance - very easy to trip if you were a bit unsteady on your feet.

We always have a great relaxing time. What makes Humprey's our choice is the suites. We have and teen and elementary girls and two 2 year old twins. A standard room just doesn't cut it anymore. Having lots of room and a full kitchen makes for a much more pleasant stay.We booked a Grand marina suite for the first week of August. When we arrived, the room was a mess! The carpet was dirty and there were several large red stains (looked like spilled drinks). The patio was covered in mashed in bread and food, and there were half empty water bottles and dozens and dozens of cigarette butts. Okay, dirty floors and cig butts and not cool when you have two toddlers! We called the front desk and someone came and cleaned up some (not all) of the mess outside. I talked to someone at the front counter who sounded sorry, but didn't really do anything. She said she would tell the manager. The first night was awful. My wife walked around in white socks and after a couple of hours the bottoms were BLACK. It was so bad we talked about leaving the next morning and just going home. That night I read the postings on tripadvisor and saw that Dawn Sanders responded to a few. The next morning my wife and I asked to meet with Dawn in private. I explained what had happened and our disappointment in our favorite hotel. Dawn was genuinely concerned, explained that the suites had not yet been renovated. I told her that the room was okay...it just needed a real good cleaning and that the cleaning staff didn't seem motivated to fix problems that were pointed out. Dawn understood and asked for a chance to make it right or send us to another property for the rest of the week. While we were out Dawn had our carpets cleaned with a \"dry foam\" that made a huge difference. The red stains were all but gone and out feet stayed clean when walking on the carpet. I think they should clean the carpets at least once a week. Here's the nice part. I specifically told Dawn that the money really wasn't the issue for us...we just wanted a nice vacation in a clean hotel with our kids and we would pay more to stay elsewhere if need be. But after the room was cleaned to our satisfaction Dawn knocked half off our first night's stay. And then send a nice fruit/cookie/coffee platter to our room one of the nights (a REAL hit with the kids). They also sent a note offering us a free in room movie that week. All in all, Dawn KNOWS how to take care of customers. She couldn't make the room perfect (it is older...) but she went above and beyond in making us feel liked valued guests. I ate at the restaurant a couple of times with the older girls that week...a bit pricey, but really good! On our last day we checked out and Dawn was there. I asked for another 25% discount voucher because we were going to grab a quick lunch with all the kids and then drive home. After settling the bill, Dawn gave me a certificate that paid for lunch for everyone. We already were happy with the hotel...we already paid the bill. But Dawn bought us lunch on the way out anyway. Again, Dawn Sanders is a great asset to Humphrey's! We WILL be back! The moral of the story is this: if you have ANY issues, don't complain, don't grumble, and don't keep it to yourself. Let Dawn know and I guarantee she will do everything to fix the problem and make you feel valued as a customer and guest.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey BC", "Title": "\u201cA Big Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "bbkbcbkb", "ReviewID": "UR39405563", "Content": "We were in room 439 and it was not like the positive writeups and pictures.

While the new hotel was beautiful it was extremely expensive and ultimately not as kid friendly as Humphreys was. The staff at Humphreys went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. I visited Humphreys a day ahead of our check in to make sure we were getting a room that would work well for our family - we had reserved a suite and a regular room and wanted to make sure the kids were fairly close to us for safety purposes. I called the next day and the reservationist was able to share with me the rooms that had been assigned to us and really put my anxiety to rest. She did her best to put the kids close to us and gave us a room we were thrilled with - the view was great and we were more than satisfied. We checked in that afternoon and the kids were thrilled with the tropical atmosphere of the entire hotel.

The \"Ritz\" attitude was terribly at odds with the level of service and the reality of cleanliness and maintenance of our room. Our niece and nephew were in another room where their dirty wine glasses from Friday evening were still in the room on Sunday afternoon.

The location of the hotel is in a very nice boating/yachting community with several great restaurants (we ate at Brigante) within walking distance. Also, the hotel is maybe 15 minutes from the airport and very easy to find. We arrived for check-in early and just expected to dump off our luggage and sight see a bit, but wonderfully our room was all ready and we could check-in. The desk staff were very courteous and kind and allowed us to choose between a courtyard or city view. The hotel has a very fun tropical theme with a beautiful courtyard and pool area -- great for playing in the water with the family or for sunbathing. The view from our room was gorgeous and we could see the city lights at night. We expected to pay for parking as this is the case with most of the hotels in the area and I was warned of this on my reservation -- there is public parking across the street for the thrifty. The only downfall was our room. We reserved a junior suite and the room was small and the furnishings were very dated. The room was in Bldg A and was in desperate need of an update (furnishings/wallpaper/comforter) and strangely you enter the suite through the bedroom not the living room area and room set-up was definitely awkward. The room was functional though, the bed comfy and the view definitely helped, but we spent most of our days sightseeing so we didn't come for the room and moreso the location. Sadly my first morning there, I had no hot water and had to call down to the front desk. They quickly fixed the problem though because within 30 minutes or so there was hot water.

We had a wonderful, very relaxing view of the Marina, as well as being provided with a very spacious suite. The suite had a king-size bed, plenty of closet space, a kitchenette fully-stocked with cutlery, plates, etc.. The bathroom was a pleasant surprise, with marble counter tops and ample space. Two sinks made it very easy for us to prepare at the same time, unlike many hotels we have stayed in. The grounds are FANTASTIC, with well-kept foliage reminding us of our trip to Hawaii. The pool area was always busy, even though it was a bit chilly (65-70 degrees). I particularly enjoyed the two parrots that are perched above the koi pond. I very nice touch of the tropics. The concert venue is very impressive. The stage was not used while we were there, but I can see why such great bands would wish to perform there. A beautiful, yet intimate concert environment, overlooking the marina and surrounded by the beautiful, tropical gardens of the Half Moon Inn. Although my wife and I enjoyed the service of the staff, the clean, spacious, very comfortable rooms, and the outstandingly beautiful campus, I do have a complaint that has been made in previous posts I have read on this site. I found that the room that we were provided, which I am certain is one of the more expensive rooms available, was extremely poor as far as noise abatement. I could literally hear EVERY word that the neighbors were saying next door if I stood in our closet area. The ventilation system served as a direct line of communication between the two suites. The room which adjoined our bedroom was not occupied on our first night, and I slept like a baby. The comfort of the pillows and linens was 5-star, certainly meeting the standard of some of the best hotels we have stayed in around the world. The final night of our stay, however, was a nightmare! I heard the couple whose bed was on the other side of the wall from our bed were talking into the \"wee hours\", and I could literally hear every word. I decided that instead of making my wife uspet on our last night, for she was sleeping like a baby throughout the conversation next door, I decided to sleep in the sofa in the living room. If I had knocked on the wall it would have escalated into a confrontation, and that is not what we expected when we booked our stay at the Half Moon Inn. A final word of advice to those who stay in room 422...the drapes do NOT close completely in the bedroom, and the morning light can wake you up very early. We simply brought along a \"bag clip\" that we use for closing bags of chips, and it worked like a charm to keep the drapes from having an annoying slit where the light came in.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio Rancho, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "claudiastovall", "ReviewID": "UR27035910", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights with two boys, 8 and 10 years old.

The hotel is located close to the airport so you do hear airplane noise every now and then, but, it was not even close to a problem. The fitness room isn't huge, but, it does have weights, bike, treadmill, and a step machine. The latter 3 all have televisions and plugs for your ipod. The lobby has StarBucks coffee in the morning and if you want breakfast you can go to their restaurant. The hotel is also close to a naval base, however it didn't pose any issues to my stay with loud noise are anything of the sort.

We have been three times now and each time it has been an absolute dream. This last trip on the weekend of Nov 14-16th was outstanding. We booked a Jr suite and got a room with a yummy bed, robes to lounge around in, fridge, micro (w popcorn for popping), coffeemaker, and a wonderful patio that gave a splendid view of the marina, backside of the lounge area and faced directly the concert stage. The price was less than $175 a night! It was magical. Loved looking out and seeing the adorable parrot sitting in his paradise surroundings. We had room service again this time and since I ordered it before they started serving we received it in less that 30 minutes and it was very good! We went sightseeing to the Point Loma Lighthouse and throughout the San Diego coastline. We ate at Point Loma Seafood and the sushi was really fresh and yummy. Fiance had the clam strips and they were wonderful, crunchy not chewy at all! We had dinner at Brigadine right up the road from Humphrey's and had the best tacos EVER!!! and the bartender set me up with the best desert, a frozen mudslide with lots of hershey's chocolate and whip cream. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip and my fiance thinks we will never stay anywhere else again!!

The pictures on the hotel's website were accurate and the grounds are beautiful - the pool and jacuzzi clean and well maintained, a great experience for our first trip to San Diego. I got scared right before we left on the trip as I saw some bad reviews posted, but a call to the hotel asking about renovations led to my being told that they were renovating some rooms with new refrigerators and microwaves and they would make sure I had a room with no repairs needed or in progress. We arrived early and they stored our luggage and although they were very busy they did get us into our room an hour earlier than posted check in time. The staff was wonderful - very cheerful and helpful. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. We had a king room with pool/garden view and I asked to be placed where we'd have the least noise from the concerts (my husband's a light sleeper) and they got that taken care of.The concerts that played onsite while we were there did not negatively impact us as far as the noise or the parking. Our room was a ground floor (I recommend this as it had a walk out patio with chairs while the 2nd floor rooms above us had windows but no balcony and sitting on the patio enjoying the wonderful San Diego evenings was a pleasure I wouldn't have missed). One reviewer said you could enjoy the concerts if you chose to and when you closed the wiondow, it closed off the sound and I agree for the most part. Some performers may be louder than others but the concerts are over by 11 so not a big deal. We did get charged for a daily newpaper that I never knew I was going to be charged for and never received, but when I called the hotel a couple days after leaving and explained I did not get a paper, they took it right off the bill - a very minor annoyance in an otherwise great experience. The hotel also offers use of a PC in the lobby so I was able to check in the day before our return flight and print our boarding passes - another great amenity. I also enjoyed the surrounding harbor and pathways along the harbor that can be used for walking or biking. There is a gaggle of ducks that hang around the front of the building but I discovered that at night, they walk through the grounds and go in the back to their \"real\" home - very funny to watch the procession! Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who is unsure about where to stay in this city. You are close enough to the downtown area(4 miles) and can see the skyline from the hotel but the marina/harbor setting is WAY better than being in the city and it seemed that Humphreys could accomodate several levels of need from just needing a clean, comfortable room in a nice setting to full suites with room service.

Rooms have a nice view of the marina or pool area many with a pleasant seating area outside the room. My thought many public areas and my room could use a little work. The carpet had significant stains my the door, the table, and between the beds. A coat of paint and better lighting would also make the room more pleasant. The bathtub/shower looked like it had been refinished or repaired, but it did appear clean as did the sink and toilet. The bed was fine though the bedding was very thin and minimal. The TV had the usual on-demand pay per view options. Staff here was friendly and helpful. The front desk was cordial and assisted me on a couple of problems. The bar was very noisy and I went to the resort next door for a glass of wine and conversation. The pool was nice and had the weather been warmer, I'm sure more people would have taken advantage of the lovely setting. The planters looked nice and some had recently been refreshed. Ground crews were visible each morning keeping the property fresh. There are live concerts and shows here on the weekends spring and summer with some well known entertainers. The outdoor theater looks intimate. Beware if you're not planning to attend the show and staying here...it might be a little busy and noisy. Also, if you are attending the show, the seats have no padding and they are hooked together. You will be touching your neighbor unless they're very slender. Other properties on Shelter Island looked like they've been updated or rebuilt including Island Palms and Kona Kai which looks to be the former Shelter Pointe. Bay Club next door looked better maintained. Humphrey's is still a pleasant place to enjoy on Shelter Island.

After the show we went to the Backstage club, listened and danced to some great blues. A perfect evening! We have stayed here a few times as well as many other hotels in San Diego.

Even the reception dinner had magnificent food with that gorgeous view! Our guests were all very impressed, many of whom stayed at the hotel. We stay here as often as possible.

The pool area seemed really nice, we didn't use it but it seemed like those that did were really enjoying it. There is a picture on here of a larger building that looks like it has multiple rooms in that building. The room we were in was in a building that had 4 rooms on the bottom floor, 4 above it, the stairs to the upstairs rooms connected that floor to the neighboring building's upper floor. The ice & vending were right outside of our room but we never heard anything from that or the parking lot. This hotel was a great location for everything we were doing in North SD County, Coronado, and downtown. It was even a close drive to the airport. It seemed like a pretty close drive to places like Sea World and Balboa Park too. Our room was really nice, none of the \"half remodeled\" stuff that others have referred to. I am actually really picky about cleanliness & rooms falling apart, this place seemed right on the ball. There was some sort of Veteran's Day 5K or something that closed the street the hotel is on. I was really glad they let us know.

Full Review Humphreys Half Moon Inn is on Shelter Island, San Diego. The hotel is situated with a boat works, where yachts and other small boats are housed and maintained on one side, and a marina on the other. After the many positive reviews on this website I had high expectations, but my early impressions were disappointing. The website seems to indicate that your room will either be a marina/bay or a garden view. The hotel website includes a description of the non-Bay view rooms as follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First floor rooms offer direct access to our private pool and tropical gardens through furnished patios.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unfortunately, it turned out that our rooms were what are labeled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms by the hotel, which means they do not look out on the garden or the bay, but on to the parking lot. These rooms are not mentioned till you dig further into the website. Quite frankly, for the price the room I stayed in was not good value. The advertised price per night for the room was $189. Because of a concert being held on the property on the first night, the actual room rate was $209. Two subsequent nights were at a rate of $139, which was a rate negotiated for our group (posted rate was $189). The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor was quite honestly upper-end motel quality (perhaps equivalent to a Best Western or La Quinta). My room was dark, and had a very musty smell to it, ironic in light of a sign in the room which said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fresh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warned of a $250 charge for smoking in the room. There are some features of the rooms which bring up the quality. Gilchrist and Soames toiletries in the bathroom are nice, and the free wireless internet access is appreciated by those with laptops. There is also an in-room safe, a self-service coffee maker, and an ironing board and iron. Other room amenities include: laundry service, and room-service (see below for a review of the service). The rooms are air conditioned (welcome, even in the much-vaunted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mild\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd climate of San Diego), and the air conditioner in my room was quite and effective. Other rooms I looked at were more light and airy, and had more room; though the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was similar. Higher rate rooms also have robes provided. Housekeeping The room was generally well cleaned, but on two nights I had to go to the front desk to ask for a form to hang on my front door to pre-order breakfast. There was a form provided to submit for laundry to be done, but no bag provided to put the laundry in. On a strange note, housekeeping would try to clean the room at 8:00 AM. If you order the breakfast from room service, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to put out the privacy sign after breakfast to avoid having housekeeping interrupt you after your breakfast! Other Amenities The hotel does offer a free shuttle service from the airport, and the service was very quick. The check-in staff was polite and efficient and professionally dealt with a set of packages which were delivered to the hotel prior to my arrival. The pool area and tropical grounds are nicely kept. Room Service On the night of arrival I attempted to order room service at 6:30 PM, but was warned that it would be at least an hour. I went and had a drink at the pool, and met friends and then re-tried to order at 8:30 PM, at which point the wait was a reasonable 25 minutes. Dinner (Filet Mignon + a Cr\u00c3\u00a8me Brulee) was $56 (no alcohol). The service was prompt and courteous. I used room service for breakfast for two mornings, and found the breakfast to satisfactory, though the hotel did get my cooked egg order wrong on one morning. A nice touch was that room service calls you about five minutes before they are going to deliver the breakfast, so you can be awake and decent when they arrive! Noise Issues Do be aware that there are concerts (both public and private) held regularly on the hotel grounds, so definitely check the concert dates on the hotel website if you are not interested in hearing the music. However, private group using the concert area will not be shown on the website. Concerts also impact the availability of the fitness room and other facilities. The night I arrived there was a public concert taking place, and I could hear the music throughout the grounds, but did not hear it in my room (an advantage of being at far end of the property and facing the parking lot, away from the concert area). At the close of the concert there was a bit of noise in the parking lot from people talking, starting cars, returning to their rooms, etc. but not bad. Even on nights when a public concert is not advertised, the hotel may be hosting a private event, which includes a band or DJ using the concert area. The noise will impact the surrounding rooms, and some hotel facilities will not be available. From other posts I understand that this is also a popular venue for weddings, and wedding parties. If you decide to book a nicer room, say overlooking the Bay, you should enquire as to whether there are public or private concerts scheduled and/or wedding or other groups. You might try for a room in the K,L or M buildings to minimize the noise issues, and maximize your privacy. Overall Frankly, I would not recommend this hotel because of the noise issues with the concerts, and other large private parties which rent the facilities. If you are with a group, and are looking for a conference hotel, then this may be a good facility, but be sure to warn your attendees that the rooms do vary in quality. A different hotel, The Dana at Mission Point, is owned by the same owners and might be a better bet for people not traveling as a part of a group. We did a kayak tour from that hotel, and it seemed like a nicer facility. However, do read the reviews about that hotel on this website for information about the old buildings v. the new buildings. If you want to try this hotel, then it is probably worth spending the money to get a room which looks out over the bay. I would especially avoid the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms, which are poor value. Even the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garden view rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much appeal (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not very private). A bay view room, at the far end of the property from the concert area and the pool is probably your best bet, though these are likely the most expensive.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous and Unique\u201d", "Author": "PamelaDahhling", "ReviewID": "UR8616158", "Content": "After doing lots of research on hotels, for our Labor Day weekend in San Diego, I chose Humphrey's. Not knowing much about Shelter Island, and having a picky husband, I really hoped our stay would be worth the $$. I reserved a Marina View Suite...and didn't regret the decision at all! As you see from photos, this hotel has a very tropical setting. The pool is surrounded by palms and lush plant life; parrots and koi fish add ambiance, and the casual setting make this a relaxing place. Gorgeous! The staff seem decent; not overly friendly, not overly helpful. Definitely pleasant and relaxed. Our room did indeed look over the Marina. We had two huge rooms and a full kitchen (no dishwasher). The room slept up to six people. A beautiful granite/marble bathroom. A triangular patio to enjoy the view. The recent updates the hotel made to these rooms makes it easy to overlook the old sofa bed, old kitchen cabinets, and mildew in one corner of the tub. The beds were very soft, comfortable. Air conditioning worked great (and we needed it!) and there was a fan too. Overall, great room. My picky husband was pleased! We were just two staircases over from Humphrey's concert hall and were pleased to listen to the Blues playing, while we sat on our patio. Concerts are usually over by 10 ish. The frequent entertainment is what makes the hotel unique. Friends of ours stayed in a guest room (room 105), and the patio was directly over the audience for the concert. What a fantastic spot to watch the concert from! IF YOU HAVE SMALL KIDS AND WANT THEM TO GO TO SLEEP EARLY, MAKE SURE YOUR ROOM IS ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PROPERTY. The staff will not warn you ahead of time unless you ask in advance! The guest room was beautiful too, by the way. The restaurant serves very good food and the Sunday brunch is fabulous...make a reservation! If you want to eat poolside, however, order well in advance...it takes forever to get the food. We even ordered some cocktails, poolside on Labor Day - the pool bar wasn't open yet and it took the restaurant bar over 30 minutes to bring four drinks. The pool temp was perfect, lounge chairs seemed new, towels ample. We even played croquet and we saw several people enjoying ping pong. Shelter Island is busy, but not overly. It's fairly convenient to the airport, Old Town, and Mission Bay. If you wish to avoid any windy conditions, the marina side of this hotel is great...while we were there, there was hardly any breeze!

Hanging out by the swimming pool and jacuzzi amidst the palm trees and blooming foliage made me feel a million miles from home and in total relaxation mode. I loved the fact that, once you were on the hotel grounds, it was hard to believe you were in a city at all - it felt more like a quaint resort from the 1950's. The hotel is conveniently located near major roads if you have a car, less convenient if you don't, though the front desk will call cabs for you (with the exception of one grumpy night worker whose total help for some cab-seeking guests was to point to a phone book, all of the staff were quite friendly and helpful). Some of the criticisms I read were valid -- they just didn't happen to bother me. Yes, some rooms overlook the non-scenic parking lot. Because of this, I opted to pay slightly more for a pool view room, and I had a nice view. It is also true that you can hear the concerts all over the grounds, but I considered this to be an extra perk, and none of the concerts interfered with my ability to park at the hotel.

This was my first time staying at this hotel, along with my husband and compared to the typical \"hotel standards\" I've seen in all my travels (and I travel all over) Humphrey's exceeds the expectations by far! Seems like a lot of people, especially from the UK seem to only see the negative and compared to what's going on in the world right now, I think there are a lot more positive things to focus on. That's why I am so happy to talk about my POSITIVE experience at Humphrey's. I truly thought that all the staff members were exceptionally nice and I felt so welcomed by them. People were always smiling and saying hello as they passed by. The pool and area was excellent! So clean and beautiful along with the grounds. I loved the way the towels were folded so creatively on each chair! There is a nice pool bar there and yes, there was a concert there on the Friday that we arrived, but I take that as a bonus to our experience. It was nice to listen to the music at the pool. It created a soothing and special atmosphere, one unlike you would find at any other hotel. The Concierge recommended the restaurant on the property and she was right-on! It was the best! and the lounge with live music was so much fun! There were ducks and ducklings running around, waterfalls, Koi ponds and parrots. We lost ourselves in the beauty of the property. We also each had a massage and just loved it! Being that relaxed and being on that property with such a caring staff, we couldn't help but to want to come back again. We did not have any type of room with a view, but the rooms were clean and definitey not a dump or anything of the sortl. Sometimes I wonder if the people who have written some bad reviews on this hotel have ever travelled at all! My husband and I couldn't get enough of the resort! I think it is a romantic place for couples. If you want it to be a perfectly quiet place all the time when you're there, then buy your own hotel, so you'll have it all to yourself. You just have to keep an open mind and a positive attitude to make the best of your vacation time. Thank you Humphrey's for the wonderful experience, your beautiful and peaceful place, your warm and welcome staff, your fantastic restaurant with a view, the nice clean room and all your amenities on top of being so close to all the major areas in San Diego.

We first stayed at the Loews Coronado and were honestly a bit skeptical when we first got to Humphrey's- and the mixed reviews on this site didn't help. However we were pleasantly surprised. The location of this resort is perfect- sorrounded by the bay on one side (actually across a small road), and the marina on the other. Absolutely no odor, bugs, or birds from the marina which was surprising. We stayed in a junior suite overlooking the concert area- at a rate of 279 per night booked on the hotel's website. Furnishings in the room are a bit dated and the lighting is not the greatest- though overall it was very clean and comfortable, though they haven't picked up on the newer hotels bedding method of no bedspread. Word of warning- the girl at the front desk told us that if you ask for a room overlooking the concerts you will definitely not get it. They do this to avoid anyone videotaping the concert or scalping the \"seats\" in your room. However when she heard we were on our honeymoon we lucked out and got to enjoy two great concerts from our \"skybox\" balcony at no charge! The entire resort ROCKS the night of a concert so if you're looking for quiet then steer clear on concert nights. The pool is spacious and large- pool bar is open throughout the evening. Humphrey's has a LOT of kids running around and they tend to occupy the pool during peak hours. We enjoyed it most in the morning. An \"adult\" pool would be a great benefit here. There is a small but comfortable jaccuzi. The grounds of the hotel are very well landscaped with a tropical palm tree/waterfall feel to it. Slight drawback are the 2 parrots the hotel puts out in one of the gardens every morning- they shreak and scream at each other loud enough to wake you up. It's entertaing at first but after a while its plain annoying. There are also a lot of ducks wandering around- a few found there way into the pool which is fun to watch but not entirely appealing from a sanitary point of view. The pool itself was for the most part clean but looked like it could have been skimmed and chlorinated a little bit better. The hotel's restaurant is top notch- though the interior looks like it could use a refresh of decor, however the food was excellent- just be warned its a fine dining establishment- our tab was 100.00 for 2 with drinks and tip. The bar/lounge is a popular live act spot as well, however there was a cover so we didn't go in. We ordered room service during one of the concerts which was reasonably priced (just remember its room service so you're paying for the convenience). Room service will also deliver to the pool area where they have patio tables and chairs set up to eat at. Parking at the hotel was ample (8.00 per day). Compared the Loews with its massive property and parking garages Humphrey's was a breeze to check in and out of. All in all I can wholeheartedly reccommend this hote. As long as you have an open mind and deal with a few little quirks you'll find Humphrey's to be much more of an experience then paying 100.00 more per night at some of the more \"upscale\" properties.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cdisappointing\u201d", "Author": "manic14", "ReviewID": "UR8215762", "Content": "Was looking forward to staying in this hotel, however was disappointed when I entered my room, which was very dark and in need of a freshening up.

As much as I agree with a lot of the opinions about this hotel, I would still have to rate my experience at Humphrey's as bad (I don't see myself as being a difficult person but you be the judge). I booked the room through the hotels website months in advance. We arrived on a Tuesday night (week before Mem. Day weekend) and recieved a room which basically overlooked the parking lot and a marina across the street. I asked if they had something upstairs or a different building (you'll see why later)and they said they were booked but they would get back with us later. Basically, by the time they got back to us the next day we felt we just wanted to stay in the room we were in because we had already unpacked (4 people for 5 days = a lot of clothes!). The room was very nice (Jr. Deluxe Suite) and very clean...great cleaning people! Everything was fine until the first night of concerts (Thurs. night). I was aware that they held concerts there but when you look at the website pics it seems as though the concerts are held away from the rooms...not the case! The stage and concert were held right behind our building! This wasn't even bad...I figured it would end at 11pm. Thursday and Friday night went by and it was a bit annoying but I wasn't going to let it ruin my vacation. After all we were the ones that decided to stay in that particular room. They had offered us a room on the second floor but in the same building - so it wouldn't have made much of a difference. (HINT: If someone from Humphrey's is reading this..if a guest stays in these buildings during three nights of concerts, it would probably be a good idea to at least comp. them free tickets to at least one of the three events - you would recieve less complaints - kind of a \"if you can't beat them, join them\" philosophy) Well by Saturday night we decided to stay away for the majority of the concert and come back late in the evening to avoid the mess. We got back at 10:30pm (concert started at 7pm). The concert was still going on but we expected it to wrap up soon based on past experience. Here is how the rest of our night went: 11:00pm - concert wrapped up 12:00am - Drunk people out in the hallway yelling. 12:30am - Drunk people still yelling - called front desk. Security came and people left. 1:00am - Wake up to hear the sound off dripping water - our sink was mysteriously overflowing with water (we did not have the water on!) It was overflowing onto the carpet - called front desk. Maintenence guy came and fixed problem. 1:30am - Drunk people back again. 2:30am - Drunk people back again. We were told that these people were part of the band from the concert. The next mornign we complained to the front desk and after some discussion they eventually comp'd us our room rate for our last night stay. This is a very nice hotel and I would have enjoyed it if it weren't for the building (concerts) we were in. I felt for the amount we paid (250/night) we shouldn't have to put up with it if we weren't there to see the concert(s).

The hotel grounds were beautiful and peaceful and the staff was very friendly. We had a bay view and were able to sleep with our windows open at night.

The rooms were smaller than normal, but very quaint and comfy. The concert venue that the hotel has is great too. Even though we didnt buy tickets to the concerts, we did listen to the concerts from the hotel pool and hot tub in the evenings. Very entertaining. I could go on about the hotel, but I wont.

I would say it's a 3-star hotel and the grounds and pool are very good. The real benefit is that Shelter Island is a terrific location to get everywhere in SD by car. Rooms They have Jr Suites and Marina Suites that are ideal for families (large with kithchenettes and refrigerators) that can easily accomodate 5-6. And they will bring in a cot or blow-up mattress too. The rooms are clean although dated. Because the rooms are dated, this hotel gets some bad reviews. We liked how the bathroom sink was outside the bathroom and the set-up of the room was spacious and terrific. The mattresses could use an update. I'd recommend staying on the second floor as you will get nice views of either the marina or harbor. Concierge The hotel concierge is wonderful (you won't find better than Donna in the area) and she saved us lots of money and time. If you stay here call her in advance and she'll really help you. She used to be the concierge at the Catamaran and she said she likes the Shelter Island location better to get around San Diego which we agree with. Pool The pool is large and a good one for kids and families. No frills to it (like a water slide) but it's a big pool with a hot tub located about 20 yards away so the kids and adults will like it. Also have a ping pong table and a little putting green which the kids got full use of. Shelter Island Location We can't recommend staying in this area enough. After being there for a week and doing everything in San Diego we love this location. 5-10 mins to downtown. 10 mins to the zoo. 15 to Sea World. 20 to La Jolla (if you take I-5). 10 to Old Town. And beautiful views of the harbor and marinas all around. If you are a boat enthusiast stay here and your mouth will drop when you see all the yachts and sail boats around this peninsula. Nice place to walk or run in the morning if you like that (very safe) and you can also use Humphrey's bikes too. Also lots of good restaurants within 3-5 mins by car and a few that you can walk to. We liked Pizza Nova (inexpensive), Point Loma Seafood (inexpensive) and the restaurant at the hotel. They do charge $8 for parking every day which is less than most of the SD hotels. We found that most of the hotels charge for parking (consider it just another SD tax I guess). Don't stay here if you want a brand new room, and you are super picky about having a perfect room. Stay here if you are a family looking for a larger clean room and you are on the go and want to see San Diego. We really enjoyed staying at Humphrey's because the pool was great, our room (a Jr Suite) was large enough for our family of 5, the concierge was way above average and the location was the best place to stay if you want to do it all in SD. Some of the posters that complain about the rooms are spoiled and stay in 5 star hotels all the time. If you are a AAA member you can save too. We were there a week and they had 3 weddings on the grounds there. The grounds are full of flora and flowers and very pretty. Also check the concert schedule if you are coming between May and Sept as they have outdoor concerts. For some that might attract you and for others you might not want to be there during a concert because of the noise. By the way - the restaurant is fantastic. One of our best meals in San Diego. I would call it upscale casual. Everything melted in our mouths and we are picky about food. A little expensive but well worth it and we hear the Sunday Brunch is terrific. This restaurant overlooks the marina - nice. Finally, lots of Europeans seem to be attracted to this hotel which we liked.

Have been turned down before for a room after they asked how many nights I was staying and I only said \"one.\" Their reply \"we're sold out\". Went next door to the Best Western which accomodated me, no problem. Other drawbacks: rooms have that \"party\" smell and vibe (like a lot of rock and rollers have stayed there and soiled the rooms).

The hotel staff all went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Ate at the hotel's restaurant several times and found the food and prices to be fine.

A short walk from the hotel are several restaurants, and cafes, including an excellent Mexican restaurant that is very popular.

We were also upgraded to a bay view room on the second floor with a great view of the bay from the balcony. Although it was close to the airport, we never heard the planes in the room, only on the balcony. The overall appearance and cleanliness of the hotel was fantastic. The grounds are remarkable, with huge tropical plants and lots of flowers. Although we didn't swim in the pool it looked clear and inviting. The service is the best feature at Humphrey's! Everyone was fantastically helpful and friendly, from the desk clerks to the shuttle driver. For example, my daughter and friend wanted to rent a car for the day to go to Mexico. The concierge made arrangements and the shuttle drove them to the car rental office. When they discovered they couldn't rent with a check card, the hotel shuttle driver took them to the train station and helped them with schedules. The concierge also printed our boarding passes when I couldn't get the printer in the lobby to work, and called a taxi for my son and his friend. The concert venue was great, although I heard one family whose balcony faced the stage say that it felt like the concert was in their room. We took our chairs to the landing and watched for free. Some of the hotel staff told us we could also watch by the pool area and they were serving snacks and drinks to hotel guests. We were asked to show our room keys but the staff was very friendly. The concerts always end at 10:30 PM, but if you have small children or have an early morning, get a room away from the amphitheater. The location was scenic, with great jogging trails and a park on the bay across the street. There was a sailboat regatta one day that we watched from our balcony, and lots of military and other ship traffic. The hotel also provides bicycles, free for the first hour with a fee applying after that. We did not have an automobile so we didn't have to deal with parking. We ate at the hotel restaurant twice and had room service twice. We all thought it was great food. It was somewhat pricey, but the quality and menu variety were very good. There are not very many other restaurants near, although if you can walk several blocks you can find several.

The grounds are very tropical and the pool area was nice. Hotel however is dated. Check in was 30 minutes, with 2 staff checking people in at 4:00pm on a Saturday. We had reserved a bay view room, and were given a pool view room (a so called upgrade); I explained that we wanted a bay view room. (We reserved a bay view room and that is what we expect to get for $200/night.) We were then given a room that was explained as an upgrade with a view of the bay in building A. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153view of the bay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was across a parking area, a street and then another parking area. How disappointing! And when there was a concert (4 out of the 6 nights we were there), the bands BIG equipment truck was parked right in front of our view. Our room had the oddest configuration. I could touch the entry door from the bed, it was so close. Then there was a narrow kitchen area with a sink and a frig., then another larger seating area which opened to a patio thru a sliding glass door. I think the designer of the room was a little confused, the sleeping area and the seating area should have been reversed. Just a small note, there was no bureau in the room, we had to live out of our suitcases. The location of the room, which we would find out, was right next to the concert entrance. On concert nights, we were kept awake by the concert, the concert goers leaving and the band breaking down their equipment and putting it in the big trucks. If you are planning on getting an early start to your day, ask for a room far from the concert area. Parking seemed to be an issue on concert nights. We were reluctant to leave our room if we were going to come back before the concert got over, because we were not sure if we were going to get parking. The one night (our last night) that we did leave and come back before the concert was over; we did get a spot near the lobby. The head concierge Donna, was very nice before we got there thru emails.

We arrived early and our room was ready. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and professional, as was every staff member we ran into. We had a bay view room which wasn't exactly on the bay. There was a parking lot, street, and a grassy parkway between the hotel and the bay, but we just put chairs up by the window and when we sat down we could only see the bay which was nice. We walked down the path to the end of the island and when we returned to the room there was a HUGE basket of fruit and king-sized candy bars plus a bottle of nice champagne. You get to keep the glasses as part of the package. It was very relaxing sitting at the window snacking on fruit and drinking the champagne and watching all the boats sail by on the bay. The room was very well appointed and nicely decorated. The bathroom was beautiful with granite counter tops and around the tub. The room was spotless and well-insulated from noise. The only complaint about the room was that it was the size of a postage stamp. There was barely room to put the chairs between the bed and the window, and maybe 18 inches of space between the other side of the bed (king) and the wall. It did have high sloped ceilings which helped. There was a concert the night of our stay and even though we didn't have tickets, we were able to sit on a small balcony and listen. The pool area was very nice, and the rest of the grounds were wonderful and full of tropical landscaping. We checked out the rooms on the marina side which I thought had a much nicer view because they were right on the marina with a nice balcony or a patio and a little grassy area (no parking lot), but my husband thought our bay room view was better because the ships and boats were moving in the water, rather than tied up to berths. I guess it just depends on what you're looking for. In the morning we recieved breakfast in bed and the food was presented nicely and the room service was actually 5 minutes early. The food was good, not exactly outstanding, but room service food never is.

The room I got was located by the sales office and it wasn't a marina view and it wasn't a garden view exactly. We were located in a corner unit facing another walkway with more rooms. I was steps from the marina though through a little walkway next to my room. If I went down the walkway it would take me to a nice bench area where I could read and look at the boats. I found the interior of the room to be excellent. I read somewhere here where someone called the property dated. I have to wonder if we were staying at the same place! I found it not to be \"dated\" in the least. It was modern and comfortable. The grounds were lucious and tropical and Tiki themed. The restaurant was nice for breakfast (also wondering where some of the negative reviews came from?!), the view was gorgeous. We even tried room service and found it conveninet. A paper was delivered every morning, we had internet access in our room via laptop or there was a shared computer with internet access and a printer located in the lobby that we could use. The hotel was EXTREMELY convenient to the airport and also to the convention center which is where my husband needed to be everyday.

The staff was always good about providing equipment, and the games were a nice diversion for my kids in between trips to Sea World and the Zoos, Old Town etc. Overall, the hotel was very warm, friendly, and clean, with a tropical motif that made us feel like we were in Hawaii again.

The hotel is of course close to the water and waterfront park.So if you like to go for walks near the ocean it is a good location. However eating options (other than the hotel) are a bit of a walk from the hotel. Overall, if you are in San Diego to see the zoo, sea world and the wild animal park, it is better to find a lower cost hotel with safe clean rooms rather than one that also includes tropical ambience since since you would not likely take much advantage of the grounds the hotel has (for which you pay).", "Date": "December 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cFair not great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4148699", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights at Humphrey's.

After reading many reviews from trip advisor members we plumped for humphries in Shelter Island. We stayed in a view suite which just could not have been better suited to our needs. I was apprehensive as the rating was 3 star and we normally stay in 4 star min hotels , but members rated this property so highly we decided to chance it. Accomodation was excellent- a separate room with 2 queen beds- more like double uk, and a separate living area with a really good sleeper sofa which my son used. He loved his own separate space at night with his own tv. just off this room was a very adequate kitchen providing free tea/coffee, popcorn and even kitchen roll. we had a beautiful marble bathroom with 2 vanity units and bath/ shower and bath robes and plentiful towels. Outside the bathroom was a dressing area which was great for drying hair make up etc. Only drawback was there was limited drawer space but we managed. My eldest son and his friend who are staying for the summer in San diego visited us often and we could all sit in the living area and never felt crowded. My husband brought his laptop and we had free internet access which allowed everyone to keep in touch. Pool area is just beautiful and so green, tropical and luscious. we always got chairs by the pool and it never appeared crowded. Car parking is free and we always got parked in the car park. We found all the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. Shelter Island is beautiful and you can go for lovely walks along the waterfront and large grass area. Not much beach. Drawbacks are under 21,s not allowed in bar after 8 pm as there was live music nightly.

Also the worst thing that happened to us we got $300 worth of jewelery stolen or missing from our room. We did report the theft but nothing came from it.

The bathroom was very pretty and well set up. We had those louvre windows so we could open them at night and let that nice cool San Diego air into the room. The beds were nice and comfy and everything was so clean. We never had a problem finding a parking space - even with the concert because they closed it off to anyone but hotel guests.

It was a quick drive to downtown San Diego or even when we went to get a bite to eat on Rosecrans - it is right there. The view from our hotel at night was fabulous - if you went out the front door, you saw a gorgeous view of Downtown San Diego and the harbor and the sailboats. Out the window of our room was the koi pond, the pool and the yacht harbor (along with Clay Walker of course - or whomever is performing at the Concert by the Bay).

We were upgraded to a jr. suite for $199 + taxes -- I have an IATA # (if you're a travel agent you know what this is) so don't ask for this rate and expect to get it. We stayed in Building B on the ground floor; this building is next to the concert area, so be forewarned that in the summer you probably will hear the concert if you're in this building -- but they're over by 10:30 p.m. Since we drove down from L.A. in the evening and didn't check in until 11 p.m. or so after the concert let out, I had to explain to 2 parking lot attendants that I was a guest checking in and thus I was allowed park near the building our room was in (you're given a lot pass for your windshield upon checkin; I never had a problem finding a space near our room). My wife and I found the suite layout a bit strange: the bed is near the door in one half, a TV and bar area separates the bedroom from the living room that opens onto a porch area with view of the concert site. We would have preferred to have it the other way around with the bed away from the hallway door, but we got used to it by second night. We checked out the Humphrey's by the Bay lounge/bar and were pleasantly suprised that we didn't have to pay cover since we were staying at the hotel. The crowd verged on the older side, say 40+; my wife and I are late 20s/early 30s. We still had a good time. The management knows when to cut patrons off that are wasted (I have a short fuse when it comes to dealing with drunks bumping in to me). The dance floor was crowded and made for good people watching. We ate breakfast at the on-site restaraunt the next mornig: ~$50 for 2 including tip. Service was friendly, food prep was a little drawn out. But the view of the marina really made up for it. Very relaxing. Pool area is very nice and resort like; extra pool towels are provided; didn't try the bar, but it looked pretty good! Enjoyed this area a lot. Don't plan to get many laps in here unless you go early right when it opens -- there were quite a few families here in the afternoon. Humphrey's location is excellent for going out in downtown San Deigo if you drove yourself in or have a rental car: you can be in the gaslamp district or Balboa Park in 10 minutes. We really liked this convenience. There's a computer with hispeed internet access provided for free in the lobby. Nice for looking up directions or checking email. There's apparently wifi in the rooms, but I didn't try this out, so I don't know if it's free or not. Negatives: the staff doesn't check the common hallway doors at night to make sure they're shut. This is obviously a security concern because if these doors remain open, anyone off the street can walk into the building. Secondly, we were awoken by the LOUD ICE MACHINE going at 7 a.m. our first morning! Had the doors been shut, we wouldn't have probably heard it. I complained about this when I checked out. If you're a light sleeper, you may not like the proximity to the San Deigo Airport -- once in a while -- but not often -- you can hear a plane taking off across the water. I can't speak to the paper-thin walls comments, but I did hear water pipes going once in a while as well as our neighbors the second morning moving their bags out. Would I stay here again?

The outside of the establishment is a bit drab and looks almost a little run down. But the interior of the rooms, the grounds, and the lobby are all upscale and refined.

We got the standard room with a king size bed and there was plenty of room for the both of us. They have nightstands on both sides of the bed with 2 HUGE drawers that hold all your stuff. The armoire that holds the TV also had three large drawers. The closet is very big as well. Bottom line - you can put everything you brought away someplace so it is out of the way! The room also has a coffee maker and fridge as well. This is a nice touch for breakfast food, snacks, and drinks. The grounds are amazing! Although we explored San Diego during the day, many of the guests just hung by the pool all day. The grounds give a feel of being in Hawai'i with all the palm trees, tropical plants and colorful flowers. There is a bar outside, and employees walking around to provide service. There is also an area with a stage for concerts that happen in the summertime. We did not get to use the fitness center, but I peeked in and it seemed nicer than the average hotel fitness centers. Besides the pool, the other parts of the resort are very green with trees, grass, and walkways to take you around.

This is huge because it gives you flexibility and you don't need to prepay. They have a generous cancellation policy (not that you'd want to cancel your stay) and you can check out early without penalty (unlike Expedia rates). ALSO - We got a \"more used room\" (which was more than adequate) with the expedia rate. With the house rate (which got lowered because we found an Expedia rate which they matched) we got a 2nd floor bay view room with a balcony and a high cieling. The pool area is second to none...large, neat shape, clean and great tropical feel. And the hot tub at night was perfect. The gardens are really well kept and the resident parrots make it feel like a vacation. The service was wonderful...they were accomodating, made reservations for us and were available 24/7. We stayed three nights and then another night at the end of the trip. Both times they gave us free upgrades, from traditional rooms to view rooms (either the pool or the bay).

I got an upgrade to a bay view standard room for an additional $30 a night. The room was located in building C on the second level. Entrance was from the outside and the outside was not very well lit however we felt safe at all times, and given thought, a well lit parking area would have distracted from the great view of downtown and the Harbor Island area. Our room was really clean and up to date. We had a king bed with side tables. A nice touch in the room were bed lamps and a table lamp that had three-way bulbs so you could determine the brightness of a particular lamp. Nice for reading. Our room had a nice TV set up with plenty of channels. The bathroom was great and spacious. A small dressing area outside the bathroom was equiped with a magnifying mirror and a mini-frig. The hotel was quiet and I heard no neighbors. Now, we did stay over on New Years Eve and the property had three parties going on at various places in the back. The music from one of the parties was loud so I can see where summer concerts would disturb guests. I would suggest a room on the north side of the hotel for more quiet. We did experience some party noise from the beach area at night but it was not too bad. The hotel does not have a business services area or internet access. I called guest services for assistance on two occasions and was not helped either time. The desk must have been staffed by college students or that age group because they seemed to be rushed during the call and did not know answers to my simple questions, i.e. where is the nearest sports bar. The grounds were clean, the maid service good, the restaurant staff friendly. I submit that this is a good hotel for the basic tourist trip and not for a more upscale, service focused client.

The hotel was a little older but well kept and the grounds are unsurpassed and our room had a vaulted ceiling and granite countertops in the bathroom. Concerts did happen every night but we really loved it, but we're young and enjoy that kind of stuff. Book it at sandiego as I paid $185 a night and noticed lots of other websites at $250 plus. I wouldn't have paid any more than $185-$200 for this hotel, though. It is also centrally located and close to Sea World (WAY OVERCROWDED), San Diego Zoo (GREAT-MUST SEE!), Coronado Island (great day trip) and much more!", "Date": "August 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calabasas, CA", "Title": "\u201cWe won't be back!\u201d", "Author": "Vbg", "ReviewID": "UR2331916", "Content": "We just got back from San Diego and were very disappointed by this hotel. It seems like being an inn keeper is an after-thought at this hotel. Priority is given to the \"Concerts by the Bay\" that go on several times a week (at least in the summer) inside the cramped outdoors quarters. This means, whether you like it or not, you'll hear the music blaring until 10:30pm (at least) and if you're in building A, you'll be harrassed by the ticket controllers. Now, when there is no concert, there are weddings, with outdoor music and noisy guests who wake you up at 2am and 4 am by loudly talking outside your door. If this place was cheap, it wouldn't bother me so much, but at $240 w/o tax a night for a junior suite we really felt ripped off.

If you don't want noise from that make sure you book on the other end or stay when no concerts are going on. The concert was fun and was over by 10:30 (noise regs.) and tear down and the emptying of people was over in less than an hour. Bedding and bath immaculate. Draperies had a spot here and there, no bigs. Maid sevice wonderful. All staff helpful and polite, we were treated well.

They also have a small pond with huge koi fish, parrots, and ducks. A big hit with my daughters. The room had a full kitchen, a separate bedroom, and living room with sofa bed. My youngest slept in the crib in the walkin closet/dressing area and it was great for us to have somewhere to retreat to after the kids went to bed at 8:30. Our room had a marina view and that was great too. I agree with another reviewer that the parking lot view is not nice at all. I was worried when we first drove up but after seeing our room and the garden we were very pleased. We booked a great rate through expedia and it was worth the extra money to have the executive suite with the 2 children with all that space! I probably wouldn't stay there during concert season (june-oct) due to higher prices and potential noise. But it looks like a fun place to stay and see a concert if I didn't have my children with me.

The jr suite allowed my husband, my mother, and me to be close but not fully together. The hotel is a well kept funky 40 year old Tiki style complex with a great location and a certain style. I requested a view of the bay thinking it would be like the website. What I got was a view of the active public road, the public parking lot and channel for San Diego Bay beyond! Oh, and huge fuel tanks for the Coronado navy base couldn't be missed. Not nice. Upon immediate complaint, I was very kindly told we could not move to more scenic quarters until the next day. However, the hotel garnered goodwill by keeping its promise and actually moving all our packed luggage and bags while we were enjoying ourselves elsewhere. CAUTION: Be specific about what scenic experience you are seeking. Leave the parking lot views to the block groups. It can really distinguish your visit as a good or less than good memory. The hotel staff was friendly, linens and bedding in good order, grounds truly lovely, and the resulting view across the concert grounds to the moorage was great! Also the bar menu was ample, good food and the bands were fun. (We were comp'ed as hotel guests for any cover charge.) We also just missed the Concert Nights which may affect parking, noise, etc. This location is convenient to Old Town via Rosecrantz, airport, freeways, downtown/Gas Light district, Balboa Park, and Point Loma. Parking was good and easy. Hotel provides advice on sights, other restaurants, and activities. Summary: If you want a romantic or beautiful setting, this could be for you. Avoid parking lot views--unless they almost give you the room. Eat the bar food for dinner and enjoy the sail boats moored out the windows. Work with the hotel to get the experience you are seeking. They can make you feel comforable and appreciated.
