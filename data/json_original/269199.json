{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Best Kept Secret in Florence I went to Florence with my mother this past may and really loved Residenza Giulia. A very quick (10 min) bus ride to the center of town (or a 20-30 minute walk). The bus drops you off right in front of the hotel. The room was large, clean, and very pleasant with a great view from the balcony. Anna was extremely helpful and super nice. Some decent neighborhood restaurants around the Residenza as well. Overall wonderful stay at a very reasonable price. Honestly, it was great to be somewhere convenient to the center of town that wasn't in the middle of tourist central.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR256949559", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lauritica"}, {"Content": "A little gem My husband and I booked a room here as we don't spend alot of time in our hotels when we're away and just wanted somewhere simple to return to at night. We were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome that we received and the help that Anna and David gave us in locating good restaurants and telling us where to catch buses etc. There are a few supermarkets over the road (past the 'New Gate') so if you fancy taking some fruit juice or food back to the room it's easy to do. The BB is only about 10 minutes walk away from the railway station - you hit a nice little cafe (La Gatta e Le Volpe) on the way down to it that serves lovely espresso.........and the River Arno and sights are within easy walking distance.If you want somewhere at a very reasonable rate (for Florence), which is clean and comfortable with helpful management, look no further.", "Date": "May 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR894727158", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Scubatwo"}, {"Content": "Great B+B, though quite far from centre We really enjoyed staying in this B+B. The room itself was very quiet, very clean and we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. There is also a lovely balcony to sit out on, although the road below is noisy. Bear in mind that this B+B is about 20 minutes walk from the main sights in Florence. There is a bus, but we didn't try it out. It would have been a good idea in hindsight though, as we found the walk back a bit tiring.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR519122983", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Emily78"}, {"Content": "The Residenza Giulia Florence - A Nice Bed and Breakfast Italy and Florence is not famous for it's high standards of Bed and Breakfasts but myself and my husband had a wonderful time at this Bed and Breakfast. Located on the top floor of an Italian residential block the Residenza Giulia is run by a retired Florentine couple who could not be nicer when it comes to helping you with your sightseeing activities. We booked online direct with the Bed and Breakfast (i don't remember the name of their website) - the rates are very competitive as we shopped around a lot before opting for the Residenza Giulia Bed and Breakfast in Florence. The only slight drawback is that you are a 15 minute walk from the Duomo and a 10 minute walk from the train station... not a lot I know but an important consideration if you are elderly. I look forward to my next visit to the Residenza Giulia.", "Date": "May 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR509957348", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ilovedeniro"}, {"Content": "Lovely! This is a nice bed-and-breakfast located in a large penthouse apartment, slightly out of the downtown core. My room had access to the terrace, with great views of the Tuscan hills and a part of Florence. I had a private bathroom as well, very new and clean. The room was large, clean and beautifully decorated. The place is run by an elderly gentleman and his son, they both speak decent English and are very kind.
