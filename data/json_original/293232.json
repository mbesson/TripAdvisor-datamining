A total dump. If you are looking for a cheap flophouse this is the place for you. Not much safer and not much more comfortable than sleeping in your car. Switched rooms from a dark, dirty and filthy room to a room that was simply dark and dirty. Ancient, used, and broken furnishings. Dirty worn carpets. Broken chest of drawers. Broken door locks. Bathroom door only opens partially because it hits the toilet. Missing lightbulbs in lamps. No coffee for the inroom coffee maker. Bad musty odor in the rooms. Housekeeping totally disregards Do Not Disturb signs. Parking lot littered with beer bottles.On the plus side it was cheap and close to the highway and the TV and minifridge both worked well, the parking was free and I never saw any bugs or rodents. And it was fairly quiet, probably due to a lack of business during our stay. Anyway, I won't be staying here again.

I thought the location and price were great so decided not to check on rates at the Drury Inn across the street. We sure which we had. The building with the rooms has NOT been renovated like the reception building has. We requested a non-smoking room, but you'd have to hold your breath climbing the stairs and going through the hall with the smoke smell as strong as it was. I was actually worried that we'd be charged for smoking in our room since the smell would drift in each time we opened our door. The water faucets were backwards and it took us running water awhile to figure that out. The bed was awful, so we thought we'd switch to the sofa bed, but there were no linens on it. The curtain not only didn't reach together, but had nothing to open or close it except grabbing the curtain, which was difficult considering it was behind the sofa. Lighting terrible, carpet questionable, and we never could get fresh air to come through the a/c unit. Spend a few more dollars and go elsewhere.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNever stay here again terrible\u201d", "Author": "currybri", "ReviewID": "UR108309201", "Content": "Nasty rooms bad customer service all amenties were not available they didnt wanna give me a pillow or iron breakfast ended before time", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNever stay there unless you want houskeeping to steal your stuff\u201d", "Author": "joannewhetstone", "ReviewID": "UR93410658", "Content": "Went to hotel and door to bathroom broken off hinges and bedspread with big burn hole and it stunk.

The receptionist told us we had only 1 night booked but did have the other booking for the next night for our relatives. I showed her the copy of the booking including reservation number but she told me to come back the next day at 11am to see if there was any rooms available. Well first impression of the room was that it had a bad smell, which went after the doors were left open for awhile. The room and bathroom were clean and the room was a good size. If the management has spent money refurbishing them I am not sure what they spent it on. The paintwork was peeling, the doors had many holes on the frame where the locks had been replaced frequently and my first thoughts were \"I don't want to stay\". Well we dcided to spent the night. The front desk informed us that the guest laundry was not working and neither was the internet. At 10pm a \"lady of the Night\" knocked on our door by error and left when she realised her mistake, I looked at her through the window and she went to another room. 11:30pm we woke to someone pounding on the door two doors down screaming \"let me back in\". My brother and his wife who were in a room facing the main road could not sleep for the action going on in the rooms above and beside them. Metal buckets were thrown from the balcony and several ladies were obviously servicing the rooms. This went on until 2am. None of us felt safe and when we went for breakfast the next morning there was hardly anything left..We went to the waffle house for breakfast...very nice. When I told them we would not be staying it would appear they miraculously found our reservations and told us that they could not take any cancellation. Thankfully I had booked through a Hotel reservation site and they handled the situation with Econo Inn.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay Here!

The room had been remodeled, but it was still very old. The walls had been painted, but still looked very old. Some of the lights did not work when we flipped the switch. Some of the electrical outlets did not work when we plugged things in. The door was warped at the bottom and did not close very well. There was no ice in the ice machine the night we arrived or the following morning. There was even a roach in our bathroom. The only positive thing I have to say is there was a very nice lady at the front desk the morning we checked out. I think her name was Jeanie, but I can't remember for sure. She was very nice and helpful.

Location isnt bad right off I 40 near 240. The room had a bad smell on opening the door. The room was large. The bed was fine. The rest though was outdated furniture. The mgmt has a comment renovated in 2008. Well it was a renovation with used furniture and the place looks like a formerly abandoned or totally run down bldg rehabbed to a limited degree is all. Some rooms are full of junk not used for guests but to store all kinds of stuff.. You can see it all from the outside! The carpet didnt look new to me. The shower was fine. The bed fine. TV fine. Room had mini frige. Chest with large drawers too. Overall though a real budget/basic Indian dive. Yeah a few sleazy folks hangin around still. Breakfast the usual fare with the usual minimal space and table and a sign forwarning you not to try to take anything out of the area. Thats the usual at these Indian run places in hopes of cutting down on food costs. If you cant sit and eat there you leave and owner rejoices! There is a waffle house right across street. The breakfast did include the common you make waffle machine and it was good. Also biscuits and gravy. First trip to eat found the place overpacked and nowhere to sit. I waited 40 min and then found a place for one to eat. I think about 5 or 6 small tables. So I guess thats good as I have seen them as small as three small tables! I took booked it as it was only 6000 points when others were 10000 12000 and up to 20000. So I wasnt expecting much. If you are reserving in advance and there are others similar in price Id opt for elsewhere. This street is loaded with hotels though. . SO if your driving and not prebooked they had a sign up 44.95 or something like that...you could always look (sniff) first. I can put up with a dumpy place if its a deal. But if your paying the same price as a other better ones charge you'll feel ripped off", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "everywhere", "Title": "\u201cnasty, gross, disgusting\u201d", "Author": "uknome", "ReviewID": "UR16707835", "Content": "We had reservations to stay here on 5/30 and 5/31 while we were in Memphis for a baseball tournament. We all checked in and had our credit cards charged up front ( always charged at checkout) and we were confused about that, our room was okay but that was before we pulled back the covers on the two beds! One of the bedspreads had some big spot of brown/red on it and a pillow on the other bed was filthy. We then went to check out some of the other rooms and they were so nasty that 16-18 yr old teen boys would not sleep in them, they are usually not that picky. One player had what looked like to be fresh blood on his blanket and one room had termites and was filthy. Don't let the picture of the outside of the hotel fool you!!! It doesn't all look that nice. The pic of the room is of the remodeled room and i believe that there is only one that is remodeled. Some shady character sitting out back, pool was not open, laundry room was gross. We were charged $69 a night but we all decided really quick that we were not spending one night there so we went about 100 yards down the road to the Ramada for $49 a night & it was 100% better. I definately do not reccomend the Econo Lodge on Sycamore View Road it is more like a rent by the hour if you know what i mean. I think thats all.
