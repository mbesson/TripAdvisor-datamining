This is a functional hotel which offer a bedroom with en suite and buffet continental breakfast. The hotel is a 10 minute stroll from Charlottenburg Station (S-Bahn which is the overground) and 5 minutes from Adenauerplatz (U-bahn which is the underground) although we always used the S-Bahn as it is quicker and more convenient for where we are going. Despite offering 24 hour service, we experienced reluctance from the reception desk for our check out at 6:30 (required for travel) although this may have been the specific individual. The shower holder in the shower did not work (necessitating this being held to shower) and despite reporting to reception this was never fixed. [All that was needed was a screwdriver to tighten the screw - or potentially a replacement - but the concept was lost on the team at reception.] It is only a short walk to the History of Berlin (worth a visit) and the Sightseeing Bus which leaves from Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. Be warned there are long queues to get on the bus - and even longer ones to get on the Boat Trip (badly managed by a short tempered bloke!). I would suggest you take a separate boat trip. The sightseeing tour does take in all the key sights. Also worth a visit is the Reichstag but note you have to book your appointment in advance and you must take photo id (you need to go through a tight security check much like the airports to get in). We went for a Hertha Berlin game at the Olympic Stadium which is very impressive. You can tour the stadium up until 6pm for \u20ac8 and the infrastructure for getting to/from games also excellent.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint-Omer, France", "Title": "\u201cvery bad!!\u201d", "Author": "najibaal G", "ReviewID": "UR118388764", "Content": "We were shocked by this hotel which does not deserve more than one star if any.

It spoiled our stay there and as if the noise wasn't bad enough the breakfast had been changed to a poorer standard with not too much variety but because of the large amount of students there if you didn't get down early there was hardly anything left.Will definitely not be staying there again.

I have travelled all over the northern hemisphere for 35 years, on business and vacation, and apart from one hotel in Birmingham, England, I must say that this is the worst hotel I have stayed in ever for that price. Cheap motels in the US and former hotels in Eastern Europe were better than this when you look at what you are paying. But there is one thing positive I can say: The breakfast was very good, with a lot to choose between. If you are vegan, vegetarian, meat eater or whatever, you will find your type of breakfast here. Another plus side was the cleanliness of the chamber maids. But apart from that. Stay away from this hotel. Try something nearer \"Stadtmitte\" (The middle of the city).

I went there with my brother and we had an excellent time! I certainly cannot complain about the hotel nor the staff. Of course, if you're looking for luxury maybe this may not be the right hotel for you, but i'm not that picky. The room was clean and very big with the biggest windows i ever did see! we stayed on the top floor and had a good view over the rooftops in berlin. The staff was very friendly and helpfull and they all speak English. Nearby you have a foodstore called Keiser's, wich is very convinient if you get hungry but don't want to spend all your money on expensive restuarants. Concerning the nightlife around this area, it was very quiet...and calm, exept from the celebrations after the football games :P just outside the hotel there are a couple of restaurants and they were always occupied with people, but besides from that, it was kinda quiet. The only thing i could complain about is the breakfast...not that we didn't get a lot to choose from, it's just that...well...i get better breakfast at home and the eggs were cold and the coffee tasted like something you've scraped off from a burnt plate or something. In other words...I've had better! The boring part about this part of the city is that there isn't much of a nightlife...and everything felt quite...dead around there... But all in all, the hotel was really good and i do recommend it to anyone who'd like a pleasant stay in berlin (there are transportations to get you around town ;P).", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in a wonderful City\u201d", "Author": "RHNIreland", "ReviewID": "UR14307255", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel in Feb/March, while yes I will agree with some reviews that parts of the common areas need updating my room was spotlessly clean, and comfortable.
