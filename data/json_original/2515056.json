We got to Seattle and went directly to the hotel and there was a room waiting for us way before check-in time. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room quiet as we needed.

We took advantage of a deal that included free parking (normally around $40 per night) and booked a Lux Corner Suite for our stay. The hotel, advertised as being in the Belltown area, is actually kind of on the border between the downtown core and Belltown proper, which is a bit north of the core. The lobby looks exactly like the photos on the hotel website. A small thing, perhaps, but too often reality falls well short of one's expectations. The Andra is carved out of a vintage building, and the decor is a very pleasing combination of sleek modern amenities, charming early 20th century millwork, and quirky old-time floorplans. Our suite included a spacious living area with sofa, a giant picnic table-like desk, cordless phone, windows on two sides, flat screen TV, minibar and coffee maker, several lamps, and an enormous freestanding mirror. French doors led to our bedroom, which included two more full-sized casement windows, a very comfortable king size bed, a dresser, and walk-in closet. Stylish modern lighting flanked the bed, along with an alarm/iPod dock and a second cordless phone. The smallish but functional and attractive bathroom featured a glass-tiled shower stall, a vessel sink, and slate floor tiles. Across from the bath was another dressing area/walk-in closet with an electronic safe. All in all, a very comfortable and attractive space. Service at the Andra was unfailingly friendly. When we returned from an afternoon of wandering the nearby shops and bars, I noticed a flashing light signaling a message on our phone. When I retrieved the message, the receptionist simply mentioned that the hotel wanted to bring something up to our room. A few minutes later, with a knock on our door, the staff delivered nice bottle of champagne with compliments and best wishes for our anniversary \u2013 a thoughtful and welcome touch! I stay in enough hotels to appreciate the challenge of providing apparently effortless service. In addition to a great physical plant and location, the Hotel Andra has mastered the service side of their business as well, giving guests a truly hospitable experience.

We had a great experience at the hotel and in Seattle! We stayed 3 nights in a Luxe Suite and feel like, compared to \"normal\" prices for a downtown hotel room, we got a good deal at $169 per night. Andra is close to EVERYTHING downtown. It's an easy 4 block walk to Pike Place Market, 2 blocks to Westlake Center for shopping, and there are outstanding restaurants all over the place. You can also take the monorail from Westlake for a 5 minute trip to the Space Needle and the EMP. The Sea-Tac train is across the street from Westlake as well so you can take it from the airport and back if you don't mind taking your luggage two blocks. We had carry-ons so it wasn't a big deal. You don't need a car here! Everything is close! :) We were met by the front desk employees for check-in and it went very smoothly. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area and the city. They also did things little things for you like hit the \"down\" button on the elevator for you as you walked down the hall if they happened to be standing close by. The lobby is great for sitting and visiting with friends or colleagues with nice furniture and a fireplace. There is easy access off the lobby to the bar area as well. The place is decorated beautifully with contemporary furnishings. The room was a typical two-room suite with a living area and separate bedroom with a french door entry. There was a couple of flat screen TVs and a desk for work if you need it. My wife liked the sitting area for putting on make-up, and that was needed considering the bathroom was a little on the small side. This is normal for older hotels that have been remodeled and it wasn't an issue. The entire room was roomy, and comfortable. There was ZERO wear and tear on this place. The upkeep seems to be really good and they take great care in making the place very clean. It's even nicer than it looks in the photos. My wife commented that it \"looks better than the web site\". The turn down service was great too as they put on nice music and leave delicious dark chocolates. Restaurants: Eat at Lola in the lobby! Great eggs benedict! Across the street is Dahlia Lounge which was good. Serious Pie (pizza) is across the street on Virginia Street and is SERIOUSLY good. We had it twice! Ralph's Grocery is at the end of the block on 4th Street take a right out of the lobby and it's on the corner. They have a really good wine selection, groceries, food, etc. I was actually really surprised how nice it was inside.

Fantastic restaurants, a remarkable array of shops and Seattle Art Museum (adorably called SAM) are within walking distance. When I realized the famous Pike Place Market is only four blocks away, I made it top priority after check-in to see the throwing of the fish. If you don\u2019t know what I mean, you need to come see for yourself. ROOMS I tend to believe it is an advantage for a hotel to begin as apartments. My husband and I travel non-stop to review hotels and agree that larger rooms with a homey feel tend to be much more livable than a standard hotel room. Hotel \u00c4ndra\u2019s 119 rooms also incorporate a nice desk, good lighting, plenty of outlets, and a clock with iPod input making it conducive to working as well. BEYOND ROOMS The design here is anything but beige! \u00c4ndra went to great lengths to be genuine in its tribute to the design of Scandinavia. The lobby or Living Room (as it is called) has a huge fireplace flanked by chopped wood, ready to warm those by the fire. The bookcases above the wood supply display beautiful glass vases and books on Scandinavia. My favorite feature in the entire hotel was the real aquarium, simply adorned with lights and brilliant green grass. DINING In my opinion, Seattle is a Dining Destination. Hotel on-site restaurants have to compete with the best of the best in the culinary world, especially when they serve seafood. \u201cLola\u201d serves Pacific Northwest fare with a Greek influence. The restaurant holds its own, especially with desserts. The mini doughnuts with dipping sauce are delicious. HISTORY Hotel \u00c4ndra has taken Seattle\u2019s metropolitan vibe and the tasteful simplicity of Scandinavian design to create a vibrant boutique hotel in the heart of the city\u2019s most exciting area. The building began as apartments in 1926 then became a transfer station for the Women\u2019s Army Corps in 1945. In the 70s, it found its calling as a small hotel and in 2004 completed its metamorphosis into the modern hotel it is now\u2014all without losing its original charm. It\u2019s no wonder that its name means \u201cchange\u201d in Swedish. MY RECOMMENDATION When I choose a hotel to review, it has already passed a thorough vetting. On occasion, a hotel exceeds my expectations as this one did. I enjoyed my time very much at Hotel \u00c4ndra. I recommend it based on its excellent location, friendly staff, home-like feel, gorgeous d\u00e9cor, and wonderful desserts.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Washington", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kenny S", "ReviewID": "UR125799300", "Content": "I've stayed here twice, once overlooking the street, the last time looking onto the roof of an old building.

The bathroom was a bit small compared to other luxury hotels, however, they have made great use of the available space - plenty of counters and a lovely full shower with great amenities. In fact, I took several pictures and measurements to get ideas for my own small bathroom reno. The bed was very comfortable and the room lighting was good. There was some street noise during the night, (particularly a beeping cross walk), but this did not surprise me as any downtown hotel is bound to have city noise - all part of the adventure! However, if noise really bothers you, you might want to stay out of the downtown core, or ask for the quieter side.

We ate dinner there the first day, and the food was the best we had in Seattle. The staff was also very helpful and had a cab waiting to pick us up Sunday morning to take us to the pier.

We chose to use the certificate at Lola (fresh hot hand melt in your mouth donuts, best Bloody Mary's which included jalepeno infused Vodka and Eggs Benedict from scratch, one of the best breakfasts we have ever had). The room was quite large, very clean, contemporary, oversized robes, Starbucks coffee maker, flat screen, wine glasses and opener, ironing board, seperate powder area,we were on the 7th floor and had city views which were fun at night. The 4 Star review is due to one area that while not the hotel's fault could be rectified with a simple solution and that is the street noise heard all night long. I suggest small ear plugs like the Chrysalis in Bellingham supplies guests for the train noise (not the same train VS cars however light sleepers will be disapointed to be awake all night). We want to acknowledge Justin for his amazing guest service (remembering our names, hailing cabs within seconds, remembering where we were going and where we had been) as a manager myself it is team members such as he that bring customers back, service, service, service.

We booked the Northern Neighbours Package that included free internet and 50% off parking and a complimentary room grade upon arrival. Before leaving home I decided I wanted to guarantee the suite, so I emailed the hotel and asked to be moved into a Suite, the told me there were not any available. So I checked Hotels.ca and there were suites showing as available. I phoned the Hotel and was told that there were suites, so upgrade my reservation. Then later that same day I received and email saying there had been cancellations so a suite was available (this email from the person that had earlier said there were no suites until I asked via email why Hotels.ca was showing them). So all that was a bit confusing for me. In the end we got the suite as a complimentary upgrade for the misunderstanding and miscommunication. First, I love small boutique hotels, I am not a fan of mega hotels. I loved the lobby and the design. I loved the furnishings in the rooms, a mix of contemporary decor within a historic building. One issue though was the lighting in the room was horrible. I could not see in the closet, I could not see in the dresser and had to feel around for my clothes, even with the lights all turned on and the drapes open. The bathroom was surprisingly small considering the size of the rest of the suite. We had also asked for housekeeping to put the pull our sofa away during the day and make it up again at night for our daughter. This never happened as requested. We also arrived back one afternoon at 4:00 to find the room still had not been cleaned for the day. This was quite disappointing. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and treated my daughter with respect and kindness. The location was great for walking pretty much everywhere. The TV in the elevator - they have to go.... I don't watch TV and I don't allow my daughter to watch TV so I am very disturbed when I see TVs in public spaces where I have no control over what she sees. And even if I was not traveling with her , I don't want to be bombarded by marketing and the negativity on the news in every public space I visit. The desk space in the suite was great for working however the internet was quite sloe..So all in all some mixed feelings about the hotel.

I called down to inquire and never got a return call so I went to the front desk myself. I was informed that there was only one Lux Suite with a tub and it was in use. They were willing to downgrade me to a smaller room with a tub, but that was it. The other lady, maybe front desk manager, was just matter of fact about it all, and not a bit concerned. Also, it took forever for our car to be brought out front the first couple of times we asked. We always called ahead, giving them plenty of time to walk across the street to the parking garage and go up the 4 levels to get the car. Lola's was closed for kitchen renovation, opening back up the last night we were there. Not a big deal as we always eat elsewhere in Seattle.

We were given a room on the 4th floor which had a view of the top of the Space needle, we were very pleased about that since we did not realize it could be seen from this hotel. We had a studio room which is their smallest, it was definitely small, but we knew that when booking, but the price was just very good on that particular room. The style of the room was very modern, as was the bathroom. The bed was very nice and comfortable, no problem sleeping after lots of walking in Seattle and hiking Mt Rainier one day. There is a chair and desk in the room, also another unit with a mini bar and coffee maker and more snacks on top, all of which are a little pricey. If you are wanting snacks for the room, check out the little grocery on the corner of the street, it's opposite the movie theater. We loved the bedside lamps in the room, we want some for our own bedroom. There is a flat screen mounted on the wall, and there are 2 bedside tables and a closet with a safe, we had just enough places to put all our things. Everything was extremely clean. The only complaint room wise was the walls seemed quite thin, and we had some noisy people next to us, sounded like they were throwing things around the room all the time. Luckily we were always so tired from our busy days that by the time we got in each night we had no problem going straight to sleep. The lobby of the hotel is very nice and cosy, it was rainy the first couple of days, and when you come in from the rainy and windy outside weather the lobby is very inviting. There were 2 different people always standing at the front door to open the door and greet the guests, the lady was always nice, but one man who always stood outside was never friendly, he seemed unhappy to be there, I can understand I don't always have a good day at work, but this was everyday that we saw him. The hotels location is great 10- 15 minutes from the Space needle,10 minutes from Pike place market, 20 - 25 minutes from the Washington ferries and Pioneer sq area and 5 minutes from the light link rail at westlake center. Restaurant and bar Lola is off of the lobby, they offer dining all day and also have a late night menu. Directly across the street is the Dahlia lounge, both are Tom Douglas restaurants, both have great food, but we preferred the atmosphere in the Dahlia lounge, you should definitely check out both of them while staying here. We had called for wake up calls 2 of the mornings we stayed here and we were not let down. At check out time we had the same lady who checked us in, she was very friendly.

Initially we were hesitant in staying downtown because a) too many cars/too much traffic, b) downtown Seattle can feel a bit overwhelming and impersonal, and c) to get anywhere, one must get in their car and drive. Not having stayed at Hotel Andra before (or any new hotel for that matter) invoked some uncertainty as to how things will be. Hotel Andra changed these perceptions (much to our delight!) and exceeded our expectations of a boutique hotel. The warmth and friendliness starts the moment you pull your vehicle up to the front door, from the valets to the front desk reception. The front waiting area of the hotel is understated elegance and simple but yet exudes much comfort. The understated elegance and simplicity is carried forth in the rooms and overall in the hotel. We got a great hotel rate and stayed in the king suite, which was a comfortable size room. While it was a hotel room, it did not feel like a hotel room. It felt more like a comfortable personal space that one might have in their own home. But the wonderfulness of Hotel Andra does not stop there. Attached to the hotel is a place called Lola's, owned by a renowned Seattle chef. My husband and I had a drink there the afternoon we checked in and breakfast the following day. Both times, the service and food was impeccable and delicious! (I highly recommend the made-to-order donuts!) Location wise, Hotel Andra was a perfect spot for one wanting to close to downtown venues and activities. We were within walking distance to the 5th Avenue Theatre, Pike's Market, close to all the main shopping downtown and a whole lot more. It was actually really nice that we didn't have to drive around to different places. (Oh, and did I mention about a little bakery across from the hotel, the Dahlia Bakery? Delicious breads and \"I'm in Tropical Paradise\" triple coconut cream pies??) The only negative about the whole experience is that I can't find any negatives! (not that I am looking but usually there are always some...) So, there you have it. Hotel Andra is that little piece of heaven in Seattle!

Decent sized room, with a comfortable sofa, and nice king size bed. The GF enjoyed the little area she could sit to do her makeup, and I was very impressed by the fantastically designed toilet/shower room. One of the nicest I have seen in a long time. I read a lot of comments on tripadvisor about hotel shower pressure. Let me tell you - in the Andra, it might be TOO powerful! Very refreshing. The location of the hotel was very good. We managed to easily walk to all that we wanted. We prefer to walk around the neighbourhoods, to really get a feel for the places we are visiting, and we walked to and from the Space Needle in the evening after dark, with no issues at all. Easy. Area seemed very safe too. My only negative comment is that of noise. Yes, I know that the hotel is located in the middle of a city. But our room was located on the front side of the hotel, overlooking 4th Avenue. Even up on 10th floor and it remained very loud late into the Friday night, with sirens and loud vehicles. My GF had a tough time sleeping, and I was also woken a couple of times. Not what we needed the day before our 11 hour flight back to Europe. My tip to you all would be to demand a room on the rear of the hotel, away from 4th. I will absolutely consider this property next time I am in Seattle.

The bathroom is a little small but totally functional. It has the \"boutique hotel\" feeling. The location is excellent, within walking distance of most of the downtown sites and some excellent restaurants.

The first night was room service by Lola & Serious Pie. Fabulous (if pricey) room service. Breakfast (both mornings) at Lola were remarkably good as well. The octopus, bacon, brussell sprout, parsnip hash (aka Tom's Big Breakfast) sounds extremely odd but tastes fantastic (serious umami factor for breakfast)! Serious Pie makes some the best pizza I've ever tried and the food/service at Dahlia Lounge was very good and accommodating to our 3 & 5 year old sons. The service at the hotel was professional but slightly less than warm and welcoming (I suspect that having our two little guys in tow was slightly off-putting for the staff given that their presence may undermine the skinny-fabulous-fashionista demographic that most boutique hotels are hoping to attract).

We travel relatively frequently and Seattle always makes for a great romantic get-away weekend, which typically includes shopping, dining and clubbing. We've stayed in a variety of hotels in Seattle (often selected by Hotwire or Priceline because you can get some great deals using both) and while most of them have been \"nice,\" none of them have ever just blown us out. As I wanted this weekend to be extra-special, I decided to do research and book directly thru the hotel. My final selection was a suite the Hotel Andra. Wow! What a fantastic find. From the staff, to the decor, to the room size, it was perfection in every way. It was a front corner suite with loads of light and great views of the active neighborhood. We were not bothered by street noise, as a number of people had reported. About the only bad thing I could find was an area of common complaint in other reviews: The bathroom is small and poorly lit. We brought a floor lamp in from the living room for extra light. This is not saying that it wasn't stylish - it was quite stylish. it was also small and dark. There's not much they can do about the size (old building) but some additional light would be nice. The service was exceptional and anything we wanted or needed was taken care of perfectly. When Lola, one of two restaurants in the hotel, was packed, we called downstairs and had a table waiting in short order. Lola was the other great find of the weekend, by the way. What a great restaurant. We had both dinner and breakfast there and both were REALLY good. Back to the hotel. We arrived at 4pm intending to relax, go out to dinner and then head out to some clubs for the night. We didn't leave the hotel until 2pm the following afternoon. Between the fantastic suite, the great bar and two top restaurants, there was no reason to leave the building!", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, very good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Travellerisrael", "ReviewID": "UR93482883", "Content": "I stayed in the hotel for 4 days during January and had a good experience.

It's true that like every big city there are quite a bit of homeless around but I guess that is true for all of downtown Seattle, and in my opinion it is actually worse around pioneer square a few blocks to the south. Lola restaurant, one of Tom Douglas's (the local celebrity chef) restaurant is at the hotel and Dhalia lounge, bakery and serious pie, three of his other restaurants and bakeries are across the street, so you will never go hungry even if you don't want to leave your room. Staff - I only had contact with them during check in and out which were fast and efficient. the bell boys/valet always smiled at you and were always very polite. room - the room was spacious, nice, and had all the amenities you would expect to find at such a hotel. the only annoying thing is you had to pay for the WI-FI access. the exercise room was small but sufficient. The decor of the hotel is very Nordic and the lobby is very inviting. I also had quite a good deal reserving a long time ahead but generally speaking it's not a cheap hotel.

We didn't think much of it since the seal is still intact, so we just left it where we found it. When we checked out the next morning, there was a charge of almost $4 for that bottle of water. After I explained it to them, they did take it off. As I was going through my credit card statement after we got home, I noticed there was another charge of $5.48 from the hotel. I called and asked and was told that was for a bag of m&ms and a snickers bar, which again we did not have!!!!!! Please beware of your bill and check closely if you do decide to stay at this hotel.

Great location within walking distance to Pike Place Market and downtown shopping in general. Steps from all the restaurants (including many of the Tom Douglas empire).

Space was good with a sitting area with couch. Our room had a view from the back of the hotel of the Space Needle. The only negatives of the stay: pricey parking ($39/night, which I guess is standard for downtown Seattle hotels), the toilet was wedged into the bathroom such that the toilet paper dispenser is basically in your lap (at least in our room, I don't know if all rooms have the same setup), and the bed was a little soft for my partner (fine for me).

Borderline Downtown, edging into Belltown, very walkable. Our first problem was arriving. The hotel does not have an on-site garage or an area to pull into. The street in front, however, is designated a \"Passenger Drop Off Zone\", and they do have a Bell Desk on the sidewalk. There were no valets or doormen present and cars were parked in front on this busy street, with buses bearing down on us, so we drove around the block. On return, still no one to assist & no place to pull in -- we double parked & I went inside. No one at the desk. I was fully expecting to see our car rear-ended as cars swerved around us ... & we waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up. While we waited, we watched as hotel management dealt with a couple whose car had been vandalized while valet parked -- the window smashed. Finally a woman came to the desk & when I told her the problem with being double-parked, she smiled & patronizingly assured me that this happens all the time. I was hoping she was not referring to the vandalism! Our room was not ready, so we waited another 20 minutes or so, before being given keys to a room with a queen bed. We had reserved a king suite. We called the desk & were told they would bring up keys for a different room. The 1st room faced the back & definitely had a rather cold, un-welcoming feel to it. The bedspread had a stain right in the center. The 2nd room faced the street & was far more welcoming & comfortable. The street is noisier, but we prefer that to looking out on brick walls & industrial roof tops. The bed was exquisitely comfortable & the towels & linens wonderful. I loved the down pillows & comforter, & the warm, comfy bathrobe, & I enjoyed a power nap under the soft, extra blanket. Rather modern styled furnishings in a classicly styled room & it worked. Nice little bar area & bags of ice at the elevators fit right into the ice bucket. The downside -- the small bathroom. The toilet barely flushed. The sink tilted the wrong direction so the water would not drain out of it. Pretty yucky. Watch your elbows when sitting on the toilet -- a bit cramped. Lola's bar & restaurant is trendy with a nice atmosphere, good drinks, fun place. We didn't eat there -- we walked accross the street to one of my favorite haunts, The Dahlia Lounge. But we did have a bite off the bar menu -- lamb kabobs & pita with cauliflower & anchovy spread. I wouldn't do that again. The lamb was very tough & chewy & the \"carmelized onions\" were barely warm. The pita triangles were good, as was the spread, but there was not a hint of anchovy in it, and that's a taste that's pretty hard to hide. We had a great weekend escape & a very comfortable nights sleep, so if this is what you're looking for, Hotel Andra will fill the bill nicely.

It's also a traditional-sized hotel - not some mini-B&B wedged into a small lot, or a mega-hotel where you are just a number. Huge bed, writing/pantry area, huge walk-in closet, and beautiful bathroom that kept the historic features, but had all the latest updates. I especially liked the \"dimmable\" lamp they had in the bathroom, as well as the architectural features. There was a large flat screen TV, and wide full length mirror. The windows opened completely, if that's what you want...I was awakened the next morning to the birds singing in the trees right outside my window on 4th Avenue! That street is relatively quiet at night, so ask to face front. I didn't have time to sample the lounge, and restaurant, but they looked interesting and active. The restaurant is open early to serve a full breakfast. The hip design lobby was a buzz of activity, and all guests seemed happy - Nobody screaming at the desk or to eachother. The concierge was always there and helpful with my questions. The location is just fantastic, I was able to shop and drop stuff off at my room, and then go back out again. Westlake center is a few blocks away, with connections to the bus, light rail, and the Monorail out to Seattle Center. There's a Bed Bath and Beyond just across the street that has most anything a traveler could want. And you can spend a whole day shopping around Westlake and Pacific center - lots of nice shops and restaurants. Just past the Westin on 5th Avenue, there's a street car - http://www.seattlestreetcar.org that takes you out to a beautiful lake with a whole complex of shops and beautiful restaurants - It's a great way to get away from the tourist traps downtown, and see where the locals go..Get off at Lake Union Park station. All the attractions are close by, too including Bell Town. If you go all the way down to the piers, you'll need to take a cab back because that is an uphill hike! You might want to cab it to Pike's Market after hours, the area inbetween the hotel and the market fills up with characters after dark. I was sad to leave this hotel, and will be returning for a few days sometime just to enjoy the Seattle experience even more!

One concern was that the doors between the two rooms of the suite are not solid, they are open slats. So if you are in one room and want to watch the TV while someone in the other room is sleeping, the sound gets through. Unfortunately, I've found most suites are like this these days. The room was new and nicely decorated. Rooms size is decent, and the closet is huge -- like small walk in room. Hotel seems well built and the rooms are quiet. The main bed was great. The fold out bed was not so good. Very saggy. An adult might not be happy with it, but the two children were fine. Valet parking is available. Not cheap, but about the same price as it costs to self-park in Downtown Seattle so a good deal. One concern we had was that the windows could be opened all the way. This was a huge worry for us since the hotel is on the 8th floor. We watch the boys but you never know -- and it is a LONG way down. The air conditioning works well so we did not need to open them. I mentioned this to the front desk, not expecting anything to come of it. But, surprisingly, the next day a guy came to our room and attached some brackets to the windows which blocked them from opening at all. He said the manager had sent him, and that he would come back after we left and take the brackets off. This just blew me away.

We got a GREAT deal- 20% off the usual price by calling to make the reservation and prepaying it (rather than reserving online, as we would usually do). I had been considering one of the \"packages\" offered on the hotel's website (www.hotelandra.com) but because the trip was only for 2 days, 1 night, I wasn't sure if it would be worth doing. One of the main reasons I was interested is because of the valet parking included in one of the packages, so I mentioned this to the woman taking my reservation on the phone, and she said she could give me half off velet parking. Nice! At any rate, the hotel was an old building that had been beautifully remodeled. It was very mod. Our room was gorgeous. The bathroom was small but you could tell exactly what it must have looked like \"back in the day.\" In other words, they had kept the character of the room, and this was most evident in the bathroom, where the totally new & modern fixtures were updated versions of the fixtures that were likely there in the hotel's original heyday. (According to a friend of ours, the building used to be a \"transient hotel.\") I happen to love this look- sleek and modernized with the old character still intact. Our bed was very comfortable, there was a nice flat panel TV in the room, and the bathtub was huge, I am So happy I indulged in a bath before I left. The shampoo and other products were from a company called Face and they were White Tea fragrance. They smelled so good I wish I knew where to buy them. The view from our window was unfortunately pretty crappy because the building across the street was under construction. I would imagine that this will be a really cool view once it is done. But I don't spend much time looking out the window when I'm in a hotel anyway. :) The location was EXCELLENT. The hotel is located on 4th avenue- we were planning to see a show at Demetrious Jazz Alley on Saturday night for my birthday. This venue is on 6th avenue- as it turned out, we were in Easy walking distance of the show. Just a couple blocks. Perfect. We also met up with my husband's cousin Saturday afternoon at a place called Brasa- also just a few blocks away. This was a lounge that offered delicious food & drink. Great place to hang out and chat. Attached to the hotel is a retaurant called Lola. We went there for brunch when we got into town and for a cocktail after the show. The food at this place is Amazing- Greek-inspired cuisine by chef Tom Douglas. When our friends found out we were staying at the Andra, they demanded that we go to Lola, and we are damn glad we did. Also, the hotel is located across the street from the famous Dahlia Lounge, which is also a Tom Douglas restaurant. However, we did not have time to check it out. Regarding service: I had received a birthday gift of champagne, and the manager on duty (Kyle) called me to let me know. I appreciated that he called in the afternoon well after we had settled in even though he already knew about the gift when I got there. He asked when a good time would be to bring up the gift, and I said anytime. He said he would chill it first then bring it up in about 45 minutes. At precisely then, he arrived. When he got to the door, he asked if I wanted him to come in to set down the package. (Now, this may seem like an obvious question, BUT the last time we stayed somewhere, we ordered room service, and when it arrived, the guy literally just walked right in without asking! I was sitting there in my underwear, so it was really embarrassing.) Anyway, Kyle set down the package, wished me a happy birthday and was on his way. He was just a cool cat all around and a class act. In fact, I can say that Everyone we encountered at the Hotel Andra was very attentive, nice, friendly, and helpful. When we checked out on Sunday, they were pretty busy, but our car was brought promptly by the young valet, who asked us if we needed any directions. We actually did, and he provided very helpful directions for us. He was so nice and genuine that we talked about him when we got in the car and joked that it would be nice to have a son like that instead of the ones we do have. ha! I would highly recommend the Hotel Andra. As the construction around the hotel gets completed, I think this hotel is only going to become more desirable.

Overall, we were satisfied with our stay, as we got a deep discount, but I'm left wondering how or why they are listed with Small Luxury Hotels of the World. We had a Lux King corner suite, and the suite itself is quite spacious, and very quiet, we did have a restful sleep. Beds/linens were soft and comfortable, and they brought up extra pillows as requested. There was plenty of storage in our suite -- 2 closets and a set of drawers, plus the generously-sized night tables were a plus. However, the sofa was disappointing -- of cheap construction, and sagging in the middle; fairly uncomfortable to sit on to watch tv. The armchair seriously needed recovering, as the edges were worn, dirty and frayed. The suite is due for an overhaul soon; we noticed chipped paint throughout, plus chipped and scratched furniture. The carpets felt a bit grimy -- there was an overall feeling that the room could have been cleaner. The bathroom is small (I knew this going in, having read past reviews). This did not bother me much, as there were adequate shelves and storage. However, if you like soaking in the tub, forget it. The tub has a very low overflow drain, obviously designed by someone who hates baths. I'm 5'2\" and not very big -- the maximum water level came up to my lower abdomen. As I reclined trying to soak, the water kept draining off, and I gave up after about 5 minutes. Shower pressure is good and tons of hot water any time of the day. The Face Stockholm amenities are a delicious subtle white tea fragrance; however the bottles are the size of postage stamps, which seems cheap for a \"luxury\" hotel. The staff are happy to send up more, but it was tiring to request this on a daily basis. The staff were mostly 20-30 somethings and very pleasant and eager to please. However, I still feel they have not achieved a \"luxury\" level of service. We had a simple request that we be sent a Seattle Times, v. a New York times as we like to read local news. On a daily basis we received a New York times, which to give them credit, was swiftly replaced with a Seattle Times on request, but we shouldn't have had to keep asking for 4 days in a row. Another time we asked a desk person to reconfirm a reservation (the concierge had left) and he looked at us like we handed him a dead fish. It may seem that I'm nitpicking, but I would expect this from maybe a Motel 6 v. a \"luxury\" hotel. I would actually place the Andra slightly above a 3 star hotel, not at a \"luxury\" level. The staff for the most part, are accomodating and pleasant, and the room was ok.

I have never checked out of a hotel early in my many years of travel. I booked a room at the Hotel Andra almost 6 months before we went to Seattle. I booked directly through their website for a room described as \"2 Queens or 1 King\". I made a note in the reservation that I wanted the 1 King, as I was going with my boyfriend. When I got my confirmation via email, it said \"2 Queens\" but the note was on there about the 1 King, so I didn't worry about it. When we arrived, I verified with the front desk agent that we were indeed getting 1 King, not 2 Queens. He said only the 2 Queens room was available. Obviously, we did not want to spend our vacation time sleeping in separate beds. The only thing available with 1 bed was a Queen. In other words, we were downgraded. There was no offer made to lower our rate, though. I blew it off at first because we had received a great rate anyway. After we spent one night in the room, we were both miserable and grumpy with each other. The queen bed was just way too tiny after being used to a King at home, and the room itself was also incredibly small. The bathroom was hardly big enough to turn around in. And our view? Construction and another apartment building. I complained to a manager, who said they were completely booked so there was nothing he could do. We went back to our room, looked online, and were able to book a much nicer room beginning the next day (we were in town for 5 nights). I told the manager I was going to check out the next day. He told me I'd have to pay a $75 cancellation fee! When I balked, he said he'd have to talk to the reservation manager to get that waived, and he'd call me in the morning. We checked out and I told the woman at the front desk that I did not want to be charged the fee. She said ok, and didn't charge me. So, this was the only positive part of the experience. The reservation manager never called me. Aside from all this, I still wouldn't have liked this place- the neighborhood is really sketchy, even though there's a bunch of nice restaurants. We got asked for money every time we walked out of the hotel.

The decor is in muted tones and interesting textures. And the beds are amazingly comfortable: fine cotton sheets and soft down duvets and pillow made for a relaxing sleep. The bar and lobby area is great for kicking back - quite small but never had a problem getting in for late drinks. The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away.

Room was large and tastefully decorated - subtle and relaxed. Very useful kitchen area with sink. Bathroom was a bit small though. Bed was absolutely fantastic - perhaps the best I have stayed in. Room was very clean. The only drawback was that my room overlooked a building site, and the work started quite early each morning.

I prefer something that offers a distinct personality but also a calming sense of familiarity. That said, I hereby declare that the Hotel Andra in Seattle is the Tina Fey of the hospitality industry - alluring and cool and quirky and fun, all rolled into one. It's a rare find that offers exceptional design, ample space, distinct character, and stellar customer service. I came across the Andra via my secret weapon, aka my friend Steve who just happens to work for the Seattle Convention and Visitor's Bureau. With a prime location in the heart of Seattle's Belltown area and moderate price range (under $200/night), I knew we were off to a good start, and after poking around their website, the vibe and decor seemed like the right match too. I was instantly drawn in by the sleek lighting, clean lines, and tasteful color palette of muted blues, greys, and taupes, with touches of Scandanvian inspiration. The Andra was our last stop during our recent honeymoon vacation, and prior to checking in, I had just made my detour to Cupcake Royale. So as I approached the reception desk with a box of treats in hand, in lieu of the standard welcome, the person behind the counter launched into a bit about how nice it was for me to bring him cupcakes. I played right along - I love it when people loosen up and goof around like that, especially people who work in the higher end of the hospitality world, where more often than not you'll encounter some pretty stiff attitudes. The front desk staff seemed to think they were in a improv group, with me as their special guest star, so score one for the Andra. Score two was finding out upon check in that we'd been upgraded to a suite (thanks to the little Upgrade Fairy, also known as my friend Steve who had put in a call to the manager). Also, the timing couldn't have been better in terms of being granted additional space - we'd accumulated a lot of goodies over the past week, and found ourselves in a serious repacking situation, which meant needing some room to spread out. Wish granted: a corner suite with a spacious living room area that included a flatscreen TV, giant desk, and full length mirror, along with another flatscreen TV in the separate bedroom. The bathroom was also really cute and stylish, and the stash of Face Stockholm products made me a very happy girl.

The location couldn't be better. The first night we were there, we stayed in the Andra Suite. The room was moderately spacious and well designed. The mini-bar was well stocked, but a price list was no where to be found. Room service was from Lola the restaurant in the lobby. The food was very good, and the prices were very high. Overall we had a great experience. We unexpectedly decided to stay at the hotel a second night. After our great experience the first night, we decided to save some money and get the smaller Andra Studio because we didn't think we'd mind a simple size change, we expected everything else to be of the same quality. I can tell you the room size was pretty much the only physical change, but the service the second night didn't reflect it's four star rating. First, the window didn't open. Now this isn't a big deal to us, but when we called the front desk to see if there was a trick to getting the window open (because the windows in the suite opened), the gentleman told us that it doesn't open because of fire code, and all the windows on that floor were sealed shut. I know that's not true because we had stayed on the same floor the night before. We didn't appreciate being lied to. Next, we went to turn on the TV. It didn't work. We checked the plug, it was fine. We called the front desk. They said they'd send someone up to check on it. Forty-five minutes later, a girl from the front desk arrived, announced that maintenance was unavailable and that she was going to check it out. She walked over to the TV, pressed the same power button we had tried and checked the same plug we had checked (just like we told her on the phone). After she was unsuccessful, she told us that she didn't know what was going on, and that she'd try to find maintenance. Another twenty minutes go by, and she calls to tell us that eminence wasn't working and wouldn't be until morning. I told her that was unacceptable because we had plans to stay in for the remainder of the night and were going to watch TV. I requested a new room with a working TV. She told me there were no rooms available and that we'd just have to wait until eminence arrived. I explained that I found it hard to believe that they were sold out all of a sudden, considering we had checked in two hours earlier and they had all kinds of other room options available (including the suite we had stayed in the night before and the mid-range Andra Room). She then told me she'd have to call me back. They ended up moving us and the new room was just across the hall, the Andra Room (and by the way, the windows opened in it, too). This was the second lie of the night. In the morning, we hit the valet key on the phone, to request our car. The front desk answered and said that she'd be happy to have the valet pull the car. We waited ten minutes and walked downstairs (that's about how long it had taken them the day before). When we got down there, there were two valets standing around having a personal conversation. After we stood there for ten minutes, holding the blue valet ticket and tip money in my hand, one of them comes over and asked if we needed our car. I explained that we had called and the front desk said they were going to call out and request the car. He said they hadn't and it didn't surprise him because \"it had already happened a few times that morning\". All in all, I can't say much bad about the hotel, the rooms or the restaurant. I don't mind little things like the window not opening or having to change rooms because the TV doesn't work.

First impressions... great looking lobby, OVERWHELMING onion smell (in the lobby), arrogant front desk, cool elevators with televisions, attractive and modern room. At first, I thought I'd made a GREAT choice. It looked fantastic. But looks can be deceiving and like the saying goes \"beauty is only skin deep\", so was this hotel. Let me spew: we arrived quite late at night. Upon walking into our room, none of the lights came on. I had to fumble around in the dark to find a lamp. Our room was supposed to have a crib set up for our daughter, however it did not. When it was brought to our room, one side was separated and we were told we needed to read the instructions on how to put it together. It was 11pm, we had been travelling all day with a young child, and were really not in the mood to put it together. We DID NOT pay 200+ dollars a night to put the bed together!!!! We called down to the front desk and told them to send someone up to fix the problem. The same guy came up, but by then we had nearly sorted it out. This just seemed unbelievable that a hotel of this quality would do such a thing. Once settled in bed, we were kept awake for hours because of the noise from downstairs. We could hear the music from the lobby/bar in both our room and the bathroom and we could constantly hear noise from the street (both valet and traffic, especially lots of sirens). I can honestly say that these were the worst 3 nights of sleep I've had since getting the baby to sleep through the night. While the bed was quite comfortable, the pillows were not. They were limp down pillows and just extremely uncomfortable. We decided to turn the a/c on to cool down the room, but it was horribly noisy and smelled like a baby powder scent was being pumped through (post-pregnancy supernose power smells everything!). I am not 100% positive, but I would hazard a guess that it was to help clear out the onion aroma. Regardless of smell, it was so loud we couldn't hear the tv without cranking up the volume, so we kept it off. Yet another annoyance. Speaking of tv, I was under the impression that our room was supposed to have a plasma tv but it was just a flat screen, regular one. The room (Lux Suite) was clean and a fairly good size, including a separate sink/minibar area, desk, and couch. The bathroom was fairly small, and the toiletries were nothing special. There were lots of lights and lamps, which was nice. The hotel does have a small exercise room (just looked in) and a computer room with 2 computers, which I did use. The location was pretty decent and within walking distance to most everything. The front desk staff was NOT at all friendly. They never looked up or said hi when you passed right by them to get to the elevator. The only people who were friendly, were 2 valet guys. We didn't have any issues parking or retrieving our car, like a previous poster mentioned. However, we did call down to get it out in advance. Valet was $24/night. We never went to the restaurant, LOLA (didn't seem suitable for children), so I can't give a review for that, but it looked fine from the outside. The day before we left, the cleaning staff hadn't cleaned our room by 2pm (we'd been out), so I called down to see if someone could come up before I put our daughter down. They decided to come back at 4pm after her nap. Needless to say, when they finally came back, my husband was in the bathroom, so I asked if they could give us a minute. They said \"no\" and that they had to leave for the day. I rushed him out of there, much to his dismay. I hope he left them a nice, and hopefully worse than onion aroma, if you get what I'm saying. :) This was just NOT the level of service I expected from a small luxury hotel. The last morning, we were awake by 5am because of all the street noise/valet, so we decided to just pack up and get out of there. When we checked out, I was completely ready to let the front desk clerk know just how terrible our stay was, only he never even asked. Funny that!!!! Seriously, how can you not ask how everything was????? I was so amazed I just walked out shaking my head. Thank goodness for tripadvisor. I thought, at least I can tell people who might care! To sum up this hotel... it is very nice looking inside. Once you start looking beyond the decor, you realize that they've taken an old hotel and spruced it up without properly insulating the walls from noise. They've put arrogant, uncaring people out as their representatives, who are disinterested in creating a positive guest experience. I don't care if it is the most gorgeous place I've ever seen, if I can't sleep and the staff are rude, it just ruins everything.

I speak of the the kind of toss-off of thrift-store-potpourri or the hyper-self-consciously modern style featuring austere curved shapes of polished metal. But the work done on the Hotel Andra truly impressed me. The choices made in design were, to my eye, very intelligent and finely tuned. The first thing that stood out to me was the choice of carpeting in the halls. The usual flavor of mass produced homogenous pattern that screams volume discount above all else in most places (even luxury hotels) is abandoned for a dark purple field with modest framing lines on the margins. In addition the monotony of most hallways is broken up by a few subtle, long, thin, curved shapes along one margin. The subtlety of the lines, like modest scrollwork, that eschew the mundane and base inclination of symmetry achieves an effect that is stimulating but far from overbearing. For the weary traveler who may not have the energy to actively appreciate the other appointments this touch is quite uplifting. The rest of the build is a great succcess in reclaiming an aging building with modern design. Along the center of corridor ceilings a section of perforated brushed sheet metal reveals only to close inspection the space that holds pipes and conduit as well as overhead halogen lighting. It is a laudable design statement that refuses to simply veneer over the old with the typical staple-on finishings that are the hallmark of mass-market remodeling. The rooms blend the old building with tasteful understated elegance of modern furnishings. The bedding is lush and generous in pillows and blanketing. The bathroom was nicely reclaimed from the buildingd previous exixtence with modern fixtures that emulated the old, like a new pedestal basin. This choice leaves only a shelf along walll over the sink and a pedestal side stand for personal effects which might create a space shortage for travelers with a lot of personal hygiene and cosmetics. The old floor that was the familiar 1 inch hexagonal tiles was reclaimed by sanding down the old surface. This effect was obviously efficacious but, not my favorite technique. The random fade of the original borders of the hexagons seemed too haphazard. I would have looked for some other treatment in addition to liven up the old floor but this is a minor criticism.

Unfortunately, my stay did not live up to the hype. Things started off bad right off the bat due to the awful valet parking situation at this hotel. The valet parking attendants were not to be found so we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to show up and give us a claim ticket. Throughout the three days we spent there, the valet parking situation was a constant hassle. Sometimes no one was there; sometimes there was no space in front of the hotel to drop off the car because limos and other cars were parked there for the adjacent restaurants; sometimes even when someone was there it took them over 15 minutes to get the car brought around (and this was after calling them from the room ahead of time to have the car brought around). We discovered that the hotel is contracting this service out and will not be providing valet parking service on its own until the beginning of next year. This was a really annoying aspect of the hotel. We tried to check in at 3 p.m. Mind you, we had called ahead of time since we were out shopping and asked if the room would be ready at 3 p.m. and we were assured that it would be. We got to the hotel at 3:15 p.m. and sure enough, the room was not ready. It was not ready for another 30 minutes. The front desk staff was aloof, unhelpful and lacking in social skills. There was only one front desk employee during the course of the three days that actually seemed like he enjoyed helping the clientele. The rest just sat there chatting with each other and barely looked up when anyone passed by. One night we discovered that the valet parking attedant was not outside to take our car because he was inside chatting and laughing with the two girls at the front desk. Needless to say, I was not amused. The previous comments about the hotel smelling like onion is absolutely. . .TRUE. At night when the restaurant in the lobby gets cooking, you will smell onions throughout the hotel. We were on the NINTH floor and we smelled it in the hallways up there. Luckily, the smell did not travel into our room, but every time we walked through the lobby I thought I was going to hurl. It was that strong. Perhaps the front desk people at night were so much like zombies because they had to inhale that awful stench all night long. As far as the room goes, I was very unimpressed. The bathroom was tiny and very hard to get around. The bath products were average at best. I decided to use my own that I had brought from home, and I almost never do that. To their credit, the bed was extremely comfortable. The pillows could have been fluffier though. We had a junior suite, so we had some extra space. There was a couch, coffee table and a small bar area in the living portion of the room. The room had absolutely no view, so we did not spend much time in the room at all. The air conditioning worked well, so that was a saving grace for the room. The location is very good. It is central to shopping and the sights. Personally, I prefer to stay closer to the shops. I definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt Elliott Bay as a wonderful 5-star hotel with impeccable rooms, service and location. The Hotel Andra was very disappointing. I kept trying to be optimistic and find positive things about the experience. But, quite frankly, there were very few things about my stay there that leave happy memories.
