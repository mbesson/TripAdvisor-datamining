I stumbled on the last room at the Alba Opera Hotel in an area of Paris I didn't know well. It is in the 9th but at the very top. Only a short walk away from the restaurants and fashion shops of Montmartre. Situated in a small cul de sac the outlook from our room was very \"French\". The room size was enormous. Big bathroom as well.(For Paris) We had our own kitchen equipped with a small fridge, microwave & sink. The owners have only been there for 3 years and are on a quest to make this hotel their \"own\". Lovely interior courtyard perfect for an afternoon aperitif. A wee bit tired in the corridors but it's the corridor so who cares? Wrought iron lift that I don't think Louis would have fitted in!!! Quirky deco. Feathered light fittings and the odd sighting of Barbie and Batman.

So if money would allow it, i will always stay in as-high-a-star rated hotel as possible. With planning a wedding, we were sticking to quite a strict budget on our trip to Paris. i tend to establish my price range and then figure out which hotel has the best reviews and go for that one. That's what i did with the Alba Opera. I wasn't blown away from the pictures and i could tell it def. wasn't a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination. But upon arrival until we left, i was incredibly impressed with how the staff treated their customers. Yes the hotel wasn't particularly modern and could do with a bit of a revamp / spruce up but i really felt like everything that the staff had immediate control over, was perfect. They were incredibly courteous, kind and friendly. They offered great advice; Whenever we go to a new place, we like to ask the locals for the best places to eat etc and every recommendation that was provided by the staff came up trumps. Some say the breakfast was a little overpriced, and perhaps it was compared to going to a Boulangerie, but breakfast fast became my favourite meal of the day. The food was very fresh and plentiful. They would give you extra items upon request at no extra charge. They also said to us that we could have breakfast whenever we wanted to and that if we wanted it in our room, they would be happy to bring it to us. The location of the hotel was fantastic and it had a great little boutiquey feel. There's one tiny tiny lift that will take you to all the floors but this isn't big enough if you were in a wheelchair for instance. As the hotel was located just up a side street, it was very quiet at night. Overall, the room was very clean with fresh linens. The room did smell a little bit stale (i'm assuming it used to be a smoking room) but with everything else really impressing me, this was a non-factor. the free WIFI was an added a bonus :-) I would def. recommend as a pleasant place to stay when in Paris.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, ca", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "GolferWC", "ReviewID": "UR102992041", "Content": "The rooms were not what we expected for a 3 star hotel, but I think our standards may be too high based on what we're used to in the U.S. The rooms were clean, small and dated.

We read the reviews, so were prepared for the worn carpets and tired decor. But love the atmosphere. For a city hotel, very quiet (except the bin collections at about 6 on Friday mornings)! No clock available. Kitchenette wasn't quite what we expected, the microwave is very high on the wall. You pay 3 Euros for kitchen pack (2 plates, mugs, tumblers and wine glasses + basic cutlery) No pans - but we didn't ask. You'll need to take your own coffee/tea etc, as none is provided. It was nice to have the extra room to sit in if one wakes earlier than the other (and drink tea of course). Ended up eating out (tres cher!!) at lovely nearby restaurants, but at least we had the choice. The beds were comfortable - no duvets here. Loved the lift, but as we were only on first floor,didn't use it. Bath lovely, with over the taps shower which was extremely powerful, if a little leaky. Yes, you can hear others up and down stairs, but not boom, boom, boom of loud music!! We didn't have the breakfast, so can't comment on the dining room - but McCafe is nearby (towards Cadet metro station) and has offer of pastry + drink for 1.80 euros, which has to be a record. Would recommend the Auberge du Clou just around the corner (turn right out of the hotel road and right onto Rue de Martyrs and it's at the top facing you. About 5 mins walk). Lovely food, very friendly atmosphere. The Fuxia on R.de Martyrs is also good Italian. All food and drink in Paris is pricey, so be prepared. Outside the Louvre, a large beer and mint tea was 14 Euros!!! Transport is easy - nearby you have several metro stations, which are easier to navigate than the buses, and more frequent. Do go to the Latin Quarter, and sit outside the coffee shop in front of the Sorbonne - it's lovely surrounded by all sorts of different people, not just tourists. And the Jardin des Plantes has lovely places to sit (and it's free). The Eiffel Tower will often be a long wait (sometimes hours), so start early.

Definitley in the Monmatre district rather than the opera district though close enough to walk to either, and around a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro (Pigalle). The Pigalle/Moulin Rouge area is very seedy and best avoided on an evening, though further up the hill there a hundreds of nice bustling cafes/restaurants - and one called the 'Zebra' (rue le pic) is well worth a visit for reasonabley priced gorgeous French food. There is a bar just as you come out of the hotel and turn right called Oscar's lounge, which is a quiet, local friendly bar worth a visit in the very reasonable happy hour (5pm - 9pm).

Currently being modernised by its delightful owners but as it is just now -spotlessly clean and very comfortable and welcoming. Very traditionally Parisienne in that the building crams a lot into a small space (the two person lift is fascinating and fabulous). We had one of the smaller rooms but, even still, more floor space than in other Paris hotels we have stayed in - a reasonable sized double room, a shower room and a small kitchen which were all clean and well kept. The staff were all really nice people (including the two owners who have only recently taken over ) who spoke better English than our French, and were always helpful and friendly. Plans to extend the foyer and the enclosed courtyard at the back sound really interesting and we hope to go back to see how it looks when completed. Not flash - not formulaic - as it is clean, comfortable, friendly and with the potential to be even better in the near future.
