Plenty of restaurants near by for dinner as well. The bad: Walls are paper thin and we had on the room next to us a group of pretty loud teenagers celebrating until 2am. On the room for some reason you could hear the elevator going up and down. The Ugly. We booked through priceline and got \"a deal\" i I always make sure i say we are 2 adults-2 kids. When we got there the folks at the reception said that that price was only for 1 queen bed and they were happy to upgrade us to 2 queens for an extra $30... so the \"deal\" was gone.

There were some issues that we experienced during our stay that made the rating drop. As others have stated the walls are thinner than paper therefore you can hear EVERYTHING including the toilets being flushed in other rooms. We were there for 3 nights and the first night the 20 somethings that occupied the room next to us felt they needed to come home at 1:30am and share the entire night out they just had with all that would hear as they were yelling and laughing and slamming doors. The positive was that after we called security (the came up within 3 mins) they were quiet. They had moved elsewhere but when they returned an hour and a bit later they were loud again but only for a short time. Our second night was wonderful. The party crowd checked out and we had a great sleep until the last night when they checked in a young couple with a newborn that screamed ALL NIGHT til 3 am. They really need to think about where they place people especailly when the hotel is not even close to being full and we specifically requested a quiet room since we have experienced similar issues in the past. Do not put a baby next us if there is a chance it may scream all night. It's like going into a resturaunt that's almost empty and they seat you next to the rowdiest table in the place. A little common sense would be great. The front staff were more than willing to fix the issue as best they could and since our stay was by using points they asked if comping our parking would be fair and we agreed.

Also, we could very clearly hear our neighbors on each side. On one side, our living room connected to another unit via a locked door that was not soundproof at all.

The parking was an easy in and out and I had no charge even when I stayed parked there for hours after check-out. Breakfast was mediocre but service was friendly and included pancakes, eggs, meat, oatmeal, juice, yogurt, fruit, and bagels/toast. At nearly half the price of nearby hotels, this one stands out as a particularly good value in an excellent location.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good rooms\u201d", "Author": "emily1535", "ReviewID": "UR120387704", "Content": "The hotel is just 2 blocks away from the westlake station, which is the station of the light rail (only $2.75) from the airport.

Strange? That, and the 'discounted' booking rate was $280 a night, plus $39 a night for parking. Yikes!

Right on 5th Avenue with plenty of coffee shops around and within walking distance of Pike's Place Market. The hotel bar/restaurant Elephant and Castle was a pretty good place to hang out also. The restaurant upstairs was also great for breakfast. I have to give a shout out to the bartender there - the bar was not yet open because it was their 'continental'-style breakfast going on, but we had all partied so hard after the wedding the night before I NEEDED a bloody mary - he opened the bar for me and made all of us the best bloody mary's.

That's when I realized that, with the television and computer off, I simply could not sleep with the sound of the snoring coming from my neighbors. And the hotel staff's response went from helpful and caring, to blunt and mercenary as I pleaded for relief over the coming days. As I said, the hotel WAS doing terrific at the start. The expensive room gave us a phenomenal view of the Puget Sound, the room amenities were good. The furnishings were exactly as promised and top-notch. The staff was cheerful - if a bit harried due to the massive convention for electronic gamers that was in town. There WAS a minor problem at the start - the room was extremely warm, and the AC setting seemed to have no impact. I called the desk at 9:45pm, and a maintenance worker popped up a few minutes later. He carried an electronic thermometer and a ladder, and confirmed the temp was in excess of 90 degrees, with the thermostat set at 68. We'd been in the room for several hours at that point. He went up the ladder, removed the vent cover and tweaked vents accessible further up in the system, then did some work on the thermostat, leaving it set at the very lowest setting. Within 90 minutes the room was a very chilly 65 according to the thermostat, but I didn't mind - I much prefer sleeping in the very cold. Still, with the sound distractions in the room turned off, the sound of snoring became embarrassingly obvious. The snoring was so loud and constant that it was like a sitcom sound effect. I ended up going to the desk at 2:30am and explaining to the woman there that, because my son HAD finally managed to fall asleep despite the very loud snoring next door, I was not demanding to move that instant. But I definitely wanted my room changed early in the start of the next business day. She assured me I'd be taken care of, and said I'd be contacted by the desk the next morning. Hearing nothing through the morning and midday, I returned to the desk that afternoon. The staff had no idea what I was talking about. There was apparently no note or information passed on by the night staff, and no notation on my room's records. But \"Good news!\" a staffer chirped. My neighbor had checked out. I wouldn't be bothered again, they said. It wasn't until midnight that I realized they had no idea WHICH neighbor was the offending snorer. I hadn't been sure, so how could they? Indeed, stalking the room post-midnight again, I wasn't even sure the clear, unmistakable sound of snoring was being heard through the walls - it may have been coming through the ventilation system vents in the ceiling. I did then - and still do - wonder if that was the source of the initial cooling problem. Perhaps the choice in this hotel is to sleep in 90 degrees plus, or with the sound of snoring. In any case, on this night the snorer was even more irritating and obnoxious, even keeping my son awake. I called the desk, explained the history, and was told there was no way to make a room change at midnight. The hotel was full for the evening. But I was assured a quiet room would be found the following afternoon, after departing guests had left. I asked the male I was talking to this time to generate a written record to this effect, and asking for the manager to contact me the following day. I'd also become less enamored with the chilly room. It was terrific at night when I wanted to sleep. But to have the room at 65 degrees during the day was simply not practical. This was in SEATTLE, and we actually shed sweaters and jackets, and changed into shorts, to GO OUTSIDE. Still, the thermostat - subsequently set for 72 degrees, and then 75 - had no obvious affect on the temperature since it had been \"adjusted\" to avoid 90+ degrees. By the following afternoon I'd heard nothing from hotel staff, and I was told at the desk that the manager was presently unavailable. When I told the clerk that I'd be looking for a room elsewhere, he wryly offered me \"Good luck with that.\" Over the following hours I learned the source of his certainty. Because of the previously mentioned convention - PAX 2011 for electronic gaming fans - there simply was not a room available in the downtown Seattle area. Yes, we could have come up with a single bed for my son and I, or a lovely suite of rooms costing each night slightly more than I'd committed to for 4 days at the pricey Red Lion on 5th, but thanks to the convention there was certainly nothing comparable, and nothing with two beds in one room, no matter the quality or price. I'd taken to getting to sleep by taking a sleeping pill, then lying awake beneath pillows to the sound of neighbors snorting until I finally passed out. My son was taking a \"nighttime\" pain reliever that, when combined with his i-pod earbuds, and keeping his head under pillows, he found sufficient to put him to sleep despite the noise. On Saturday, the last full day of my stay, I again returned to the desk. As there was apparently no one who had any knowledge of my complaints and contacts and the promises of a move over the previous days, I went through the litany yet again. A woman who I believed to be the manager - but who did not introduce herself (she simply appeared when I asked to speak to the manager) reviewed my booking. I asked for some sort of significant adjustment to my bill, and for the long-promised room change. Reviewing the computer, she apologized for the noise and the thermostat problem - confirming with me that they HAD immediately addressed that problem and \"fixed\" it. When I agreed, but went on, she said, \"But we did listen, and the room is no longer too hot. Correct?\" She then noted that I had another day remaining on my reservation, and that I had passed the deadline for cancellation. She said they had no other rooms with two beds that were available. She told me that \"What we can do for you\" is to allow me to check out immediately and waive the penalty of the night's billing. When I told her we were both aware that there were no similar rooms available in any hotel at any level of quality in the downtown area, she said, \"I've told you what we can do for you.\" DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE ANNOYANCE OF TRYING TO SLEEP DESPITE THE SOUND OF NEIGHBORS SNORING. And do not assume that one just has to be unlucky enough to land a room next to a snorer. I strongly suspect this hotel has a defect as the result of its recent and much-touted update - noise from rooms that are NOT immediate neighbors may be flowing to other rooms through the ventilation system, and quite clearly at that. So I further suspect that the choice really is between closing off the internal vents in the duct work - thus having no heating/AC system, and trying to sleep with whatever noise others in the hotel might be making down the hall. And, finally, keep my experience with the staff in mind if you have any problems with this hotel. I want to add a positive word about an establishment in the \"basement\" of this hotel - The \"Elephant & Castle\" pub. I had three meals at tE&C, and the service was excellent each time. But on the 4th occasion, everything fell apart, and in this instance the management not only demonstrated great customer service, they did such a good job of it they had me laughing about the screw-ups. I went to order a dinner on my final night, and did so through the bartender. Then I sat down to read until my take-out was ready to take to my room. (I was eating very late, long after the hotel's restaurant and room service had shut down.) A manager and then another staffer stopped by to ask me about the difficulty of reading in the noisy bar, and we traded some comments and jokes. I'd been so involved with reading that considerable time passed - nearly an hour, and when I next saw the manager I asked if he could check on my order. He was puzzled, and seemed surprised to learn I'd made an order. Now I better understood his earlier questions - he thought I'd just come downstairs to read in the noisy bar (perhaps he'd heard about the noisy rooms upstairs???). It was quickly determined the bartender had simply forgotten to enter my order - this despite my excessive tips on previous visits. The manager offered profuse apologies and promised to rush the order right out. I asked him to make sure I also had some extra condiments I'd asked for. At long last a waitress brought the bag with my order, and I was leaving to pay the manager asked if I was satisfied with the extra condiments he'd put in the order. I told him I was sure it was fine, but he wanted to check to be sure. When he opened the bag to look, he instantly said, \"This isn't your order.\" Moments later he returned with the correct order, apologized again, and then told me he'd given me a reduced price as an apology for the absurd delay. It wasn't until the receipt was returned that I learned that he'd charged me only half price. He was more concerned about expressing his relief that he'd double-checked the order before I'd left with the wrong one. Unlike the folks upstairs, this manager took a problem and turned it into a positive experience. I'll return to the Elephant & Castle, but NOT to the Red Lion on 5th. And I WILL continue to seek redress through my credit card company for the lousy service, broken promises and rude treatment.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire", "Title": "\u201cGood location for all the sights\u201d", "Author": "dhtlancashire", "ReviewID": "UR117561469", "Content": "We had a very good short stay before going on a cruise.

The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. It is a perfect location. When we left the next day the bellman was supposed to dispatch a taxi for us. Didn't happen. After 20 minutes another bellman took over and the taxi was dispatched.

There was an interesting pancake machine, sausage links, bacon, homestyle potatoes, two kinds of scrambled eggs, a few breads and cereals and juice.

Refrigerator in room was great to keep leftovers in. The iPod docking station was great...we streamed Pandora with free Wi-Fi, so we had just the music we wanted.

The bathroom was nice with good lighting but the water from the shower head only sprayed out from the outter perimeter and not the center so rinsing the shampoo out of my hair was a bit of a challenge. The bathroom door has a large frosted glass panel so you can see the person inside sitting on the toilet or wiping themselves off out of the shower.

The business center is across a breezeway, then downstairs which could be uncomfortable for a woman alone. There were four of five computers which are free for printing airline tickets. For the internet, the first few minutes were free then your CC is charged. Don't recall how much since we didn't use it. The front desk staff were nice but the concierge, yikes! The first day I noticed the concierge just sitting at the desk staring out the door looking totally bored. In fact he looked as if he was about to fall asleep. When I asked him about a particular store, he simply said it had closed years ago, no smile. No suggestions of other places I might be intrested in, no giving of a map or anything. The next day there was a different guy but he looked equally bored. They really need to have these guys actually doing something so they at least looked busy or better yet, they need better people for the job. There is a restaurant downstairs which serves a buffet breakfast, STAY AWAY! Ugh, for $12.95 it was awful. The pancakes were freshly made via a machine which was okay but don't expect fluffy pancakes as those were flat. The scrambled eggs were not good so I didn't finish them. The fruits were floating in water so I didn't bother with them but my mother said they were tasteless. The other selections were bacon, sausage, muffins, cereal, for the money this so called buffet was not worth it. The juices were too sweet even my teenager commented on it.

By the way, you have to ask for vouchers at the front desk for the breakfast -- you cant just pay at the restaurant should you decide to go. The cable programming for the TV was NOT family-friendly. There were about 10 sports channels but the only family channels were Cartoon network (and that is NOT often for children) or ABC Family. Would have liked a Disney channel or Nick channel.

When we arrived at the rooms they were next to each other without an inside adjoining door. I called down to reception and was informed that they had no adjoining rooms in the hotel, and when they said \"adjoining\" they just meant \"next to.\" Seriously? They did not clarify this at any time, though several calls and front-desk chats, and we would not have waited almost two hours for rooms without an inside door. The accommodations themselves had old, noisy climate controls and nice flat-screen TVs with no DVD player or pay movies, though they did have an iPod docking station. The cable channels on the TV were grainy. The bathrooms were clean and the towels plentiful. Since it was the holidays, they had cookies and warm cider in the lobby, but not all evening.

Check-in was very competent and pleasant; I had sent myself a package and was notified immediately upon check-in that it was waiting for me. Our 11th floor room was roomy and comfortable enough, with two queen beds and a view of Puget Sound and, when the clouds lifted, Bainbridge Island in full Fall glory beyond. Lighting was notably insufficient. On the other hand, the wi-fi is free and dependable. The beds were comfortable, but the sheets had major issues: (see photo) and threatened every night to come unmoored. The pillows were too high and firm. Once we figured out the apparently uncalibrated thermostat had to be set at about 80o, the room temperature was comfortable. The closet door is on an inconvenient auto-closer but the hangers are real wood, on real hooks, thank you very much. There are also two big fluffy robes in that closet. In the room are: a hair dryer, the usual coffee maker and packets of icky coffee (who needs that in Seattle!), iron and board, fancy clock radio, a big flat-screen TV (with 46 channels listed but only about 25 available, of which about six were sports, and a couple in Spanish). There is also a very convenient dorm-sized fridge for cooling your own food and drinks, but no mini-bar. We found it to be essentially a quiet hotel, except for some periodic mysterious mechanical rumblings like little gremlins bowling in the ventilation system. The bathroom has the same hang-tags as everyplace these days: if you are willing to re-use your towels, hang them up on a rack, blah-blah. Indeed, the housekeepers did not take away our towels (but helpfully, did leave us fresh ones), which we were happy to use for a couple of days, but there is nothing resembling a functional towel rack in the bathroom, in favor, alas, of trendy d\u00c3\u00a9cor and uninteresting art. This is my plea to all hotels: skip the art, please give us enough feet of towel rack so we can hang \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem up to dry!! Hot water was quickly forthcoming and pressure was adequate. The vanity is pretty granite, but the lighting could have been better. We used the parking garage under the hotel. The rate is $30 (plus tax) with in-out privileges. Take a look at your charges before checkout. We were billed for all five nights we stayed in the hotel even though we used only two garage nights. The front desk readily made the correction, commenting that the garage is run by a concessionaire and that they often make such mistakes. Oddly, the Red Lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-service Terrace Garden restaurant on the fifth floor was not listed in the guest directory in our room. My one meal there, breakfast, was enjoyable (though not especially cheap), the service quick, and the coffee good. However, beware the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grapefruit juice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was watery and sweetened, i.e., grapefruit drink. I told waitress I was disappointed, and all she said was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ocean Spray something-or-other\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (really!) instead of apologizing. It would have been more appropriate to take it off my bill, but not worth making an issue of. Speaking of food, a great alternative for breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner, is Specialty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, bakery/deli/sandwich/coffee shop across the street, on the corner of Fifth and Union. They offer very good sandwiches made to order on excellent bread (try the turkey and cranberry on herb bread!), all kinds of muffins and cookies, soups, and the like, eat-in or take-out, very reasonably priced. On the suggestion of the front desk clerk, we made our way to Gambas, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Japanese-French\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant, for first rate sushi one evening. On another evening we went down to the Waterfront and had an amazing clam bake at Ivar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Both these eateries are seafood *heaven* Of course at Pike Place Market there are dozens of places to eat anything your heart, or stomach, might desire.

The hotel staff blew us all away, always eager to help and accommodating with whatever questions or concerns we had. One in particular, Alex (who works the front desk), went above and beyond with how engaging and friendly he was. When we asked if the hotel supplied DVD players, he went the extra mile and brought in his own DVD player from home for us to use! When deciding that we were going to stay again next year for the event, they gave us tours of the suites and the bigger rooms and helped us build a plan as to what kind of connecting rooms we could get and what the cost differences would be. Talking to both the active manager one of the days, and the general manager the next day, we had nothing but compliments for the hotel. You could tell she was proud of her hotel, and her staff, and she had every right to be. There isn't a person I wouldn't recommend this hotel to. She (I believe her name was Shannon Sharon) was extremely friendly and gave us all of her contact information for planning in the future. The only very very petty grumbles I had, were that the elevators move so fast, that your ears actually pop, which took afew days to get used to, and that the bathroom doors were kind of an opaque glass pattiern that wasn't very hard to see through, right in front of the toilet, which was very unnerving staying in a room with two males. I look forward to next year when I can plan going back to the Red Lion again, it was definitely worth it!", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida Keys, USA", "Title": "\u201cReview - notes on their pub\u201d", "Author": "4nRelations_Inexpert", "ReviewID": "UR40485555", "Content": "Regarding The Red Lion's Elephant and Castle Pub.

We later found out it's a pet friendly hotel so beware! :( During the day didn't really matter since we weren't there but when we got back at 10:30 and the dog was STILL barking. We called the front desk THREE times and they said they would call the owners and have the dog removed. Finally, the owners returned around 12:30 but I was very upset that the hotel didn't offer to move us (we finally asked to move on our third call to the front desk) or didn't really try to rectify the situaion, no apology, no nothing. Aside from the dog issue, the hotel is newly renovated and quite clean. The room we had was very small. It's pretty bare bones in terms of toiletries provided - you have to ask for lotion (soap, shampoo and conditioner are provided). There was no full length mirror (important if you are shopping!), I asked at the front desk and they didn't have one which I was thought was odd. I'm pretty sure there was free high speed internet in the room which is a very nice touch. We come to Seattle fairly frequently and this is the first time we've had an issue at a hotel downtown.

Other things were the dirty exterior windows with bird poop streaking down them. Also, the toilet was difficult to flush and the handle had to be held down hard for a long time to flush. Also, the room was poorly lit, with at least 2 lights not working and not able to be fixed, since it was due, according to the maintenance man, to a faulty wiring job when the hotel was remodeled. So, we had a hard time reading in the evening, and it was depressingly dim. On the first day, two of the four elevators were not working, so there were long lines at the elevators. I spent over twelve hundred dollars for the 5 nights, and when I checked out, when asked how I liked my stay, I told the receptionist I would never again go to a Red Lion Hotel, and it was worth only $100 a night.

Downtown Seattle is fairly compact, and is well-serviced by (free) bus routes on most of its avenues and many of its streets. The hotel is within walking distance of many sites and nice restaurants. (My wife and I discovered the cafe at Macy's, about a five minute walk, was excellent for breakfast or lunch, with tasty and reasonably-priced sandwiches and soup, and quick and efficient service. The service at the Red Lion was excellent, especially the front desk, which went above and beyond the call of duty when I had problems printing out boarding passes for our return flight home. The room, for which we paid a small extra amount, was on a high floor with a delightful view of Elliott Bay and the arriving and departing Washington State Ferries. The king bed had excellent linens, a decent-sized work desk, and an easy chair. It also had a small fridge and a coffee maker. The bathroom was a tad small, but one usually doesn't live in the bathroom. The shower was adequate in terms of hot water and water pressure. The only negative about the room was the table lamps on the nightstans, which could use higher capacity light bulbs. I didn't bring my laptop, but I believe that wireless access has a daily charge. The hotel is a five minute walk from the Sheraton Hotel, where one can get on or off the airporter bus. The latter is $18 for a roundtrip, and if you have a little extra time is well worth the savings over an airport taxi if you have a party of two or fewer. (The bus will take you about 45\" to/from the airport, about 15-20\" more than a taxi; the bus runs every half hour.) As leisure activity we would certainly recommend the Museum of Art, but would suggest you skip the Olympic Garden, which was underwhelming at best. The Happy Hour at The Brooklyn Restaurant was excellent - good and inexpensive drinks and food, good service, and a happy, noisy but not raucus atmosphere. (Based upon the Happy Hour food I would think the restaurant, which is of the fine dining class, would be an excellent choice for either seafood or beef.)

I worked for two solid days in the hotel. Generally the stay was better than expected, given some of the reviews on Tripadvisor. Pluses 1. Rooms were pretty clean, lots of space, and had appropriate amenities. 2. I was in the room when housekeeping came each day and they did a good job cleaning quickly and quietly (I was on the phone most of the time). 3. Hot breakfast buffet was included each day, although choices were relatively limited. We opted not to have breakfast the second day. 4. Room service for lunch was fast and hot. Menu has some good choices. 5. Customer service was generally courteous and friendly. 6. Fantastic location downtown, just a few blocks from Pike Place and one block from Westlake. Lots of great restaurants and shopping around here. Minuses 1. We had problems with outbound calls. First night we tried one phone and had to have the front desk \"release\" the line for outbound calls. Second day I tried another phone and had to call again to get it released. This one never worked, so I usedmy cell phone the entire time I was here. 2. The room is not really set up for working. No speaker phone or mute capability. 3. TV didn't work one morning; all the channels were snow. 4. Pay movies didn't work; got a message that the movie had to be ordered at the front desk. Called to ask them to order it and they said they'd take care of it. Movie never started. 5. Water pressure and heat are acceptable but lower than we'd like. 6. We were two doors down from the elevator, so we could hear people noise when they were waiting outside. Fortunately not too much noise from neighbors (although the headboards rattle anytime you move on the bed). 7. Within a few blocks of the hotel you can find a lot of vagrants and other people at loose ends. When we had dinner last night just a couple blocks away, two bike cops were frisking and interrogating two young men right against the window where our table was situated. 8.

Beyond the walls made of balsa wood, the hotel has a bit of a dated feel. Colors are the typical golds, ruby, and forest greens. The polyester bed spread seemed cheesy, the bath towels seemed too thin, and the bathroom fixtures themselves were quite poor. My bathtub filled with water when I showered and drained very slowly. The toilet took 3-4 flushes to get everything taken care of ... oddly enough, since it made quite a stir with its mighty sucking action ... which seemed to do little.

There are treadmills, elliptical trainers, free weights, and a few machines. Towels and water are provided there. My only issue here was that it was very stuffy in the room. They need some fans in there. The hotel also provides guests with the option to purchase a pass to a full service health club nearby for a nominal fee.

The restaurant was the most disappointing experience. During happy hour we ordered a couple drinks, and was served a cosmopolitan in a chipped, leaking glass. The server didn't notice it and quickly left as he set the drinks down. We had to go search for him to let him know about the broken glass. The service was very slow and there was no reason for it either. Nobody was dining in the restaurant and there were 3 waiters who were handling about 8 tables. On our second adventure to the restaurant/bar, we were acnowledged when entering but were completely ignored when we were seated. After 5 minutes, we got up and left and went outside the hotel for our dinner. Housekeeping did a good job for the most part. However, we didn't receive any service on our last night and I had to contact the front desk. They sent somebody who did a haphazard job of restocking the towels and soap amenities, but didn't clean the room in the same style that we had experienced the previous three nights. Hotel has a convenient location in downtown Seattle and is just steps away from world class shopping and dining.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somewhere Fun", "Title": "\u201cGreat View and Great Shopping Location\u201d", "Author": "wheresdabeach", "ReviewID": "UR8004252", "Content": "We had a room higher in the tower facing the water and boy did we have an amazing view of the city and Puget Sound.

Located on Fifth Avenue (who knew?) between Pike and Union, this properties biggest benefit is it's location. Only 5 blocks from Pike's Market, and surrounded by shopping and places to eat. Oh, and if you like coffee, be careful, there are only approximately 3 coffee shops per square inch, so you may have to stock up between footsteps. The room was on the small side, but not unexpected of hotels in big cities, where room count is a question of economics. The other bad part of the room is that it had thin walls. The wireless internet access was free and decent, but had sporradic issues at times. Parking in the underground lot is $25.00 per day (plus a couple bucks in taxes), and you are free to come and go as you please. Just make sure the front desk is aware that you will be using the parking garage so they can get you the proper tags. If you book through an airline that you print your own boarding pass, be advised the business center charges $4.95 for 15 minutes, and $.49 per page to print. (I think it was $1.49 for color). The pillows were understuffed down pillows, something I'm not a big fan of, but even my wife thought they were too soft. The bed was medium firm. The room had adequate heating (we didn't try the A/C, it was cold enough as it was). The blackout curtains did a pretty good job. Water pressure and flow was pretty good. We didn't note any draining or filling problems. The Terrace restaurant was closed for remodeling while we were there, so I can't comment on it's quality. There is an English styled pub called the Elephant & Castle that is attached that was good quality. (Though they were lacking in a good selection of English brews at the time) All in all, it was a pretty good hotel at the price we paid ($80.00/per night, plus fees/taxes). I was really satisfied with the hotel at the price, but the normal price seems to be around $180/night, which I would have been furious at, as the value was nowhere near $180/night, especially when you have to add parking.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "hi", "Title": "\u201cNice room but beware of phony telephone charge!\u201d", "Author": "hdt", "ReviewID": "UR6570512", "Content": "I stayed here on business trip for several days.

When I told the front desk staff (multiple times, because it never got fixed), each staff member told me a slightly different story about how to access it. They all guaranteed me their way would work, but it never did. Eventually, a manager told me to call tech support to report a problem with their wireless coverage. Why it was my responsibility to report their problem, I don't know, but I just didn't have the time to call. Tip: go to the Juan Valdez coffee shop right next to the hotel if you need to get online. Access is free, and the environment is nice. 2. Upon checkout, the front desk did not split up the bill the way my roommate and I asked to have it split up. They split it up their own way without asking us how to do it, and then told us they couldn't change it because it was already done. To make a long story short, my roommate ended up spending about $150 more than me (even though we wanted the bill split up evenly), and she will not be able to get reimbursed by her employer for that extra amount. 3. The shower drain was very slow. Minor compared to #1 and #2, but I just don't like wading in a pool of dirty water while I'm trying to clean up. 4.
