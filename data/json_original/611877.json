The location itself is certainly great, and the hotel is only a five-minute walk from the nearest U-bahn station and less than a mile from the Charlottenburg castle and its estate. BUT: Otto-Suhr- Allee happens to be one of Berlin's busiest avenues with incessant heavy traffic and horrible street noise. Consider yourself lucky if the room you're given does not overlook the avenue, because most rooms do. Stayed for three nights in August '09 when the outdoor temperature rose above +30C. The room windows had to be kept open at night because the hotel is NOT air-conditioned, like many hotels in Berlin. The noise from police cars and revving motorbikes was unbearable!!!! Changing my room for a quieter one giving on their courtyard was impossible since the hotel was booked full because of the Marathon. The amenities are simple and basic, but the shower rooms might seem a tad cramped. The breakfast is OK.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cOK, but probably not again...\u201d", "Author": "mrrfrost", "ReviewID": "UR5882167", "Content": "Booked this hotel for a group on Berlin Marathon weekend and due to lack of availability elsewhere! Location: About 5 mins walk to Richard Wagner-Platz or a little further to Deutsch Oper this hotel is just outside the centre and just a couple of stops or short bus ride (bus stops outside the hotel) from Zoo. So a shortish ride to the main attractions. The hotel is a grey concrete block - not appealing on the outside and is on a failry main road so the rooms on the front can be a bit noisy but I was tired... Rooms: Reasonable size - all rooms seem to be of 2 single beds. Clean enough but the shower curtains didn't fit so the bathroom floor got soaked and there wasn't any soap/shampoo provided, just a hand wash. Staff: Most were helpful and spoke reasonable English Food: Breakfast was fine, a range of cereal, breas, chesses hams, fruits etc. But there are no signs anywhere that there is a charge for breakfast and we weren't told, it was just added onto the bill at check-out whether we had breakfast or not and had to go through each person and delete the costs! It costs 8 euros per person per day but there is a cafe next door which probably does breakfast for cheaper.", "Date": "September 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cWhat a dump\u201d", "Author": "TraderJoe911", "ReviewID": "UR5771058", "Content": "I stayed at the Arktur for a couple of nights in early September. Because of the IFA-Show at the same time they charged a much higher price than they normally would. The room I stayed in was on the first floor. It was quite large - that was the good part. The negatives: The hotel is at a busy road and it was terribly loud in the room. The carpet was dirty, the bathroom so small that you couldn't move. The TV is the smallest I have ever seen, so even though you get 200+ satellite channels you can't see much. The towells were thin and old, the hotel generally looked worn and cheap. Overall it was my worst hotel-experience in years.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Arktur City Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d611877-Reviews-Arktur_City_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$53 - $130*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Otto-Suhr-Allee 74</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10585</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "611877", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/76/26/76263414c7fed8d5354f4f42d41743946large.jpg"}}
