Our first impression was a positive one, when we checked in with Anna, who was very friendly and helpful. When we arrived at the room we were assigned, it was a huge letdown. Room 111 sits at the corner of two buildings, with absolutely no light making it into the room and a location right next to a storage room that the maids use. The rooms were very dated and very cramped for 4 people. The vanity is outside the bathroom which is nice, but the lighting is poor and the ventilation leaves much to be desired. It was difficult to keep the room at a pleasant temperature due to the humidity which seemed to be in large part due to poor ventilation in the bathroom. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the internet service was great. The pool and pool area was beautiful, with lots of colorful flowers and palms. Everything is kept immaculately clean. There was a laundry facility near the pool which we did use, and everything worked well (though the PacMan machine ate some of my coins!) The breakfast was great, and again, a lot of attention was paid to keeping the room stocked and clean. There was one front desk worker who was there in the late afternoons who was not particularly pleasant, but our interactions with her were limited enough to not have to bring it to the attention of anyone else. The location is great and central to so many things, though it does require some creative driving skills at times to get into and out of the hotel itself.

Since we were right next to the street, there was some road noise even with the doors and windows shut, but it wasn\u2019t loud enough to bother either of us. Since many rooms are located well off the street, if this sort of noise bothers you, you could ask for a different room when you book your stay. The room was very clean. Beds are fairly comfortable \u2013 just a tad bit hard for my personal taste. Breakfast included cold cereals, pastries, bagels, hard-boiled eggs, canned fruit, orange juice, and do-it-yourself waffles \u2013 in short, nothing fancy, but good enough to start the day.

The breakfast was basic with toast, muffins, eggs, jam, some cheese spread, orange juice, some (canned?) fruits, coffee and tea. But the self-baked waffles were great!

Location - yes its abit out on a limb but not as bad as some make out. There is an ample car park and the site looks and feals secure. There is a five minute walk to the Tram/Bus/Coaster station and yes you have to cross a busy road but there are traffic lights! San Diego Old Town is a few minutes past the station and has many shops/ eateries. A 24 hour pass on the tram is $5 so you are easily able to get almost anywhere in San Diego at a minimal cost. As for the hotel and its staff - you cannot fault it. Spotlessly clean and everything you would expect from a hotel of this size. The Breakfast was great too. Many people have raised an issue over noise - yes there is a freeway nearby as well as the train but it was not noticable in the room. The airport is also close by and whilst we didn't notice it on the first day it was noticable on the second - probably something to do with wind direction.

The hotel also has DVD players in the rooms, and you can freely borrow from a large selection of DVD's in the hotel lobby. Our kids also enjoyed the pool, which is large and a nice temperature.

I cannot give the Inn a five rating because of where it sits. It is in an industrial area and that might turn some people off. However it is close to many major San Diego attractions and is a 5 minute walk from the transit center. Be sure to map out where you are going.

I really wanted to rate it higher, as the staff and management seem to try hard to make it right, but some of the minus keep bugging me. Here are the pluses. - First, the hotel has some of the best rates for its location. Few properties that I researched would sell rooms for its rate (about $130 for a 2 Queen deluxe suites, less if you are AAA member) that is so close to most of San Diego's major attractions. The rate includes parking, internet (well, limited) and breakfast - a continental breakfast with packed pastries/bagels, waffle machine, and boiled eggs. Breakfast is pretty decent. Items were constantly refilled, and we found no issues finding a place to sit (hotel was fairly full during our stay, judging from the occupance of the parking lot). With respect to rates, if you are an AAA member, make sure you mention that during your reservation. It is likely that the whoever is handling your reservation will ask if you are an AAA member (a plus, a hotel that offers a discounted rate on the phone). Also, the AAA rate is not mentioned in the hotel website, and the published rates do not reflect the 10% AAA discount. According the the front desk agent, what you should do is to make a note that you are a AAA member in the comments field of your online reservation. Or call in person, they are quite friendly. - The rooms are quite clean and comfortable. Well appointed and functional. I would say they tend to be on the smaller side (the deluxe 2 Queen, I mean) but it worked for our family of four. The vanity area is separated from the bathroom which is a plus. AC is an under-window unit, a bit noisy, but it works pretty well. The room had also a tv and a dvd unit, where you can check movies at the front desk. - The hotel is nicely landscaped, and the pool area, although small, is pretty nice. Another plus is the lobby, where you can help yourself with coffee and water the whole day. It also has a computer and a printer station. It is actually a nice area to hang around, and there were even some board games that you can check and play (chess, scrabble), which is what actually excited my 8-year boy quite a bit. - I believe that the best feature of this property is the location. It is actually close to everything that matters in San Diego. It is walking distance to Old Town San Diego. It is less than 10 minute drive from SeaWorld - and you don't need to hope into the freeway to get to SeaWorld, which is a plus to save some rush hour traffic. The same holds for downtown, Gaslamp quarter, marina, and Balboa park. It was a 10 minutes drive to the beaches and 20 minutes drive to La Jolla. Actually, location is one of the major reason we chose to stay at the Old Town Inn, since its proximity to SeaWorld allowed us to leave the park late afternoon so our kids could have a brief nap and we could enjoy some dinner outside the park, before heading back to watch the night shows, which we found was well worth it. Also within the location topic, there are plenty of dining options right near the property (we had thai in a mall nearby), although I think it would a bit too far to simply walk. - I should also note that the staff works pretty hard to make it right. They are quite friendly. I wasn't aware of the AAA discount until the second day of our stay. When I mentioned that, the front desk agent automatically gave us discount for the remaining nights - I didn't even need to ask (bring your AAA card, though). The morning helper was also very friendly in giving us information and directions. Now some minuses - The first, I would like to say that the Old Town Inn is basically an old motel that has received a nice face lift, furnishings, and landscapting to look it nice. It is successfully most of time. However, there are times that you are reminded that this is an old motel under the facade, for example, when you hear the sound of the pumbling in action early in the morning, and you know nobody is using the bathroom. We were on the first floor, so perhaps this factor is magnified. Nevertheless, it does highlight that this is an older property. - The property is quite small (which is good and bad), and so is their parking lot. To be fair, we haven't had any parking issue, even arriving late, and the hotel was fairly full. But it does give that feeling of being crowded, not to mention the need to do some maneuvering to fit into some spaces. - The location is great, but the immediate surrounding area is kinda iffy. I did not feel unsafe in the area (it is just desert, with an industrial feeling, and only runs for a block or two) but I would not stroll around outside the motel after dinner. Still, it is perfectly safe to walk during the day, as a lot of people do. - In room internet is free, but ... Well, it seems that the hotel does not have a large bandwidth, and if you do try to download something, the server will block your mac address permanently. I don't if that is what happened to us, but I was not able to access the internet after my wife used the computer, and she said the only thing she was looking was CNN. Maybe we were blocked for some accidental news streaming, I don't know. It was a bit of an annoyance, although I was able to remedy by using the lobby computer. At the end, the free perk was not actually free. - Finally, my biggest quibble is with the noise. From our room, we had an unobstructed view of an elevated portion of a freeway and, hence, the noise had an unobstructed path to our room. The noise actually arrived in the form of \"white noise\", but very audible. Again, it may be that our room magnified the conditions (rooms facing other directions may not be in the direct path of the noise). I also believe that the gaps between the door and the door frame (which were relatively wide) may have to do with it (sounds seem to flowing through these gaps), meaning that it may be possible to ameliorate the situation by narrowing those gaps. There were also other noises adding to the symphony, including airplanes and the aforementioned toilet flush from the upstairs neighbors. In all fairness, I should mention that I only noticed these sounds early in the morning - evenings were quite ok. Also, wife had less issues with noise - and she is the light sleeper. Also, to be clear, these issues were not deal breakers, otherwise I would not have given a 4 star rating. However, they were reminders that this actually an old motel underneath the nice facade. I thought that overall the hotel provides an excellent (probably the best) value for your money, considering its ammenities and location. It has a friendly, accommodating staff that works really hard to make it right. However, it does have issues, like noise and crowding, that keep reminding me of its old motel facet. As I said, my sentiments for its rating swings from 3.0 to 4.5, averaging 3.75, so that's why I finally decided to rate it at 4.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cI never knew it was there!

There was also juice and milk, cereal, donuts, coffee, bagels and cream cheese and danishes and fruit salad. For being a free breakfast I was pleasantly surprised at how much was offered. I also liked that we didn't have to pay for parking. This, the price of the hotel and the free breakfast and being near Old Town is what sold me. Granted the area isn't the best since it seems to be right in the middle of an industrial area but I didn't have any problems with seeing homeless people or street walkers loitering around the area like some of the other reviewers said.

We did not have a rental car, so were reliant on public transport, but if you have a car, there is free parking. When we checked in (at 10 AM!) the front desk people gave us lots of information on the area, including a guide to getting around by public transport, with tips on how to get to local attractions, grocery store, beaches and more. Very helpful! The closest grocery store is just a couple of bus stops away. There are also tons of other stores (Target and such) as well as a lot of fast food in that area.

We also enjoyed the ability to check out DVDs- a great end to our busy days in San Diego. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious- heavy on the carbs, but still good. Coffee, tea, and water are available all day in the lobby as well. If you need to do laundry, there are a couple of coin-operated machines near the lobby.

The check-in process was a breeze. They have free parking. The hotel room was probably one of the cleanest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in - absolutely spotless. And they paid attention to so many details - it was really well set up and the housekeeping staff puts a personal touch to the place. I was very impressed. The location is good. It's within walking distance of Old Town and right across the street from the bus station and the trolley station, so if you don't have a car or you didn't want to drive, transportation is at your fingertips (well, if your fingertips reached across the street, it would be). Only two things that I wish had been different. The trolley only runs until about midnight (on the weekends), so if you want to go out to the Gas Lamp Quarter and stay out late, you'll have to take a cab back, but it's not far, so this probably wouldn't be expensive. And the breakfast isn't anything special. They do have wheat bread, which I appreciated, and orange juice, but everything else was what you would typically find at a Days Inn / Comfort Inn type breakfast. The price is very reasonable and, overall, I had a great stay. I even got to sit out at the pool for about 30 minutes and soak up some sun (it's not a big pool, but it's cute and well placed).

We saw the BBQ grill in the corner and thought it was nice to have available, but unfortunately we ate out all the time since the hotel was conveniently close to the historical part of old town. Anna helped us out at checkin and pointed out on the map how there was a pedestrian tunnel underneath the railway station that would get us quickly to that part of old town. Taking note of the time on my watch it took no more than 5 minutes to get there. Our main reason for being in San Diego was to also go to Seaworld which was about a 10 minute surface street drive from the hotel. Back at the hotel we enjoyed the extras they provided such as a bookcase selection of DVDs guests can borrow along with a variety of board games and books which guests can enjoy in the lobby where there were couches to relax in or take back to their rooms. It was also convenient that they had a guest computer in the lobby, but we used the free wi-fi from the room and had no problems. Also it was nice that in the lobby they always had coffee and ice cold lemon water available. Then of course in the morning there was the continental breakfast in the dining room next to the lobby. Nice to have your own freshly cooked waffles in the morning with their good coffee. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was very neat and with the granite counters for the two sinks added a nice touch. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in as I slept all night without the tossing and turning I usually experience at other hotels. The room was well maintained, but the only negative for any of this review was the fact that there was the smell of cigarette smoke every time we entered the room (although the sign on the door as with all their rooms show 'non-smoking'). As much as I prefer to conserve electricity I found that having the AC on helped keep the smoke smell away. I was told that all the rooms are undergoing some improvements and changing them to all be non-smoking so perhaps they hadn't completely gotten to the room we stayed in on the 3rd floor across from the lobby.

One is that there is no restaurant or bar on site. Another is that there are no tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, groceries/drugstores in walking distance. You can't get into Old Town itself (despite the name) because you have to cross a 4 lane highway.. However, the location is very central for reaching San Diego's main attractions by car (Zoo, Midway, Botanical Gardens, Old Town, Coronado, Petco Park, Gaslight area, LaJolla etc). All within 15-20 minutes drive. The only other downside is the lack of an exercise facility although they do have a nice swimming pool. They don't have a separate \"Business Center\" room but they do have a computer and printer in an area near the front desk so that you can run off boarding passes and/or maps. Given all that, Old Town Inn would not be an ideal place for an extended stay because of its lack of certain amenities and the inability to easily walk out and get them nearby (like a restaurant or bar)..

I wouldn't say the bathroom was impecably clean, but it was in good conditions. The rest of the hotel seemed very clean too. The rooms were good and the beds confortable. The TV didn't have a good quality of image, so the hotel lost points there.

I stayed at less than half the rate of a hotel within walking distance to the SDCC and even with the SDCC parking ($10). The OTI is slightly less than 10 minute drive on surface streets to the CC and about 2 blocks to Old Town San Diego. The neighborhood looks iffy mostly because it appears to be largely industrial rather than commercial or residential \u2026 also the trash, the liquor stores, and the wandering homeless. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t stay here without a vehicle because there isn\u2019t anything besides Old Town I would want to walk to. The property however stand out all the more because of the environs \u2013 it is well kept and well lit. Plenty of parking right in front of the rooms. Access to San Diego is good since it is located right on Pacific Highway which leads straight to the harbor and downtown. The other way is the Sports Arena area where there are quite a few restaurants, shops, lumber store, etc and of course the Sports Arena. It is a little awkward getting to the motel from Pacific Highway since it is a south bound one way so if you are coming north up Pacific you probably want to turn left at Kurtz then right on Rosecrans and right again on Pacific. The airport is really close but not so close so as you are bothered by the sounds of aircraft. The motel is at the junction of the 5 and the 8 Freeways. If you\u2019re interested take a look at the management response of September 20, 2010 \u2013 gives a little bit of history and context if its authentic. My experience was overall favorable. No problems with my reservations or with check-in. You get a nice hospitality pack with your check-in materials and the staff was friendly and efficient. My room (a non-smoking queen) was tidy and did not smell of cigarettes. The TV had fewer cable channels than some other hotels with similar price range but they have a library of DVDs in the lobby you can watch for free on the DVD player in your room. My room had a small refrigerator and microwave. Also a coffee maker with coffee packets, hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. I noticed that each day one towel, the first tissue paper, and toilet paper ends were folded in some kind of origami decoration \u2013 a nice touch especially considering it must have taken somebody some extra time to fold and plait the stuff. My bed was kinda soft but not a problem. Both nights the locale had no other noises than the occasional train in the distance and a little bit of freeway rumble. The breakfast area was clean and bright. The complimentary breakfast includes waffles you make yourself, a variety of pastries, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, coffee and tea. Not exactly hearty fare but, you know, it\u2019s healthier that way. I noted that on the morning I checked out that the bagels were hard enough to knock out fillings (i.e. stale) \u2013 just a warning. Observing my fellow travelers at breakfast, I would guess they were mostly families on trips of some kind rather than business travel but you never know. This is my kind of place meaning functional and value \u2013 not the place anybody would run away to in order to \u201cpop the question,\u201d spice their marriage, or maybe ruin their marriage. I\u2019m not exactly certain I would stay here again except if I were attending another work event at the Convention Center and needed to save money and I wouldn\u2019t want to stay here without a vehicle.

I stayed in one of the deluxe rooms, and I think if you're planning to spend a lot of time in your room while you're on vacation, it's probably worth it to pay the extra to stay in the deluxe rooms over the economy rooms. I saw one of the economy rooms, and while it was perfectly nice, it just wasn't as spacious as the room I stayed in. The sink/vanity area outside the bathroom in the deluxe rooms is huge! I also had a sofa/seating area, which was the perfect spot to have our dinner of pizza and popcorn while we watched a movie. The tv also swivels, so when we decided to hop into bed, we swiveled it from facing the sofa to face the bed instead. The location is a little different, but compared to the prices of the hotels that are actually in the Old Town state park, their prices were a pretty significant savings. The road the hotel is on is kind of busy during the day, but the rooms don't face toward the street, and the landscaping and pool are so pleasant that you don't really notice the street after you've been there a little while, and the traffic really dies down at night, and you don't really hear the traffic if you're in your room, and I had no problem sleeping at all. The staff is very accomodating, and the place has quite a few nice little touches that you don't see at other hotels in their price range.

Did I mention every room has a dvd player with a large selection of dvd's in the lobby, which may be checked out free of charge?

We stayed in one of the economy rooms in the back building and paid a rate of $100/night including tax. Our room was basic but was clean and comfortable which is all we needed. Our room had no bath \u2013 only a shower. Not ideal but also not a problem. We were in a 2nd floor room close to the street and we did hear some traffic noise but it never kept us from sleeping and was not an issue. The pool area is lovely and we were happy we did find some time to enjoy it. Free parking was a plus. Staff were very friendly and helpful and discounts were available at the front desk for many San Diego attractions. We got a discount on the Old Town Trolley hop on/hop off tour and a discount on San Diego Zoo tickets. The description that this hotel is next to nothing but close to everything is pretty accurate. Although Old Town and the trolley station are actually very close \u2013 about a 5 minute walk. Mission Beach, Balboa Park, and the Gas Lamp district are no more than a 15 minute drive. Mission Beach and Gas Lamp are probably less than that. We used our rental car to go to San Diego Zoo and it took about 15 minutes. We visited Coronado and Balboa Park on a separate day when we took the Old Town Trolley tour. We also used the Trolley to visit the Gaslamp area and the Midway museum \u2013 avoided driving and parking in the downtown and harbour areas. Not sure what parking would have been like, especially given it was July 4th weekend. There was also a free continental breakfast. This was standard hotel fare \u2013 very much the same as the motel we stayed at in Santa Monica. The only difference was the addition of a make your own waffle machine. Okay but not great. We ate at the hotel the first morning but ate out every morning after that. We found a great place in Old Town called O\u2019Hungry\u2019s which served $3 hot breakfasts until 11:00 a.m. Great deal. I\u2019ve heard some people call the Old Town area a tourist trap. However, we really loved the Old Town area and were very happy we stayed here. The area does have some touristy-type stores but there are also some great restaurants and there are several historical sites/museums to explore. The area was lively and people were friendly.

After reviewing the reviews on this and another non-chain hotel (in La Jolla), we decided to branch out and try both over the long Easter weekend. We booked the first night at Old Town Inn and 2 nights in the other hotel. After spending one night in each hotel, we checked out of the second hotel (even though we had to pay for the second night there) just so we could check back in to the Old Town Inn. Everything good about this hotel has already been said, and I agree. You can definitely tell the owners and employees care for this hotel - from the clean rooms to the awesome customer service. Every time I saw one fo the OTI employees, they greeted us with a smile and some sort of kind greeting. For me, it was the little things that put this hotel WAY over the top. Each room had a small fridge AND a microwave. Although we didn't use either (because we aren't used to having them in our rooms in the chain hotels), it is now something we can keep in mind on our next trip. The breakfast is basic, but they provide the make-your-own-waffle stand, which is just a great touch. The bedding and linens show their wear, but are clean and neat. The first room we stayed in had 2 queen beds which happened to be much more comfortable than the king we got on our return - but both were miles more comfortable than the other hotel we stayed in. I have nothing but more praise for this hotel, but it will be continuing to repeat all the other good things everyone else has already said. STAY HERE when you're in town - you won't be disapopinted (and it's convenient to EVERYTHING, even though it is not in a prestigious area of town).

We stayed here last year (March 2009) and booked to stay again this year (March 2010) and the quality and service has not changed. If anything, the hotel has improved. We had an unusual traveling situation (we were flying standby from overseas) and so were not able to pinpoint a definite time for arrival/departure. Not only did Beatriz and other hotel staff members help us with rental car and taxi information, they also held our room and did not blink an eye to many last minute changes we had to make due to our standby status at the airport changing frequently. We never got an endless ring or a busy tone, a re-routing of our call to a main office somewhere out of state while making/changing reservations, and we were never put into \"hold heaven\" each phone call we made. Our calls were answered within a few rings, the staff (especially Beatriz) was courteous and understanding with our changes, and professional. They EVEN called us back to let us know our room was ready EARLY, along with suggestions of a quieter room they had off the highway side!! Wow. It is a bit older facility, but certainly not in its pride in ownership and management. The grounds are impeccable, the pool surrounded with pretty bushes and flowers, and the rooms clean, comfortable and spacious. Though not in \"hot spot\" locations other popular, familiar-named hotels tout, Old Town Inn is MORE conveniently located, in our opinion. It is an oasis in an otherwise not so \"bling bling,\" stuffy city location. When freeways and highways in downtown, airport, and Gaslamp Quarter areas get congested with traffic (often) you will wish you never parked a car (and paid a daily fee for doing so!) at a hotel other than one positioned like where the Old Town Inn is. Its Pacific Highway location is this hotel's best kept secret, especially when pressed for time to get to and from the airport and car rental pick up/drop off locations in a hurry. It also is a short walk from the lobby of the hotel to the bus/shuttle/trolley station in Old Town. The rates are remarkably affordable for such a great location. Though along the road, past the bus station, and then down under a highway tunnel, we felt safe (even at night) in walking, as a family, from our room to Old Town (great restaurants, stores, and nice town to enjoy and walk through!) We give 5 stars in all areas to this respectable, family-oriented, professionally run, and \"customer first\" attitude hotel.

However, the bed was much too soft for myself and my husband, and our backs were a bit achy in the morning.

I asked at the front desk which way to go in order to see a few things and instead of sending me into the old town right near by they sent me on the industrial road (on which I only saw storage facilities and homeless people) and up over an on ramp for cars basically. While the park I would have eventually gotten to would have been nice I'm sure, it was not worth the journey. As a side note, there is a fenced off bike path that runs along the highway that's still not great but safer than the on ramp. Also while we were there and waiting for a taxi in the lobby a man came running in saying that another guest may have been assaulted. I will give kudos to the police dept for showing up in record time but this was very unnerving for us.

I'm from Vancouver, Canada, and haven't been to many places down in the States... Luckily TripAdvisor made things a lot easier. I had to choose between this Inn and Comfort Inn which is also situated in the Old Town area. Thank goodness we chose this one. Why? We took the trolley, while our other colleagues that chose Comfort Inn had to take the bus and ended up being late for the Convention every time! We stayed here for the ACN National Convention from February 27 to March 2nd. Every staff working at the Inn was friendly. When I was calling in to check for availability three separate times, each staff member I had talked with was very polite and respectful. We arrived in San Diego early and the staff were able to keep our luggage in the Manager's office until we came back for a proper check-in. The room was basic but very clean. The two queen beds were very comfortable and the shower was great! Every day coming back from the Convention we would find our beds beautifully re-made. The concierge is open 24 hours. One night, two of my colleagues were thirsty and wanted some milk to drink at midnight... The staff in charge allowed us to get some milk from the kitchen. Breakfast was plentiful with bagels, waffle ovens, 3 or 4 types of cereal, orange juice, milk, muffins and danish buns. Commuting to the Convention Center was made relatively easy by the Trolley Line. Warning: It can get confusing at the Old Town stop! If you want to go to the Convention Center, take the Blue line (although it comes to you at the wrong direction... It's just that it's the end of the blue line, and so the trolley actually goes in reverse.), stop at America Plaza, walk across the trolley line and then Take the Orange line to Convention Center. You'll get the hang of it :)! Total commute time from Old Town to Convention (approx 15-20 minutes). I'd recommend everyone to try the Casa Guadalajara Restaurant situated in Old Town, and the Thai Ly restaurant in the heart of Gaslamp Quarters.

Change the name to Old Inn?\u201d", "Author": "jasonblu", "ReviewID": "UR25612239", "Content": "Being a fairly seasoned, and previously pleased \"Old Town Inn\" veteran, I booked a two night stay at my \"Old Faithful\" San Diego hotel, somewhat excited to show my wife and new baby that there are still great hotels that don't cost a lot. Long story short, we checked out early and stayed at the Dolphin Motel (see my review of them elsewhere). Something seems to have happened to this once wonderful gem of a hotel, or maybe I was looking at it now from a different angle, having my wife and baby there with me. I am not sure which. Notables on SHUTTLE SERVICE Easy. There is none. Take a cab - its about 15 bucks from the airport. Notables on CHECK IN We called to have a room reserved that day, and, I guess due to the bad economy, there was no problem finding vacancy. I talked to a very nice gentleman who took down my name and said there would be room waiting for us. When we got there (at midnight, mind you), there was a new clerk, and she had no idea we were coming. Now, to her credit - she said their system was doing backups, so she could not access the database. I guess they don't have a backup means to pass down from shift to shift on who is expected to arrive during their system down times. Something they should consider doing. We were told we had to wait till the system came back up. 10 - 15 minutes went by, then my wife and baby came in wondering what was the hold up. The baby started crying. Next thing I know, the clerk is flipping through the paper register finding us a vacant room. Why it took a crying baby to think up this backup method, I am not sure. Maybe for 75 bucks a night, they don't want to go TO Crazy on providing good service. I say this tongue in cheek, as the girl behind the desk clearly didn't want to be there, and was a obviously annoyed at her job. She was certainly not the cheerful lad who answered the phone 2 hours earlier. I'd have to say employee wise, they are hit and miss now. Before, I could never find an employee there that wasn't eager to help and cheerful. Notables on THE ROOM Immediately when I walked in the room, I sensed something was different. Where once there were immaculate, clean, neutral smelling rooms, I was hit with a wall of sour, musty, almost urinal smell. I sniff tested the carpet and the bedding. Though they didnt smell all that fresh, that wasn't it. It was the A/C unit. Apparently they have this policy to save electricity where they shut off the units when the residents aren't in the room. I am guessing this is what is causing mold to grow in the units? It was so bad, we had to just shut off the unit. Thankfully, it was 67 degrees outside, so, it wasnt like we were sweating in the room. The residual stink was enough to ruin the rest of the night though and we both awoke with headaches. Compounding the odor, the carpet had also been recently heavily doused with carpet powder - so the smell of the perfumes in the cleaner combined with the wet sour mold smell, made it nearly intolerable, odor wise. Note to management: stop crop dusting the old worn ditry carpets with carpet powder and just replace the dang things. They are old, dingy and creepy feeling on bare feet... DEFINITELY due for replacement. The bedding is the typical, cheapo, plastic, rough, cheezy floral print bedcovers that are not fit to use as blankets. Those always annoy me. Two words to hotel-bedding-success guys: Cot, ton. Everything else is your typical budget hotel room fare. BTW - No refer. No Microwave. No iron. Actually - its a bed, a shower, a sink, a toilet, a moldy A/C unit and not much more. Zero Frills. Wife wants me to mention though that they had \"nice new granite-ish counter tops.\" Cool Beans. Needless to say, I was no longer talking up the place to the wife. She was not impressed. Notables on their WIFI INTERNET. Summary: It's a cruel Joke. Fellah's, dont be fooled by their listing of offering high speed internet in the rooms. Its a sham. They limit the ENTIRE hotel area to 2 Mb/s (for comparison, a typical single home internet cable service provides 11Mb/s.) !! They even have this retarded system that will document your MAC address and ban you from the router for downloading \"large files\" , but don't define what that constitutes a \"large file\". \"Pretty much only enough to check your email, is it. \" said the clerk. I had an important \"large file\" (132 Mb) I needed to DL for business the next day and I was locked out in minutes, or so I thought. Upon further inspection, I realized that my wife's laptop and both our iphones had signal but couldnt log on. A router issue. Nothing to do with my \"large file\". I called the number for tech support listed by the room phone, and the silly lady on the other end didn't know her routers from ravioli. Seriously. Like a robot, she started walking me through this check-list of stuff completely unrelated to the issue at hand, laboring over what operating system I was using, blah blah, when, since 3 systems all using different OS's had no signal - The antenna's clearly just needed to be reset. I tried to cut to the chase with her, but she mentally short circuited when I suggested we just have the routers reset. Wasting time there, I had to just hung up. I called the front desk, told them the situation. They said they could reset the antenna's. Only, they never did. Or if they did, the internet never did come back up. That was a big one for me. In this day and age, one HAS to have connectivity. Managers, get with the times! Get fast wifi, make it part of the room fee, and let it fly. Its cheap and easy. Notables on the CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST It's no La Quinta, let me tell you. They DO have the waffle maker (which, now, you have to mix your own mix. They now give you the cups, the water and the powdered mix and a plastic fork to mix it with. Before, they had them all ready made out, you just sprayed the iron, poured the pre-made mix, and voila - delicious waffles) other than the waffles, they have bagles, dry cereal, instant oatmeal, milk, coffee, and watery orange juice. That's about it. I seem to remember much more selection, and even scrambled eggs and bacon and sausage when I was there last. Maybe not. In a word - thin. Miscellany For those who are patriotic - I noted a strange anomaly. They have a California Flag, a Marine Corps Flag and the Mexican Flag hanging in a row from the roof...but NO AMERICAN FLAG. (at least not there - if there is one somewhere, I didn't see it) Odd. If your going to fly flags, and your IN America, fly an American Flag. Bizarre. Are they trying to make some political statement or something by omitting the Ole Stars and Stripes? HIGH POINTS. The grounds were clean. There was enough parking. The bathroom and shower area were clean. Its conveniently located: 5 minutes drive from the Airport. 5 minute walk to Old Town. Its Cheap. They had a nice military Rate of $68 plus tax. Came to like 74 a night. Would I stay there again? Replace all the carpeting, nuke the A/C units of the sour mold, keep em on, switch to all cotton bedding, offer decent WiFi without those retarded restrictions (11Mb/s is about $60 a month FOR THE ENTIRE HOTEL guys, come on) and of course, show your loyalty to the country that lets you run a business on its soil and RAISE THE GRAND OLD FLAG - keep the $68 military rate and I would come back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Downers Grove, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "vballgirl78", "ReviewID": "UR25195234", "Content": "After reading TripAdvisor reviews I chose the Old Town Inn.

Everything inside and outside was very well maintained and fresh looking. The lobby was comfortable and welcoming and they had a huge fire going in the fireplace the whole time we were there. The breakfast room was very big, lots of light, with lots of tables that held vases of flowers so it was very cheery. Breakfast had lots of delicious food to choose from and the make your own waffles are quite a hit with everyone, expecially my 6 yr old. There were quite a mix of people, lots of families, older folks, lots of youger folks, tourists from other countries so it was quite nice. Inthe lobby they had a table set up so that you could help yourself to coffee, tea and stuff 24hrs. There was also a computer with internet access. Outside had free parking and there was always a place to park. The front desk were great. We arrived very early, before check-in time, and they held our bags for us until the room was ready so we were able to go out and enjoy ourselves and not have to cart our luggage with us in the car. They knew a lot about what to do and were very helpful with great suggestions and lots of info about the area. There was a pool that was so well disguised by gorgeous plants, shrubbery and lots of birds that you felt you were somewhere else. There was also a coin laundry room which we used and were glad to be able to do laundry as were others. The rooms themselves were excellent. We had 2 queens and the beds were so comfortable and lots of pillows and everything was clean. (Trust me, I checked under the beds!) You could walk to the Old part of town in a few minutes where there were lots of stores and excellent restaurants. From there you could also take a variety of transit to other places.

There was only 2 of us so the room size was very adequate with plenty of drawers and hanging space for clothing. We had a bathroom with a shower only. The shower was a great size and there were plenty of towels and toileteries. Also, as we were staying more than 4 nights we received an amenities pack which came in very handy. Tip about hairdryer, the bathroom light needs to be on for it to work - how daft did I feel saying hair dryer didn't work. The breakfast which is provided is great, waffles, bagels, cereals, fruit, juice and hot drinks etc. Always plenty of food and regularly replenished. The staff are excellent, nothing was a problem and their knowledge of the local area is brilliant. You can book tickets with them for the different parks and also trolley tours. We didn't use the pool area but it was cleaned regularly and looked like a good place for a wind down after a long, leisurely day around San Diego. It doesn't matter if you are driving to the hotel or flying in, the location is easy to find and not too far from airport (approx 5-10 mins taxi ride). We wanted to be near the Old Town and you only have to walk out of the hotel cross at the lights, under the subway and you are on the edge of the Old Town (5 mins).

We upgraded for an extra $10 a night and stayed in the newer section which seemed much nicer. The pool was lovely as well as the beautiful landscaping. We took the Trolley downtown (blue line) most days which is an easy walk (easy walk to old town as well) and easy to navigate. (FYI-the pamphlets recommend Old Town Mexican Cafe-not really that good and pretty expensive-seems like a tourist trap) *Breakfast was supplied everyday, got a little repetitive but was a nice money saver and kick-off to the day *Staff-Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. We bought our zoo tickets at the front desk to get a discount. Hotel room- We got a room with a big bathroom and two queens which was definitely worth the extra money when the laundry and souvenirs started piling up. Everything about the room was fine with the exception of a squeaky floor (which gave us something to laugh about) I think overall that people our age (mid twenties) might be better suited at a hotel downtown as more of our activities were focused closer to the city and not as much on other areas of San Diego (mission valley, la jolla) which the old town inn IS very central too ( it seemed as though we were the youngest guests too). Also, younger people might not find the closest neighborhood, old town, as interesting especially since there is not much going on at night(that we could see), with the exception of Harney's, a hipster sushi restaurant.

Standard continental breakfast with 2 waffle makers, bread, bagels, fruit cocktail, cereals, orange juice, coffee, tea, etc. The front counter staff was friendly and helpful. The front counter had discount tickets on sale for some of the attractions. For example, an adult zoo ticket for $30.00. They also provided complimentary toiletries such as toothpaste should you run out. The only complaints I have are the following: 1)internet access on the free computer was slow (minor detail) 2)you can't book through the internet even though they have a website. However, there is a toll free number. Once you told the staff what your requirements were, they would email you back to confirm your reservation. The response time was quick. Old Town Inn's location was central for our needs given that the transportation hub that was approximately 300 yards away (across the street and commuter parking lot). The bus and trolley system takes you to all the tourist sites - Gaslamp district, downtown, beaches, La Jolla, zoo, SeaWorld, Fashion Valley and Mission shopping malls, etc. including the border next to Tiajuana. The outlet mall Las Americas is also next to the border less than 1/2 mile from the last trolley bus stop at the border. The Old Town tourist site is on the other side of the transportation hub approximately 200 yards away. Waiting time for regular buses was usually less than 10 minutes (daytime). Trolley bus waiting time was less. HINT: Buy a day pass good for the trolley and bus. One day adult pass is $5.00, 2 day is $9.00, 3 day is $12.00 and 4 day is $15.00. You can buy the pass at any kiosk /terminal or at the convenience store at the transportation hub. Restaurants We ate at the Coyote Cafe and Old Town Mexican Cafe in Old Town. Restaurants are next to each other. Food was good. Little Italy Restaurant - Filippi's. Restaurant entrance is through the deli. (3 trolley stops from Old Town). Good food at a fair price. Always crowded. Go early or late to avoid lineups. Gaslamp District - Sloppy Joey's - pizza and pasta. Food was okay. Phil's BBQ on Sports Arena Boulevard - good food - chicken, beef and pork ribs, etc. Less than 1.5 miles from Old Town Inn Other Info: Taxi cab from cruise terminal to Old Town Inn - approx. $14.00 before tip. Cab to airport approx. the same price - $14.00 before tip Some of the Balboa Park museums had free admission on Tuesdays.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Watford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Dave12345", "ReviewID": "UR21040523", "Content": "Overall great stay here.

I arrived in San Diego with a reservation for one night only. I was anticipating having to return to the city two weeks later for two additional nights, but hadn't made any plans about where I'd stay upon returning; figuring I could figure that out once I was in California. I'd looked at lots of San Diego hotels on-line before I went west, and wasn't satisfied that I'd found something that covered all the bases for a reasonable price. One night staying at the Old Town Inn, however, convinced me of the obvious wisdom of making a reservation to return there when I came back into town. The location is a big part of its appeal: handy to the airport, walkable to the Blue Line Trolley and Historic Old Town with its restaurants and shopping, easy nearby access to I-5, I-8, Point Loma, Presidio Hill Park, Mission Beach, Sea World, downtown. The hotel's own service and amenities are also nothing to sneeze at, with charming flower-filled grounds, beautiful pool, friendly and eager-to-help staff. I needed border-crossing advice for a trolley visit to Tijuana. Done. I needed directions for getting to Cabrillo National Monument. Done. I needed an early-morning wake-up and ride to the airport. Done...and not just a taxi, but a Town Car that charged me a flat fare ($16) and was waiting for me ten minutes PRIOR to when I needed it. The rooms are smaller than a standard chain hotel-by-the-Interstate room. But both of mine were clean, comfortable and quiet, despite being adjacent to a multi-lane road.

I have previously called the hotel directly to book a room for two adults, and was given a price quote and a reservation number. Due to some miscommunication, I was booked for a room for Jun 23 and 24 instead of Jul. I was quoted around 150 bucks for 2 nights over the phone, and did not receive any other confirmation after that. When I arrived at the hotel on Jul 23, the person at the counter told me that I booked for Jun, and since I have missed my booking they had charged me 170 bucks for not showing up. Apparently, that was the price for \"one night\". They didn't have any vacancy either, and would not let me use the hotel phone to see if there are any other vacancies in the area. Instead they directed me to the pay phone outside the hotel, which ate up our 75 cents, the last of our change. I was really frustrated, since I have planned the trip that does not account for any delays such as this. We had no more change to call hotels, I was out 170 bucks, and I had no place to stay. Finally they told us that they had one room that they can let us stay in. It was 170 bucks a night, since the Comic-Con was in town. So from an average of 90/night to 170/night. Desperate for a place to stay, we took their offer. But let's just say that we were not happy campers. But to be fair, aside from that, the stay was more than pleasant. The room was nice and clean, the bed was so big that it felt impractical (you could fit 3 adults on it) and it was comfy. The breakfast was ok, with bagels, waffles, toast, stuff like that. Someone helps you make the waffles too if you don't want to do it yourself. When we checked out, I talked to the GM, Beatriz, about my 170 penalty for \"not showing up when I was supposed to\". I had booked for Jul, not Jun, but I got charged 170 bucks! I was quoted 150 then, even if they were going to charge me, why did I get charged for more? Beatriz immediately fixed that for me by putting the money back on my credit card and apologized for the mistake. And with that, I left the hotel quite satisfied with the overall service and quality of the hotel. Although I think the younger staff they hired (like the teenage front desk girl that first helped me when I checked in on Jul 23) needs some improvement, overall it was a pleasant stay.

What else should one expect? Well, the Inn gives you all of these. two more remarks: first, as to location. Granted, the Inn is not located in downtown San Diego. whn first arriving We were actually a little worried about the surroundings. But, although it's right next to a major road and the adjacent lot is occupied by a huge Marines depot of some sort, it's not a problem at all. the Inn itself is quiet and pleasent, and accross that major road, a minute's walk, is the Old Town, which is really sweet, and has a few excellent mexican restaurants, and also the Old Town transit station where you can find all the public transportation you need to get to other places in San Diego, and we had a wonderful experience with the public transport staff and the locals, who were all extremely patient and helpful.

Thankfully we went to Legoland before we checked in at the Oldtown inn. Once we arrived the gentlemen who checked us in was very nice and helpful in directing us to a place to eat.

He pulled the sheets back and there crawling on the pillow was a bedbug. I ran and woke my daughters put them in the bathroom immediately and went straight downstairs to notify an employee, this was at 1:00 in the morning. The employee followed me up to the room and as we entered my husband was catching the fourth bug, this one crawling across the bed my daughters just moments before were sleeping in.

(A car really is needed to see Wild Animal Park, Sea World, and even the Zoo--although we got to the Zoo/Balboa Park by bus without too much trouble.) Old Town itself (5 minute walk) is interesting and fun at night--great places to eat.

We spent a few days at Disneyland, then rented a car, making our way south. The Old Town Inn is conveniently located just a few miles from Sea World and about 10 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. The staff is very nice and helpful; upon checking in, they offered us advice on restaurants and other attractions. The continental breakfast was quite good and the waffle makers that others have mentioned were fun to use. As a non-coffee drinker, I really appreciate that they had hot chocolate packets available (though, I would have loved some herbal tea bags as well!). The breakfast includes cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, orange juice, milk and more. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. The countertops near the bathroom are made of granite and have plenty of room for your toiletries. Our first night, we ordered pizza from Broadway Pizza, thanks to the recommendations included on a laminated sheet in the room. The pizza was really delicious, a good price and delivered right to our door (no address needed; I just needed to tell them \"Old Town Inn\" and they said, \"OK!). The next night, we drove the few blocks to Old Town. I did some research on Google and found lots of good reviews for the Cafe Coyote and Cantina, located at 2461 San Diego Avenue. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, but by the time I parked the car and walked a few blocks to the restaurant, my wife already had a table. The service was great, the chips & salsa wer e quite tasty, the hand-made tortillas were great, the portions were generous and the fried ice-cream was delicios. The area gets a bit crowded during the evening, but free parking is available on the street or at the Old Town recreation area on Congress Street between Mason St. & Twiggs St. Just be prepared to pounce as soon as you find a spot during the busy evening hours). I would highly recommend the Old Town Inn for those wishing to see Sea World, the San Diego Zoo and Old Town. The staff is top notch, even if you can't make reservations via their Web site (when I called for a reservation, Beatriz was nice enough to call me back rather put me on hold while she checked in other guests. It was her suggestion that she call me back and I really appreciated it!!). The rooms are large, clean, safe and convenient. Add in the complimentary continental breakfast, complimentary wi-fi, free parking and easy-to-find location, and it's easy to see why the Old Town Inn continues to get rave reviews.

It is a quick 5minute walk to Old Town itself and there are pedestrian crossways. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Comfortable beds, clean rooms, adequate breakfast with waffles, etc. We stayed for a few days prior to heading to Maui and again on the way back. The first stay was in a larger room facing the office/pool area and the second stay was in a smaller room (not as nice) away from traffic (yah, that's not possible). That would be my only concern - traffic noise was a real problem for us. I will say it died down a tiny bit in the wee hours - but overall, bring earplugs. We also found a discount coupon in a local hotel guide for this property which we used on our return trip - only good for small room anyway. Cab fare is $15 to/from airport. The service they use charges a flat fee. They were extremely punctual even though we had a last minute change. Parking is easy in and out with no extra charge.

Yes, it's across the street from the train station and the freeway is audible from most front-facing rooms. But for the price, I can totally live with that. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs, just in case. It's about a $14 cab ride from the airport (a bit pricey, but oh well). There's someone that staffs the front desk 24/7. They provided me with free toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste when I realized at past midnight that I forgot to pack the essentials. Also had extra pillows and blankets upon request. They have breakfast 8am to 10am (I think) and it's YUMMY, totally worth waking up for even after a long night. Fresh, hot, self-serve made-to-order Belgian waffles, a variety of danishes, muffins, toast, and bagels. Also there's fresh fruit, canned fruit, OJ, hot coffee and tea. Honestly, for a motel, this is an awesome brekkie. The standard room itself was not bad, fairly small but clean. It fit a dresser, a 27\" CRT tv, queen sized bed, and a two-person dining table. There's a vanity, a small walk-in closet, and a bathroom with a standup shower. There's AC & heater in the room just in case the weather isn't perfect. Walls are paper thin so we heard others coughing, talking, and watching tv. This was not nearly as bad as the very occasional train rolling by tooting it ridiculously loud horn. Earplugs are a good thing if you happen to get a room near the street :) We rented a car so I can't really comment on walking distance to everything, but I can say that everything was easy to reach by car. Parking wasn't at all a problem and we came during spring break/St Patricks day weekend. A few oddities: The carpet felt damp the entire time we were there, like they were just shampooed but didn't dry completely. The ventilation of the bathroom wasn't great, drops of water condensed on the ceiling and dropped on our heads (and some of the water was brown). A few lightbulbs were out or close to dead so they would flicker endlessly. I think the previous resident in our room had set the alarm to ring at 7:30 am and didn't turn it off. So, of course, the alarm blared like a siren only after we'd just gotten in 5 hours earlier...SIGH, that was a bad start to an otherwise great trip.

Well... It's not that little considering that it has 3 buildings to its name, but it still gives you a cosy and warm feeling. Given that we arrived on Amtrak @ Old Town Station, or rather, the Old Town Platform, the hotel was a short less-than-a-mile walk across the Transit Centre Car Park. Check-in was efficient, and while they did not have the King-Bed Non-Smoking Efficiency Room we had reserved, they upgraded us to a Queen-Bed Smoking one with a full kitchenett. While we really do hate the idea of staying in a smoking room, the hotel really did their very best to deordorize the room and their efforts are not missed. Sadly though, once the heater / air-conditioning is turned on, the smell of smoke came back on full blast. There are no views to speak off at The Old Town Inn, but its proximity to the Old Town transit Centre literally means that you could get to any place in San Diego rather easily. A short 5-minute walk would bring us to the Trolley Station, and from there its a 15-minute ride to Downtown San Diego. Similarly, we could catch a Metro Bus to SeaWorld, which would take all of 20-minutes. The Zoo could also be reached in about 35 minutes.

We had prebooked the Inn by contacting them through their website after reading a number of positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. The hotel was completely full due to the Veteran's Day weekend. We had a very early disembarkation from the Celebrity Mercury. We rented a car from Thrifty and spent a couple hours seeing the sights - visiting the lovely Del Coronado Hotel on Coronado Island and exploring the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego. We then drove to the Old Town Inn to check in, but they had had a full house the night before and said to come back in a few hours. We left our car in a parking spot near our room and walked to the historic area of Old Town. Because it was the Veteran's Day holiday we were pleasantly surprised to discover that there were free tours of Old Town Historic park being offered hourly! We were escorted on our tour by four costumed guides portraying known real-life characters from San Diego's early history. One of the park personnel portrayed a gossip-loving female, the wife of an early California governor, who has been immortalized by the letters she left behind showing her proclivity to gossip about fellow citizens and a well documented rivalry with another leading female of Old Town! That day there was also a fellow dressed as an early sherrif, an Irishman who was depicting an early settler and another 19th century young male character. They were all very entertaining and informative, as prior to our day in Old Town we had scant knowlege of California's early history. They each stayed in character for the entire tour and introduced themselves only at the end. Two were park employees and two volunteer reenactors. Old Town is the California equivalent of St. Augustine, a place we live very close to and are well acquainted with in Florida. If you get a chance to see one of these reenactments in Old Town, do so! After our delightful two hour \"tour\" we browsed through a number of the other historic buildings, did some shopping and then had lunch at the Old Town Mexican Cafe (I am writing a seperate review of this restaurant of which we were not particularly impressed). We then walked back to the Old Town Inn to check into our room and catch a couple hours rest, although we did walk back to Old Town in the early evening to do more browsing. We were very happy with our second floor non-smoking standard room with a queen-sized bed and clean and spacious bath. There was absolutely no noise and we felt that at $69 for the night we got a very good deal. They had coffee available at all times in the office area, as well as a coffee pot and all you needed to make it in the room. They also had free internet usage in the office- I'm not sure about in the rooms as we did not have our laptop on this trip. They also have a lovely clean pool area, free goody bags that included toothpaste, razors, gum and a few other items given to us at the very friendly professional check-in, and an absolutely delightfully clean and well-decorated breakfast area open from 6-10 am that even lets you make your own piping hot waffles! The pastries, cereals, joice and coffee were all very good, as well, and we were completely satisfied with our short stay at the Old Town Inn. I highly recommend this hotel for all travelers.

However, we rather disappointed with the hotel. The room itself, while clean, was no more than adequate. We had difficulty finding a carpark space near the room with some large vehicles in particular making it very awkward to park in certain places. The air conditioning was rather noisy. The main reason for choosing this hotel was its location near old town. I had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel in the first place but when I did I was surprised to find it in a somewhat industrial area and the nearby neighbourhood didn't look the best in the world. In fact whoever decided to call the hotel the Old town inn deserves royalties because I'm sure the name gets people interested in the hotel as an old town accommodation spot. On a map the hotel looks very near old town which technically it is. But to get there, even if it only takes 5 minutes, you have to walk past a warehouse, cross a busy highway, walk under a freeway and then an underpass under some railway tracks and a trolley station (the trolley goes all the way to Mexico border from here). Not really a walk for those with a nervous disposition although once in old town everything seemed safe enough. In a nutshell I'd prefer a few more touristy things adjacent to the hotel to make the walk more pleasant. Being on the highway has one advantage. Its an easy 5 minute drive to SeaWorld if that's what you're in San Diego for. As someone who has visited most other parks in Southern California I thought that park was a little too commercialised for my liking with not enough rides or indeed shade to keep the little ones happy. The inclusive breakfast was fine although on both mornings there were shortages of various items. Seating, especially for families was also in short supply at times.

I exchanged several emails with their very friendly and helpful reservations staff and based on that exchange, reserved a deluxe room for 2 nights. In my emails to the staff, I had explained that since my friend and I were travelling from Paris, we would be jetlagged and wanting a *quiet* room. I was assured that if we went with a deluxe room, we would get a quiet room. Also, I informed the staff that we would be arriving late, around 10 pm, and was told that was not a problem. When we arrived (slightly earlier than expected, but after travelling for almost 24 hours) the only \"deluxe\" room left was on the ground floor on the parking lot (114). However, on my key-car envelope, it was clearly marked that we were supposed to be on the 3rd floor in room 313. We went back to the desk where the very friendly receptionist explained that the hotel was booked and that our ground floor room was the only one left. So, despite my numerous emails in advance and the key card written out in my name with a 3rd floor room assignment, we were stuck with leftovers. I have heavy-duty ear plugs, so I thought it would be ok. At 6:15 am this morning, the herd of elephants in the room above us woke us up, apparently preparing for the circus. Despite my heavy-duty ear plugs, I could also hear cars in the parking lot. After unsuccessfully trying to go back to sleep (ah, jetlag!) I decided to take a swim in the heated pool for some exercise and relaxation. I got to the pool at 6:45 am. Locked. I went inside t o reception to see if someone could open it, and the receptionist (different from our arrival) refused. I explained that I had been woken up, was jetlagged, and just wanted to swim some laps and not make any noise, but je refused, saying no, the pool doesn't open until 7 am. However, there were about 4 people eating breakfast in the breakfast room, whereas allegedly breakfast doesn't start until 7 am either... So now I am back in the \"deluxe\" room, which I purposely put in quotes because it's barely big enough to fit the 2 beds (which are, however, very comfortable). Luckily, the WiFi is working fine. While the reservations staff was friendly, as was the person who welcomed us last night, I do not feel that friendliness makes up for misleading me about getting a quiet room (everyone knows that a ground floor room is never the quietest!!!) and for this morning's unfriendliness and lack of know-how of when to make an exception (btw, the pool hours are *not* posted at the pool.)

They didn\u2019t always keep up with re-filling the bagels & muffins either. The waffles were great though. Another issue is that they only have 8 tables in the breakfast room which wasn\u2019t always sufficient seating for everyone. The location was great because we were able to walk to Old Town for shopping and dinner, Sports Arena for In & Out Burgers and Starbucks, to the MCRD to watch the Marine graduation, and to the transit center to take the bus and/or trolley \u2013 which we took to SeaWorld and Coronado Island without any problems. The day we left, we checked out of our room, stored our luggage with them for the day and then they called a cab for us once we were ready to go to the airport.

The rooms were pleasant however they were lacking many items. There was no fridge, safe and the rollaway bed they brought us was probably thirty years old. The staff was pleasant when we booked in, gave us great maps for getting around and arranged for us to have extra pillows and blankets. Our room was near the road and we heard everything. Unless we had the air conditioning on high we had a hard time sleeping. I slept well in Anaheim but after the second night at the Old Town Inn both my husband and I had sore backs. I was tired after sleeping at the Inn. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed, however our rollaway bed was never made the three nights we spent there. The breakfast was just okay, the first morning we had to go find staff to restock as there was nothing left and it was still quite early with a lot of people standing around waiting for food. The breakfast room is small and they ask you not to eat outside of the breakfast room. I'm not sure where you should eat if you can't get a table. ( standing up, I guess). The pool is fine and clean. There is no hot tub. Parking became difficult if you were one of the last in the parking lot. It is small and difficult to manage. We would have rated our stay okay until we went to check out. We had checked in using our CAA Visa Travellers Cheque Card. They accepted this and yet when we went to check out they told us they could not accept this ( even though we had no problems with our other hotel, restaurants and shops for the last 10 days). We had to go and get cash from the bank. When we returned home, we notice on the statement, they had put the money through on our Visa when we checked in and then taken our cash at check out. This has been resolved but only after calling them . Apparently the girl who checked us in should not have accepted our card. We spoke with our CAA and Visa and they said they have never had anyone reject this card. It is the same as a travellers cheque but in the form of a card which makes it much easier to use. Old Town Inn is the only hotel which we know of that does not accept it. I think perhaps the Inn should get up to date on new payment methods. Would I return? No. And obviously I would not recommend this to anyone else. The inn was okay but the check out definetly turned me off.

It had to be close to a trolley station so that we could get by without a car. It also needed to be clean, quiet and affordable. After weeks of searching and reading reviews of hotels, I was beginning to feel that I would never find the perfect hotel. Then I stumbled on the reviews for Old Town Inn. It sounded just perfect for what we wanted. I called the hotel and the person on the phone was extremely polite and helpful. So we booked in for a week. When we showed up, I wondered if it would be as good as it had sounded. And it was. The Trip Advisor reviews had been right on. It was a real find!! We had a delux room with a kitchenette. The room was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table. We would have preferred to have a table and chairs rather than a desk with an extra chair drawn up to it, but that was a small thing. If you book a kitchenette, it does not come with the dishes, etc in the room. You have to ask at the front desk and they will deliver a large case full of dishes, utensils, dishclothes, detergent, etc. But if we were to do it over, we would have not spent the extra few dollars for the kitchen unit. Each unit has a microwave and fridge, so we really didn't need the gas burners. We could have saved the extra 5 dollars a day and just bought some paper plates. The bed was really comfortable and the room was very quiet. One of the best things about the hotel is the location. It is a 5 minute walk to the bus and trolley station. From there we were able to get to anywhere we wanted cheaply and easily. A day pass was only 15 dollars for 4 days so you can't beat the price!! The Old Town area is right next to the trolley station, so we were able to wander around there whenever we wanted. There was an Italian restaurant by the trolley station that had a 5 dollar pizza special each day. So we were able to take it home and have a delicious dinner for next to nothing. The breakfast at the Old Town Inn was truly amazing. Yes, technically it was a deluxe continuental breakfast. But it had make yourself hot waffles and hard boiled eggs, so there was a lot of variety. They also had tea, coffee, hot chocolate, juice, yogurt,fresh fruit, fruit salad, assorted cold cereals, instant oatmeal, about 5 types of bagels, 4 types of danishes, toast, etc. We were there for a week and I doubt we repeated the same breakfast choices. The meal filled us up enough that we rarely needed lunch. It is also a really nice breakfast room, so we often stayed and chatted with our friends for an hour. It was definitely the nicest continental buffet I have had at a hotel. The hotel wasn't cheap, but was on a par with what all the other chain hotels were charging. But our friends wanted to save a few bucks so they had booked one of the hotel's economy rooms. These rooms are fairly small, but they are able to fit in a table and 2 chairs. They also had a fridge and microwave. Their bathroom was small, but did not have a hairdryer. But since they were not planning to spend too much time in their room aside from sleeping, they felt it was fine for their needs. Their bed was also super comfortable. They paid about 20 dollars a night less. If I was staying for just one night or if I wanted to save a bit of money, I would not hesitate to stay in the economy room. They are currently renovating rooms in that wing, so there was a bit of extra construction noise earlier in the day for them. But if you don't mind the extra cost, go for the bigger deluxe room. I think it was worth it. There were several restaurants within a ten minute walk fo the hotel, so we really didn't miss having a car. On days when we were out all day at Sea World, etc, we often stopped on our way back for dinner and then just hopped on the next trolley or bus. That is the benefit of the day pass!! We are already planning another trip to San Diego, and we will definitely staying at the Old Town Inn. It is a real gem of a hotel. The staff is top notch. Nothing was too much trouble and their attitude was great. I also loved being able to use the lobby computer to check my emails. The hotel has a very spacious and comfortable lobby with a fireplace. The Old Town Inn is an oasis in the middle of an industrial area. We never felt unsafe. Even though it is near to a highway, the hotel is very quiet. I can't imagine anyone complaining about anything at this hotel.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma, WA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and cheap but clean - hence the bargain\u201d", "Author": "saberman", "ReviewID": "UR6806242", "Content": "I wanted an affordable place to sleep close to USD, the airport, Seaworld and convenitent to the rest of San Diego attractions. I only paid about 65 bucks for the night in a room with 2 double beds within a row of a motel like structure, which is likely the older of the structures on the property. I was tired and did not notice the traffic from the nearby street and close elevated I-5. No noise from neighbors and a clean room made this a bargain. It was indeed convenient. A car is still a good idea in SD. However, nearby are bus and trolley routes. On arrival about 4 PM, I noticed a very strong \"room freshener\" which was definitely overdone. My advice to the hotel is to insure that non-smoking rooms are absoulutely maintained non-smoking and that room fresheners be far more subtle and sparingly used. The bathroom was 1950s design with a small shower stall, toilet and small updated vanity. The two double beds would be adequate up to a 6 foot tall person but not beyond. If you are tall get aroom with a queen bed. The decor had a cheerful bedspread and paint scheme. TV was very basic cable. The lobby was warm and welcoming as was the staff. There is only one person at the desk. If more than one person is ready to check in or out there will be a wait, so don't wait until the last minute to leave. The breaksfast was adequate and convenient self serve. Bagels, dry cereal, instant oatmeal, pastries and make your own waffles. The waffle batter was bland to paper mache' in flavor and texture - might be improved with a longer cook time and perhaps a different batter. One piece of advice to the staff - get a sneeze guard and keep the food out of children's reach. We observed one hacking, sneezing child spreading her germs over the pastries and bagels. We stuck with the non-descript waffles. Eating breakfast out may be worth it. All in all, if you just need a convenient place to flop, this place works out well.

The bad news... In general, there was a bunch of little things that were kind of annoying for us, We are two men in our 40s that rented 2 rooms (a small one and a larger one (the larger one had a kitchen and sofabed as well as a queen)-- both non-smoking) 1. The first \"larger room\" they gave me had a strong cigarette smoke smell. The carpet actually had cigarette burns in it in spite of the fact that this was supposed to be a non-smoking room. 2. I was transferred to another room (no smoke smell) but it (and my friend's room) both had a perfumy/disinfectant kind of smell that we both found unpleasant. (Perhaps, it's that Fabreze stuff and you might not mind it but both of us left the windows open to get rid of it).. The second room also had cigarette burns in it (these were on the blanket). In addition, the back of the door to the room had some heavy scratches and dents on it as if something heavy had been thrown against it. 3. When I returned later to my room, and turned on the tap to brush my teeth, there was an overpoweringly strong sulphur smell (rotten eggs smell) coming out of the tap. 4. I went to buy bottled water and the vending machine I tried was out of water; the second one stole my money and failed to dispense my water. 5. When we arrived, The pool had a sign on it saying that the water heater was broken although I saw people swimming in it later in the day who said it was warm. 6. The \"make your own\" waffles for breakfast were pretty tastelss and the cereal had a stale taste. The cereal was dispensed from large glass jars via scoops. I thought it strange that the scoops were stored by hanging them by the scoop-part (not by the handle) on the wooden knobs that were screwed into the center of the jar lids. In this way, every \"dirty\" hand that came in contact with a jar lid -- and left its germs on the lid's knob --resulted in those germs being transferred to the scoop which in turn was repeatedly inserted into the jar. (Yeech!). I believe that the reason the cereal tasted stale was that the jars were never emptied and washed -- just re-filled from time to time. 7. The remarks of the prior posters notwithstanding, there was some traffic noise from the street. My room was about 1/2 way back from the driveway entrance and you could still hear some noise in the distance (with the windows closed). It didn't disturb me -- I feel asleep easily but it might affect light sleepers, especially if your room was closer to the street. FYI, the smaller rooms (what they call \"the bungalows) are farther away from the street than the larger rooms. in general. Ok, the good news... 1. The lobby was very nice -- there was the fireplace and attractive furnishings. 2. Check-in was a snap. Mary at reception (who later changed my room) was a delight as was everyone who worked there. 3. The rooms were very nicely' decorated: even the smaller room was nice -- the only slight drawback was the smaller room's bath which had the \"original tile\" which while clean looked a little old.. 4. Everyone who worked there was very helpful and kind. When I lost my money in the soda machine, the deskclerk led me to the third machine (in the laundry room) and gave me the money I had lost. 5. The Orange Juice and tea at breakfast was tasty. I did not try the bagels but they were large and lots of people appeared to be enjoying them. I've sinced talked to a plumber who told me that the \"sulpur smell\" that I experienced (which was not in the shower, btw) could have resulted from a recent plumbing repair and probably would go away in a week or less.

Pretty pissed off about that, even the 1 hour early shutting was wrong, as we were 10 mins early. Anyway, we drove to the local IHOp and had a fantastic dinner, so that cafe lost our money. Their loss. Overall, if you're going to be staying in San Diego, we can strongly suggest a stay, just chuck a bit more on the budgetfor the deluxe.

Convenient to everything, especially Sea World (great for us, since we bought the 5 day pass!). We only used a half-tank of gas for the whole week and probably could have gotten by on much less if not for a foray to the Wild Animal Park. An easy walk into Old Town made this great for late-night dining, too. Breakfast, while not gourmet, managed to fill us up just fine with plenty of good choices-- waffles, bagels, hard-boiled eggs, and oatmeal. That in itself probably saved us an arm and a leg in food costs, doubling the value of this wonderful budget lodging. By the way, we stayed in one of the older economy rooms with a microwave and fridge (they call them \"bungalows\"), and enjoyed it very much. We were in 141, the end unit, which afforded us plenty of privacy and was away from the noise of the pool. The gentleman at the desk said the bungalows had been renovated recently, and they looked very nice to us.

I would have given it 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I've rounded up. Most of the reviews (good and bad) are pretty much right on. First, the good: 1) As mentioned, great bargain ... ~ $100/night for a double queen deluxe 2) Very good location - walking distance to Old Town and the Trolley station; minutes from Sea World, downtown, the airport, and the Zoo 3) Great breakfast (as everyone mentions) - it can easily save you a lot of money if you normally eat a big breakfast with a family <BR> 4) Very clean and nice decorum in the rooms, lobby, and poolside Now the bad: 1) This is by far the noisiest hotel/motel we've ever stayed in. And we've stayed in all different types of places, from old boutique hotels in busy downtown areas to the cheapest Motel 6 by a busy highway. And this noise is all internal, not from the nearby highway. During the busy time when most rooms are occupied, you can hear everything above you and on both sides. Every footstep sounds like an elephant stampede. Every bath or shower sounds like Niagra Falls. You can even hear conversations, drawers opening/closing, and faucets being turned. And this was in the new section. Luckily my 5 year old sleeps through everything and we are usually up by 6:30, or we would have been even more annoyed. When I mentioned this to the desk person as we were checking out, she said we should have stayed on the 3rd floor. Perhaps they can pre-warn people if 3rd floor rooms are still available. 2) The pool is basically useless, exept for probably July/August. It is small, and even though it is heated (supposedly) to 82deg, it is freezing. The entire week we were there, we saw a total of 2 kids using it. Perhaps we are too use to 90deg+ lake temps in Texas. ;) 3) Only one desk person at any time, even during the busy weekends, can make for a long wait.

We were in a 2 queen- bed room with the gas hot plate (and hood vent) as well as fridge and microwave. We are a small family of Mom, Dad and a 6 year old and we were mostly visiting for all the theme parks. We were only really at the hotel for breakfast and after dinner usually went to bed. It's located very close to Seaworld, the zoo and the airport and only 30 minutes or less from The Wild Life Park and Legoland. We attended all the parks and getting to them was very good with the hotel directions. I think that this hotel is awesome for a family visiting the city for the sights, the pool was clean and our son was the only one in it the few times we went but the weather was mostly overcast. If you have a huge budget, go to a 5 star but if you want to spend your dollars on the sights and park meals etc. then this hotel really helps. A rental car is best but it is very close to public transit if you are only needing to be in town. There is a crosswalk and lights to cross the 4 lane road between the hotel and the trolley/transit system and Old town. As for it being far from restaurants.....again, with a vehicle it is minutes from all the fast food and pizza you can imagine as well as Black Angus, several family restaurants etc. The famed hotel circle is also really close and we drove by it on our way to the Wild animal park and it looked like a zoo. It is just countless hotels on either side of a major freeway so I don't know how any of those places would be either quieter or nicer and the price on most I saw was considerably more than the Old Town Inn. Also there was no parking fee at this hotel to add up the bill. We stayed for an entire week and the front desk was helpful though usually fairly busy. For families with young kids I would really recommend this hotel unless you are made of money and like room service etc! The breakfast had a choice of 3 cold cereals, 3 types of oatmeal, a great fruit salad, hard boiled eggs, 3 types of bagels and cream cheese, white and brown toast, 2 types of fruit pastries, 2 types of muffins, OJ, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and of course the self- made waffles and syrup. Pretty impressive for no extra cost. We were there for the last 4 days of spring break and never had to wait for a table and it was even quieter for our last 3 days.

My wife and I celebrated our 30+ anniversary (allowing a ten year time frame helps keep you right!) while we were on this Vacation. I am sixty one (also celebrated that milestone on this vacation.); my wife is five years younger. We are time share owners, since 1997, in Florida, Westgate Vacation Villas. We exchanged one of our weeks for Desert Springs II and another for Marriott\u2019s Newport Coast Villas (Newport CA). and spent two nights at Palm Springs Marquis Villas Resort, with another couple .(I have written reviews on these.) We were on our first California visit. We were on holidays, in California, from January 26 to our return to Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada on Valentines Day February 14th. We arrived home to -40 degree temperature. (It is the same temperature in C. or F.) . We often travel with another couple but this time we were just the two of us. Unforeseen circumstances prevented another couple from joining us. We also stayed one night each at \u201cHermosa Hotel\u201d Avalon, Catalina Island ,(Review is complete) and \u201cDesert Hills Hotel\u201d in Palm Springs.(In the Marriott\u2019s Newport Coast Villas, Newport Beach Review, I mistakenly called it Desert Springs Inn) I plan to write up on Desert Hills Hotel as well. We followed Trip Advisor for the hotels mentioned and Hermosa Hotel. We found the reports to be very accurate when one considered the consistent comments. (Also checked the reviews on the timeshares, but we were confident we knew what to expect at them.) This was a situation where we were in Newport Beach and had a night and the better part of two days to fill in before our return to Palm Springs. We had thought about going to Mexico but decided that was too much and I\u2019m glad we made that decision. While we were at the Newport library, being guest computer users, my wife was looking after emails and I checked out the motels in San Diego on Trip Advisor. Old Town Inn seemed very inexpensive and had gotten good reviews. We felt we had been lucky with Hotel Hermosa in Avalon would we try our luck again? I phoned and was offered a room for $65.00 I booked it! We arrived about 3:00 P.M. my wife wasn\u2019t feeling very well, just a little off. I asked if an upgraded room might be available. I was offered a room with a queen bed, a microwave, and bar fridge. It was a little bigger and $10.00 more. (A Special Price!) My wife rested and I looked around. The pool area was very well looked after, as was the lobby. It appeared all the staff I talked to are proud of the inn! Again, all the positive things that have been said, we agree with. We did not experience any problem with noise or any other negative situations. My wife felt better after a rest. I got direction to Old Town and asked if it was safe for us to walk there. They said they had not had any trouble and we left about 5:30 P.M. for a walk around Old Town. It was great! There were shops and a band, very enjoyable! We got into a Pizza Restaurant,(My wife\u2019s favorite!) around 9:00 P.M. We enjoyed the meal and walked back to the Hotel. We felt very safe all the time! The next morning, we went for a great breakfast as has been described in other reviews. We bought tickets for the Trolley Tour at the Inn for $28.00 each. (They said leaving our vehicle at the Inn would not be a problem.) We walked to the Trolley in old Town around 10:00 A.M. and had a quick tour of San Diego. We returned about 2:00 P.M. We had a quick lunch and left for Palm Springs about 2:30. This is a very nice hotel, well maintained and would be great for a family. It was great for us.

Trip Advisor has always been reliable for us, but definately not this time. To begin with, the hotel is not really in Old Town. It is located on an industrial road about a mile from the historic district. You can walk to the historic Old Town area, but you have to walk along Pacific Hwy for a bit, then cross under the freeway and past the train station to get to it. No way would I take my family along this route after dark. The room was old and had a musty smell. The furniture looked like it was from the 1970's. We were awoken both mornings at 5am by the garbage truck behind the hotel. To make matters worse, someone's dog starting barking out in the hallway at 7am and this went on for 30 minutes both mornings. The breakfast that everyone raves about is nothing more than a waffle maker, donuts, muffins, cereal, and yogurt. Of course the breakfast area is so small that it was always difficult to find somewhere to sit, especially if you have more than 2 people in your group. I took a quick peek at the pool which was very small like you would find at any budget motel. Parking is tight, we couldn't find a space when we first arrived late at night. Each space is very narrow, and pretty difficult to get in and out of the car when you can barely open the car door. The final straw was having to kill a cockroach in the bathroom in the middle of the night. I've never checked out of a hotel earlier than planned in my life, but we did that next morning. Yes, the front desk staff are friendly, and it's a convenient location for getting to Sea World and Old Town(by car), but it should be clarified that the Old Town Inn is simply a 1 star budget motel. You'll save some money staying here but it was not worth it. I can only conclude that all these glowing reviews are either fabricated by the owners of the motel, or the people submitting there opinions are comparing the place to a Motel 6 or Super 8. Giving it 5 stars is ridiculous. What would they give the Hotel del Coronado? We stayed our final night at the Courtyard San Diego Central for only $30 more a night. The place was great. We were definately penny wise and pound foolish on this one.", "Date": "July 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long beach california", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Treasure\u201d", "Author": "ourladyofrevlon", "ReviewID": "UR3660345", "Content": "I have stayed in dozens of hotels-motels in San Diego over the last 30 years as I live just 2 hours away.

I told them my concerns on the economy & they gave me a key to look at 1st saying they want me to be thoroughly happy with my stay. Well, the room is small & a ways from the main area.

Bathroom had tub/shower & outside the bath is a very large sink area with tons of rooms to put all my makeup & hair access. The pool area is lovely w/beautiful flowers. The deluxe continental breakfast was great. I have read people not so pleased with it but if you want a cooked to order breakfast stay at Embassy Suites for $200 +. The breakfast consisted of 2 waffle makers with the batter poured in individual cups, many hot & cold cereals, bagels, sweet rolls & toast, cream cheese & jams, apples & oranges, fruit cocktail, hard boiled eggs, juice & coffee, tea & cocoa. FREE! A small observance that I was impressed with is that their vending machine sodas were only 75 cents. The whole place was immaculate & staff personnel genuinely warm & caring.
