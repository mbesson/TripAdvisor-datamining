The staff was friendly, and the rooms were nice. My room was clean, bed was comfortable, and it had a balcony. Also the floor my room was on was very quiet which is a big bonus in my book. The breakfast buffet had just enough to quench your hunger if you are a breakfast person. This hotel also had a nice clean pool to keep you cool during the day. The only downfall I found was the location. The taxi driver was confused on the exact location although he asked a few people.

Kids in a separate room with own tv. Balcony too. Breakfast nice with great coffee as you'd expect. Lovely pool but hours a bit short for our needs - opened at 10 and shut at 7. Meant it wasn't open before we went out and shut when we got back. But days when we lazed around it was lovely to have it. Gym expensive which was annoying as it was pretty much unused while we were there. Wifi access really expensive which is very frustrating these days. Staff were very helpful - particularly sorting out a doctor visit for my wife which was very easy and helpful at the time. Would overall recommend but be prepared for a 40-50 minute journey into the city centre on bus and tube.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNo service, no smile\u201d", "Author": "hagenbas", "ReviewID": "UR115027273", "Content": "Having ween quite some hotels, aware of cultural differences between countries: do not go here. Have read reviews about the staff and unfriendly-ness, but thought upfront this would be ok. It wasn't! Even worse. Rooms are small. Family room with the size of a single bedroom. Loud party at night till 0.30am underneath the family room is not handy. Nor was an apology made (with 2 small kids that could not sleep). Pool is nice, but the staff is terrible. 1 out of 10 seems to care. The other ones ignore you, do not help, and have no idea what service with a smile means. This hotel will never learn and improve. Send all employees on a customer service training might be a start, combined with english or italian lessons.

It was a very shocking experience. Within one hour after arrival our car was robbed on the parking lodge of the hotel. Ofcourse the hotel cannot help that this happened, but still we had a very bad feeling about it. Around our car the mostly eastern european personal continued working avoiding the glass on the parking of our robbed car. Nobody alarmed us. We went to the reception for help but she did not seem to care. After a firm discussion we finally got some help cleaning the car and informing the police. From the hotel we did not receive any help, interest of whatever. Unbelieveble ! The service of the hotel personal was worse in general. The eastern european personell all looked angry without any sign of happiness. Finally our last night was disturbed by a hooker who worked all night in the room above us serving several clients. After checking out we saw that our cartire was statched several times. Bad luck or...... ? Whilst changing the wheel on the hotels driveway several employees passed us with a silent and angry face.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money\u201d", "Author": "MarcCopenhagen", "ReviewID": "UR74923765", "Content": "Very helpfull staff.

My frined and I along with her 6 yr old daughter arrived on Friday, left Monday. Nice surroundings, pool area looked good, we were in adjacent building which had some pretty dodgy steps up to a first level door. Not enough safety for these. the room was large enough for a huge bed and a fold out chair. the bathroom facilities were good although the shower doors were broken and took some work! Breakfast included was very good. Hotel was in strange location bit like an industrial estate to get to it but once theough gates it was lovely and quiet. only down side was cost to get into Rome centre by taxi (app 45euro) This is the only reason I would not stay here again, it made it an expensive location.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alexandrebombo", "Title": "\u201cjust great\u201d", "Author": "alexandrebombo", "ReviewID": "UR14286795", "Content": "My family and I stayed at this hotel just last month and it was great.
