Check in was easy. It was great coming back to the hotel late at night and being able to grab a crepe from one of the many vendors on the surrounding streets. Everyone knows ahead of time that the hotel is in one of the busiest tourist areas of the city, so it won't be too quiet at night, but with the windows closed and air conditioner on, we slept just fine. The beds were comfortable and the bedding was nice and clean (same goes for the bathroom towels). The only flaw I could really find I suppose was the fact that we were on the 6th floor and the elevator was broken and could only take us to the 5th. Not a huge deal, but it was a bit odd that we stayed for a week and it wasn't fixed during that time. I suppose could have requested a room on a lower floor, but since my travel companion and I are both able-bodied, I didn't bother. Plus, we had a corner, front-facing room, so the view was really nice. The wifi was free and fast, as promised. We didn't buy the breakfast because there are so many spots right downstairs that offer similar foods for less money, but I heard nothing but nice things about the hotel's breakfast service. The hotel was very clean, the maid was friendly and it was so clean that it SMELLED clean after she cleaned our room.

The room we got had a double bed and a single bed (ideal for our son), very comfortable and spotless. Very clean bathroom, totally new. The shower is perhaps the less positive point because it's open on one side and can get the floor a little wet, but not too much if one is careful. Besides the size of the bathroom is quite big for the usual standards. Good surprise. I was a bit afraid that it might be noisy due to the amount of restaurants and bars around, but it was quite sound proof.

OK not riverside but nice all the same. Not at all noisy even being on the front of the hotel and had a lovely small balcony. We had not booked breakfast but when we realised that one cup of coffee was about E5.50 almost everywhere we decided that E7 for a basic but filling continental breakfast was really good value. I know that there is a Patisserie next door with coffee in paper cups and sitting outside which is OK later in the day and their baguettes were fab but so nice to have a leisurely breakfast. There was orange juice, tea, coffee and range of cereals, toast and pain au chocolat etc. For a bit more you could add eggs, ham etc. Staff were not over joyous and one in particular could benefit from a smile campaign but it did not spoil breakfast.Great base and do not miss a trip to Versailles it was amazing and again so easy to get to from RER close to hotel direct to Palace.Buy RER ticket in advance (E7) and do the organised tour which takes you to parts of the palace including the opera house that you cannot get to on a general ticket. You can then use this ticket to go around the rest of the palace so was great value for money. The tour was really really interesting and Versaille town is nice to eat in lovely shops and eating places in the town and the most amazing McCafe opposite the station which is a MacDonalds cafe selling the most delicious coffee and pastries. Split from the Happy Meal section and an ideal breakfast stop before the trip. The hotel were happy to store our bags on the last day and the reception staff were really helpful and can not understand other comments as they guided us around and even found train times for us. Nothing was too much trouble for them and we had not problem communicating. Ask to be directed to the most amazing coffee and ice cream parlour, right out of hotel and first left and 2/3 min walk on left side. They make ice creams in the shape of a flower with as many flavours as you want. Coffee was pretty good too. There are loads of meal offers in restaurants behind the hotel and away from the seine. Certainly a lot cheaper than those close to the metro. We would certainly use the hotel again as it offered good clean rooms, safe area and plenty eating options and direct link from Gare du Nord to Versailles and easy to connect with all attractions and we walked to the Louvre.

We quickly learned that our room number was Cinque-cent-trente-six (536). After that we enjoyed some trial French with mixed results. Get to know the reception staff - they are good value, good fun and most helpful. About 50 metres and you are at the Seine. Turn right - there is Notre Dame.

Exactly what you want from a hotel: central location, good beds and soft bedlinen, MODERN (tiny, yes, but clean and functional) bathroom, enough wardrobe space (with big mirrors) for two people, flat telly and minibar (we didn't use the safe, but I think you need a special key). Beautiful full height window with an angled view of the Seine and a bit of the Louvre (room 429), above a very lively street. The double-glazing is PERFECT (no noise at all!). The aircon worked like a dream, was very quiet and SIMPLE to operate (you know, the \"ON/OFF\" button style and you could actually READ the display). Breafast was included in our special offer: delicious little croissants (we demolished quite a few), good coffee (don't believe everything you hear about bad French coffee) and chocolate, and the usual other bits and pieces: cheeses, ham, eggs (boil your own), sweet breads, butter and a good selection of jams. Some fresh fruit (not much of that, though). The breakfast room is tiny but very friendly (you always appreciate a warm smile for breakfast), with windows to the street. They serve it till 10.30 but there were notices around saying you could make arrangements for other times, or to have it in your room, if you needed it (early departures, lazy mornings). We may try it next time... The lift only takes three people (with a big suitcase you'll probably travel alone) and the corridors are extremely narrow but not oppressive (short and bright colours). The decor is simple and friendly. The old staircase is LOVELY. We DID use the Wi-Fi (5 euros for 48 hours). We had our Eee PC and it was great to show our room and the view to our families in the evening. Connection quality varied (good enough for surfing but not good enough for GOOD Skype video).

Getting to the Air Show was easy as RER B took me directly there with NO train changes. The entrance to the Metro/RER is about 100 feet from the door of the Hotel. In this area there are dozens and dozens, maybe hundreds of restaurants. Easy walks to Notre-Dame, Palais de Justice, Sainte-Chapelle, Musee Cluny, Luxenbourg Gardens, + many more. STAFF: They were all great! Very friendly and willing to speak english when needed. FOOD: The hotel had it's own little breakfast room that was very nice. It served the typical european breakfast. The coffee was outstanding as you might expect in Paris and the staff very attentive. The breakfast was only 13 euros, very reasonable for a nice sit-down meal with great coffee. ROOM: Again I was very pleased and although the rooms are a little small compared to USA standards, the quality of everything was very high. Much nicer than your average US chain hotel. Good beds and bedding. Good internet connectivity via WiFi. The windows were excellent and sealed out the noise from the streets virtually completely when closed (this is a very busy area with lots of street activity so this is a key feature). And MOST IMPORTANT for visiting in the summer, the AIR CONDITIONING was excellent! It worked well, was a built-in central unit with in room control (not a noisy window unit typical in many chain hotels). This was a huge plus for me because in Paris many of the small hotels don't have AC or there AC is fairly useless.

As other reviewers have said, the choice for dining, proximity to metro and other transport links, sightseeing buses and tourist hotspots is superb. I would also add for any smokers the smoking ban in indoor public places has little effect on the tourist or locals when choosing a restaurant. The facilities for terrace drinking and dining in all of Paris is as always, wonderful. Most establishments have many tables outside for smokers with loads of patio heaters, and inside for people who do not like it, with no feeling of discrimination for the smoker.

Only complaint was the noise generated outside the Hotel of an evening where street buskers & rap dancers performed almost each evening to load music. Even though we were on the 5th floor it was most noticeable of an evening. Worst still was the bars just around the corner opened to 5am in the morning that attracted a number of young revellers who thought they could sing at 4.30am in the morning. Every morning at 6.30am the local rubbish collection is made outside in the streets which at times woke us up.

We had about 5 days to explore the city. We are urban dwellers in our early 30's and our trip goal was to experience urban life in Paris while putting 10,000 miles on our shoes during our short trip. A friend of a friend that has stayed in Paris multiple times and always stays at the Albe recommended the Albe to me. In general, I think it is the absolute ideal location for our needs. As I stated, this was our first time in Paris and the central location could not be better. I tend to obsessively research hotels before I travel and the location relative to the \"must see\" sites in Paris is what attracted me to Albe. The Albe is literally just steps into the left bank south of the Ile de la Cite. We saw all of the sites that we could comfortably see in Paris without ever using a cab. We walked and used the metro (subway) for all of our travel. During a random early morning jog I found myself in awe while running through the courtyard in the Louvre at the 7-minute mark. The hotel is on the corner of 2 small streets with lots of foot traffic and is just a block down from a major city street. The streets below the hotel are filled with some small restaurants with pizza, the ubiquitous gyro wraps, Greek fare, etc. There is a great little place just below the hotel, which has nice croissants, pastries, etc., for a French style breakfast. The street below is also \"home field\" for the local break dancing crews and random singing groups. Because of this, we could hear some classic 80's breakdancing hits at times during our evening naps. This was mostly nostalgic and entertaining. It was not an actual disturbance for us. The quality of the breakdancing was questionable, but I guess that is for another review. I will try to stay focused here. The hotel decor is modern. The elevator is probably the smallest that I have ever been in, but, like the breakdancers, it was more entertaining than problematic. We stayed in room 640 on the 6th floor. The room was small, but I knew this prior to coming and this was not a problem at all. There is room for the bed, small desk, small wet bar, and TV. There are no drawers, but the closet has shelves for your clothes. The bathroom was adequate size and has a shower with a tub. The hotel staff was always cordial, respectful, and helpful. I would stay here again, if I went back to Paris and wanted an ideally, centrally located, clean place to lay my head in between adventures", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Leila007", "ReviewID": "UR16570111", "Content": "Myself and my parents stayed at this hotel near the end of April.

Yards from the Seine, yards from the St Michel Metro/RER, and thus directly linked to Paris CDG airport, surrounded by eateries of all standards and prices, its location is hard to beat. We stayed for 4 nights, including a weekend, and were fortunate enough to get a fifth floor room, with a small balcony no less, which afforded us an unexpected view across the river to the Louvre. The room was very small indeed, not unfamiliar in Paris, but fully equipped and decorated to a high standard in modern style. I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a room that size for a fortnight, but if you go to Paris for a weekend and spend so much time in your hotel room that you are worried by its dimensions, then frankly you need to get out more. The bathroom was a very comfortable size and again well equipped. Everything was spotlessly clean and in fully working order. With regards to the issue of street noise \u2013 no problem for us. Excellent double glazing plus our high floor kept out just about all of the noise. It really was astonishingly quiet. I note differences of opinion on the level of noise in other reviews, for which I have a theory. D\u2019Albe is on the corner of two streets, Rue de la Harpe and (I think) Rue Hachette, in a typically triangular Parisien building. The former street is relatively quiet, whereas the latter is lined with restaurants of the noisy persuasion. If you end up with room on a low floor over the noisy street, you might be in trouble, however good the double glazing. On the other hand, Rue de la Harpe is just sheltered enough to preserve the rooms from the noise. I understand that all rooms bar some singles face one of these two roads. We were lucky, and therefore it was blissfully quiet for the middle of Paris. We didn\u2019t do breakfast in the hotel: it\u2019s expensive, and you can get fresh and excellent petit dejeuner at the Restaurant Saint Severin opposite the hotel for far less (and sit outside to boot). Alternatively, if you are off to the Louvre or the Orsay for opening time, try the wonderful La Fregate on the corner of Rue du Bac directly over the river from the Louvre for some proper Paris style. Note that prices in general in Paris now are sky high, especially when coupled with a nasty sterling to Euro rate. It\u2019s pretty easy to blow 50-100 Euro on dinner, even without wine. Overall, Paris remains wonderful, and we had absolutely no issues with the hotel.

We just got back (yesterday) from an 8 night stay at the Hotel Albe in Paris, France. Our family of 5 stayed in 2 rooms, one double, one triple (rooms 213 and 212 respectively). (Ps, I'm pretty sure the hotel reads these reviews: somebody earlier here had complained about being ripped off saying it had to be a maid with a key - one thing we noticed was *the doors do not latch* if you just let them close, you have to pull them (if inside) or push them (if outside) the room. Because our kids were going from room to room alot, we left our door -not latched- more than once and more than once a manager or staffer pulled the door shut to latch it, so maybe they saw the complaint here and are sensitive to it). The hotel is in an excellent location, especially given that you're something like a hundred feet from the front door to the St.Michel metro stop. (Of course, what nobody will tell you but I will - once you're underground you may have to walk and walk and walk to get to the train platform, but thats \"to be expected\". [?] Anyway...) Great location. Loads of greek restaurants in the neighborhood but a few french restaurants, a couple night clubs, a couple bakerys, a couple crepe places all within a block in either direction. Pharmacy close by also. Great landmarks within easy to moderate walks, greater landmarks and venues simple enough to reach by Metro. (and yes, we got an \"orange cards\" for each member of the family for unlimited metro travel all week and recouped multiple times over the cost over what single or carnet metro prices would have been). Of course, Notre Dame is an easy (EASY) walk. (I walked over there three or four times just on a lark while my family rested from me running them all over the rest of Paris). Ok, back to the hotel, not an overwhelming number of rooms, but the place was really booked while we were there since it was Easter - the standard Euro breakfast buffet was pretty crowded most of the mornings we stayed at the hotel (included in the room rate). (Breakfast could have been improved a wee bit, but we ate there every morning and can't really complain since it was \"free\".) Ok, one observation: alot (ALOT) of people staying there were French, hear what I'm saying? It's like your grandad always used to say on those long car trips about restaurants, \"well, if the truckers eat there, it most be good!\" - so I figured the hotel has a good reputation among the out of towners coming into the big city for the holiday. Narrow staircase (see pic) but not terrible to go up and down on. The -only- negative thing I can say about the hotel is that the elevator was being serviced at least 3 of the days while we were there - -however - the hotel always had the elevator running by dinner time (and all night), then they worked more on it the next day. So, no major problem. This is a 3 star hotel with three star performance. It was very clean and modern feel to it without being over the top \"nouveau\" feeling (like they were trying too hard - the feel of the hotel (to us) was just right). Front desk staff ranged from very fluent english to pretty good kinda sorta english. Cleaning staff was more ala francaise. Morning breakfast was administered by mostly one young lady who was very friendly and between her english (better than my french) and my frenglish, we got along famously. Side note: memorize a few french phrases and you'll open all kinds of smiles. Noise has been raised here a few times - there *are* two competing dance crews working the corner right outside the door (see the pic of a typical evening). But - we were on the 2nd foor, not the top floor, and nobody in our family complained to me at all, and with the windows closed I was barely aware of the noise and it certainly didn't keep any of us from sleeping. Would we recommend? Absolutely. Stay again? More than likely except that I'd like to try staying in another area just to try it sometime. The location here is fantastic. I won't belabor the review with anecdotes about the restaurants on the street (Rue de la Harpe or Rue de la Huchette). (Note that google maps pointer to the hotel is wrong wrong wrong. The hotel is not on the corner of Harpe and St Severins, but Harpe and Huchette, a much better place than you'd expect from Google maps).", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton", "Title": "\u201ca stay in the heart of Paris\u201d", "Author": "noflash", "ReviewID": "UR14585541", "Content": "The room although small was neat, the facilities pristine, and the staff always pleasant, available and helpful.

The hotel is a 3 star but the location is rather central. Like most hotels in this city, rooms come in small sizes and of course the lift is almost non-existent or too small to fit more than 2 adults! To be objective, I will list the good and not-so good points. Pros The reception was friendly and allowed us to keep the baby stroller with them so it won't take up additional space in our room. The heating was efficient and can be adjusted. The bathroom though small had a heater next to the tub/shower. The decor looked clean and modern. The room had ample wardrobe space to keep some of our things. And it had a safe where we kept our documents. The continental breakfast was very satisfying. They had a variety of cereal, cheeses, pastries, bread, yogurt, drinks and ham to choose from. You can also get orange juice, toast, boiled eggs and fruits as well as coffee on request. If you wanted expresso or cafe creme, you can request for that too. They also served hot milk for my son's chocolate. Anyway, I couldn't fault their coffee, it was good stuff. The hotel's location is very central (in Latin Quarter) and near to several metro entrants. Except when you have a stroller... There are tons of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, shops and take-aways in the immediate vicinity, so food is not an issue for those who stay here. The semi pedestrian streets are easy to stroll around and plenty of actions during the weekends and the evenings when the place gets more vibrant. Cons We had a standard room for 3 and it was on the 4th floor - the view of room faced the unscenic view of the semi-delapidated building directly across the hotel. The lift was under renovation whilst we were there and so the noise of drilling can be heard during the day. But just imagine walking up 4 storeys, it was exhausting and something I'm not accustomed to. NOT good at all. The rooms are hardly sound proof and you can always hear your neighbours come in and out. Never mind that. But what's unbearable is that the street is noisy especially over the weekends and the windows are not sound proof enough from the rowdy activities out there. The noise level didn't die off until about 4am! Would I stay here again?

However, they got stuck at the airport due to bad weather, so I had to spend the first night at the hotel alone. As I was alone, I made sure to lock the door and hang the \"do not disturb\"-sign on the door before going to bed, as I wanted a good nights sleep. The next morning however, I couldn't find one of my handbags. And the door was slightly open. Ran downstairs to the reception, but they hardly listened to me, refusing to believe that someone could have entered the room while I was sleeping. And first then was I made aware of there being a safe in the room and given a key to it - a bit late isn't it, when your passport, ticket back to London, Ipod and camera is missing?! So we had to spend half a day at the police office reporting the whole thing - our trip obviously didn't start off so well. However, it doesn't stop here. The next morning, me and my friends was going downstairs when one of the girls, half laughing, said \"that isn't your bag though, is it?\" pointing at one of the maids carrying a hand bag. Well, it bloody was!!! So I told her I wanted my bag (!), she carried it downstairs to the reception - and apparently it was found where the cleaners keep bed linen and towels. Thank god, my passport and train ticket was still in the bag, but my Ipod and camera wasn't of course. The next day I spoke to the hotel manager when checking out. He did apologize for what had happened (although refused to believe that someone employed at the hotel could have done it - who else could have opened a locked door though - and known I was alone in the room?), and told me that I would get my losses refunded through the hotel's insurance. I sent them the receipts as soon as I got home, but I still haven't heard from them, even after sending follow up e-mails.

We liked the hotel a lot. The room was clean and comfortable \u2013 a bargain for Paris. The bathroom was very large, and looked new, even to having a heated floor. The staff, all the way to housekeeping, was very friendly. Even the stuff in the mini-bar was reasonably priced, and the bakery downstairs was a convenient and tasty way to start the day. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a big \u201cbut\u201d on the way. Location. It is a great location as a base for exploring Paris. But it\u2019s not a great location if you want some sleep. It is a VERY buy area. We read Trip Advisor before we went, and even packed several different sets of earplugs. But what we experienced went beyond the realm of \u201cstreet noise\u201d \u2013 that is, the buzz of voices on a crowded street, punctuated by the occasional laughs and shouts of more exuberant pedestrians (the hotel is located on a pedestrian only street). What happened, at least while we were there, was Street Performance, lasting to the wee hours of the morning. And not just by magicians, mimes, or even musicians armed with just their voice and an acoustic guitar. These people had portable PA systems \u2013 and car batteries to power them! In front of the bookstore on the corner of Blvd St. Michel and Rue de la Huchette, an Afro/pop/cover band was in residence. They had acoustic guitars and percussion, which were all amplified (and they were quite good). They pointed out toward the busy Blvd St. Michel, and weren\u2019t really the direct cause of noise for the hotel. But right around the corner from them, on Rue de la Huchette, there was another performance spot \u2013 just steps from the hotel entrance. On Friday night, it was some type of street drum group, complete with call and response, and crowd participation. Our earplugs were worthless, because you see, this second group had to be at least as loud, if not louder, than the first group around the corner in order to be heard! Somewhere in the middle of the night my son was in tears because he couldn\u2019t sleep. It was about 4 AM when we finally crashed out. Since we were just coming off an overnight trans-Atlantic flight, we awoke positively shattered. Needless to say we lost the activities we had planned for the next morning. We were lucky to make it out the room before housekeeping arrived. When we returned to the hotel on Saturday night \u2013 at about 10 pm \u2013 the cover band was already drawing a crowd on the Blvd St. Michel, but this time a group of break dancers were setting up on the Rue de la Huchette \u2013 complete with a battery powered PA system. So we got rap music and crowd cheering well into Sunday morning. Earplugs again were no help. There was little sleep until things got quiet. We were almost afraid to return to the hotel on Sunday night, but we did, to the find the pop band and break dancers again set up. Fortunately, the streets were a little quieter and the crowds weren\u2019t that thick for the dancers (maybe because they had been performing throughout day on Sunday). It did get quieter earlier \u2013 say 12:30 am \u2013 and we got more sleep than on the previous nights. But sitting on the Eurostar on Monday morning, we were absolutely fried. We got to our hotel in London \u2013 and took a nap. A couple of things here\u2026we are not light sleepers. And we are fairly well traveled, having experienced the crowds of the World Cup in Germany in 2006. The other thing was, our room was as far down the Rue de la Huchette as you could get from the performance area. The other side of the hotel faced it directly. I can\u2019t imagine what those guests experienced. So I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the rooms are so reasonably priced because of the location. There probably are quieter times to stay at the D\u2019Albe, but it\u2019s a crapshoot to figure out when. A previous Trip Advisor poster likened the area to Bourbon Street. It\u2019s also a lot like summertime on the boardwalk at Ocean City, Maryland. Before making our reservation, we had been looking at more expensive hotels in less busy areas of Paris. As I stared sleeplessly at the ceiling in the A.M. of Sunday morning, that cost difference looked like a bargain. At that moment I would\u2019ve gladly paid double the difference for a quiet room and closed eyes. We won\u2019t stay at the D\u2019Albe again, but I wouldn\u2019t tell people unequivocally not to. Just be aware of the possibilities. If you're someone who might enjoy being out late on the streets of Paris, then this might be a perfect hotel for you. It just didn't work for a family who was trying to get to sleep before midnight. I feel bad writing this review because the hotel really did nothing wrong. If the hotel were located somewhere just a little quieter, I would go back in a heartbeat. But we saw Paris through a groggy haze because of our lack of sleep.

The only downside to the room is that wireless internet connection is not free. (They sell access cards at the front desk and there is also an internet cafe around the corner from the hotel.) The front-desk folks are extremely nice and helpful! The surrounding area can only be described as perfect! The area is very lively in the evenings and very safe during the day; we did a few morning runs along the River Seine, which is just a stones throw away. Right downstairs from you is a bakery for your morning croissant and coffee. On every street flanking the hotel, around every corner, and across the way are plenty of souvenir and Parisian shops (Etam, Cote a Cote). There are also numerous restaurant choices all around, a French book shop right across the hotel door entrance, and for those aching for a \"regular\" sized coffee by American standards, there is even a Starbucks just 2-3 minute walk away (although I preferred the downstairs bakery)! Here is the approximate time/distance it took us to get to various places from this hotel: Notre Dame Cathedral - 5-10 minute walk (cross the bridge and you're practically there) Monmarte (for the Moulin Rouge) - 15-20 minute cab ride Gare du Noir - 20 minute cab ride Metro stop - 1 minute walk (Saint-Michel stop) I would absolutely stay at this hotel again and definitely recommend it!", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cLOVED this hotel and Paris!!!\u201d", "Author": "MelissaL81", "ReviewID": "UR11485638", "Content": "We LOVED this hotel!!

The area is lively, though extremely touristy. If you are a first time visitor to Paris, the 5th is recommended. That being said, i've stayed at some really good hotels and some really bad ones in the 5th. I'll put the Albe in the 7/10 range, not the best, certainly not the worst. As for my stay at d'Albe, I decided to give it a try because of an amazing deal I got on the web. I paid a discounted rate for 3 nights and got a 4th night free and a free breakfast every morning. If I was paying full rate (or nearly full rate) I would have been disappointed with my room. Location: Smack dab in the middle of the Latin Quarter. This is good and bad. This is good because you can walk or metro or cab to nearly anywhere quickly. This is bad because d'Albe is located on a pedestrian street. Some cab drivers will drop you off at the front of the hotel. Some will not. Thus, you may have to drag your luggage through crowds to get to the hotel. The lobby: The lobby is very modern and fresh looking. The staff: The staff is friendly enough. They made a reservation for us. Though I had a few problems here and there where the staff would take a smoke break and lock the front hotel door. Thus I had to lounge around out front of the hotel and wait for them to get back to open the door again. This generally happened only later at night (11pm-1am) The room: Small like most of Paris hotels that are not outrageously expensive. It had a safe and a flat panel TV. It had a tiny desk. It had a tiny closet. The room also had a small bathroom. We did not have a tub. We only had a shower stall (i'm American so shower stall is aok). The room looked like it was sort of remodeled recently. Maybe fresher carpet but definitely showing age. The lights flickered a lot. It only had one outlet to charge my phone/camera/computer. The bathroom showed a bit of age. The shower was not as clean as I hoped, a bit of mold here and there. The toilet ran unless you gave it a whack. I also could rarely get consistent hot water in the morning, though hot water flowed freely after 3pm. (I checked with others staying and they had similar problems). The air conditioning worked wonderfully. I could make the room freezing. Breakfast: They get danishes and croissants from the bakery next door so it was all fresh. They had coffee, cheese, some hard boiled eggs and ham. For free it was very nice. For pay, you can walk next door and get a fresh hot danish for a euro or two. Overall, I didn't love it. It was very mediocre. For around the same price, there are a lot of hotels in the area that are nicer. If I got a deal again, i'd probably stay. If I had to pay normal rates, i'd choose elsewhere.

When you're in a big city like Paris you're better off in the path rather than off it because you'll be doing a lot of walking to get to the places you want to get to.

Rooms were typically small but modern and clean. A great value for your money. Skip the hotel breakfast. Go outside and get a crepe or pastries. There are many options outside your door. Unfortunately no coffee maker is provided. Skip all the restaurants outside your door when it comes to other meals though. They are all tourist traps. Chances are if in front of the restaurant their are enormous boards showcasing each page of their prix-fixe menu it won't be worth it. Head off the beaten path where you are bound to find some excellent options. If you don't like to walk, the metro station is right outside your door. Also there is a batobus which makes stops along the Seine River to landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. They have day passes. Skip taxis since Paris public transportation system is very easy to navigate. Save yourself some money if you are coming from CDG airport as for 2 euro you can hop on the RER B line to St Michel Station. It only takes about 35 minutes. Also if you are catching a TGV or Eurostar train at Gare Du Nord for your next destination take the #4 train. It's only a few stops and you'll get their in 15 minutes.

We were not expecting it and we were thrilled. The room was very comfortable, with an upscale, modern vibe. The flat screen tv was impressive, although , not being fans of tv, it was probably wasted on us.

We stayed on a warm spring Saturday night, where the street below featured wall-to-wall people, but we slept soundly. The beds were extremely comfortable. Our room was not ready at noon when we arrived, so we left our luggage sitting out in the lobby with everyone else's. It didn't bother us, but the more paranoid among you should be aware. We also left our key at the front desk when the room was not occupied. Again, I know that drives some people crazy, but that's just the way it is here.

Carmel, who looked after us in the morning was really pleasant and could not be more helpful. We stayed in room 427 which was one of the bigger rooms.

The best thing about the hotel was the location. It is in the Latin Quarter, which is full of atmosphere both in the afternoon and particularly in the evening. We travelled by RER directly from Charles De Gaulle to the St. Michelle Metro Station which is just 20yards from the Hotel. Due to the convenient location, we used the Metro every day. You can also get the RER train from here to the Palace of Verseilles , it takes about 40 mins. and you can purchase your entrance ticket along with your rail ticket at the station. But be warned, you may still have to queue to get into the Palace. It took us an hour to get in, but the line was moving all the time and the weather was good. The bus stop is also just beside the Metro Station which will bring you over to Galeries LaFayette for some shopping. The Hotel is also just over the bridge from Notre Dame Cathedral. You can get the open deck bus, hop on hop off, which costs \u20ac22 and is valid for two days. Well worth the price and a great idea for getting familiar with the city. It was my third visit to the city and I hope to be back again in a few years. I'll definitely be staying at the Albe Hotel.

The room wasn't large, but plenty big enough for us and had a mini bar, flatscreen tv and safe. The decor was simple and modern, and to our taste. The beds were comfortable. Again, although small (including a shorter length bath), the bathroom was sparklingly clean and modern which for me is more important, with plenty of hot water. The entrance lobby was bright, modern and clean, with some welcoming leather seating and magazines. We arrived early, and the hotel offered to store our bags. Our room was ready by 12.30pm. It was warm in the daytime even in March, but this allowed us to have the windows open. Not sure about how it would be in the heat of the summer (see other reviews). The staff were wonderfully helpful, and gave a very good restaurant recommendation - always a test. We opted for breakfast in the boulangerie next door, as recommended by other reviews. Great idea! Bargain price for a pain au chocolat and cafe americain which you can take away or have sitting down. It was warm enough to sit outside so we didn't want to sit inside in the hotel restaurant. Also saves a few Euros and some space for a long, lunch! Yes, it's not the quietest location, and if you want a peaceful night then choose somewhere else. But we wanted a bit of buzz and got it! My 17 year-old daughter loved the area with its small shops and noisy bars and clubs - even down to the smashing of plates by waiters trying to tempt you into the greek restaurants! It did get a little roudy later on on Saturday night, but we found it amusing and entertaining rather than worrying. Something to sit and watch whilst lingering over a coffee and crepe in the bar on the opposite corner. Lots of street 'performers'. Not sure it would be quite so lively during the week... Also, you're so near so many other places - especially if you don't mind walking - that we agreed the price was very good for the location: right by the Seine, on the edge of St Germain, across the river from Notre Dame and onto les Halles and the Pompidou, and a walk along the river over the Pont Neuf and on to the Louvre.

The RER metro can be found inside the building at terminal 3 - the ticket to Paris central costs 8.10 euros one way and there are only a couple of ticket offices - hence a massive queue.

We discovered the hotel during our last stay in Paris. The Hotel is a stones throw away from St Michel Metro but despite it's central location, right in the heart of 'the biz', the sound proofing is fantastic, although you do tend to spend most of the time with your window open to let in all the fabulous sounds and smells. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and will allow you to muddle your way through your limited French before rescuing you with their far better English! We booked directly with the hotel and as we had stayed before requested a high floor. We were allocated a good sized room on the 5th floor with plasma TV, mini bar and a balcony that had views over the Sienne & it's many bridges - the perfect place to sit with a glass of wine planning our days & nights expeditions. We also had breakfast included in our stay but with the many Boulangeries & Patisseries in and around the area we tended to eat out most of the time. Not to take anything away from the hotel breakfast tho, the breakfast room is very bright & pleasant with a good selection of cereals, toast, cheeses & of course pastries but we would probably leave this out next time. The only down side to our stay was that there was some refurbishment going on in the lower floors and the bumps and bangs could be heard from earlyish morning till early evening, but for the hotel to keep the standard that it has set then these works have to get done at some point and it certainly wasn't enough of a set back to spoil an otherwise flawless stay.

Hotel d'Albe in the Latin Quarter, 5th Arrrondissement, was a very satisfactory hotel - especially for the average price of $150 Euro a night. It is locate right off Saint Michel near Notre Dame and on the RER B train line from CDG airport. We took the train for about $8.50 Euro versus taxis that can cost over $60 Euro each way. It takes about the same amount of time (45 minutes) using either method. The Hotel is located on the Metro 4 and RER C. Best of all is the easy proximity to the Lovre, Notre Dame, Centre Pompidou and more. The Hotel is located on the Left Bank in an active part of Paris - lots of people walking around the many shops and ethnic resturants. We had two rooms - both on the first floor of the hotel (106 & 145). Both were average sized rooms based on our experience in Paris - double bed, medium walking space, and reasonable bathrooms with tub/showers, average space and hair dryers. Rooms also had mini bars (which we did not use, a small grocery is around the corner) and secure safes. The rooms were very clean and maid service did a good job keeping up with our trafficking in and out during our stay. Room 145 was more modern and located on the interior back side of the hotel making it more quiet - no view from the window and a smaller bathroom. Room 106 was more traditional and ran the length of the hotel - with a front view of street (noisy with the window open, but okay when closed even on New Years Eve) and a second window in the bathroom (helpful if you like fresh air from cross ventilation). Beds were comfortable but a bit firm - rooms included 2 extra pillows. Bathrooms used Grohe fixtures and great water pressure/temperature in the showers and deep tubs. Towels were very light but worked - the bathroom had a warming rack which was nice. We remembered to bring wash cloths since they are not common in Europe. Hotel provided minimum toiletries - soap, bodywash for shampoo, and shoe polish. If you need conditioner and lotion - bring it. The Hotel serves breakfast at $12 Euro a day - which we did not use. Be careful as the charge did show up on our bill -though we had no problem having it removed upon checking out. The entire front desk staff were very helpful - including confirming our dinner reservations during our stay. We treated them to some chocolates purchased at Galleries Lafayette. Overall - we found the Hotel d'Albe to be very satisfactory and would stay here again. The location and rates are very attractive. Access to the museums via Metro or walking was easy and the lively neighborhood was enjoyable.

We moved to a smaller room the next nite to the 5th floor that was fairly quiet with the window closed and the noises outside subsided by 2 AM. for the next 3 nights. The bathrooms are tiny and the foam pillows, cheap sheets and rough blankets were really disappointing after the K & K. Otherwise the hotel was clean and the people polite, but as said in a previous review \"nothing special.\" We also preferred the more central location of the K & K and their direct booking special price included a wonderful breakfast.!", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat central hotel\u201d", "Author": "mwilkins", "ReviewID": "UR6056123", "Content": "We needed somewhere for a couple of nights in Paris (2 adults and a 6 year old) and were not disappointed.

Once I saw the raving reviews about this hotel again I had to give my honest opinion so people don't make the same mistake that we did. Needless to say we aren't staying here again. I stayed in this hotel with my husband and son for one night last year on our way to Africa. We chose this hotel based on the reviews in Trip Advisor. I have to say that we were quite disappointed with our room. We had a triple room and of course it was small no surprise there but it was the basics. The staff was very nice and the breakfast was okay. I suppose if you are looking for a no frills budget hotel in the middle of bustling activity, than this place is for you. The location is good, in the heart of the Latin Quarter and minutes from Notre Dame. Yes , the lobby may look nice in the pictures but I have learned that you can't judge a hotel by it's lobby. I am by no means overly critical or snobbish I just expected more I guess.

First, the bad -- we read a number of reviews that emphasized soundproof windows; however, the noise from the street still penetrates. Some noises come through more loudly than others, such as, garbage trucks (every other morning at 5 am), police sirens, screaming, shouting, group singing, etc...and a lot of this goes on in the Latin Quarter until about 2-3 a.m. With that said, the windows do keep out approximately 70% of the noise. Without the double thickness, the location would be unbearable. Regarding the individuals at the front desk, some were more pleasant than others. The last morning of our stay, we had an upstairs neighbor that literally stomped around above us making it impossible to sleep (our ceiling was shaking). When I called the front desk at 5:30 am, the attendant stated that she would look into it. Over 30 minutes later, the noise hadn't stopped so I called again only to have her say that she hadn't called the individual yet and that she had departures to take care of. One hour later, the noise had still not subsided, and I called a third time only to have her say that she was checking into it. When we checked out 3.5 hours later, we found out from her that she NEVER contacted the individual above us, and she got angry that we couldn't understand why (the noise stopped approx. 30 minutes before we checked out). She informed me that she had done all she could do and was supposed to do. Also, like too many hotels, the comforters/bedspreads and blankets had not been washed prior to our arrival. We found hair and spots on the bedding. The good news is that the room, with the exception of the blankets and comforters, was very clean. Even though it was small, we had enough space to navigate and store our very large duffel bags/suitcases and other carry-on size bags. The rooom was small, but designed to be very efficient in managing the lack of space. The bathroom was probably the best feature of the room. It was very clean and the shower was wonderful. The beds were comfortable to sleep in and the heating/air conditioning unit was working very nicely. Lastly, the location is priceless, being located between two metro stops, St. Michel and Cluny-Sorbonne. The RER is accessible from both, which makes it amazingly convenient coming to an from the airport let alone any other location in Paris and the suburbs. The bakery/patisserie located beneath the hotel serverd delicious breads, crepes, and coffee. The bonus was having a Haagen-Dazs a stone's through from the hotel. However, I wouldn't advise eating too often in the Latin Quarter because the food really wasn't that great, but you do get what you pay for and most of it was very cheap.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "demone714", "ReviewID": "UR6001544", "Content": "just came back from Paris... and LOVED the D'Albe. As posted in other reviews, it truly is all about the location. Yes, the rooms were def on the smaller side, but everything was very clean. the staff was helpful. and were for the most part, friendly. i recommend this hotel for people who do not intend on spending any time in it (even though it was comfortable). the price was very fair for paris. however, i do not recommend this hotel for people who want a large room, or a fancy lobby, as there is just a small desk. this is definitely not a 5-star hotel. the location is very close to Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle. It's in the heart of the latin quarter, which is very touristy... (i recommend not eating dinner here, as the food is much better in the surrounding blocks). it can get a bit loud if you're facing the street. didn't bother us, as we stayed out late, but if you go to sleep before 12 and you have a problem with even the slightest bit of noise, request a room facing the back. we were on the 5th floor, and had a little balcony, which provided a little bit of views. Also, try to book directly with the hotels website... Exclusive-hotels, saved almost $30 a night booking directly through them. also, make sure you let them know whether or not you want the breakfast. it's 12 euro a person, which was definitely too expensive for us, as there is a little bakery downstairs where you can get croissant and coffee for 2 for 7 euro. overall, loved this hotel, and i'm recommending it to everyone i know :)", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "Lhoppy", "ReviewID": "UR5937813", "Content": "Just returned from a few days in Paris staying at this excellent establishment - couldn't fault it.

Very convenient to all train stations and any tourist attraction. Right by a ton of restaurants and a Starbucks. I've been to Paris three times and this location was by far the best. The room was comfortable, small by US standards but certainly average/good by European standards. We needed a triple, so we had one double bed and one single. The view out of our window was of the St Michel corner right by the Metro. Beds were comfy and there were extra pillows. EXCELLENT bathroom - we had been to four other hotels by the time we reached Paris and I loved all of them but this was by far the best bathroom/shower The elevator is small and slow, typical Paris, but we were on the 6th floor so we waited rather than taking the stairs. Now, here we are at my big problem with this place (and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars). When we checked in, we were told that breakfast was served in the room downstairs. So naturally, each morning we ate breakfast in the room downstairs. Anyone traveling to Europe knows that some hotels have breakfast included and some do not. We assumed by the way we were checked in that it was included. It wasn't and it was 12 euros a piece! At checkout, I was furious but the manager did nothing to assuage my frustration. This irritated me more than the breakfast itself. I am not saying that the hotel advertised falsely. There is a small sign next to the check in counter and also it is printed on their website.
