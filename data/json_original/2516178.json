But your lodging choices here are mostly very expensive boutique spas. But what if you are on a budget, or have kids, or don't need 24/7 spa access? Well, then there is the Best Western Stevenson Manor. I'm giving it Five Stars because it is hands-down THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY at this end of the Wine Country. However a good price is only an advantage if it doesn't mean substandard. At the Stevenson, you get scrupulously clean and spacious rooms -- a few with fireplaces -- and lots of amenities that add up to way more than you'd expect for the cost (which is well below $100 a night, especially with the many discounts offered: 2 or 3 night stay discount, AARP, AAA, Military. They even offer a discount for guest who are staying to be near relatives having operations at nearby St. Helena Hospital.) First of all, some of the pictures of the exterior make the place look bigger than it is. Rather than a big impersonal chain hotel, this is a cozy little motel -- only part of which is two story -- built around a charming little enclosed patio. The location is an easy walk to all the restaurants and spas along Calistoga's main drag. Let's go over what I got for my room rate of $89 (return visit discount for a Thursday and Friday night stay): *A large, scrupulously clean room with two double beds with comfortable linens and a lovely bathroom with whirlpool tub. (Some rooms have fire places and several are handicapped accessible.) *Lots of amenities such as free newspapers, Wi-Fi, sink, microwave, refrigerator, wine glasses, coffee service in room and more. *An amazingly good FREE breakfast that included my choice of waffles, yogurt and fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, toast, pastries, fresh juice. *Afternoon complimentary wine tasting with the day's featured wine and cheese. *Extremely friendly, attentive staff -- from the owner/manager who acted as a gracious host to the guy who quickly fixed a minor problem with our TV. This hotel would be especially good for families with children -- especially since kids are not usually welcomed at some of the more boutiquey inns around here. If you were trying to do the area on a budget or with a family, the free breakfasts alone would make it doable. (Load the kids up at breakfast, then stock your in-room fridge with snacks and sandwich fixins from the nearby Cala Market.) It's also a great budget option for exploring Wine Country. Most people flock to overpriced, overcrowded St. Helena. But Calistoga is right at the tip of the two main wine trails through the Valley -- Route 29 and the Silverado Trail. Calistoga also features some nice little museums such as The Sharpsteen Museum and access to mountain hiking, the Petrified Forest and the Old Faithful Geyser. Here are the things to be aware of about the Stephenson: *The hotel has a very nice little heated pool area with pool, hot tub, sauna. Yes, it is small, but almost all of the resorts around here have day passes or free pool access if you book a spa treatment. So use the Stephenson pool most days and book a spa treatment/pool day somewhere else for a splurge. *This is not necessarily a spot for a romantic getaway. While not as noisy as one reviewer claimed, people with children do stay here. As noted in other reviews, there are some rooms that are further removed from common areas. If quiet is important to you, ask for those rooms. So my recommendations? Families with kids or people on a budget, this is your place. AS for me? I don't have kids and I'm not on a budget, but I'm still glad I discovered the Stephenson. I was here twice while my mother had a knee replacement at St. Helena Hospital -- so I wasn't here for a vacation. But I found my experience enjoyable and comfortable. The bonus was, I felt comfortable splurging on a massage and good dinners at some of the town's best restaurants since my stay at the Stephenson was so reasonable.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cFabulous experience, great value.\u201d", "Author": "MarafromToronto", "ReviewID": "UR124136081", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here on a recent trip to California, and one night in wine country.

It is also close to the Napa Old Faithful Geyser and has some beautiful scenery. I went about 1-2 miles west of the hotel along Grant toward Tubbs and ran up Bennett Lane, through the grapevines.

We booked it at the last minute, not sure if you could do this at peak season as there aren't a lot of accommodations in the under $150 range in Calistoga. The view behind the hotel of the mountains was amazing and I had the view out my window. The employee upon check in was very polite and assisted us in getting reservations at some local restaurants. The rooms were very clean with a lot of extras. There was a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. 2 each of glasses, coffee mugs and even wine glasses (you are in wine country after all!). There was also a lot of things in the bathroom - plenty of towels, the standard shampoo and conditioner but also body wash, lotion, q-tips, cotton balls and makeup remover wipes. They also had a 'real' hair dryer as opposed to those on the wall kinds. You could definitely walk to some close by restaurants and even downtown Calistoga although that would have probably taken 15 - 20 minutes. Parking wasn't an issue in town for us but we were definitely there during the slower period. We ate at Jole while there, it was awesome. They had an expanded continental breakfast but I didn't get to check it out - or the pool/hot tub due to our short visit. The only complaint that I have was the bed. I had one queen in the room and the bed felt like anytime they had one person staying they put them in this room for the past 5 years and every single one of them slept right in the middle of the bed. I was very glad to only have to sleep in the bed for one night.

As we were travelling with our 13 year old son we went for the twin double bed room, the beds felt a little small. There was only the pool between us and the road but we heard no road noise.The reception staff were informative and friendly.

Reading other gushing reviews, I was a little skeptical that this place was this good for relatively little money. After having spent a night there, I will chime in and give a second to all previous commentary about the Stevenson. I would really have to nit pick to find something wrong with this motel, and the overall experience. Where to begin? Pleasant reception; helpful and friendly staff; clean, well-maintained room; mini-kitchen with whole bean coffee!!; whirlpool bathtub; pool view; complimentary internet; iPod dock. On the outside, heated pool and hot tub, ample parking lot, pleasant courtyard-sitting area to enjoy a glass of Napa Valley wine. We would have preferred a queen bed instead of a double, but not a big deal. A continental breakfast is advertised. Usually that means a stale cinnamon roll and coffee. Not here. Fresh waffles, hard-boiled eggs, coffee, cereal, fruit, toasted bagels, muffins or bread, muffins, orange juice, etc. Breakfast room can get busy around 8:30, so go earlier or later, maybe. If it is SRO, there is another dining room adjacent to the office, or enjoy the courtyard. The property is located at the east end of the main street and is away from the CBD, but a very pleasant, short walk into town. If it is essential for you to be right at center stage, front row, then the Stevenson may not be for you. The location, however, was a positive for us. Calistoga is the perfect base to visit both the Napa Valley and Sonoma wineries, and seems like a thousand miles away from the gridlock that has become St. Helena. Really, for the mid $100.00 range, for a quality wine country lodging, in season, this place is a bargain. Guaranteed, we will stay at the Stevenson again when visit the Napa Valley. Oh, a note on visiting local wineries. As I said, it\u2019s been a while since our last visit. Nothing is gratis here, any longer. Most if not all charge for tasting. And, most do not have a \u2018no appointment\u2019 winery-only tour. If they offer a guided tour at all, you will have the pleasure of forking out $20.00, minimum. One winery wanted $17.50 per person for the self-guided tour, with no tasting!!

We stayed in two different second floor rooms, one with a balcony and one with a fireplace. There is no elevator, which could be an issue for some and is not very convenient if you have a lot of luggage. The rooms obviously had been refurbished recently and were nicely appointed and comfortable. Fireplace rooms are more spacious than balcony rooms. The rooms are centered around an interior courtyard, which is a pleasant place for breakfast or a pre-dinner glass of wine in good weather, but which also means noise from inconsiderate guest groups can be (and was) a problem. The guest laundry is located outside near the ice machine, which is a little creepy doing laundry late at night. As others have noted, the weakest aspect of the hotel is the breakfast experience. The breakfast room is tiny; tables are squeezed together so that everyone is constantly tripping over each other and the number of tables is inadequate. In nice weather you can take your breakfast out to the courtyard, but otherwise you're out of luck. This is not a place to linger over coffee and a newspaper.

We didn't the first time, which is why we stayed here. It was exactly as expected - average chain hotel with outside pool and spa. Way too corporate for a stay in this cute little town. Even if you have kids, I think you could find a more interesting hotel/BnB with an outside pool. Having kids would be the only reason I would ever stay here again, and then as a last resort. Make your stay in Calistoga more special by spending your money somewhere else.", "Date": "January 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, new, comfortable place to stay in Calistoga\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1221486", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a trip that included a night at the Stevenson Manor Inn. What a treat. We stayed mid-week and called to get a room price. They like to keep the Inn as full as possible so gave us a very good rate and put us in a huge room with a beautiful fireplace. Coffee makers with coffee grinders built in and fresh coffee beans ready to go. Clean, new and quiet and in a great location for visiting the various wineries in the Nappa Valley. Staff was wonderful, polite and seemed to enjoy making their customers happy. Nice continental breakfast to start your day. While in the area don't miss the tour of the Rutherford Winery caves. Interesting and fun. The deli food at V. Satillo Vineyards is amazing and we had a wonderful picnic on the grounds with a delicious bottle of their wine. If you're a \"foody\" don't miss attending a class at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone. Chef was fun and informative and the focaccia was delicious. Their gourmet shop has everything you could hope for in the way of gadgets for the at home chef. Will return at the first opportunity to this lovely valley and will hope to stay at the Stephenson Manor Inn.
