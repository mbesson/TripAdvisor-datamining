I have to say that i was not impressed in the least. cons first, sorry: the complimentary breakfast buffet was mediocre. fruit and yogurt, toast, cereal, and a hot egg dish that was different every day. there is a creepy red lighted hotel that is 3 stories taller than the hotel right next door. the neighboring hotel had LOUD club music thumping ALL NIGHT. it also blocked all the sunlight to the pool so the pool was freezing and uninviting. Had to complain and moved rooms two times due to no hot water. and the kicker: there are bedbugs. my husband didnt get bit but my legs were COVERED in little bites. Pros: the owner of the hotel did comp us an excellent dinner to his friends italian restaurant in return for all the hot water issues, but when you dont have hot water you dont have hot water. the hotel is well located right off the 5th ave and if it wasnt for the red creepy manequin hotel, it would be fairly quiet. the beach is within reach as well all in all, we will not be staying at this hotel again.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falkenberg", "Title": "\u201cChristina and Ola, Anna and Jan, Falkenberg, Sweden\u201d", "Author": "ChristinaFalkenberg", "ReviewID": "UR126230180", "Content": "Very nice hotel and excellent service.

The housekeeping does an excellent job at decorating. Every day we had beautiful new decorations in our room. The last night we stayed, our housekeeper, Eric, even left us the nicest note on our bed, thanking us for our stay. We made sure to leave him a nice tip at the end of our stay! We also ate breakfast here a couple of times, which is much cheaper than going out to a restaurant. The food every day was fresh and delicious and once again the staff was wonderful!

We did experience a light bulb/electricity problem, but the staff was on it within minutes of the report and it was fixed immediately. The daily breakfasts were varied with plenty of selection and the quality of the food was excellent; could have served more breakfast meats (bacon, ham or sausage). Access to the beach clubs was very good. Going in we were concerned about the distance to the beach, but it only took a couple of days to get used to the walk to the beaches; the locations of the clubs was not a deterrent to the stay and would not be a factor in a return visit. We liked the proximity to 5th Avenue with the added benefit of the quiet, particularly after a day at the beach or dinner and a walk. No question of the great value for the dollar in terms of service, room, and amenities.

Good location with respect to 5th Ave/never needed to take a taxi at all, but a bit far from the ADO stations (and we walk fast...) Pros: - Beach Towels were great-- thick, large, perfect! - The minibar fridge was a lot larger than expected (college fridge sized)-- which was great for storage of breakfast/food items during the week. - The room was clean and simple, which was perfect-- there is a lot of closet/storing things space which was nice, additionally we loved the balcony (shaded view of the garden, but nice nonetheless) - The pool! Refreshingly cold, not busy at all. - Staff were very helpful/friendly: esp. Karla and Eric-- special thanks - Decor/Towel art.... returning to the hotel every night was especially fun-- the towel art was different and interesting every night (though the petals got a little tedious to keep cleaning up!) - FREE PURIFIED WATER: we took day trips and brought our own waterbottles, so this was perfect for us-- we'd refill everyday and venture out-- saved us lots of pesos on plastic waterbottles and water! - It was our anniversary, and the hotel went out of their way to help us celebrate, which was great (and soooo appreciated) Cons: - Lumpy pillows: so, our first night, all of our pillows were lumpy and hard. We went down the next morning, and they had changed two of our pillows to be sleepable, but it would have been nice to have a full set of comfy pillows. - A/C: the hotel's A/C set up is good-- they are trying to keep eco friendly, so they make it so you pretty much can't keep the A/C on when you are out-- which was great, and fine in January. However, whoever engineered the room set-up neglected to think that placing the A/C in the little entry way would not be effective in cooling the body (e.g. living space) of the room. Basically, you'll have a really cold entry/closet area, but the room itself will not cool off too well given the placement of the A/C in relation to the rest of the room. - Breakfast was expensive ($7USD/meal!) and we found it average, so we passed and survived off cheaper local fare - Shower temperature: fluxed rapidly/randomly between hot/cold/lukewarm frequently-- was hard to have a completely warm shower. (not also that playa tap water smells very *strange) - Noise: So HPB is located right next to \"Reina Roja\", this loud, red, hotel/cage/thingy. While it didn't particularly disturb us most nights (we were on Calle 22-- a pedestrian only street--and as far from RR as possible, which was great), if you happen to catch them on a party night: There was loud loud loud music playing on a Sunday from 10am to past when we finally fell asleep (12:30)... could just have been the BPM festival? Misc: - Beach club (Mamitas) was a bit far-- we got there at ~10:30/11am, and had to trek to the edge of the club to find two seats and an umbrella, but once there was fine (if you don't expect too much service). Expensive drinks... Overall: nice place to stay, we booked far in advance so was a bit cheaper than the usual price. Great \"base\" for excursions to the surrounding areas (Tulum, Coba, etc.).

In short, this hotel has a great location near the beach and 5th avenue. It is extremely convenient, exceedingly clean, and has an incredible staff. The only wrinkles that I encountered were a fair amount of noise form the hotel/club next door, and noisy AC. The former is out of the hotel's control though.

I want to give these guys 5 stars, but the noise keeps me from doing that. Even so, I would go back to stay at this hotel - it has so much else going for it. We stayed at the hotel for six nights with my mom. They treated all of us with the utmost courtesy and professionalism. My mom, who is a little older, was treated with incredible patience and care. I travel quite a bit for business and pleasure, and have not encountered a better hotel in terms of staff. I would like to thank Christian (our waiter), Eric (our cleaning person), and Karla (front desk) for their special service. I am not the kind of person to heap superlatives on a hotel, but this one really deserves it. I can also recommend a few restaurants in the area: El Asador on Avenida Constituentes (about 2 blocks), The Mayan Bistro (right next door to hotel), and 100% Natural on 5th (awesome juices, and great for the vegetarians in your party).

Our room was located on the ground floor and although we thought we'd booked an upgraded room (this error was down to the travel agent - Jetline travel - do not use them!), this was a standard room but we were more than happy with it - spacious, clean, huge comfortable bed. The location is fantastic - within seconds of the hotel, you're on 5th avenue but it's far away enough for you not to be bothered by any noise at night. You will be spoilt for choice for bars and restaurants nearby, both touristy and more traditional. Even the obvious, more touristy options on 5th are fantastic quality. You will pay more but if you like the hustle and bustle and atmosphere of a busier restaurant, like us, you probably won't mind paying a little extra. We didn't have a bad meal anywhere during our time in Playa. If you fancy something a little less up-market, I can recommend Los Pescadillos (I think) just up the road from the hotel (turn left out of the hotel so you're walking down 10th until you reach the roundabout - this place is opposite the Scotia Bank). Amazing calamari and huge portions of Mexican specialities such as giant burritos and fajitas. The Bohemia beer served in a glass with lime juice was great too. Friendly staff. Another favourite restaurant was Buenos Aires on Calle 6 where we went on our last night for a treat. We had a huge platter of amazing cuts of steak for around \u00a330 - amazing! There are plenty of places to find good inexpensive breakfasts on the roads just off 5th - we didn't have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on that. Our favourite bar was the Rooftop Bar - a tiny little place overlooking 5th with friendly staff and cheap, strong drinks! The cheapest (and strongest!) cuba libres (50 pesos) and amazing frozen margaritas. Open until 2am which good rock music. We did venture to the Blue Parrot a couple of times (which doesn't get busy until late by the way). Expensive drinks and bad music but OK for a couple of drunken beers and a dance at the end of the night. The beach is gorgeous and only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel offers tickets for use at Mamitas beach club so you can use their sunloungers and umbrellas for $5 per couple per day. You don't have to buy drinks but you can't take your own but we were happy to purchase a few drinks - good service and music on in the background while you chill out with a book....the beach is spotless and safe. Clean, warm sea. Very few people annoying you and lovely to walk down the long stretches at the end of an afternoon's sunbathing. We tended to walk from Mamitas up towards the Senor Frogs end, but not as far, to a lovely bar called Fusion for sunset drinks - they have a band on each night at around 5 which is a perfect end to the afternoon before heading back to get ready for the evening. I'd avoid senor frogs like the plague however - we only ventured in one afternoon to escape a rain shower and it was like Butlins gone wrong - rowdy Americans sat around whooping wearing hats made out of balloons on their heads and loud shouting and music coming from the PA. Needless to say we didn't stay and didn't bother going back! The free water and tea and coffee at the hotel (though the hot water wasn't always hot) was a nice touch, especially after a late night and you haven't bought water. There's free wifi so I could access the net on my phone in my room. There's also 2 PCs in the lobby so you can use those free also. You get given a token for a fresh beach towel each day so no need to pack towels. Despite us having lots of lazy lie-ins, we were rarely disturbed by the cleaners - they wait until you leave the room so don't worry about any early awakenings! It was my husband's birthday whilst we were there so I asked Jorge on reception if he could arrange a little surprise for him that day. Hubby was chuffed to bits to return from our day out to find balloons, decorations, a cake made out of towels (which looked amazing!), plus a little cake and a nice message from the staff in our room. Lovely touch! We have travelled the world a few times over so are quite hard to please with holidays but this is definitely one of our favourite holidays and we hope to return! Top tips: Don't bring any dollars with you. You will get stung with conversion charges. We just brought cash cards and drew out Pesos at the bank (plenty of ATMs around - the bigger banks charge less for withdrawls. Maximum withdrawal per time is 3,000 pesos (\u00a3150 approx) and they charged about \u00a31 for the withdrawal. Use your Spanish! We know some conversational Spanish and people in bars and restaurants really appreciate it if you try! Don't feel pressurised to book trips as soon as you arrive. There's plenty of tour operators so lots of availability. We booked trips to Chichen Itza and Isla Mujeres a couple of days in advance, no problem Thank you so much to all at the Hacienda and to Playa! Lovely people, great food, amazing beer and margaritas, gorgeous beach....perfecto!

For starters I had driven myself 7 hours with a broken wrist in a cast from Uxmal so was not the happiest of chaps, but the reception staff soon melted away my grumps. So welcoming they are here. The hotel is L shaped with a pool in the garden area, palm trees with cotton hammocks to relax and read a book or just snooze. Most people head to the beach so if you\u2019re a fan of quiet like me it's ideal. The shape of the building does however mean that sounds can echo around the hotel and especially in the rooms with ease so if you\u2019re a light sleeper bring ear plugs, but come you must. My first room was at the end of one side of the L and very quiet but the internet connection was not strong enough to connect to work systems, and as this was primarily a work trip they kindly rearranged the other reservations to get me into the room next to reception with a much stronger signal. Unfortunately a much noisier room as there is a bar opposite and a toilet with mega noisy fan next door. But by choice I stayed for the better signal. The staff well what can I say. The owners are too Italian, Robert the reception manager for the group (they have 5 hotels) is too German and the staff too Mexican. Sorry folks joking but I promised Robert a tease. From the maintenance staff (apart from 1 Sunday morning @ 8.30 am ) to the owners, nothing is too much trouble but nobody imposes, they have a great balance and will go out of their way to accommodate you. I would like to list them all so ALL there you are. The hotel is in one of the most central convenient positions possible in Playa del Carmen. It is on 10th between 20 & 22 so in 2 minutes you can be in the best restaurants with the lowest prices and friendliest service. Further down towards 5th & 10th they get pricey and add 20% tips and pull other dodgy stunts. Mega supermarket is a 10 minute walk and there is a great laundrette over the road. The rooms.... Beds are Massive in width, big and I repeat BIG pillows, spacious and tasteful. Big walk in shower with roof mounted shower head as well as a hand held shower. Loads of wardrobe space and a huge fridge to fill with COLD BEER. As I was working needed extension leads and plug boards which they happily provided, the reception and excursion team were more than happy every morning to print the work documents I needed for relatively very little cost. I was due to go back to Cancun for the last 12 days but elected to stay here ,and drive an hour each way each day to Cancun everyday, rather than move. When I return it will be to Playa del Carmen and it will be Hacienda Paradise (or one of their hotels). If you want central with easy access to great bars clubs and great restaurants then stay here you will love it. Thanks guys for a great stay and all your help over the past 40 days.

We were not interested in staying at the massive all inclusive resorts and wanted a place a little bit more intimate. We stumbled upon this little gem through the other great reviews on Trip Advisor and are glad for it. THE STAFF - The staff here were amazing and provided friendly and personal service. We arrived late at night and before we even got in the door, the man on reception was already outside greeting us and helping us with our bags. Generally if the staff saw that you were a new face they would go out of their way to introduce themselves and make you feel welcome. Every day our house maid, Yami would delight us by leaving different towel sculptures and petals on the bed - it's a really nice touch. The bar staff were very attentive and made sure we didn't get thirsty - whether we were just sitting outside our room or by the pool. They also brought us olives and I got a free cocktail on one occasion! I know they're just little things but it's the little things that count! The concierge was very helpful in assisting us pick the right tour to do in the area and recommended some great places to eat and beaches to see. One day he arranged for a taxi to take us to Akumal beach and then a 'REAL' Mayan/Mexican restaurant on the way back - at such a cheap price we couldn't believe it - you would never get that in Australia! So to the staff - a VERY BIG THANK YOU! THE ROOM - The room/bathroom was very clean/modern and had a nice Caribbean feel about it. The king sized bed was really comfortable with massive and sleeping pillows which faced the cabinet housing a TV. Shower had 2 shower heads, a rainy one above or you could switch to a power head (good for when you're washing your hair!). Room was on the bottom floor which suited us as it close to the pool and bar and we had table/chairs just outside our patio door. Air conditioning is noisy but this didn't bother us as we passed out pretty easily of a night. LOCATION - Hotel is literally around the corner from the main 5th avenue where all the restaurants and bars are but far enough that you do not hear any noise of a night. We loved that we didn't have to walk far of a night after indulging in some good food and drink. It's probably a 5 min walk to the beach and a long enough walk that you're hot again after walking back but the pool took care of that. AMENITIES - Pool was great, when we stayed there were never that many people around so it was like we had it all to ourselves. The restaurant does basic but tasty food - it probably would be even better with a little more variety on the menu and I think the bar could be open longer but being so close to everything else, it was not a big deal.

My girlfriend and I originally booked 3 nights at the hotel as our plans were pretty fluid. The main thing that other reviews have highlighted is the excellent staff and welcoming atmosphere at the hotel. This was evident from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. This hotel really does have the best hotel staff I have ever encountered from the management, to receptionists, to night porters, to kitchen staff, chamber maids and so on. Everyone was so friendly. I really got the feeling that this was genuine too and not fake and part of the job! Over the period of my month stay I had the pleasure of experiencing a number of rooms. The fact that I moved half a dozen times was by no means the hotels fault, in fact quite the opposite, they always went out of their way to accommodate me when I decided to extend my trip again and again!! All of the rooms were very comfortable and quiet. I don't have a single complaint about any of them. Most days upon my return from an excursion or just the beach a new towel sculpture would invariably be waiting for me in my room cleverly made by the attentive housekeeping staff. The breakfast was fresh and tasty and included in my room rate. The staff at breakfast always greeted me with a smile and chit chat. I didn't eat at the hotel any other time so I can't comment on their lunch menu. In the lobby is a concierge service that can book your excursions, taxis, etc. They were super helpful when I had problems with my flight to New York caused by hurricane Irene and spent hours on the phone for me trying to contact my airline. After my girlfriend had to leave to return home for work another friend of mine came to visit for the week. His second day in Playa was his 30th birthday. I decided it would be fun to get him a traditional Mexican pi\u00f1ata. The hotel went out of their way to organise a small party, including cake and pi\u00f1ata. About 15 members of staff turned up to take part. My friend absolutely loved it! After my fifth or sixth extension (I forget) it was time to leave for New York. Annoyingly my bank decided at this point to stop my debit card, despite the fact that I had plenty of money in my account. To cut a long story short, this could have been a very stressful experience but again due to the professionalism of the hotel staff a solution was found that satisfied both parties. In case you haven\u2019t guessed I would not hesitate to return to Hacienda Paradise and would strongly advise anyone planning a trip to Playa to stay at the hotel.

The room was ready and we were located on the first floor. We were reluctant at first to be on the first floor, but we soon realized that we had direct access to the pool from our balcony. The room was very clean, with a comfortable bed,a nice size TV and mini fridge big enough for our many cans of beer. the bathroom was nice and spotless, but at certain specific hours of the day, we had to let the water run for about 5 minutes to get it warm enough, which was not a big deal to us. We had taken the breakfast plan and were mostly satisfied by the options available for breakfast. There was bread, fresh fruits salad, cold cuts, cheese and usually two warm breakfast options. It did get quite redundant after a week or so, so we ate out a couple of times. The pool was kept clean at all times and there were most often loungers available. The staff was always friendly and helpful. We left tip for the maid everyday and we'd find the room spotless everytime we came back from the beach. They even folded our clothes! The mamita's beach club itself is pretty close, with a walk of about ten minutes to get there. When we got there early (around 10 am) we'd get the umbrellas and loungers nearest to the beach, but even when we got there around noon, we'd never be without an umbrella. Mamita's is a beautiful beach for Mexico, and it is not rocky at all in comparison to lots of beaches around Playa. The hotel was close to many restaurants and bars on the 5th Avenue, but not right in the middle of the tourist area. Actually we found out quickly that the most interesting restaurants and barson the 5th were beyond the 20th street. We hung out at La Fe a lot for the cheap beer and nice vibe. Another good thing about being away from the most touristic area was the total absence of noises at night.

Also, on one of the days they decided that they are closing the pool for the whole day for cleaning without notifying the guests. This was very inconsiderate. The location is in the center, but it\u2019s 15 minute walk to the beach.

The cab driver dropped us in the wrong place somehow so we had to walk for 10 mins anyway (note to self - ensure you have the address clearly spelled out in large letters, it is quite simple!). We arrived a bit sweaty and tired and the guys behind the reception welcomed us with big smiles, a cold wet flannel and a cold drink. They also knew who we were which was a nice touch. We got a really thorough introduction to the hotel and it's facilities and then shown to our room which was luxurious in comparison to others we have stayed at on the Mexican coast this trip. The room was beautifully styled, mosquito proofed and had both a fan and air-conditioning which was very welcome. It also had a giant bed and a little balcony. Our price didn't include breakfast so we were given a BOGOF voucher for the first day which then tempted us to eat their breakfast the other 3 days as it was good value for money and quite a spread. Breads, cereals, fruit, eggs, mexican treats, Italian treats etc. The guys on the reception advised us where we could go on the beach to take advantage of discounted food and loungers / umbrellas, the beach was about 5 mins walk away. The hotel is located 3 streets back from the beach, 2 streets back from the beach is the main 'strip' which is a very long road packed with places to eat and shop so there is no shortage of options. It doesn't really have the feel of a caribbean hideaway - much more of a party town. My boyfriend wanted to go diving and the guys at the hotel arranged this for us which was fantastic, we got picked up and dropped off and he got two dives for $100 (US) I think. They also took me along in the bus so I had a new beachy paradise to sit on for the day (complete with bar/food/massage and floaty toy facilities if required). There are many things to recommend about this hotel, but the people were really exceptional, even chopping up coconuts and fruits my other half bought back late at night. They were very accommodating and made for a very memorable stay.

We did two tours with them: Chitchen Itza (\u00a333) and Tolum (\u00a355). Both were very interesting; however, remember that it takes about 4 hours each way to Chitchen Itza. Restaurant Breakfast was fine \u2013 typical continental breakfast (fruit, cereal, meat cheese, bread etc). My brother is vegan and they were happy to create different options for him as well. I didn\u2019t eat lunch or dinner here so can\u2019t comment on that. Room I had room 21 which had 2 double beds. The rooms were clean and tidy with effective air con and ceiling fan. The beds were a little on the hard side. I paid about \u00a355/night which included B&B. Staff Very friendly and helpful. Outside The main courtyard had a few sunbeds and a small/medium sized pool. I can imagine in summer that there are too few beds as we were stuck for one even in the quiet season. However, as the sun rarely appears in the courtyard due to the high surrounding buildings and trees so it\u2019s no great loss. Location The hotel is in an excellent location for the main amenities. Just 2 minutes walk and you\u2019re on the main street (5th) with all the restaurants and bars. It was early April and very quiet. Even in the main nightclub areas the main bars were fairly empty.

We stayed at Hacienda Paradise Boutique Hotel the entire time. We booked at HP after reading all the positive reviews and let ME be the one to tell you - OMG THEY WERE 110% right about E V E R Y T H I N G - except for the breakfast ;-P (I'll get to that at the end). OVERALL, this hotel & the staff is simply AMAZING! Best hotel stay ever. For the price we paid on Expedia.ca and the service we received, this hotel is TRULY a GEM - def better than some 5 star hotels we have stayed at elsewhere in other countries. I cannot imagine staying ANYWHERE ELSE IN Playa del Carmen except here!!! To K.I.S.S. here are the things we absolutely LOVED LOVE LOVED about HP: a - FREE wifi in the lobby AND hotel rooms, there are even 2 computers you can use in the lobby, you can even PRINT your boarding passes from here b - FREE cold, bottled water (500ml) at ANY TIME, day or night, just ask the lobby concierge. We abused this ridiculously because whenever we ate out at restaurants, the water was never free (always 15 - 20 pesos) which is not a lot of money but FREE is always better than non-free, so we took advantage of this MULTIPLES a day - esp on REALLY HOT days or before excusions c - FREE tea or coffee in lobby at any time of day - in Playa Del Carmen, tea can cost you between 20-30 pesos. We were on a tight budget, so saving money drinking free tea helped alot d - FREE beach towels to use at Mamita's beach club or wherever else you want to use them - we used them daily, especially for water activities/excursions e - DAILY room service & change of towels/linen as requested. The hotel is really \"green\" so they will only change towels if you leave them on the floor (that's the way you request towels to be changed). We are also \"green\" so we tried to to re-use towels at least 1 or 2x. But whenever we left them on the floor, our cleaning lady put fresh ones asap we never had to hunt her down for anything. f - AMAZING STAFF - OMG i have never felt so WELCOMED or like people actually cared about making your stay FANTASTIC than at this hotel >> JORGE \"Tours\" was simply great - he helped us book 2 of our excursions which were great, and at a discounted price. He also made really excellent recommendations re: restaurants that were not located on 5th Avenue, as we wanted to have the REAL Mexican experience i.e. EAT where the locals are eating. >> JUANITA \"Cleaning Lady\" was SOO NICE and smiling/helpful - she did a great job tidying our room daily, and it was a real treat to come back to our super clean hotel room at the end of a long day, and lay in a freshly made bed with the fluffed up pillows and cute towel animals she made EVERY day, always a different animal. >> DANIELA/ROBERTO \"Reception Staff\" -> again, really helpful in providing us daily beach towels and free bottles of water >> JORGE \"Kitchen\" he was always smiling/friendly at breakfast, and even made us specific egg dishes the 2nd day we got there as we were not fans of their scrambled eggs initially g - BEAUTIFUL ROOM, with all marble bathroom tiles/shower, tiled floors, huge super comfy kingsize bed - we requested a QUIET room facing 22 Norte on the 2nd floor which we got - the balcony overlooked the hotel's pool/courtyard area. JUSST BEAUTIFUL exactly like in the pictures you see posted - it really looks like that. h - GREAT LOCATION - a block away from the hustle & bustle of 5th Avenue, so you can get peace/rest at night and party like a rock star during the day :) The quietest rooms face 22 Norte. LAST.... there was only 1 thing we did NOT overly love about HP - their buffet-style breakfast. Now - they had scrambled eggs, fruit, yogurt, toast, ham, cheese, cereal, coffee/tea, some flan? or cake? we never tried, pancakes and last on SOME DAYS only french toast OR waffles OR crepes (but never all 3). The breakfast is 91 pesos/per person. It's not that the food didn't taste good - it was breakfast like any other place, you can't really go wrong with eggs / toast / cereal - however we felt the overall presentation was lacking in the sense that the food didn't beckon us or appear overwhelming appetizing. But more importantly - there were some staple breakfast food items that were sadly lacking e.g. BACON, SAUSAGE, HASH BROWN/POTATOES, NON-SCRAMBLED EGG CHOICES e.g. made to order omelettes, CROISSANTS, PASTRIES. The HP breakfast is a mixture, but more continental than good full English / American. We are Canadians - but I still like my full/American breakfast lol. We understand that for 91 pesos, you're not gonna get EVERYTHING. But we are really big breakfast people and have had GREAT breakfasts for roughly the same price elsewhere in Canada. Sadly due to sheer laziness we never had breakfast elsewhere except one day at Mayan Bistro across the street - the food was meh but the presentation was FABULOUS. Thus if you are huge on breakfast, I would encourage you to try some other breakfast spots in Playa e.g. Carboncitos, Mayan Bistro etc..

This review may be somewhat biased in that we spent our previous 6 nights in Tulum (we love Tulum!). The rooms, swimming pool, and internal courtyard are really nice. The rooms have 2 doubles or 1 true king-sized bed. With high ceilings, a quiet fan, a/c, TV, and an updated bathroom this hotel could and should be rated much higher. Unfortunately, we had some problems with our first room. Not only did it open up to the courtyard restaurant (see pictures) but there was a distinct vinegar smell in the bathroom when we checked in. Originally we thought they used vinegar as a base to clean the glass walls of the shower. But when the odor did not subside by the next day we spoke to Robert (the reception manager) about it. After inspecting the bathroom, he promised to investigate the problem and resolve it before we got back from Mamita's Beach Club that day. When we returned he offered us another room along the quieter corridor which fronts 22nd Street. This room is in a much better location and did not exhibit the rank odor. For the price, the nice rooms, and excellent (and quick) service provided by Robert we rank this hotel as very good but overall there are a few qualifications: - try to stay away from rooms #14, #15, and #17. Not only do they front busy 10th Avenue but in the morning when you open up your curtains, you are confronted by hotel guests eating their breakfast just yards away. - even in our 2nd room we noticed stains(?) on the floor which could have been easily cleaned with a good mopping (we even cleaned a few with a wet towel) but they were there our whole stay. This leads me to believe that hotel staff does not mop the floors on a daily basis. - finally, and this is not a problem with the hotel per se, but the peaceful inner courtyard is partially enclosed by a monstrosity called the Hotel Reina Roja. It is ugly and its 3 stories of netted balconies overlook the courtyard. To summarize, we would stay here again but only because the rooms and service are excellent. The cleanliness is the big issue we have. Hopefully this review will prompt management to take action on this as we would have otherwise rated this hotel much higher.

After just having staying at the Riu Palace of Americas (five start luxury) I did not want to set my expectations too high and be disappointed. Trip Advisor offered great traveler reviews and so I felt like even if this place was over rated - I still couldn't go wrong for the amazing price, location, wonderful breakfast by the pool! To be honest, I was so impressed with the service I don't think I'll ever go back to the All Inclusives again. I guess it all depends on what the purpose of your vacation is. If you are wanting to lay by the pool at a resort right on the beach and have servers bring you coctails and dress up to go to a fancy dinner or buffet everynight with low-budget shows - you may not like the boutique experience. HOWEVER if you are someone who feels independent in their travel, spends very little time in the room, wants a good location to come and go from while they go explore on their own - you will certainly love the difference. I must say, we were there 10 days and looked at other boutiques around Playa but none had the QUIET location a block off 5th ave that Hacienda did. The grounds around pool and breakfast patio were lovely, each room has a balcony facing pool. This place is only two stories so very small and intimate. Free internet and beach passes to SenSi beach club (NICE padded chairs). We had WONDERFUL bedding and pillows actually very comfortable for Mexico (usually have hard beds), We had a fridge in our room so could bring some beer back from Walmart to keep on hand. Our maid service was the best! We had a new towel art design waiting for us each day and we had fun leaving little surprises for them each morning along with our tip.

Part of the fun of a vacation is the research and preplanning related to various location and accommodation options. Hacienda Paradise caught my attention. A relatively small hotel, modestly priced, with an exceptionally large number of positive reviews. Every review seemed to emphasize staff quality and attentiveness. Reserving months ahead, in our case for 12 nights (basically nonrefundable if disappointed upon arrival), ups the ante on locating the right lodging. With the help of Trip Advisor and all of the frequently eloquent submissions, we nailed it! From the moment we first approached the reception desk until we were assisted with our bags out the door 12 days later we could not help but feel that the entire staff wished that we had a great stay and that any possible assistance be made available. As we daily passed reception, in the restaurant, and in the hallway with housekeeping, we were repeatedly asked if all was well and if there anything additional that could be done. We had a sense that the staff was almost hoping for a challenge, a problem, a need, so that they might swing into high gear and take care of it. I hesitate to make the following comment. This is like revealing a favorite hidden fishing hole on the internet. The Master Suite is a tremendous bargain. I'm not sure, but I believe there is only one. Upon entering it looked like the two rooms had been staged for an advertising photo shoot. Fresh flowers, fresh fruit, iced wine in the bucket, arranged china, red flower petals scattered over bed and hot tub. Excessive storage, great bath, a very private patio. The available pictures do not come close to doing justice. Wonderfully extravagant for two, perfect for three or a family with kids. Playa Mamitas is less than an eight minute leisurely stroll, more if you can't get your wife past Starbucks which is half way. The hotel offers discount coupons at Mamitas Beach Club, but we greatly prefer the adjacent Kool Beach Club. In our experience the staff is friendlier and more attentive, the wooden cushioned lounge chairs are superior, music is subdued and background versus intrusive. So, thank you to all that have previously commented on TA and helped us to find our way to the Hacienda Paradise Hotel and a sincere thank you to the staff and management for a great vacation in Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Albert, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLived up to all our expectations.\u201d", "Author": "LC531009", "ReviewID": "UR95304651", "Content": "My husband wanted to go somewhere warm for his 60 birthday in January, and after deciding that it should be Playa del Carmen, I went on Trip Advisor and started looking for accomodation.

Hacienda Paradise totally lived up to our expectations! It was a great experience from the moment we entered the doors and were greeted by Marco & Edgar. Our room was clean, comfortable and big enough for what we needed and a small fridge was included so we did put in a couple of things from we bought from Mega and ate these after a day that we were worn out from out trips. The hotel was very clean, the staff super friendly and we felt cared for all the time. The pool was great for us to sit beside - yes it was shaded but then we didn't want to be in the direct sun all the time. Our room had sun directly on our balcony from 10 -12 noon so we sould often sit there and read and have coffee. On my husband's birthday the chef, Jorge, baked a cake and a lot of the staff came to our room to present it to him and sing happy birthday - he was so pleased. The houskeeping staff also put out a cake mad of towels on the bed and then later that evening we went to a restauartn that the concierge, Jorge , had recommended (Casa del Agua) and had a great seafood dinner. Each morning our breakfast was available in the palapa and we so enjoyed that - a mixture of Canadian, Mexican with a little continetal thrown in. We felt safe to leave out things in our room even though there was a room safe. We did leave out our laptop and ereader but did put away our passports and extra money. the location was great. We were close enough to walk everywhere we went within Playa and again felt safe. The Beach was a short walk and we could get a discount coupon, at the hotel desk for a couple of different beach clubs which we took advantage of and greatly enjoyed. the ocean thee is so blue and beautiful!

The hotel is truly a boutique hotel: only 34 rooms and a staff which has the time and the desire to help you at every step of the way. We found that our room was quiet even though it had a window onto the busier Avenue 10. The beds were super comfortable; we slept like logs. The breakfast is good but not especially varied: eggs, toast, fruit and yogurt, good juice and good coffee comprised the centerpiece and there were often pancakes or Mexican variations (and occasionally desert pastries) to provide change. I at first took precautions to store my computer in the in-room safe provided, but after a few days of getting to know the staff it became obvious that all of our things were safe in the room so for the rest of our two weeks we never thought about it again. The location on 10th Avenue is, as most people have observed, very good, one block from 5th Avenue when you want to indulge in one of the pricier (pricier for Mexico anyway) restaurants and close to 30th if you want to walk to Mega to pick up some groceries or eat in one of the really affordable local restaurants. The only issue would be for those who wanted to spend time in the Hotel pool or in the sun chairs working on their tans with a drink close at hand. We were there in December and although we went into the attractive pool a few times it was, shall we say, bracing. Also in December and probably the rest of the winter months the sun is so low in the sky that it is blocked by the adjacent hotel and does not really invite to sunbathing. So if that is what you want then you are better off paying more for a hotel on the beach. There is one for example just 250 meters to the east of the Hacienda Paradise for which you will pay roughly 3 to 4 times more per night. Since that was not what we had come to Playa for we were quite content with the price trade-off. We did make the 10 minute trek to Mamita\u2019s beach club twice and although it was a little noisy you can find that same noise level at any beach at home. We also made the slightly longer walk to the other beach club, Wiki\u2019s, and found that a lot quieter. We were in the Master Suite and all I can see is that if the suite is available pay whatever it costs to get it: one extra room, two HD TVs, one DVD/CD player, a bar, a Jacuzzi, (but you have to feel a little bad about wasting all that water in Mexico so we only used it once) and a spacious balcony that, because it was on the second floor did get a couple hours of direct sun in the late morning and early afternoon.

Besides the baseline service, including free Internet, we got the breakfast and free coupons to the beach. By the way, the beach club they have an agreement with is probably the best in Playa. Indeed, it was the location of the Jazz Festival. The breakfast is fresh, very varied, and their espresso coffee is better than many I have had in Italy (and we are Italians). The chef is so genuinely dedicated to his work: once I asked for an apple, and it was presented in a big plate with a decoration all over the edge of the plate. Can you imagine?

Anyhow the hotel is an older property that has recently been remodeled and is very nice and modern. The property seems to be an old style Mexican hotel, however when adapted with marble and glass bathrooms, beautiful painted walls, nice comfortable beds and all the modern luxuries this hotel really does transform into a boutique 4 star hotel. Lets start with the the rooms, they are very clean and ours was completely insect free. The King Size bed with the pillows was great. The curtains block out a lot of the sun so you get a great night sleep and the bathroom amenities are perfect. The shower has a handhelp shower head as well as a rain spout. The bathrooms are small but complete. Because the hotel is older there can be a small odor of sewer that can come out of the shower, but they provide a plastic topper that will block out the odors in each shower. (this is just part of Mexican construction and is prevalent all over Mexico, even my house in Puerto Vallarta has this issue). Anyway, just close the door to the bathroom and it is NEVER a problem. The bathroom is beautiful and the room is great! The air-conditioning works well and each room has a fan over the bed as well. OVERALL: 10! The breakfast is complete as well, and if you get the room. make sure to get breakfast included as it is a good value. Daily there are eggs and bacon and sausage (hot dogs). Also there is Yogurt, cereal, waffles, fruit, breads, juices, water and usually a different Mexican option each day, sometimes quesadillas, sometimes, chilaquiles, black beans or tacos. If you are expecting American flavors you may be disappointed, but the breakfast is good and tastes good. Remember you are not in the USA. That said, the food is clean, and very tasty. And they also will make you an omelet, smoothie, cappucino, or mixed juice drink for a fee if you like (but the prices are very reasonable). The pool is small and in the pictures looks bigger, but it is very clean. If you are looking for a quick dip even at night, it is a great clean pool. If you book directly with the hotel they give you a pass for Mamitas beach club (valued at about $10) where you get two lounges and an umbrella. The beach is pristine and about 4 blocks from the hotel. The hotel will daily give you fresh and clean towels. Also parking on the street is not usually a problem if you rent a car. This way you can drive out to Tulum, or even the Cenote Azul (about 3 hours away towards Bacalar/Mahajual).

All of the staff were wonderful (friendly & helpful), the facilities were top-notch, and you couldn't beat the convenience. A short walk to 5th Avenue (the main tourist spot in town), an ATM in the lobby, and cheap taxis made it easy to enjoy our stay. The concierge even helped us get to a local movie theatre on short notice to see a U.S. movie (an experience you should do if you have some extra time - it was fun!). Highly recommended if you want a place to relax after hitting all the sights during the day. The concierge can arrange tours for you if you need them, too. One warning if you're new to Mexico...you're not supposed to flush toilet paper - that's what the little trash cans next to the toilets are for (there weren't any signs to warn us - but we knew from a previous hotel).", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pocatello, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNice end to our trip\u201d", "Author": "deepsnows", "ReviewID": "UR65220863", "Content": "We were relocated to the Hacienda Paradise from a sister property, the Playa del Karma.

Our experience over 8 days was exactly what we were after - low-key, lots of beach time, and just one excursion day. Let's start with the service philosophy. The staff got to know our names, always smiled and provided great, detailed service. We stayed up at the bar a couple of nights and Beppe made us some fantastic tropical drinks including the best mohito I've ever had. The hotel won't suit the all inclusive traveller - it caters for breakfast and Jorge the concierge can reccommend any restaurant or service you require. But it struck just the right balance between being taken care of (we love the towel art and fabulous shower swag), elegant simplicity, friendliness, and independence to make each day your own. The hotel is about 4 blocks removed from the beach and set back from the fun, boisterous 5th ave but manages to feel like a quiet getaway with it's inner courtyard with pool and hammock. There is a new big hotel called the hotel Rojea adjacent to to the courtyard which seems to be courting a hipster party crowd. Once or twice the music from their rooftop got a bit loud but the managers are working out a good neighbourly relationship to preserve the special quiet space that is the Hotel Hacienda. I'd m the hotel for sweethearts, solo travelers, or groups of 4-6 that want to get adjacent room and want a comfortable, really well priced home base for exploration. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you want a mega resort all inclusive experience with 37 pools a bunch of kids and an infinity experience. We would have loved an ocean view and butler service but that's not what this trip was about. You need to think about what you want out of the experience. It's called a \"boutique\" hotel but it's not trendy. We found the hotel to be a most engaging and intimate experience, based in simplicity.

I asked to be moved to the Calle 22 side which is much quieter. Within 10 minutes, my request was granted and I was moved to a quieter room facing the pool. My room rate included breakfast and passes to Mamitas every day. The dining area is next to the pool and serves a wonderful assortment of hot and cold breakfast items each morning. The dining room staff goes above and beyond to make sure you're taken care of while dining. It was a nice way to start the day. This hotel is very clean and very boutique-ish. There are all types of people who stay here - singles, couples, families, friends traveling in groups. I really enjoyed it. The beds are Serta Perfect Sleepers and are wonderful! This is a fairly quiet hotel. The dining room is open through the evening hours. I can't say enough about how well the staff treated me and the other guests. The only negative I encountered was the massage room. I had a morning massage scheduled and was caught off guard when we walked into a small, dark, stuffy room at the back of the property. It had two massage tables crammed in which were separated by a curtain and the entry door opened right into the room in full view of both tables. A woman walked into the room while I was getting a massage and set up her table. It was definitely not up to the standards of the rest of the hotel as far as cleanliness or the stylish rooms. My massage was great, but would have been much better had it been in a more suitable room. There is a wonderful grassy area out by the pool where they could do massages. Maybe they'll consider that for next year. PDC has grown tremendously over the past five years.

With breakfast included and daily passes to Mamita\u2019s, the hotel is a very good value. The staff was very competent and genuinely friendly (but not in an over syrupy sweet way you sometimes find at the bigger resorts). We stayed in a first floor room on Avenida 10 (the busier street), but unlike other reviewers, we were not bothered at all by the street noise. The air conditioner muffled any noise. The front desk offered to move us to a room on Calle 22 on our third day, but we decided to stay put in our original room on Avenida 10. The rooms were well laid out with plenty of storage. Housekeeping did a great job as well. Like others, we loved the towels shaped as animals and the rainfall shower. Hot water was plentiful (only once did we have to wait a few minutes for it to warm up). The walk to Mamita\u2019s is less than half a mile (0.4 miles to be exact; I measured it with my satellite GPS running watch). You have to watch for cars in a few places, but we enjoyed the walk. During Spring Break week, the crowd at Mamita's was young (mostly from Mexico and Europe). The music was a little loud, but we had fun and met some great young people from all over Mexico. Usually their English was far better than our broken Spanish. Unlike other popular Spring Break places, it wasn't a total drunk fest. The highlight of the hotel for both my husband and I was the little courtyard restaurant. Each morning after our run, we were treated to delicious fruit salads, granolas, and yogurts. There were plenty of hot dishes to choose from & the most amazing green tomato salsa. (Armando and Beppe were kind enough to tell us the ingredients.) The entire restaurant team was eager to please and improvise. One morning, I requested black beans. There were none to be had, but the next day and nearly every day after I received a small dish of black beans. Thanks Beppe and kitchen staff! Another morning, the hotel had run out of black tea, but Eber brought out a delicious cappuccino instead. I\u2019m normally not a coffee drinker, but I thoroughly enjoyed this special treat and very much appreciated the thoughtfulness of Eber. On our last evening, Beppe made us a series of yummy dishes that made for a delightful poolside dinner and dessert. Our favorite restaurants in the area were: 1) Las Cazueles on Calle 26th (a tiny Spanish sidewalk restaurant between Avenida 5 and 10 \u2013 very close to the hotel, delicious meals & tapas, and unbelievable prices), 2) Pizza Piola off Calle 38 and 3) Babe\u2019s Noodle Bar on Avenida 5 near 30th.

The maids learned what we were up to and shaped our towels into themes from our sports event - it was a really special personal touch. What set the hotel apart from many of the others we've experienced is that the staff had the capacity to solve problems for their clients without needing authorization from management. And they were willing and happy to do so. The hotel itself, like many others have said, is simple and in the middle of things and offers great value.

The reviews were more or less spot on, and I will reiterate some of the more salient points. Service The hotel prides themselves on service, and this comes across during your stay. This is not a 5 star hotel, but the intent is to be accommodating, which I find helpful when traveling abroad. The hotel appears to take feedback into account to improve their service. For example, when we checked in, the manager was clear to point out that the beach club was not included (per our reservation) and that there would be a charge of $5USD if we chose to use the service. This appeared to be in response to previous reviews where people were surprised at the charges on the final bill. A few other experiences worth noting: One day we mistakenly left a t-shirt in the beach towel deposit, and it was freshly washed and ready for us the next morning. One day the hot water in our shower ran out. We called the front desk at around 10pm, and they had it working by morning. The two free water bottles per day in your room are a very nice touch, and much needed for long days out in the sun. The hotel offers you fresh beach towels each morning (for use on or offsite), which was also very convenient. One afternoon the shampoo was not replenished, but when I went to inquire for an additional bottle I was brought 5. Prior to the trip we wrote the hotel to request a room on 22nd street. We were informed that all those rooms were booked by repeat customers, but when we checked in we were taken to one on 22nd street. The free computer terminals are helpful for planning day trips and reading up on restaurant reviews. If only the online check in for our airline had been working properly as well.... Noise We had no trouble with noise at night. I imagine you may hear more street traffic along 10th avenue, which is somewhat comparable to NY city street traffic (minus sirens). However, hotels along 5th avenue (between 1st and 32nd street) will have more noise due to heavy foot traffic/late night tourists. Breakfast We did not order the breakfast package with our reservation, so I am unable to comment. Pricing seemed in line with advertised breakfast menus along 5th avenue. Drinks Unexpectedly, the hotel bar had the best drinks we sampled during our trip. Margaritas in Playa in general were not very good; this one was more of a martini style and very strong. The pina coladas were very refreshing with fresh coconut mixed in, but more of lighter drink. El Bistro on 5th and 24th also had tasty fruit drinks (and a great value during happy hour), but for those looking for a strong margarita, the hotel bar is a good bet. Pool Area/Courtyard The courtyard/pool area is small but nice with lots of plants to give it a tropical feel. We especially enjoyed the view from our balcony, and the hammock by the pool is a nice touch. Given that the beach is 4 blocks away, we did not spend much time at the pool, but that is to be expected unless you are staying at a large resort. There are mosquitos/bugs on the property (and in Playa, in general), and I got bitten on a number of occasions (mostly foot area) while on hotel property, all of them at night and at times despite bug spray. However, my boyfriend did not get bitten at all (even without any spray), which is consistent with the mixed comments from reviewers. Finally, a rather obtrusive looking hotel has been built on the adjacent property (La Reina Roja), extending above the courtyard walls (the Hacienda property is L-shaped as opposed to completely enclosed). It would have been nice if the rooms that border the courtyard of the Hacienda Hotel had been painted a more neutral shade instead of a dark grey with industrial trim. Location Great location from which to explore Playa. Right off 5th avenue between the two main hot spots (8-14th streets and 24-30th streets). Short walk to the beach. We spent half our time in Playa and half exploring the Yucatan (cenotes, ruins, etc.), and found the hotel location to be a great base for exploring the area. Final Bill Be sure to review the final bill. We were mistakenly charged for a hotel breakfast, but this was removed after we disputed it. Additionally, the hotel charges a $2USD/day charity fee in partnership with a local charity. This is optional, but is presented on the final bill as standard charge (and not something entirely comfortable negotiating about at the end of the stay). The one thing that seemed strange in connection with the charge was that there was an additional sales tax associated with the charity fee (generally donations are don't have fees or taxes associated with them). The hotel does not match contributions on a dollar for dollar basis, but they apparently offer transportation services, etc., to the group. My recommendation would be for the hotel to have a dedicated web page/tab regarding their sponsorship, with a link to the organization's website for verification/additional research purposes. I would also recommend that they leave a copy of the final bill under the guest room door on the day of check out, which is standard at US hotels and helps you review/reconcile beforehand.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cPleasant but situated on a noisy street.\u201d", "Author": "NinaSeattle", "ReviewID": "UR59733226", "Content": "We just came back from a week long vacation in Playa Del Carmen.

When making my reservation I made it very clear that quiet/relaxed environment was the most important thing to us. Nevertheless, when we got there, we were put in the room that was located on the 10th. There was no option of changing rooms that night so we had to sleep in this room and it was REALLY noisy. The room had no privacy because the back door opened up to the courtyard where everyone gathers for breakfast. Fortunately, we were moved the following day to a quieter room with a lot more privacy.

My thoughts: - We took the ADO Bus from Cancun airport, which was painless and simple. BUT, be aware that as you walk out of the airport, you're going to be hounded by dozens of individuals attempting to get you to take their car/shuttle. Fight thru it and get to the end of the terminal where the ADO bus arrives. Once in Playa, simply hop into a cab and 10 pesos later you're at the front door of the hotel. - When booking, request a room on Calles 22 (the street on the north end of the building) OR something on the bottom floor of Av 10. I had requested this and unfortunately when we first arrived we were placed in a room on the second floor facing Av 10. The noise from cars driving past is very distracting and echos into the room. I didn't think it would bother me, but it was somewhat unbearable. - We asked the front desk to move us to a different room (citing the fact that I had emailed ahead of time and was told at the time that we were going to be on the first floor, on calles 22) and they were extremely accommodating and had us in a new room the next afternoon. What impressed me the most: we had forgotten our toiletries in the shower when gathering up our stuff for them to move while we went out to the beach, but they did not...they had them in the shower for us in the new room...AND they remembered to take the beer we had in the fridge and move that as well. :-) - If you're used to a little bit of walking, the location is not an issue at all; I actually preferred being on Av 10 versus Av 5 or on the beach. It's a short walk (5 blocks or so) to the Matimas beach club. The beach club was a great luxury, but I'd advise you to get there before 9:30 am...it seemed to quickly get crowded and the best spots taken. - Av 5 in the evening is fun to walk around; we didn't realize until our last morning that we never walked north of Calles 22, so I'm not sure what's up that way but there was definitely a lot of activity going south and there was never a feeling of being 'unsafe'. In first looking at a trip to Playa, I had concerns that there would be too much of a \"WHOO HOO SPRING BREAK 2010!!!!\" college-age/underage crowd (I'm 33, She's 25)...was relieved to find that it's more laid back and a nice mixture of age, though this may have been due in part to the time of year...I believe spring break for most American universities is later on this month. - We used the concierge desk to sign up for a snorkeling trip to Cozumel...not sure the name of the package, but they have a partnership with one company and it was amazing. They'll pick you up at the hotel, drive you to the ferry, have tickets for you to board and are waiting for you on the other side. The snorkeling was just right, not too long, and not too short. 35 minutes-ish at three different locations along the coast. The weather that day was a bit chilly...remember to bring beach towels with you to dry off. - Never bothered with the hotel pool; the area is quite shaded and since the temp never got above 82, it was a little on the cold side. If you're looking for a hotel with a nice hotel bar/restaurant/pool/several amenities...this place isn't for you. Definitely think of it as a boutique hotel. All in all, I'd say the positive reviews are accurate and the negative comments seem to be the exceptions to the norm.

You can do an all-inclusive, too often overpriced and \"vanilla\" and often a taxi drive to the town, or a condo which gives you all the amenities of home but with no helping hand whatsoever, a fancy hotel which charges you extra for everything, OR our choice: the Hacienda Paradise, a small, perfectly located hotel right in the heart of Playa del Carmen. We chose this property for many reasons. The reviewers on tripadvisor loved it, and they're usually right. I called direct to the hotel and had all my questions answered accurately and efficiently. By the time I got there, I already felt like part of the family, rare for a hotel these days. What we wanted was a hotel with breakfast, but not just any breakfast. A full breakfast served in a nice courtyard setting, complete with fresh fruit, yogurt, Mexican eggs (how do they make them so tasty?) and numerous other tempting offerings, plus some really good coffee. That's what we found. The staff is phenomenal, and both Giuseppe and Max make a really good espresso! (Just ask them.) No better way to start the day. So that's the plan. Have a filling breakfast. Explore the city on foot. Walk a couple of blocks to the Mamitas Beach Club (by 9am to assure an umbrella) with the free coupons from the hotel, for chair and umbrella rental, enjoy some of the most blue water you'll see anywhere, have a nice casual lunch in what seemed to be about 1000 different options, none too pretentious (see: Cancun), take an afternoon siesta back at the hotel on their plush bedding, enjoy their pristine bathrooms, minibar, and cable TV and AC. And did I mention the complimentary coffee, tea and FREE internet in the lobby? And if you want to bump it up one more notch, see if you can stay in their Master Suite, not much more than the cost of their regular room. Now your vacation becomes a 2-room suite with bar, large couch, double sized balcony, two large flat-screen TVs, a CD/DVD player, and IN-ROOM laptop computer, and as my wife put it, a bathroom \"to die for\", complete with a jacuzzi in its own separate space. We spent more time in the jacuzzi than the pool. That's how nice it was. Great staff, great deal, great location. They lent us umbrellas for the short short time it drizzled outside. They have a concierge right on the premises who'll arrange any excursions. Their airport transfers worked perfectly. They all speak English (and Spanish and Italian, and even some Dutch!). Everything is super clean. And yes, you'll get the rose petals on the beds, and the towel animals as well. The hotel knows we're all on vacation. They do their job, and they do it well.

Ahhhhhhhh!!!!! Clearly, our comfort was Leon's first priority. The business transaction of check-in could wait. This delightful first encounter set the tone for the rest of our four night stay at Hacienda Paradise. The hotel features a delicious and varied breakfast buffet each morning, which included fresh cut fruit, yogurt, choice of granolas, a variety of baked goods, cold cuts, cheese, a selection of hot items that changed daily such as scrambled eggs with ham, huevos rancheros, french toast, pancakes, etc. There was also orange or pineapple juice, coffee and tea, plus the staff could make cappuccino, espresso and other beverages to order. My reason for detailing the breakfast offerings is to respond, in a way, to the comment from the Winnipeg travelers that the breakfast was \"alright, but nothing to write home about.\" To the contrary, breakfast at Hacienda Paradise was fresh, varied and excellent. Moreover, lingering over coffee is encouraged and the guests never feel pressured to \"turn the table.\" Unlimited free high-speed internet access is available at two terminals in the lobby - a rare feature at a Riviera Maya resort.

FYI the Walmart & MegaMart do not take American Express US funds travellers cheques either as they did a few years back. You can cash them with proper ID for pesos at the Scotia Bank which is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel is very quiet which was good for us but the young people in our group would prefer it to be more lively.

We stayed at 2 hotels: the less expensive Hotel Hacienda Paradise and Secrets Maroma Beach (which I will review separately). Our idea was to book a less expensive, clean hotel, preferably offering at least breakfast for the first part of the trip so we could spend most of the day outside the hotel sightseeing, shopping, dining out and going on tours to the ruins and ecological parks. We didn't see the point in spending hundreds of dollars per day if we wouldn't be at the hotel most of the day. We just wanted a place to eat breakfast before starting the day, shower and sleep. Hotel Hacienda Paradise more than met our expectations for this purpose. Pro's: 1. Hacienda style breakfast every morning included in the daily rate, it offered more options than a continental breakfast and there were different things every day: scrambled eggs (prepared differently every day), toast, yogurt with granola, cereal assortment, mexican specialties, cold cuts and pastries. It was pretty good, nothing amazing. 2. Staff was friendly and helpful, always a plus! 3. Location- for us it was a good location because it was right next to Quinta Avenida, but not on it which would have been too noisy. We walked everywhere and it was very doable (believe me I'm lazy!). There's a large supermarket, lots of restaurants and shops, even a Wal-mart nearby. 4. Rooms, hotel lobby-The hotel itself is lovely, nicely decorated. It was noisy in the early evening but by bedtime it had quieted down and the noise was not a problem. The A/C temperature cannot be controlled so if you like for it be very cool ,it's not gonna happen. 5. Value for your money, you get what you pain for and I thought it was more than fair. Cons: 1. Breakfast was served at 7:30 at the earliest, which is fine, however most of the tour buses leave at 7:45 to 8 am , leaving you little time to have breakfast. This is minor but it was inconvenient for us. 2. Pool- It's small and kept clean, but the main issue is that it's in a very shaded area so the water is very cold. I did not see anyone get in the pool the whole time I was there (My husband and I never used it). 3. Cleanliness- The hotel and rooms were kept clean, however there were stains on the bedspreads and in the shower, which was very unappealing. 4. Beds/mattresses- These were on the hard side, not very comfortable to be honest. 5. Beach- Is not that close and not that impressive, we didn't care to much about this since we were staying at Secrets later on which has an amazing beach. However if this is the only hotel you're staying out and the beach is one the main reasons you're coming to Playa this is something to think about. Overall I think the good outweighed the bad and I would return to this hotel and recommend it to a friend for the same purpose we used it. Feel free to contact me with questions", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cAverage boutique hotel located much too far from the beach for my taste - C\u201d", "Author": "VegasPisces", "ReviewID": "UR56046049", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Hacienda Paradise Boutique Hotel for the Christmas/NYE holiday 2009/2010. Overall, the hotel wasn't bad, per se, but the vacation experience wasn't nearly as relaxing as we had hoped it would be. If you are planning on traveling to Playa del Carmen generally, and this hotel specifically, with small children, here are some personal observations that you may find helpful: 1. Playa del Carmen isn't very kid friendly. The only reason I even looked at traveling to this beach destination in Mexico is because it was so highly rated as a family destination in Trip Advisors \"Trip Ideas\" drop down on the main webpage. This region of the Mexican Riviera has many shops, bars and restaurants along the Avenida Qince (5th Avenue), which are great if you are traveling with teenagers or as a couple, but not really for younger children. Also, the main beach for the area is at least 6 blocks away from the hotel, which was quite a walk with little ones especially after a long day of playing in the waves. We didn't pack a stroller because we had so much other luggage, so it was a very long week of lugging around 3 yr old little boys! The beach itself is rather small and quickly becomes crowded. The vibe there was more like a night club, with loud music and people partying. Once again, I'm fine with this on my own and think that teens would love it, but it just isn't ideal for little ones. Finally, the beach club with which the hotel is affiliated, Mamasitas, was very frustrating. We booked the Master Suite at Hacienda Paradise, which came with access to the beach club. As such, we were given vouchers and towels on a daily basis. Nevertheless, when we arrived at the beach club each day, it was a huge hassle to secure our seats and umbrella, with even more headache when we tried to order food or drinks. This area of Mexico seems very popular with the locals, which was actually one of the reasons I was excited to go there, but that fact worked against us at the beach club, where we were treated like the less important guests. Overall, I would not recommend Playa del Carmen - at least outside of a non-inclusive - for a family traveling with small children. 2. The hotel itself was charming, but overall average - As I mentioned above, we booked the Master Suite for a week, which was great because it gave us some privacy when traveling with our little ones. The main room had a fold out couch/futon type bed that worked perfectly for our boys. They had a big flat screen tv and dvd player to watch all of their favorite videos, which was perfect. I thought that the a/c worked fine and didn't really have a problem with ambient noise, even though we were there during a very busy time. The Master Suite also has an in-room laptop, which was a little tough to figure out at first but overall very convenient. The included breakfast was pretty good - not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. The staff was genuinely friendly and the room was well cared for, with the housekeeping staff even decorating the room with balloons for the boys on NYE, which was a nice touch. The pool was very small and completely blocked from the sun due to its interior location, so we never stayed there instead opting daily for the trek down to the beach. It would have been nice to have the pool as an option. 3. If you do go with little ones, don't miss Dolphin Discovery! We booked a day trip there through the hotel and it was definitely the highlight of our visit. The kids asked to go back each day thereafter. Overall, I think my reservations about recommending this hotel have more to do with my disappointment in Playa del Carmen as a kid friendly destination than the hotel itself. Either way, I just didn't think that this venue had enough going for it to make it truly memorable. Even if I did go back to Playa, I would want to stay elsewhere as there were many hotels and condos closer to the beach than this one.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cPretty Sweet\u201d", "Author": "John_McAllister", "ReviewID": "UR55842624", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Hacienda Paradise and booked the Xperience package that is promoted on the hotel's website.

Just don't take the cooler to the beach club as it is not allowed. The staff were super friendly and went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one.

The staff was friendly and helpful, even before we'd arrived they had answered email questions. It was useful to have a copy of the rate and details when we checked in. Hacienda Paradise has a pleasant little lobby with 2 computers and bottled water and tea/coffee. The room we had, with 2 queens, was ground level with slider door access to the little breakfast area and pool area, which was very convenient. Not a huge room, but it did have a mini-bar and safe and a nice sized bathroom with glass-enclosed shower stall and 2 complimentary bottles of water a day. The beds are on the hard side, but not impossible. There is a remote controlled air conditioner and you can set the temperature on it - ask for extra blankets if you tend to get cold at night. The location is great - just one block off the walking street of 5th Ave, and I don't think I would have wanted to be on 5th Ave, since it is open late. The hotel has a nice little breakfast area with coffee, tea, juice, yogurt, granola, eggs, toast, cheese, etc.. You can order omelettes or smoothies, but they'll be extra. The small but quiet pool area is also in the central courtyard next to the breakfast area. The hotel has an arrangement with Mamita's Beach Club, so we were able to walk a short ways to 28th and down to the beach with towels from the hotel, and use vouchers for beach chairs and an umbrella once we got to Mamita's area. The sand and beach and water are beautiful! The thing that makes a difference at Hacienda is the quality of the staff - Guiseppe, Jorge, Beppe and others are genuinely nice and helpful. By the way, their sister hotels are Aqualuna and Karma, a few blocks away. We did spend one night at Aqualuna too, but it was convenient to have breakfast just out our door at Hacienda, rather than the short walk from Aqualuna.

We were on the ground floor and it was only a few steps to the lounge furniture around the pool. Many earlier comments have mentioned the construction issues with the adjoining hotel. Looks like things are improving as this hotel is nearing completion. However, there were still periods when power saw and hammering noise was distracting. From our observation the Manager of HP was attempting to deal with their 'neighbors' and resolve the issues as quickly as possible. It certainly isn't an easy situation. Having been to Playa several times before we spent probably more time at the hotel than most guests would. We ate a fair number of meals at the hotel besides the complimentary Hacienda Breakfast. From a number of lunches and one special evening dinner it's clear that many guests are missing the boat by eating most of their meals on 5th Avenue.

I think its because it is mostly shaded Cons: -When we first arrived the room was very HOT, and had a musty odor to it. The odor did subside mostly after the room cooled off. -There is construction during the day inside the hotel next door, so there is a constant loud noise of jack hammers and saws through out the day. I think this issue is through out Playa, for there was a lot of construction everywhere -The courtyard has A LOT of bugs and we each received over 20 bug bites each. I am not sure what they are, but they look like small gnats that leave extremely itchy bites like mesquitos and our bug spray did not work against them. Our room was right next to the courtyard, so a few would frequently get in the room as well. One day inside the lobby my husband saw a huge swarm of them by the computers. I do want to say that the hotel may have little control over this, someone mentioned all of the area were having problems with these bugs. - Some of the hotel staff spoke very little english. -The \"Free pass to Mamita's beach club\" Is not free, and we had trouble understanding our final bill because the staff at checkout did not speak english. -Housekeeping did not change the sheet at all. I had to ask for clean sheets and they got very itchy after a day or 2. - We left a tip for the housekeeping staff that was taken and the room was left uncleaned. They promptly cleaned the room after we notified them, but this made me feel very uneasy like someone just came in and stole it. We also felt bad for the maid that was made to clean, for I am sure she did not take the tip, so we went ahead and re-tipped her. I would suggest waiting til the last day to tip housekeeping. - Another issue we had was that they maid accidently threw away our tour ticket to Chichen Itza, which led to confusion and we were sent on the wrong bus. By the time they figured out we were with the wrong company and they took us back to the hotel, our real tour van had already left. It was our last day too so we did not get to go to Chichen Itza at all, (one of the main reasons we decided to go to the Rivera Maya).The concierge did refund our money for the tour along with about $10 extra also for us having to take a cab back from our van breaking down for another tour. I feel they could have compensated a little better, also with the fact that they told us at check in that the Beach passes were free, only to charge them to the bill later. I am really indifferent on whether or not I would reccomend this hotel. I guess I would say yes due to the fact that we booked the \"Xperince deal\" which saved us about $20 a night. If we had paid anymore than $80 a night I would probably not reccomend it, but for the price, it really wasn't that bad. I think alot of it was out of there control, and probably have the same issues at alot of the boutique hotels. I am glad we did not stay at a resort though, for alot of it was an adventure and the experience of being in a foreign country.

The most excellent Mamita's Beach Club and northern section of the beach (which MANY say is the best part of the beach) is only about 2 blocks away.

There was an in-room safe, fridge, excellent television, we couldn't have been happier. We were on the ground floor, so we only had to exit our patio door to get to the pool (nice pool for a relaxing swim in the evening). We only saw the pool being used one other time, yet we didn't even hear it until we opened our patio door. The front desk staff were wonderful. The 2 (yes two) free computers with internet access in the lobby were a god-send for keeping in touch with what was going on back home.

Everyday there was a great selection of food, and they started putting it out early (7:00-7:30a.m.) so we could always eat and then dash out to our day's activities.

Upon our arrive at the Hacienda Paradise we were impressed by the cleanliness of the lobby and the enthusiasm of the receptionist. We quickly checked in and were guided to our room. Just as the description on the website, we felt like the room was exactly as portrayed. The first night we stayed on the lower level and changed to an upper level room the following night. The was nothing wrong with the first room except we wanted to have the view from above. Everything in the room was clean and well cared for. Plenty of space to store clothes and a very comfortable firm bed. The bathroom has a shower only but it approx. 4' x 4' and has two shower heads for variety. The rooms are outfitted with plenty of lights and a decent air conditioner. Each morning we enjoyed the home cooked buffet that included eggs, delicious bread pudding, crepes, yogurt, cereal, plus a variety of fruits. There was also a great selection of coffee! The staff was detailed and mingled with the guest to make sure everything was to their satisfaction. This hotel is not large, I think about 30 rooms, so the hotel staff to guest ratio was great. We commented on how many people worked there paying attention to every detail possible. If you are new to Playa the concierge located in the lobby will help you book some of the great activities. During our stay there was some construction that was finishing up right next to this hotel. Originally we were concerned that this would disrupt our pool time but that was not the case. Most of the building that faces this hotel has been completed. The pool is small but nice. There is a lot of shade throughout the day around the pool so sun worshipers beware. Obviously the beautiful beaches are better for sunning and enjoying people watching. If you are looking for a quiet place to stay away from the 5th ave. noise, this place will certainly accommodate you. It's very close to the beach and all the shopping you can want. We rented a scooter from American Car Rental [--] located on 26th and 5th avenue near Starbucks.. For about $25 per day and minimal gas you can cruise around Playa and points beyond. Just be careful not to go to far north of the resort area in some of the poorer area's since it's not safe. If you are looking for an inexpensive massage, try Veronica's on 5th and 20th. For $29 per hour they will give you a great massage with a very clean environment. We did a couples massage that had adjoined rooms. Another spa is Spa Itza. We have been there two years straight and enjoy the staff and sunning on the roof top deck that has open showers, steam room, and sauna. We will certainly stay again at the Hacienda Paradise Hotel on our next stay in 2010. The price was a bit less than the other hotels we have stayed at and provided superior service.

You could do a lot worse than this place and I doubt anyone would regret staying here, but it just did not provide the sort of colonial charm that the word \"hacienda\" conjures up. There were other slightly weird aspects that did not detract from our visit but might annoy others - the hotel is nicely finished but the location of the air-conditioning in the room means that it is not wholly effective and takes a while to cool the room down. In our bathroom, both of the taps in the hand basin were hot water taps. The television reception is not great and there aren't many english channels. There was no access to powerpoints on one side of the bed (sounds harmless unless you have a sleep machine or similar). You don't have to pay for bottled water replaced in the bathroom but you do for water replaced in the living room. Finally the staff, whilst all very friendly and helpful, have a slightly vacant air to them, like they are talking to the person behind you. This sort of thing would usually go unnoticed, except the hotel presents itself as a luxury hotel, which leaves you scratching your head a little. None of this, of course seriously detracted from our stay and you can expect to have a pleasant time here, without being bowled over by an incredible experience.

Yes, there is construction going on next door (and everywhere else in Playa!) however, the only time I heard slight noise is when I was using the pool during the day (about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Nothing out of the ordinary or unbearable.

Each suite room had its own flat screen t.v. and we even had a mini computer with complimentary internet use. We had everything we needed and more! We were welcomed with a fruit basket in our room and delicious exotic teas. The toiletries smelled wonderful and did wonders for my hair. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The hotel is small and quiet and the pool is perfect for a dip after a long walk and sunbathing. It was usually empty or we only had to share it with maybe 2 more people. I must say that the staff was very helpful and friendly. We wanted to visit Tulum but wanted to drive ourselves and Aurea, one of the staff members was able to get us a good deal on a rental car and a trip to/from the car rental place. Anything we needed, they were readily available to work with us. The hotel is run in a very relaxed manner. We arrived very early and were able to check in right away, without issues. The checkout too was quick and simple. This was our first time in Playa so we had quite a few questions. The staff was always very helpful and willing to share insights with us. The staff seemed happy to be there. They joked with each other and us (in a professional manner) and were always smiling. Mamita\u2019s Beach club was heavenly. We usually got there in the afternoon so we only got the back row chairs/umbrellas but it was great. The hotel has vouchers that will save you some money otherwise, beach chairs are 30 pesos each and thatch roof umbrellas are also 30 pesos.

Giuseppe seemed to be a fairly busy man, but always made time to stop and say hello and ask how the stay was going. And of course, I can definitely appreciate that. The rooms were filled with nice, but large furniture. The beds were extremely comfortable, which you probably know, reading other hotel reviews. A soft bed is difficult to come by in Mexico! Great bathrooms and yes, once I figured out how to turn on the AC, nice cool evenings encouraged a great nights sleep. Friends of ours canceled at the last minute and jokingly we asked Giuseppe for an upgrade since they've already paid. Well, he let us have the master suite one night since it wasn't booked. Yes, as a second room. It was VERY nice. Thank you Giuseppe!!! The pool was larger than I had thought since there were so many reviews that said it was tiny. It's not huge by any means, but you certainly won't hit the other side if you dive in! There is a bigger boutique hotel going up right next door so you see that from the pool but it wasn't a hassle to us at all.

I found out the hard way, ouch! ) As for the \"noise\"... well you're IN playa.. so yes, you MIGHT hear an occassional car drive by, but it was by no means too much to handle. There's a cafe type area that serves a continental breakfast, nothing fancy, but it'll do the trick, especially for me, since I don't really \"do\" breakfast.

Greeted with fresh cold towels and bags taken to our room in a zip, we were given a quick tour of the intimate garden with a small but sparkling pool and comfortable lounge chairs decorated with fresh towels and flowers on each chair. Our room, as requested for my teenage niece and myself, had two double beds made in all white over-the-top thread count sheets with duvets and pillows galore. Everything in the room was brand new, from the wall mounted flat screen to the generously sized mini fridge and the bathroom with glass-doored shower, a real blowdryer, and luxurious organic bath amenities - shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soaps. Fresh bottled waters for teethbrushing was included and refreshed daily. We enjoyed Mamitas Beach Club - so close to stroll to -and the discount and prepayment option provided by Hacienda Paradise was fabulous. We also experienced a smaller beach away from the action of Mamitas one day and enjoyed this as well. We loved being so close to Fifth Avenue and the shopping and restaurants, beach, etc. yet a bit removed from the frenzy and noise. We enjoyed quick dips in the pool after beach and after an evening of shopping and dining. Although Playa was very hot during our stay, we found our air conditioning kept us very cool when in the room and while sleeping. Showers were a joy with the huge rainshower shower heads and the additional hand shower option, and lots of hot water. Breakfast was delicious - french toast, a choice of two Mexican egg dishes, many choices of yogurt and cereals, fresh juices, delicious coffee, various breakfast cakes, etc and very well presented in the outdoor shaded area adjacent the pool. While there is obvious construction adjacent the hotel, we did not experience any problem with the noise. There is construction all over Playa right now so it would be difficult to stay in any of the small hotels in town and not be near noise from construction, and any construction noise we heard is much less than that of the Fifth Avenue if your hotel is right on the Avenue I had two massages in the small, tranquil massage space in the hotel for the amazing price of $35 for an hour from a professional and holistically oriented massage therapist.

It also has free buffet breakfast, which is a huge bonus. It is only a block away from Quinta Avenida, which is great if your idea of fun is hanging out in a US-style outdoor mall in Mexico. While this review is meant to plug Hacienda Paradise, you should know what you're getting into if you go to Playa del Carmen: drunk frat boys and sorority girls, American chain stores (Starbucks!), horribly overpriced restaurants, crowds, noise, Senor Frogs, traffic, \"exclusive\" beach clubs that charge you up the nose for a beach chair. If a relaxing beach vacation is what you want, go to Tulum or Puerto Moruelos. If you're looking for a \"European\" crowd, go to Spain. This place is full of rich, obnoxious, drunk Americans looking to get wasted and laid. There are much cooler parts of town further from the beach, but they don't redeem this town at all, which has been totally ruined by American-style consumerism.

Well manged (Guiseppe does a great job making guests feel welcome and invited). The rooms themselves were clean (biggest concern always for my wife!! - she's a neat freak so when she says something is clean - it's clean). The room we stayed on had sliding doors to a small patio area on teh ground floor. I didn't see the high level rooms (floors two and three, but they all had sliding doors and a nice terrace). Don't worry about the noise, there is some construction going on, but we barely heard a knock - you don't spend so much time in teh room since you are at the beach, walking around 5th or on an excursion which the consierage (Christian) is great at helping to plan.

It is one block from Avenida Cinco, the main--traffic free--walking concourse. It is therefore 1 block from many restaraunts and 2 blocks from a Starbucks. The hotel is very nice and comfortable and considering the price this place is a steal. For example, whereas one of the local travel tour business offices wanted to charge us 110$ for a cab back to Cancun airport this hotel staff arranged it for 50$, less than half of that price. It was very comfortable and the king sized bed may be the largest bed we ever slept in. Directly above the bed was a fan which we kept running all night.
