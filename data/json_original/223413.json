Courtious and helpful staff. It is located on the bay side of main street, but short walk to the beach. The breakfast meal is a winner, unless you want a formal breakfast. The room was clean. There was a minor problem with the tub drain, but was tolerable. I think they have a smokers section, so smoke does not spew into other area. We'll likely stay here again. Oh, the community park located behind the inn is great for running, biking, or walking. Sit on the benches, watch the ducks, or the crabbers along the extended walking deck to the bay area. (My wife and I did not like the italian restruant located behind the Inn), but this was several years ago...cups, utensels, found its way in the artificial greenery and left there, next to the tables.

It was pretty much the last available room in the ocean city vicinity that weekend. Thank goodness we found this hotel! Hotel: We stayed in a suite (2 queen beds, a sofa bed). The room was clean and spacious enough for all of us to not feel overcrowded. The staff was great and extremely helpful and pleasant. The pool was nice. Indoor pool was a little small (but good to have) and the outdoor pool was great. Breakfast buffet was awesome, the only thing about it is that the line gets very long. (Get there early!) Surrounding Location: There is a park area behind the hotel which has a pier for fishing and a great park for children. There was also some baseball going on in the two fields they have. A path about a mile or so around the park is available for running or biking which was a plus. There are great restaurants in the area and convenient stores for snacks and such. The beach is across the street which is great. Quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk. Speaking of the boardwalk the bus stops right in front of the hotel to go to the boardwalk ($1 each way or $3 all day pass). However, the ride is about 45 mins to an hr long on the bus with all the stops. But it beats parking if you can't find cheap/free parking. Casino is about 10-15 mins away driving. Overall it was a great time with many benefits even though it is not right on the boardwalk.

You are parallel to the beach so it's not far to go across the street obviously but the main action of the boardwalk is far. This hotel is located near 126th street... yes, there are shops all around for miles down the main drag, lots of mini golf, different restaurants and stores near the hotel, it's not in the middle of nowhere by any means but we wanted to be at least closer to the action than we were. When we got there we had no idea just how far we were... we asked how far of a walk it was to the boardwalk and they just said to take the bus, which is what we did, but we got off too early, at around 25th street or so? We had to walk for SEVERAL more blocks to get to the main area and it was HOTTTTT!!!!!!!! so yeah that made for a miserable day. Just keep in mind that the main area of the boardwalk starts at around 5th street and goes down to 1st then there's a few more blocks after that. We drove a lot after that 1st day and were able to find lots of free parking spots on the street (if you got there early enough - 10,11am) that didn't require too much walking. The closer you get to Ripleys Believe it or Not, the more you'll have to pay to park so I would recommend parking around 5th/6th/7th street for free and walking a bit. Or you can take the bus but the bus takes long and makes a lot of stops, esp when you're starting at 126th street!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cI dont recommend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Osageo", "ReviewID": "UR138725928", "Content": "I read a lot of reviews about this hotel.... I am not sure weather I had bad luck in this hotel or the reviews are just complements. We had booked this hotel before we went.

The reciptionest was not so gentle and she asked us to decied weather we were going to stay in this room or we didn't like it, and in the last case we have to stay one night at the hotel. She left us 5 minutes to decied as that was a high season and there are lot of people waiting for an empty room. We decieded to stay one night ,this is also because the hotel is not on the beach. You have to cross the road with your swimming suit to get there. Finally, we found other better hotel, of course with higher price as we were looking foor immediate booking. The other hotel was much better, first row one, and there were many rooms available there. I think the hotel staff need to know how to deal with guests first. You will discover this easily when you go there. I truely describe what has happened with us there. And honestly, as I will never go there again, I don't recommend it to the reader.

It is a later-generation hotel, with fresh decor and very clean in room, hallway, and lobby/breakfast area. Located on the Bay side of the Coastal Highway on the northern fringe of Ocean City in an area where there are mostly private condos, upscale properties and only a few other hotels;it is several miles from the boardwalk (an asset if you prefer a quieter area) but it's on the \"beach bus\" route if you want to make a trip downtown. You have to cross the highway to reach the beach but the intersection has a traffic light and working crosswalk buttons. Just behind the hotel is the very nice Northside Park. There are sit-down restaurants (seafood, Italian, steak) and cheap eats (subs, wings, pizza) all within a block on the same side of the highway as the hotel, plus a dollar store, groceries, etc. The room was very clean including corners, linens, and bathroom. The bath was a modern one-piece type (no grout to get icky) with a safety-handhold bar, and it was sparkling clean except for a bit of hard water build-up underneath the whirlpool jets. Room a comfortable size, nice flat screen TV and all appliances (hairdryer, fridge, microwave) clean and in working order. Bed comfortable with a variety of pillow \"firmnesses\" but I always bring my own for my neck problems. No sign of vermin.They did a good job of cleaning up the inevitable tracked-in sand with one exception: the elevator carpeting needed attention. The room was quiet and so were the guests when I was there. It is family friendly. I spent my time at the beach, but the outdoor pool looked nice; staff kept it cleared of sand. Service was friendly. The complimentary breakfast had enough variety so that you could try different things on different mornings. It included cereals, yogurts, muffins/pastries/bagels/toast, scrambled eggs, meat (sausage patties or bacon on different days), biscuits and sausage gravy (a Southern dish), and a pancake-making machine (the pancakes are so-so but fun to make.) Plus surprisingly decent coffee/decaf and the usual breakfast juices. As noted by other reviewers it is best to get to the breakfast early (before 8:30) to avoid the rush.

The Holiday Inn Express lives up to the tripadvisor member reviews (Thanks!). From the time we arrived, until our departure (days later), the hotel property and staff exceeded our expectations! LOCATION - The property is located in northern Ocean City, where there are plenty of dining options and multiple grocery stores (Food Lion, Super Fresh, etc...) to grab groceries and snacks. The beach is a short walk, and the distance to the ocean water is much shorter than the southern end of OC, where the beach is about three times as deep. The hotel also backs to Northside Park, which offers open space and activities on the bay side of Ocean City. ROOMS - Our room was clean and spacious. We had a suite with two double beds and a sleeper sofa. The room had a sizable mini-frig, microwave, pantry cabinets, and small sink. The beds included soft and firm pillows, labeled accordingly. The beds were soft. The A/C worked great - no problems at all with climate control! COMMON AREAS - The hotel property and common areas were well maintained. The pools were kept very clean, and the lounge chairs and tables were cleaned and organized daily. The outdoor pool is large and ranges from three feet to five feet in depth. BREAKFAST - Breakfast was included. Wow, what a treat, from a food and service standpoint! Their breakfast staff provided top-notch service (keeping the foods and drinks stocked throughout the breakfast time period) and the food quality and variety were great for a Holiday Inn. Breakfast items included - orange juice, apple juice, milk, coffee, tea; scrambled eggs or cheese omelets, bacon (crispy!) or sausage or Canadian bacon; pancakes, biscuits and gravy, hard boiled eggs; muffins, bagels, toast; cereals; and yogurts. The dining area was kept very clean and included flat screen televisions to catch-up on news, sports, and weather forecasts. The pancake making machine was a big hit with my kids... you push a button and out pops two freshly made pancakes! STAFF - All of the staff that we encountered were polite, accommodating, and focused on customer service. MISCELLANEOUS - Lots of free parking. They have a massive parking lot that extends around the entire building, as well as parking on the streets.

Not having previously been to Ocean City and knowing nothing about how the strip was situated we had a hard time making a decision, but we chose the less expensive option and took our chances. Well, we were certainly not disappointed. Even though this hotel is not ocean front, it is a very short walk away from the beach. Just cross a parking lot, cross the Coastal Highway (which is easier than you may initially think) and down a short road right onto the beach. Even though this hotel is 15 miles away from the boardwalk, it was easy as can be to drive down to the boardwalk, find a parking spot and spend the day walking around. And there are many restaurants and attractions very close by. The rooms were a good size, with two double beds and a pull out couch. They were clean. The staff was extremely friendly. And the free continental breakfast was fabulous!! Scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, muffins -- not what you expect a typical continental breakfast to be and this saved us both money and time. Most of our days we drove to the beach on Assateague Island so not spending the extra money on something ocean front was a good decision for us. Directly behind this hotel, on the bay side, is a nice park with a playground. One word of advice,however, park in the parking lot behind the hotel because when there is a bad rain storm, the front parking lot floods so badly that they have to pump water out of people's cars. This isn't unique to the hotel. The whole strip was flooded one day when we were there and there was a lot of rain.

I guess it didn't behoove them to call me and let me know. The first night I had to sleep uncovered without a pillow. What a horrible night of (non) sleep. I had to go buy a pillow from a store. Other issues... I was on the fifth floor during my stay. (of 5 floors). They had no A/C in my floor (not the rooms but the hallway). It was very HOT during my stay. (95+). Since the hallways had no A/C, it was super hot. So, in the afternoon after the beach, I'd come to my room, shower and get dressed to go out. By the time we go to the lobby we were drenched in sweat.

It was just a wall dividing a small couch on the other side of the wall and ONE TV what a drag. But because it was only going to be for one night, we decided to stay. The beds were very cozy and the hotel room was clean and I could not complain about that. The hotel was quiet and we slept fine. The breakfast in the morning was just what was described in previous reviews with a large selection which was a plus to staying here. Another negative I personally did not like is in the bathroom they have a sign implying that if you steal a towel, wash cloth or what ever your bill will be charged for it. Although I do not think this is a bad policy, as hotels are stolen from all the time, I thought it would have been more tasteful had they put that information in the check in paperwork so that each guest would understand that.

The kids loved the hotel and have been bugging us to go back. More on the hotel later... The hotel is ideally situated near restaurants and within easy walking distance of a grocery store. The beach is across the street. There are around 30 free parking places right next to the beach entrance. There is also a crosswalk with crosswalk light that gives families plenty of time to safely cross the street. The beach was nice though the water was somewhat rough (watch after the kids big time). There were lifeguards up and down the beach. The hotel had two pools: indoor pool with a depth from 3 to 3.5 feet and an outdoor pool with a depth from 3 to 5 feet. My oldest son is slightly taller than 3.5 feet which presented a problem in both pools. He loved walking around in both, but I had to keep him away from the deeper water. If the inside pool had been kept at 3 feet, it would have been ideal. I believe the pools are open until 10 pm which was more than adequate. Behind the hotel is a park with baseball fields, walking path, and PLAYGROUND. The kids loved the playground which had a small and large kid section. The pattern for our stay was beach, playground, pool, and sleep. We occasionally had slight troubles with noisy neighbors. We tried to compensate by keeping the AC on the whole time but the unit did not have a \"fan always on\" button which meant it cut on and off the whole night. Fortunately, the neighbors quieted down by about 10:30 or so. Next time we spend any time at any hotel, we're going to bring our white noise machines. Lastly, the hotel had a better than average complementary breakfast which included hot items as well as the standard pastry/cereal selections. The hotel rotated their offerings which was nice. Our oldest had a small scare with one of the muffins which contained nuts (he's allergic to nuts). Fortunately, his one bite didn't affect him and the staff put up a sign indicating that nuts and or nut traces are in the muffins. We had one depressing event happen at the hotel. My wife's jewelry was stolen (probably). It is still being investigated. The moral of the story is to never leave valuable items in your hotel room unless it is locked up though with 3 small children that's easier said than done.

Also, in the bathroom, there were little bottles of shampoo and conditioner, but no little lotions or shower caps, etc. Not a big deal, but I always think that a basket of extra stuff is a nice touch. The continental breakfast was good. There were cinammon buns (kids loved those), bacon, eggs, English Muffins, bananas, coffee, juice, milk, cereal, and oatmeal. I'm sure there a couple of other things, but it escapes me right now. There weren't any waffles or anything like that--just enough to get you going and that was good enough for my family. The breakfast area was clean and it was restocked often. The area itself was a little tight though--the tables and chairs were very close to other tables and chairs. Just a little tight, nothing horrid, but just to let you know! Also, on our way out of the breakfast area, there was a tiered basket to the left with free newspapers in it (might be for travelers during the weekdays, I'm not sure). Parking--not a problem. We never had to park behind or on the side of the building. We always parked right in front and everything was well lit.

I had chosen this hotel for its great price and close location to the beach. We arrived in Ocean City a few hours before our check-in time and were exhausted (we had driven through the night from West Virginia). The hotel staff and desk clerks were INCREDIBLY accomodating and even gave us an upgrade to a room on the 3rd floor with a king-size bed and a jacuzzi tub- because we slept in our truck in the parking lot for those few hours while the room was cleaned. I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the room All Holiday Inn Expresses with the new bed linens are fantastc. No gross bed-spread- only crisp clean white sheets and pillowcases. My only complaint about the room would be the jacuzzi tub. It didn't look very clean around the jets with that brownish yuckiness that some tubs get that haven't been thouroughly cleaned. I didn't plan on using it though- so it wasn't much af a bother. Oh- if you are thinking about springing the extra cash for an upgrade to KIng size/jacuzzi room- you may want to rethink it. The tub is very small. Not much room for one person relaxing- definelty not two. The bed is HUGE though. Very comfortable. The pool area is fairly clean. Both the indoor and outdoor pools were usually very crowded- which is to be expected at a family hotel like this. Our room was above the outdoor pool- which was kind of strange because many times I would open the curtains and find lots of people looking up into my window. We also noticed some trash/clothes/towels in the water before the pool opened in the morning- but they were cleaned up before the area was opened. Another drawback to the hotel was the fact that there were absolutly no balconies. It really took away from the \"beach feeling\", and it made it hard to dry out our beach towels! My boyfriend and I didn't have a problem walking across the 4-lane road to the baech, but I wouldn't attempt it with a family & all their beach gear. We actually packed up the truck with our stuff and drove over a few times. There is free parking (first come first serve) right next to the dunes, which makes it really nice for carrying stuff- expecially if its 90 degrees+ and you are the color of a cooked lobster! (sunburn=PAIN) The hotel is within walking distance of a nice steak/seafood house (Blue Ox), a medical care building, one of those sovenier shops, and the Prune! A must visit donut shop. There is a HUGE park behind the hotel. We saw lots of walkers, dogs, kids riding bikes, runners, soccer games...lots of other activities too. There were police patroling in cruisers throughout the night. I felt pretty safe leaving our vehicle on the opposite side of the hotel than our room. One of the best parts about any Holiday Inn Express is the breakfast- more importantly the cinnamon rolls. SO DELICIOUS!! I don't think that I will stay here again- but only because I wanted a diferent kind of experience when I'm on vacation. I would rather be on the beach than a block away.

If you wish to take in the boardwalk, there is a bus system that runs the length of Ocean City 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For $2, you can use the system for the entire day. Certainly a bargain.

We booked a Standard Room and requested non-Smoking. Upon arrival we were told we were booked into a King Suite (one King and one pull out sofa) and it was a smoking room that they had placed an ionizer into. We asked to see the room - it wasn't very large and still smelled of smoke. We went back to the desk and complained, and they \"found\" a non-smoking King Suite like the one we saw, on the third floor. The pullout couch was too small to reasonably sleep two people unless they're really small kids, so we asked for a roll-away. They gave us one at no charge, and said they normally charge $15 per night for it. It isn't that good, but our 10-year old could sleep on it alright. The rooms aren't that big and the \"kitchenette\" is really just a very small sink with a smaller refrigerator underneath, and one double-cabinet about 15\" high above the sink, with a microwave mounted underneath. Comes with a coffee maker but not a toaster. The lack of a balcony or window that opens makes the room claustrophobic. Cleanliness is pretty good overall, with the usual slight dust visibility around the perimeter of the room. There was plenty of dust behind the TV. The king bed is comfortable, but not the pullout sofa or rollaway bed. The bathroom is average sized for a cheaper hotel. When the staff gave us this room, they reminded us that it was an \"upgrade\" to have jets in the tub, but the jets have a lot of black sludge/mold in them and I wouldn't get in the tub and use the jets. The outdoor pool is larger than most, about 5 feet deep at its deepest, and seems fairly clean, we saw someone cleaning it most days. The indoor pool seemed murkier, and is smaller and only 3-1/2 feet deep. There's a hot tub with the indoor pool, and the heat was up but the jets were broken for our entire stay. The chaise lounges and tables use the standard plastic, but they were fine, didn't see any broken. There's plenty of parking on the side and back of the hotel, but the front is completely crowded with the Blue Ox restaurant in front and the \"Olive Tree\" restaurant on the left side of the hotel - there's no sense that the hotel has any of its own \"grounds\" to speak of. There is the Northside Park across from the back of the hotel, a pretty nice park overall. The breakfast is pretty basic - 4 cereals, bagels, tasteless english muffins, other mini muffins, the cinnamon rolls which were good but kind of heavy, one or two fruits - oranges, apples, bananas that were generally way too green, and coffee/tea and orange and apple juice. The women who work the breakfast really hustle and keep everything full, but it's all gone by the published 10:30 a.m. end time. The walk to the beach is pretty easy across coastal highway, there's beach access directly across from the hotel at 127th street. Overall, I wouldn't stay here with 4 people unless you are assured of two queen beds and the parties sharing the beds can get along in them - a problem for our two boys.

With a 7 year old. From everything I heard, it would be a way to get a slice of classic Americana beach/boardwalk experience. I chose this hotel because it had the best prices at the time I was looking, and practically everything else was totally booked. I was a bit wary because of the distance from the boardwalk and the fact that it is an Express, but I was pleasantly surprised. It can't be beat for the 4th of July if you have small kids and want a hassle-free 4th of July experience. The hotel is across the street from the beach. Up past the 100s, the beach is very nice and not crowded, so we didn't mind not being near the boardwalk a day or two since we were planning on visiting that area specifically anyway. Past the 100s seems to be a swankier part of town anyway. The hotel lobby and common areas are clean and inviting. The staff is nice. We didn't use the indoor pool because we used the outdoor one. It was in very good condition for a pool at a hotel near the beach, with very refreshing, cool, and clean water. It is bigger than many of the hotel pools and kind of kidney shaped rather than oblong. There were nice tables with umbrellas and lounge chairs around it. The only detraction was the maid service. The first day, our person never came to clean the room even though an envelope in our room identified her by name, and we left her what we thought was a good tip/incentive (also untouched). We had to report this and then they got someone in to clean the room within 5 minutes. We later noticed that this backup person didn't take away our old towels, though she did leave new ones. She forgot to leave us new shampoo and conditioner. The next day, our beds were made but the bathrooms were never really cleaned, they just left new towels and other stuff. I don't know if this was the hotel policy because it's a beach hotel where they get overwhelmed with constantly cleaning up sand and so have decided to just leave towels and tidy but not do the floors. It was a little annoying, but I felt like if that was the case, I kind of understood, because we were continually trooping sand in, and at least they were leaving new towels, cups, ice bags, etc., each time. The room was otherwise pleasant, with a little sitting area with a loveseat, coffee table, fridge, and microwave. I agree that the free breakfast never varied, which was a bit tiresome, but that could be easily remedied if they offered yogurt cups and cut fruit to break up the bready theme. On the other hand, if one took the time, one could vary it each day. I think most people are on their way out and rush and grab the mini muffins and cinnamon rolls. One could sit and have a bagel and cream cheese and a boiled egg one day or a bowl of cereal and create some variety. And hey, it's complimentary. In a town where eating can cost quite a bit, it's nice to get something in your stomach in the morning without shelling out more money. Also, the Fractured Prune is a short walk over to the strip mall next door if you want to pig out on the famous donuts. One of the best things about this hotel is where it is located. It is at 126th and Coastal, on the bay side. It is right next to a park where they have a wonderful 4th of July celebration each year. You can literally just walk across the parking lot to it. In a big field they put up huge moonbounces and other inflated obstacle courses, rock climbing wall, etc. They sell tickets that amount to about 50 cents per ride. Kids 8 or 9 and under will love this area. Then there's another adjacent field where they set up old timey arts and crafts stations with things you can buy, even llitlle folksy things like $1 grab bags for kids, and there were bands playing \"beach music\", plus lots of that good/bad food -- cheesesteaks, buffalo wings, funnel cakes, pizza, oyster fritter sandwiches, lemonade, hotdogs, ribs, chicken, ice cream, snowcones, etc. They set up lots of picnic tables with red and white checkered tablecloths. It's heavenly if you like your classic fourth of July celebration. At night, a spectacular fireworks display, the longest I've ever seen (and I've seen many) right there in the middle of a pretty uncrowded field. The finale to the fireworks was the most elaborate I've ever seen, almost as if they had something to prove or wanted to make sure absolutely no one left disappointed. I laughed and laughed and laughed as it went on and on and on. I told my friend that I'd just witnessed fireworks on viagra. Anyway, nowhere else in OC can you do everything you ever wanted to do in OC for the 4th of July and then be in your room having pillow fights with your kids within 5 minutes of the fireworks ending instead of trying to walk to your car and sweating out the humidity. There are also several good restaurants within walking distance. There is Tequila Mockingbird, which has excellent Mexican. There is Babe's blue ox steak house and raw bar. There is a dough roller and dumsers dairy (the only dumsers that sells oyster sandwiches). There is the Olive Tree, which was a little dingy and seemed an almost complete clone of Olive Garden as far as features (the sign out front and unlimited salad and breadsticks), but seemed to have much better food (a seafood marinara was excellent, with al dente pasta and seafood that was very fresh and not overcooked -- including the scallops)/the kid's pizza was an actual, nice, inspired pizza with spices and an excellent crust, not just thrown together as at so many restaurants. All in all, we'd probably stay here for any 4th of July at OC.

It's pretty far up the beach from the main strip - you won't be walking down to the boardwalk, but the section of beach was pretty nice and less crowded than some others, since there's no big hotel there. Our issue was that the hotel is actually pretty far away from the beach, especially when you have a 2-year old. The road you have to cross is six lanes wide, and the hotel is set pretty far back beyond that. Not too bad for adults or older kids, but toughfor a toddler.
