Topkapi Palace, the Archeological Museum, the Grand Bazaar, and the Spice Bazaar are all within a walking distance of 10 - 12 minutes, or a tram ride of 5 minutes or less. Taksim is a longer tram ride, but easy to navigate to. The hotel itself was very charming - nicely renovated and furnished with antiques in a very cozy, tasteful way. No elevator, but the bellhop took up the bags and there are only 3 floors with easy stairs. Clean rooms, beds were comfortable, the heat worked well, water pressure was fantastic. The breakfast room which doubles as a daytime/evening cafe with a terrace is lovely, with a beautiful view over the Blue Mosque and red rooftops heading out toward the sea. Free internet and good, basic breakfast with eggs and some Turkish items (cheese, olives, sweets, etc.). Staff was friendly. For someone staying longer, there was a good selection of books and games on the shelves and dvds in the room, making the place feel quite like a home away from home.

Very close to Topkapi, the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and the Hippodrome. Despite this it is very quiet indeed - tucked down a side street. The hotel itself feels more like a 'pension' than a big hotel - it is like living in a house. The best thing is the roof terrace which has the most fantastic views across the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorus. It is not 'posh' - the breakfast area has a feel of the 1950s about it - but we liked that. You eat brekast up here and they were really good about us coming up and down from our room carrying cups of coffee and juice - all very relaxed. Very nice breakfasts. After you have done your sightseeing you can come back for a cold beer on the terrace before you head out for dinner. The rooms are not large but this is because it is an old builidng in a very central location. Very good A/C. The staff are very friendly and helpful - they went beyond the call of durty on the last day when we were delivered with a hire car with no petrol in it. The son of one of the ladies who works there came with us and he drove with us to find a petrol station (nightmare traffic in central Istanbul!!) then drove with us to the port to catch the ferry across the Marmaris sea.

I was over the moon when I got my confirmation in writing that we had reserved a room overlooking the blue mosque with twin beds and as our holiday drew nearer began to relish the thought of our pre-dinner drink on the terrace listening to the call to prayer above the hub-bub of street level. What a disappointment when we arrived at the hotel. Rifat recognised us from our visit the previous year and we took a seat in reception whilst he retrieved his paperwork regarding our booking. The scene around us was reminiscent of Fawlty Towers with staff taking bedding and towels at speed and scurrying downstairs. After about 15 mins Rifat told us he didn't have a room with twin beds but he had one double room. We were shown to a tiny dark room in the basement of the hotel below reception which clearly had been made up as an emergency when we arrived and couldn't be described as a hotel room. Not only that it had a small double bed. We were two ladies travelling together - why would the hotel think it was appropriate that we should want to pay to share a small double bed when my reservation had clearly stated we were reserving a room with twin beds. What was even more disappointing was the way this was handled. When we asked what had happened to our reservation and produced a copy of the email from Rifat confirming the booking we had made 2 months previously, he merely stated they had a large group in who had taken all the rooms. Clearly a reservation isn't worth the paper it is written on if a bigger group materialises, even though I had provided my credit card details to secure the booking. Additionally Rifat didn't offer to help to find any alternative for us. After we asked him to help us he rang the Alzer Hotel next door who were able to offer us a twin room at the same price as our reservation. No view from the room or roof terrace bar, but they had great service and it was a clean well equipped room. By means of an apology, The Turkoman merely offered that we could have a breakfast in their hotel......not something we chose to take up as we had breakfast included from the Alzer Hotel", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent all round - couldn't ask for more\u201d", "Author": "NMS77", "ReviewID": "UR74998624", "Content": "The Turkoman is the ideal place to stay in Istanbul, especially if you are visiting the historic sites.

The balance here is just right - the furnishings and rooms give you a sense of being in wrapped in Istanbul's unique history, but everything is sparklingly clean and you have all the modcons and luxuries you might want. Also, it doesn't get much better than breakfast or sunset drinks on the roof terrace - the view is fabulous. And finally, the staff are extremely friendly and can help with pretty much anything.

The price reflects the location - a stone's throw from just about every major sight you want to see, and this room has views over the Blue Mosque and the Sea of Marmara. We did get 10% off the price of the room as we paid cash, and they did throw in a free transfer from the airport as we were staying for 5 nights.

The room rates are about average for Istanbul, so we were not expecting anything above average in terms of quality or comfort. In fact, this is a fine hotel -- welcoming, plush and comfortable. We booked a corner room with two french windows. The view, straight on to the Blue Mosque, took our breath away. Just off the Hippodrome, the hotel is five minutes from some of the key sites -- Hagia Sophia, the Basiliica Cistern and the Museum of Islamic and Turkish Art, as well as the Mosque itself. Heading uphill, a ten minute walk brings you to the Grand Bazaar. On our last day, I tried the Cemberlitas hamam (near the entrance to the Grand Bazaar) and felt rested for days afterwards. The hotel has a wonderful roof terrace overlooking the mosque for breakfast and drinks. The breakfast sets you up for the day -- and the organic apricot and orange marmalade is as good as other reviews suggest! We were there during Ramadan, and the Hippodrome sprang into life at dusk as families gathered around stalls to break their fast. There was a book market within the grounds of the mosque, which was open until late at night for worshippers. We were welcomed in, even though this was technically against the rules, and had the privilege of seeing the interior free of tourists. The call to prayer at 5 am each morning shakes the area, and seems to be right in the room with you, but is still marvellous. In short -- great hotel, great staff, great room, great location. We will definitely be back.
