Second, the Pool was a long walk all outside to the back 40 of the hotel. When we got out to the pool, there were no towels. So the long walk back to the lobby in our suits to get towels. THe pool and hot tub were also not very clean. leaves and dirt at the bottom.Third, The elevator sounded like a dying cow, and we noticed the inspection report was 2 years overdue. Not a big deal but kind of weird for a hotel to not have up to date inspection reports. Breakfast was okay, although the bagels were stale all 3 days we stayed there. The door to our room did not close and latch without jimmying the door handle. Room service cleaned our room, and when we got back, found the room was unlocked and anyone could have gone in. That was annoying! Not like we had any valuables, but still... Overall a cheap hotel and not what I expected from a Ramada, but I guess you get what you pay for!

Before choosing the Ramada we were looking at the Days Hotel down the street which was way overpriced. The manager there told us the rates at every other hotel would be similar, which was a lie. Anyways, the Ramada was great! The price was super affordable and the amenities were great. There was a pool and a jacuzzi right outside our building. The pool was heated as well so it was great for a nighttime dip. There was also complimentary breakfast which was delicious. Items ranged from cereal and fruit, to waffles, pastries, and bagels. There was also a workout room in the hotel which was one of the amenities I was looking for that Days Hotel did not have. While the Ramada was right off the highway, we were in the building that was the farthest set back, and were never disrupted by traffic at all. Parking was included in the charges and there was both indoor and outdoor parking spaces. The view from the hotel was of the hilly California landscape, and there were great sunsets in the area. Location was another strong suit for this hotel. It seemed like we could get everywhere we needed to in 20 minutes or less. The airport was super close, as well as downtown San Diego, and my sister's school. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Ramada at Hotel Circle in San Diego. p.s. The only downside was that you are charged a 20 per day deposit that you receive back at the end that would cover any damages that might occur. This was not verbally made know when we charged the room to our card...however it was explained on a plaque at the front desk that we noticed later. p.s.s.

Our room, while small, was clean, but the toilet ran constantly. The sink was cracked. The hallways and carpets were worn and dirty. The \"security\" doors at the end of the hall did not lock. The elevator was scary. It had only a 500 lb weight limit posted and was slow and noisy. One father on our team leaned against a railing on the outdoor staircase and discovered a bolt was missing. Thank goodness a child didn't discover that first and fall. I reported it to the desk and they replaced the bolt, but why was it like that in the first place? The equipment in the \"fitness center\" was inadequate and broken. The pool was so tiny that not everyone who wanted to swim could get in, and there were only a few chairs, most of which were falling apart. There were never towels at the pool. I encountered a homeless man rummaging through the dumpster in the parking garage. Our team had an early football game and needed to leave at 6:00 am. One mom on our team asked if the boys could grab something from the breakfast room before we left and we were told no, it doesn't open until 6:30. I don't understand why they couldn't open a half hour early and let them grab a muffin \"to go\". The breakfast room was so small and poorly laid-out that it would have been easier for the other guests to not have our team in there eating. And while I know that it's not part of the property, the abandoned spa store in front of the hotel is downright frightening. Someone needs to tear it down and clean up that property.

The congestion is horrendous, and could be resolved by simply setting up the coffee and the juice stations in different parts of the room so that you don\u2019t have to wait while other people are making and waiting for their waffles. All the serving stations for the food are bunched up in the same section of the room and you cannot get to anything when the crowd gets big. It is a very unpleasant experience that could be easily remedied if anyone gave it a little thought! The internet provided works, but there is a cable plug in the room that does nothing.

I booked a BUSINESS CLASS room which was superior to the STANDARD KING OR STANDARD QUEEN rooms. During this 2008 stay I was VERY pleased with the comfort of my room and the service of the hotel. My BUSINESS CLASS room included upgraded newer dark wood furnishings, a superior bed, and very superior bedding. I was very happy with the size and comfort level of my room. It is fair to say that the Ramada Plaza is an older property and is in need of some updating. The carpeting in the hallways is very dirty and there is a slight smell, but no property is perfect. The only issue I experienced during my first stay was the power to the room going out 3 times during my stay. This was usually resolved within 15 - 20 minutes when a maintenance man would flip a circuit breaker switch in the lower part of the building. It was annoying, but not enough to ruin my stay or opinion of the property. I made plans to attend San Diego Pride late in 2009. Knowing I'd be in San Diego for the festival in July 2010, I searched Hotel Circle properties and found what I thought was a very good rate for the Ramada Plaza. I booked my reservation for my July 2010 stay in January. I once again booked a business class king room. The rate was an average of $85 a night for my 5 night stay. Upon my arrival on July 16th 2010, I was assigned a room on the 3rd floor of the back building of the property. This was the exact floor and building where my previous room was. The front desk clerk (BILL) was quite nice and quickly checked me in. Once I found my room and walked in I immediately called the front desk to verify that I was in the correct room for the BUSINESS CLASS room that I had reserved and paid a slightly higher rate for. My call was answered by a young lady at the front desk and her first response to my question was a very audible sigh of indignation that I was questioning the accuracy of my room. I was very polite in my conversation with her, never raised my voice, and only asked a simple question. She responded that the room I was in was indeed a BUSINESS CLASS room. After her tone and manner to my question I simply said \"well if that's the case then I guess I'll just have to accept it.\" The BUSINESS CLASS room that I was assigned on this stay included the shabbiest furnishings of any hotel that I've ever stayed in. The bleached oak laminate bed, desk, table & chairs appeared to have been purchased around 1989. The bedding was the exact comforter pictured in the hotels room pictures of a STANDARD KING room. It was certainly not the superior bed and white down comforter and duvet that I received in my previous BUSINESS CLASS room during my 2008 stay. This room was also smaller than the room I received in 2008. I honestly felt that I was not given the room that I had booked and paid for. In fairness to Ramada Plaza, The STANDARD KING room that I was in was comfortable, it was clean, the bed itself was good, and the room did have new or newly cleaned carpeting. It was probably some of the cleanest carpeting I've ever seen in a hotel of this class. The sink in the bath area and the additional sink / vanity area just outside the bath area made it convenient for two people to get ready at once. I also experienced very little noise problems. The other negative issues I experienced besides the room bait & switch issue were with the television, the safe, and housekeeping. The first night in the room my television did not work, some error message kept coming on the screen after it was turned on for 20 seconds. I reported this to the front desk and after just over an hour a property maintenance employee wheeled up a new television and installed it while we were out. After waiting for over an hour our plans forced us to leave the room so the employee had to install the new TV while we were gone. It was nice to return and have the problem resolved though. The in room safe did not work and we were unable to store our laptop in it. On the first full day of our stay, we left the room around 11 am. Upon our return around 8 pm that night we noticed the door to our room was open. The interior swing bar security latch had been swung out towards the hallway and the door was open about an inch. I believe housekeeping staff use that swing bar to prop the doors open as they are coming and going from the rooms to their cart during the room maintenance process. Our door had never been secured after the maid had finished her duties. We rushed into the room and looked around, the bed was made and the bathroom cleaned. Nothing was missing and the laptop was still in the room, but it was EXTREMELY UNNERVING to walk up to the room in the hallway and find the door open. It was only sheer luck that didn't experience a theft from our room. A complaint was immediately made to the front desk and we were assured the maid would be admonished. As far as the housekeeping itself, our maid was very good at keeping the room cleaned. I did tip her generously each day of our stay (It is proper etiquette to do so.) even with the security lapse. If you're simply looking for a clean room with minimum comfort at an inexpensive price, the Ramada Plaza isn't a bad place to stay. If you are looking for level of comfort or service above the very minimum then you should probably book a room esle where. If you do stay at this property, DO NOT pay more than $100 a night. The rooms are NOT worth more than that. The STANDARD room quality and service of the hotel is quite basic so you could probably find a room on par with this property at a Motel 6.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here\u201d", "Author": "runjrun", "ReviewID": "UR67271787", "Content": "We stayed here for a weekend and brought home ants.

From someone who works in a five star hotel and spa I found the Ramada Plaza to be an excellent place to stay. Usually I do not expect much from a hotel/motel type establishment, but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel, rooms, and amenity areas were clean and well kept, the staff were knowledgable, friendly and very approachable for any questions or assistance. AMENTITIES: The hotel offers an airport shuttle that you can also use to take you places in the area. Members in our group used the shuttle to go to and from town, Sea World (5-7 min away), the San Diego Zoo (10-15 min away, otherwise a $22 dollar cab ride) and to the embarking and disembarking area for the cruise ships. On the day that one of their drivers called in sick and the shuttle was consequently not running the hotel paid our cab fare to the airport. None of the beverage machines seemed to be working in the hotel that we could find, but we got complimentary sodas from the front desk. There is also complimentary internet in the lobby with free printer access and complimentary tea and coffee (possibly 24hr from what we saw, but I am not sure) in the lobby. The outdoor pool and hot tub are open till midnight, the latest hours I have ever seen! FOOD: The Tickled Trout Restaurant was on the small and dark side but the food and service was excellent.

Cons: There were so many little things wrong that it added up to one big disappointment, which angered me more because most of it was so unnecessary. We were in the main building, in a newly decorated room, and compared to what other reviewers have said, the furniture/fixtures were in good shape. But the TV was TINY \u2013 not much bigger than my computer screen, for pete\u2019s sake! I could only control it with the remote (not on the TV itself), which worked about one time in 20 clicks (very annoying!!). If we moved the TV even an inch, the reception was ruined. The lights near the beds didn\u2019t work \u2013 pulled the bedside table out and found that they weren\u2019t plugged in (and what a mess of wires and shoddy workmanship I found behind the table!) There was a switch near the door, but couldn\u2019t figure out what it was for until I finally found a light plug that wasn\u2019t in the socket. I couldn\u2019t plug my cell phone charger in the plug on the mirrored wall. There was a refrigerator and microwave in the room, which was great, but they weren\u2019t housed in a cabinet \u2013 they were just placed on the floor (microwave sitting on top of refrigerator)! There was a coffee maker, but no stirrers - when we called, we were told we could come down and get some (Hello? How about Housekeeping fixing their mistake by bringing the item to our room?). The single elevator was interminably slow, and the only stairs were at the far other end of the building from my room (the set nearest to me only allowed exit from the building). The only vending machine in the building was broken. The staffer delivering the morning USA Today at our doors used a cart with a loud squeal, which woke me up 2 hours before I needed to get up. The pool is certainly nothing fancy, but it didn\u2019t really bother me - there really isn\u2019t a lot of room on the lot for a pool, and I don\u2019t think people come to this hotel/location for the pool amenities, anyway. There were plenty of towels when I was there. The restaurant seemed pricey, although supposedly it has won Ramada-based awards. I only had lunch there, but wasn\u2019t too impressed. There were 3 workers standing around at the entrance when I walked in at 11:30 \u2013 they stared at me like I had 6 heads, which was kind of off-putting. P.S.

I thought that was a little weird but hey I was thrilled to get the microwave and fridge. Oh yes he also mentioned that this room was supposedly a bit bigger than others. We stayed on the third floor in the back building. This was kind of a pain but it was nice too because the pool was clear back by this building. Sort of in the corner of the parking lot which I thought was a weird place and very inconvenient for the guests in the main building. The door into the building had a sign saying it was always locked for our safety however it was open most of the time. We took the elevator up to our room and let me tell you if this was a larger room than usual I'd really hate to see the size of the the others. This room had two queen beds and it was one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in. It had the fridge, microwave, table with two chairs, a sort of desk table and chair, and the TV in the amoiore. That was WAY too much stuff in this itty bitty room. The bathroom was very clean and pretty nice, nothing fancy but nicer than usual I'd say. Then it also had a seperate sink vanity area. It was very nice to have the two sinks and mirrors, saved us time getting ready in the morning. There was also an in room safe which was nice as well. We could see the entire pool area from our window and unfortunately we could hear just about all the noise from it too. We just turned on the fan or the air and then you couldn't hear much of it. TV came in fine but I found the channels lacking. They did offer pay movies and video games which we didn't use but is nice to have. The hotel also offered room service from their restaraunt the TIckled Trout. There was a two dollar per person charge plus a 17% gratuity added to every room service order. I thought that was high when the prices were high already for what you got. But we did use room service three or four times. Each time the food was brought up well before the amount of time they said it would take, which was great. Nothing we had from there was bad but it was nothing to write home about either, again especially with what we were paying. On one of the days my husband went down to the restaurant and got the breakfast himself which of course was much cheaper. He said the restaurant was dark and gloomy, I didn't see it myself so I can only give you his opinion. We ate next door at Ricky's for breakfast and it was okay. We also ate down the road at Valley Kitchen I believe it was called. Nothing fancy but it was decent as well. One thing I do want to complain about was the \"guest laundry.\" This was actually a tiny area off of the exercise area that had two washers and dryers. Up untill our last night one of the washers wasn't working so that was really inconvenient. We really hated it because we were clear back in the back building so we either had to drive down and risk losing our parking spot, or walk down and back up the really steep hill with all the laundry. Plus you never knew if someone else was down there using the machines. We thought with the amount of guests at this hotel they could've offered more machines and maybe even one in the back building. To make matters worse the dryers took forever. The laundry was supposed to close at ten at night but we were up past midnight one night waiting for our clothes to dry, they never did all the way. We got so sick of going back and forth between buildings that we just sort of camped out in the lobby....with our four year old daughter. I think we sort of annoyed the front desk people but oh well maybe they should get some machines in the other building! The pool area was okay. Again very weird placement though. The pool itself was small but clean. The hot tub looked nasty on one of the nights but was fine the rest of the time. There's nobody down there keeping an eye on things and we did see some pretty rowdy drunk people at different times, but other than that it was mostly families like us. I do have to say that the hotel circle area is very convenient to sea world, mission beach, and old town. The only problem we had was wanting to find some fast food restaurants to save money. We remembered seeing a Wendy's nearby but couldn't seem to find it again. We called the front desk and they told us the closest place was some jack in the box that wasn't close at all. Eventually we found the Wendy's and a couple of other places on our own, I felt like the front desk people should've easily been able to tell us where to find the closest fast food joint though. When we checked in on the back of the hotel layout map there were decent directions to many different places you might want to visit and those came in very handy for us.The hotel circle area is very crowded though so if you want to stay out of the way you DON'T want to stay here. All in all the place was okay. For the price though they could've at least had a continental breakfast at the least. We paid anywhere from $114.00 to $179.00 on any given night we stayed so I feel like a simple free breakfast wouldn't be too much to ask for.", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, VA", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay here again.\u201d", "Author": "ck1220", "ReviewID": "UR5014021", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for one night in April of 2006.

We got back from dinner about 11pm and found a better parking spot than when we checked in. We didn't use the pool, but it seemed a bit of a walk and thrown in the corner of the parking lot.
