This could have been the whole review. However, here's a few more.The hotel is relatively small giving you the impression of a more personal service. Front desk staff is polite and effective. Hardware relatively new. The rooms are well designed, and give you the feeling of relaxation. Their size is ok, typical london hotel room but of well implemented luxury. Marble bathrooms exceptionaly clean and shiny.The address is quiet, although you are in the heart of London. Everything is close by.

The Halkin was always, and still is, completely flawless, It easily ranks as one of my top 10 hotels in the world.

The outstanding and accommodating service that its staff consistently delivers sets the Halkin apart. In addition to the usual services, such as making restaurant reservations, the staff helped us in many ways. Getting third row seats to a sold-out Royal Opera Theatre performance, holding some of our luggage while we were in Paris and picking up our bags at check-out within two minutes of calling are just some examples of the attentive, helpful service the staff provides. All this with style and grace -- and no attitude. The staff care and want to be of service (for example, once when we needed help with luggage but only the concierge staff was free, one of them stepped in), and I never once observed the it's not my job attitude so prevalent today.The small touches equally impress -- a welcome drink at check-in; turn-down service (Frette floor mats) no matter how late (the staff seemed to know instinctively when we were out); lavendar roses and fresh fruits in the room; a sturdy umbrella and a long, leather shoe horn in the closet. The Halkin is situated in a great neighborhood that is quiet and serene while also just minutes from the action (Hyde Park Corner tube station is only three minutes away walking, Harvey Nichols less than ten). The room is large (for London), stylish, quiet and well designed with heated bathroom floors and towel racks (with great towels -- absorbent but not bulky); a large soaking tub and separate shower with lots of water pressure; a comfortable, big bed with great linens and pillows; good lighting; and touch controls for everything at bedside. A flat-screen TV, an air conditioner that goes a little cooler and more dresser space are all I would ask for (also, the room in which I stayed had only one small window, so if sunlight or window space is a priority, book a suite).

I can only say that the rooms and the service are just as outstanding as the most enthusiastic reviewers have said they are, comparable even to a top class hotel in Asia (and I have never said that about a hotel anywhere in Europe before). Another unique quality is the peace and quiet, so very difficult to find in any major city. This is accounted for not by any unusual soundproofing (and any significant external noise would in fact intrude, see below) but by the hotel's location on a narrow one-way street which sees very little traffic. Since I was on a short non-business visit from the East Coast of the US, I decided to stay on my home time zone and sleep from 0300 to 1200. I was able to accomplish this even on a weekday morning.The only exception to the peace and quiet was a function of the room where I spent the first night being on the west side of the hotel, overlooking an alley, Montrose Place. This must be where the service entrance is located, and I was woken up before dawn by the usual rubbish collection noises -- bags of bottles being slung into a truck, the truck revving up to compact them, the beeping noise as the truck backed out, miscellaneous shouts and yells. Rooms on this side are definitely to be avoided.Thereafter I slept in a room facing Halkin Street, where I was not disturbed at all. I believe rooms on the east side (where there is no alley) and at the back would probably be quietest of all. Although there is a massive, block-long construction project under way right behind The Halkin, it is noisy only during normal working hours (this not being Asia, after all). It looked to me as if it has about another year to go.The only complaint that I would have is the outrageous charge of 20 pounds ($35!) per day for internet service in the room. When will hotels in Europe stop charging for internet service as if it were some new, rich man's toy, instead of a routine utility, like electricity and TV?", "Date": "Dec 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR549509562", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Westonian"}, {"Content": "Great Room, Great Service   showReview(3702515, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 27, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR484252371", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "The Wow factor   showReview(3615158, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 27, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR106513047", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bingofish"}, {"Content": "Superb, sophisticated, and elegant   showReview(3576305, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR241840019", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Quiet and Stylish.
