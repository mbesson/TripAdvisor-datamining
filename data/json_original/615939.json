The school had to book through school contacts so we where expecting the hotel to be a hostel for youths however this was not the situation. We arrived at Max Hotel, we where annoyed that the lift did not work and was quite smelly so we had to hike about 27 stairs with two suitcases each to get to the reception. Once we got to the reception we where grated with friendly, handsome Italian men what really could you want, the problem with the hotel was the breakfast the rooms where spotless as they where cleaned daily and bed sheets where cleaned daily but the breakfast provided in the morning was terrible, we would have went to the local shop next door to the hotel or across to a bakery to purchases buns or chocolate for breakfast. We never stayed in the hotel for dinner as it was not provided, the location of the hotel was fantastic 20min walk to the famous fountain, 5 minutes from a train station with lots of designer shops. If your in Rome to explore the city all day the Hotel Max is for you it's really a resting nest. Will be back again when come back to Rome.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wells, Somerset, UK.", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "BobbyatWells", "ReviewID": "UR104268213", "Content": "I was really worried about this hotel having read previous reviews on TripAdvisor. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Hotel Max. Admittedly the common areas shared with other hotels were not the greatest, but the lift was in good working order and did not smell. The rooms provided were clean and of a good size - one point though - four bedded rooms are not suitable for adults - there should be no more than three to a room. The bathrooms were good and clean towels provided every day. Although the breakfasts were wholesome, they did become a little boring - I would have like a little more variety. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. If you are taking a group of undergraduates to Rome I would recommend Hotel Max.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot terrible.\u201d", "Author": "1Minerva", "ReviewID": "UR104266272", "Content": "Not as bad as a lot of the other reviews state.

The location is perfect- near Termini Station and its easy to get anywhere :). The hotel room was perfectly clean so was the toilet. There was a TV, fridge and personal safe in every room so you can leave your valuables there. The towels were changed every day. The stuff was really nice to us. In the first day we arrived at the Hotel at 11:00 am and they give us our rooms (even though the check-in was at 1:00 pm ). Last day we had our plane at 10:00 pm and they let us live our luggage there all day long.

Anyway, we left and we were going to try to make the best of it since we didn't knew where we were going to end up, because we didn't had the chance to google the hotel anymore before leaving... When we arrived there, we noticed that there where 6 hotels in one building. We had to climb to the 3rd floor, where the reception of Max is situated. The which we had to pass every day was disgusting. It was dusty, with cigarettes all over the floor. We really didn't trust the elevator... That says enough... The organisation was a mess! It felt like they weren't prepared for a large group like us! When the chaos was over, we finally had to chance to go to our room. The first thing we couldn't ignore was the terrible smell coming out of our room when we first opened the door. We immediately opened the window and when we came back to the hotel later that evening, the smell was almost gone. For some reason the cleaning lady closed the window every single day when we were out of the hotel, so the room was smelly again.. The room was also very tiny, and there wasn't enough space for 3 people to put their luggage. Breakfast was really poor, we all got 1 piece of bread and you could only choose between nutella, honey and jam. The first day i tried to drink cappuccino but it tasted like it was made from water from the dishes... Hot chocolate, which i tried the day after, was okay. When we were still hungry, we went to 'DESPAR', a supermarket, to buy some cookies/chips/... Now let's be positive: The location is great!!! The Central station (Termini) is just 2 minutes away, so you can easily take the train or underground to anywhere! Our bathroom's size was big when you compare it to the size of the bedroom. There were also fresh towels every day! That was really pleasant! The staff was okay, but they were having discussions all the time with eachother... (Or anyway it seems like they were...) Generally, our stay was okay, but it wasn't the best hotel i've ever stayed in... For a study group, it you don't ask for a lot of luxury, it's not that bad..", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lytham, Lancashire", "Title": "\u201covercrowded and an insult to our intelligence\u201d", "Author": "Freck1e", "ReviewID": "UR27664819", "Content": "Room 2 - Situated on 5th floor. (The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor as the other floors are occupied by different hotels) I arrived with a party of Photography students on a field trip to Rome. The booking in procedure seemed to take hours and upon finally getting to our room it was 4 beds all jammed together with less than a foot of room between the bed and the opposite wall. Four girls had to get ready in this! The bathroom appeared to be of mediocre standard until I tried the shower (there was no bath). The water was cold and the shower head had not been cleaned in years and had clogged up so much that the water was not coming out properly. The second morning I tried the shower again, and there was warm water but after being in there for less than a minute the shower door fell on me - the entire door! Shortly after my friend climbed on her bed to get ready (there was no floorspace to walk on) and the bed collapsed! It was like a scene out of Faulty towers! Luckily, as Rome had so much to offer, we spent most of the day and night site seeing and just used the hotel as somewhere to crash.. The lift was good when it was working but was a bit hit and miss so wouldnt recommend this hotel if you cant climb 15 flights of stairs. Oh, and breakfasdt - dont believe what they tell you, even the receptionist warned us how bad it was, and he was right - after morning 1, we are at the eatery accross the road.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cI really didn't like it!

I went there with my siblings, and it is very ideal for family vacation with older children, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for couples with small children because of the room sizes. The rooms are small but it was ok considering the low price you pay for this hotel. The staff is nice except one lady in the reception - she was constantly angry! Theres a lot of voices and noises outside the window, so be prepared for sleepless nights:) no, i'm just kidding. We had some problems with the room facilities; the wall sockets! There was 3 in our room but only 1 was working. So bring an extra portable socket with ya or something like that:) And the hairdryer in the bathroom is very poor, so make sure to bring a hairdryer with you. The minibar looks like its broken and not freezing but it is actually working. The elevator is very old-fashioned but working aswell:) Breakfast at the hotel is fair enough, not much luxury; bread, butter, jam, nutella and honey. that is what you get every single day!

The service and staff are great and extremely friendly. Some other reviewers have complained about the noise, but then again consider you are right in the middle of Rome. It\u2019s not any noisier than any other downtown hotel and again I reiterate great value. The room size was adequate and very clean. D\u00e9cor was a little dated.
