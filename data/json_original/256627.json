This hotel has one very serious let-down; whilst the suites are spacious, they are very very tired. I stayed here with a colleague so I got to see two very different 1 bed suites. Mine was well layed out however 2 of the three windows were in the bedroom so the living and kitchen areas were very gloomy which, combined with the tired look made the room feel very depressing. My colleagues room had very strange layout and there was a strong stale tobacco smell in the bathroom coming from elsewhere in the building, plus his view was of an internal courtyard - not very appealing. That being said, this hotel would be OK for a short weekend break where the only need is for a bed to sleep in, but as a hotel to live and work out of for a week this was so bad we moved to another Radisson property (the Radisson Blu, Sydney Harbour - WAY better!).

On a few trips, including this last one, the family has come along (my wife and two girls) for a bit of a holiday while I work. We have stayed in apartments in this area before -- the previous time was at Metro Apartments on Sussex, which we enjoyed for the space and laundry facilities, but also found a bit grubby. So this time I thought we would look for an apartment that is a bit more upmarket. Which is how we ended up in a 97m-squared 2-bedroom apartment at the Radisson for on week (our previous house was smaller). I must say that hotel rooms near Darling Harbour in February are not cheap, and we payed something like $500 per night for the room. But it was certainly nice to have a separate bedroom for the kids, and two tv's that they could glue themselves to at will. The kitchen facilities are good -- though the fridge had the usual stock of overpriced drinks that I had to move out as a first thing, and the pots and pans were barely workable. There were two decent shower rooms, one with bath. On the down side: the beds were not that comfortable -- one of the kid's beds was so uncomfortable (it had obviously been jumped on and the springs stuck through) that one daughter could not sleep well. And there were no laundry facilities (except the usual ridiculously priced hotel service). The decor in the room was fine, if dated. And the noise from outside was constant, and particularly noticeable at night. We had a back-facing room, so all the air-conditioning units on surrounding buildings added to the cacophony. I think that's a part of staying in downtown hotels the world over -- but better sound proofing would not go amiss. But we really enjoyed the convenient location -- easy to get to transport and restaurants. And the cleaning staff were fantastic, helping us with little things. The (wired) broadband was fast, and adequate for our needs -- but I would have preferred WIFI. We used the 1st floor indoor pool quite often, especially the kids. Good job we are from New Zealand and are used to cold water -- because the pool was not warm. I think Australians would put a toe in, and decide to leave it. So overall, we had an enjoyable stay for the great location, good room size, and general pleasure of hanging out in Sydney. Not so good was the price, poor beds, and noise. We decided that we would probably not stay there again -- perhaps a smaller and cheaper room would be more enjoyable overall. But finding a decent serviced apartment round Darling Harbour is not that easy. i see that the Radisson describes itself as 'Luxurious Hotel Rooms'. I would not say that -- I've seen luxurious, and the Radisson is only that in the the industrial hotel sense, not the pampered body and mind sense.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontypool South Wales", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location, but needs sound proofing!\u201d", "Author": "MrsWoodie", "ReviewID": "UR125369521", "Content": "We visited this hotel with our friends who were visiting us in Australia from the UK. We got a great price and picked the hotel because of its location being near Darling Harbour. We arrived at the hotel and was checked in quickly and efficiently, although we did have to pay an extra $30 per night for a roll away bed for our daughter, which we were not advised of at booking. The hotel is clean and the rooms are very spacious, we had a 1 bedroom suite which was more than adequate for the 3 of us, the bathrooms were a little dated, but they were clean and suffice.

The location of the hotel is perfect, you cannot see the harbour from the hotel, but it is only a 5-10 minute walk, for the price this is great. Our only issue with the hotel was the noise, we were in a room that overlooked the street and the windows may aswell not have been there, it was so loud we could hardly sleep, the hotel really needs to address and upgrade the windows in these rooms, our friends had a room in a different part of the hotel and they had no issues, so if you are considering this hotel please ask for a room not overlooking the street, the view out of the other rooms are not very nice as it overlooks a run down old building with a grotty looking pool, however at least you will be able to sleep.

Second, was that the bed was two king singles bound together with linen - and they were different mattresses- so one was an inch higher than the the other :-/ There was two vanities- one with a sink and one with lit mirror. The bath was only half size, which was frustrating. The room was well worn, and very old. It had no air of luxury or wow.

We also ate at the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and dinner during our 2 night stay, where service was rather slow and food was pleasant, but not 4.5 star quality. The location is great, however, as it is close to shops (including a large Coles grocery store) and the mono rail which we used for our business appointments, plus lots of restaurants nearby. They do have complimentary strollers to use, but they are not very sturdy and supportive of a smaller sized baby, so we made use of our baby carrier which I strapped to myself more than their stroller as we had initially planned.

I was 1 adult travelling with 2 children under 13 and wanted to be close to everything and in a safe location. We took the airport train to Town Hall station. Cost was $15 adult and $10 for a child (only pay for one child & the second travels free). The hotel is located in Liverpoool St - about 2 blocks from Town Hall station an easy walk down hill. Our room was a studio room with 2 queen beds and kitchenette. We asked for the cooking pack and microwave to be provided to us (at no extra cost) and we were able to prepare breakfasts and dinners in our room on some nights. Woolworths is located near Town Hall station (4 storey supermarket!!) and Coles is located on the corner of George & Liverpool Sts. Remember to take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Being near the city and Darling Harbour, there are several night spots, pubs and restaurants nearby and patrons may be a little noisy late at night. We always felt safe walking in the day or night. From the hotel, you turn left into George St and you are in the city centre; walk about 30 minutes to the end of George St and you are at the Harbour Bridge, The Rocks and Opera House. At Circular Quay you can choose to take a ferry across to Manly - highly recommended as cost is reasonable. You pay for 1 child and the second travels free. We had fish & chips in the mall (take away fish shop at the end of the mall near the beach) and then enjoyed an icecream from Movenpick. Follow Liverpool St across the bridge towards Darling Harbour and you are at the wharf with many different restaurants, cafes and shops to keep you busy for a while. We visited the Aquarium (quite pricey at $38 for an adult and $18 per child). But the kids loved the experience and we spent a few hours inside looking at the unusual sea creatures. We waited in line for about 30 minutes (lines look long but move pretty quickly). The location of the hotel is so good that there is no need to take a bus or monorail anywhere if you are only wanting to stay in the city centre region. Monorail costs $4.50 for a single trip or $9.50 for a day adult ticket or $23 per day for a family. Save your money and walk if you are able - it is good exercise and you can spend the money elsewhere. We enjoyed sharing a very rich italian hot chocolate at Max Brenner ( whilst walking we noticed the store up a side street - something you'd certainly miss if on a bus!) Photos of hotel on their website are exactly what you will be greated with when you arrive. My son swam in the pool (very chlorinated and stung my eyes just sitting there supervising). My daughter used the gym a few times - 1 treadmill, 1 bike, 1 orbitrek and a couple of weight machines - Not big but good enough - we went there around 8pm and there were always people using the gym and pool but enough equipment to go around. They were renovating their entrance but there was always service with a smile! Lovely body wash and body lotion provided in sample sized bottles as well as a few other essentials.

One of the biggest balconies of a hotel room Ive stayed in, it overlooked Darling Harbour which looked unreal at night time. The hotel was incredibly clean and well kept and the staff were amazingly helpful. Whilst telling us the news of the upgrade, the staff were getting really excited for us (which is always nice) and then showed us to the elevator. When we couldn't work the elevator, they helped us by taking us up to our room, offering to take our bags and open the door for us. When leaving the hotel to go to dinner at night, the wonderful guest services manager [not sure of her name but she had an English accent] acted as a concierge getting my party (of 15 in different rooms) a number of taxis. If you've ever been to Sydney you'd know how hard it can be to catch taxis in certain places at certain times. We were brought many things by the staff and they were overall exceptional. The location is very good; close to stations and attractions.

Two bedrooms, each with its own well-stocked bath, a relatively large (but poorly stocked) kitchen, a dining area and living room with large tv and a work desk gave us lots of room to spread out and the ability to make breakfast and pack lunches for our trips to the beach. The carpet and furnishings are a bit worn but we weren't looking for a luxury experience here. There is a small balcony but its unfortunate view over a deteriorating tennis court and another building's small pool made it completely unappealing. The hotel's indoor pool and spa are quite lovely, however, located in a pavilion-type setting with pinpoints of light projected through the ceiling like stars. The front desk staff was cheerful and very helpful, lending us umbrellas and calling to make sure the pharmacy they recommended was open. The hotel is located very close to Chinatown, within walking distance of Darling Harbour and two blocks from a shopping center with a grocery store, bottle shop and pharmacy. Public transit, including the CityRail connections to Circular Quay and the bus to Bondi, is easily accessible. Free internet for the duration of our stay was a special bonus, especially for our teenager yearning for conversations with friends back home. This isn't the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, but I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling with a family, especially if they are going to be staying for more than a couple of days.

My third recent stay at the Radisson in Liverpool Street confirms my sense that this hotel is truly the best in its class in Sydney. It is often the case that hotels appear very good on first visit, but little niggles and problems become clearer as you return again and again. The Radisson, in contrast, is actually seeming better each time I go. Upon checkin I was greeted warmly by staff who remembered I'd been there in February; a small but welcoming touch. I received a complimentary upgrade from the already very good studio rooms to a proper 1-br suite; not only that, it was a room facing Sussex St (rather than the monorail encumbered Liverpool St) - worth asking for this view if you can. The rooms are big, very big: originally apartments (you can see from the layout and basic structures in the rooms), these are now extraordinarily spacious for the money paid. I was staying for 3 nights and working in the room as well - thus, a small but excellent bedroom, plus a very large living space was perfect. The hotel remembered that I liked having a microwave in room and utensils for the kitchen - these had been provided in advance; if you are new and want this, just make sure to ask (some rooms may come with them, but I suspect not). As far as I know, most of the rooms have balconies - this is essential if you are spending time in the room and want a sense of space. Mine was accessible from both living and bedroom. The hotel itself is somewhere between functional and luxurious - about right for its star rating. Certainly the public areas - lobby, restuarant etc - are nicely furnished and it was pleasant to come in each day from work and feel the hotel was welcoming me. This is one of the problems with some apartment-style hotels which, honestly feel as welcoming as passport control at the airport! So, the Radisson scores there, even if the rooms are, in truth, somewhat standard in their look and feel. The location probably suits me better than most, since my work tends to take me away from the CBD towards Central, so Liverpool St is fine; but it is not the glitzy down town feel of, say, the Hilton or Swissotel. Can take 10 mins in traffic by cab to get to, since you have to battle down Liverpool St from, say, the airport. However, it is stupendously quick to get away from - once you are in a cab, you are able to get to Anzac Bridge, Harbour Bridge, X-town tunnel easily. It's 5 mins to Town Hall railway by foot. Three minor issues - the a/c was turned to 15 degrees upon my arrival so the room was very chilly; I have to say, most hotels around the world seem to do this and, while this is probably ok in Darwin, Singapore and so on, it does seem to be a waste of money to have it down so low. Also, the sofas are not especially comfortable - they would have to be the cheapest and least pleasant sofas I have ever encountered! Still, since I didn't sit on them very much, I was not fussed. There was also only one powerpoint near the desk, into which was plugged the lamp (where does the power cable for PC go? :) ). Mine stretched to another point but, again, one of those slightly irritating things which, I guess, is what happens when apartments are converted to a hotel. But, I have no doubt, the staff would have found an adaptor had I needed one. All in all - I am struggling to think of any reason NOT to stay here; I've been in probably 10 Sydney hotels in the past 5 years and, while all of them are good, Radisson is a real find for anyone wanting space, excellent staff, and who doesn't like to spend 25% extra just to feel like one is in luxury. For me, luxury is the way staff are very welcoming, and the room to spread out and enjoy a stay.

Upon closer inspection the sheets were ripped, towels were of very average quality bathroom vanity was hardly big enough for 3 toothbrushes + hairbrushes, let alone a makeup bag or similar, shower over bath was permantly stained with black stains and tiles were not clean - nor was light switch - yuk! Bedding situation was rectified promptly and we were told that this was a common problem when booking thru third party sites. Bed and linen delivered promptly and with a smile by Manager herself. Now we chose this hotel because of it's central city location and did anticipate some noise, but even on the 8th floor with earplugs it was still loud enough to keep you awake at 3am on Saturday morning and again on Sunday. Sunday night things quitened down a lot earlier. Housekeeping was hit and miss - first day fine, but despite housekeeper asking what time would be suitable for do room when she saw us coming in after breakfast around 10am, it was not done between 11am - 1.30pm when we were out. Around 2pm a knock - told her not to bother but she gave us fresh towels. Was impressed with their conservation efforts - sheets not changed unless you put a sign on the bed, rather than other way round - use sign if you don't want a change. Same policy with towels as most international hotels - leave on floor to change, or hangup. Pool & Spa - didn't use despite wanting to as smell of chlorine was overpowering - also spa was same temperature as pool - not ideal for a soak. Gym looked adequate but not utilised. Didn't eat on site - plenty of options around - just the ads for their breakfast buffet put you off - didn't look at all appetising or of 4 1/2 star quality. Business centre was an oversized cupboard with 2 computers and a printer - we waited 15 minutes or so for a computer. Did need and received help printing boarding cards - all with a smile. If you like to watch a bit of tele (we did a bit as weather was horrendous - no fault of Hotel of course!), every time the monorail goes by your reception is interferred with for 5 seconds or so - they come and go every 7-8 minutes, so a bit of a pain. All in all, very disappointed as I thought I'd researched this well. If this was advertised as a 3 1/2 star and priced as such I'd give it a 4's for everything, but at A$1550+ full price for 3 nights, even at half price this was not worth the money.

I had arrived at 1130, way before the check in time and although i had requested for an early check in, i was not expecting it. However, to my pleasant surprise i managed to check in within 15 minutes (thanks to the amazing staff) to a large and most importantly clean room! No musty smells along the corridors or in the room and the room had a kitchen as i entered the doorway and the bathroom on the other side. I usually have a habit of checking how clean hotel rooms are just so i wouldn't have to go through unpacking and then having to pack again when i discover insects/anything gross lurking in any corners etc. Toliets were free from any smells,dirt,mould etc, linen clean,kitchen clean and no trace of dirt oh and i have to mention this!! There was entirely no food smells during my stay. I think stale food smell is just disgusting especially in an enclosed A/C building so thank goodness!! Space in the room was awesome and that space below the TV was perfect for dumping my shopping bags! Desk by the window was great for working on the whole night on my laptop although internet connection was rather slow so i ended up using the PCs in the business room - it's really not necessary to get internet connections in the room. The monorail was right by my window and honestly the sound did not bother me!! It had the same effect as say...traffic a good distance away? The windows blocked out the sounds pretty much anyway. I love having a balcony, great for smokers but i'm not but i had some friends who were and we just hung out there for a couple of hours so \u00e2\u2122\u00a5s it! Oh it was also really useful for deciding on what to wear since Sydney weather is so unpredictable! hot most days during summer but the occasional cooler rainy day. It got rather noisy on one night where some people were getting really pissed drunk at the nearby pub and there was the usual shouting but it lasted for about an hour or so and it's just normal citylife and being smack in the middle of a city, one would not and should not expect silence. (oh i was on the 3rd floor so yeah maybe it would quieter higher up) I also \u00e2\u2122\u00a5ed how quiet it was in the hotel, housekeeping was always on time and the bed+ pillows were really comfy! No bathtub but the toliet was great!! ladies would love the make up table which comes with a higher chair and a small wall mirror to zoom in on those pores and tweeze those brows!! I could spend hours in the loo!! The staff were great!! They seemed as though they genuinely loved their job and it was such a delight conversing with them!!

I left my luggage in the reception, and when I came back around 1pm, the room was assigned and the luggage was already in the room. The only problem I experienced was air conditioner. The first day I was in Sydney was extremely hot (+41C), and the air conditioner regulator knob did not rotate to any position lower than +24.5C (76F) which was too hot for me. It looked like there was some artificial restriction on the knob so that the guests could not set it to too low value and overspend hotel's electricity... I complained on the reception - twice, few hours after I was assigned the room and the next morning, to two different clerks on the reception, each time I was told that someone would take care of it and nothing was done (I doubt anyone was looking at it at all, my impression was that that was the hotel policy).

We had a 2 bedroom apartment with a small balcony looking out onto nothing much. On opening the door of the apartment we looked onto scratched and dirty paintwork. The main bedroom held a Kingsize bed, the second bedroom just fitted 2 single beds. The 2 bathrooms were clean and pleasant. The toiletries were the smallest I have ever encountered in a hotel and given our stay over 5 days and frequent use of the pool, they really went nowhere. I had expected a laundry, but there was none to be found. The kitchen was reasonable but we could not get the oven to work. The apartment came with 3 spoons, 3 forks, 3 knives, 3 glasses etc etc but this was increased to a generous 5 of everything on request. There was no dishwasher which I was disappointed in. The couch in the siting room was pretty uncomfortable. The swimming pool was very nice, the spa rather hot, but the gym is a bit of a waste of time with minimal equipment and oveused outside of work hours by residents of an adjacent building. Apart from being a bit shabby, we had 2 major issues with the hotel, the first was their inability to control extremely nosiy guests in the apartment below us which kept us all awake until around 4am. They only left their balcony at that time to start arguing in the bedroom directly below us. Strangely, after calling and complaining around 4am, the front desk called me back about 20 minutes later (ie about 420 am) to tell me they had told the guests to be quiet. As there was only a phone in the living room, this woke my daughter who was sleeping there just ater I had finally got her off to sleep. Secondly when we left the next day (ater a total of 2 hours sleep), I was unpleasantly suprised to find a charge of $50 per night added to the bill for a roll away bed my small daughter had slept on in the living room, in addition to the $30 per night parking and a couple of minibar charges we had not incurred. When I brought this up with the desk manager he could not have cared less and told me that I had no option other than to pay their charges. Apparently I was supposed to find this hotel good value at the equivalent of $380 per night or $1900 for 5 nights. Well I didn't and I complained to the conference organisers who booked my room. After 7 weeks of emailing, my complaint was answered in more or less the same way...the Radisson couldn't care less.

The room itself was very pleasant and it had a great bathroom with a huge shower. The view on the other hand was terrible but its a hotel in a city centre so we weren't too upset about that. The reception staff were ok but not particularly friendly. The hotel only has a very small eating area which serves all meals. It is just a flight of stairs up from the reception area. The bar is also located here. The serving staff were nice. We didn't eat breakfast here as there are many cafes nearby serving a much better meal at a much better price. We did have dinner one night. We were very tired from a day of sight seeing and didn't want to go out but we found that it was quite pleasant. For every meal they reccommended a glass of wine. The room service menu is pretty much the same as the restaurant menu but slightly more expensive. The pool was a disappointment. The pictures which I looked lead me to believe that it was alot bigger then it actually is. Overall we had a good stay here but felt that it was a hotel geared mainly at business clients. Internet is also quite expensive in the hotel. From the bedrooms you get a free 24 hours but then have to pay 25 dollars per day if you wish to continue.

So, I'm going to add my positive review. We spent three nights here and it was fabulous! Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, nothing was ever too much trouble. We booked a studio hotel room which was perfect for us - we were only there to sleep. The room was situated on the 8th floor and overlooked a building across the street but we enjoy people watching and we saw a few funny things from our balcony. The room was tastefully decorated and clean. It was serviced daily and it was great to see the Radisson helping to reduce their carbon footprint by asking guests to assist with energy saving, this is good to see in these eco-friendly times. We ate in the restaurant a couple of times, which I have to say is quite reasonably priced, the breakfast was great and had a great selection to choose from. The location was just perfect for us as we had travelled to Sydney to attend the Michael Buble concert (which incidentally was wonderful) this was held at the Sydney Entertainment Centre which was a five minute walk away as was Chinatown and Paddy's Market. A supermarket is situated 5 minutes in the opposite direction at World Square. Monrail station is very close by. The closest train station is Town Hall this is two streets away and a good flat walk, great for those with trolley cases coming off the airport train. A tip here, grab a street map from one of the airport stands as the streets are a little confusing until you get your bearings. Sydney is a great city to get around on foot as it is reasonably flat walking and public transport is frequent. Access to and from the airport is great on the train which is $14 one way . We had been told a taxi would be around $50 from the airport. However, that depended on the time of day you were travelling as traffic can become quite grid-locked at rush hour. We discovered a $16 adult day pass which provided access to the bus, train and ferries. We caught the ferry to Manly (which is a quiet spot) and had a wander around, it's a very pretty seaside suburb of Sydney. Sydney is a very large city, which is very busy and it is noisy where ever you go. So, if you are looking for peace and quiet stay out of the city, perhaps Manly or go bush with the roos!", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBasic Accomodation - Not worth what we paid\u201d", "Author": "Beanie210273", "ReviewID": "UR15224390", "Content": "We stayed here on our first visit to Sydney.

It is nice to have a balcony which is large enough for a table and a couple of chairs if you don;t mind the traffic. This is very central Sydney so noise will always be an issue. All our suites were spacious, well furnished and clean, the bathrooms are very small in relation to the overall size of the suite with an adequate shower over a bath which itself is too small for anyone taller than 5 foot. The beds and bedding were also very comfortable. The lack of a safe large enough for a small laptop computer is dissapointing for a business style hotel.

All in all the hotel isn't cheap but you are stying in the middle of a big city and in a great location,no major complaints though and i'll probably stay there next year.

I checked Trip Advisor and the comments were so helpful and true. The Radisson was a great stay. The location can not be beat. It was right down the street from Darling Harbor which we visited almost everday! Our room was roomy and clean. The offered room service daily and the 1 bedroom suite is big enough for a family of 4 ( they can send up extra roll-away-beds for $35 per night). Our room came with a full bar although I wouldn't eat anything from it (chips, sodas and nuts) you have to pay for what you eat and the prices were expensive. It was cheaper to go the the grocery store \"Coles\" located up the street for snacks and sodas. I really can't complain though and I would stay here again if I was given the chance. The duty manager was very nice and never got tired of our millions of questions. The waitress Alejandra took care of our dinning needs and really made us feel welcomed whether we were dinning in the hotel restaurant or ordering in-room service ...also the when we ordered food to our room it came up quick and hot!!. I did not like the meat (chicken, fish, or beef) it tasted very different than what I am used to. We loved the dessert. It is pretty expensive ordering food from the hotel but it is an option. There are so many places to eat from within walking distance. There is a great deli (spanish delicatessen )across the street if you just want a real good sandwich and soda. Taxi's galore in the area ( although you really won't need them). China town and Paddy's market is within 5 min. walking distance. Please go to Paddys's market for all of your souvenir's they are 50-70% cheaper than buying anywhere else (same stuff but way cheaper). I went on the last day of my stay and was upset that I did not go there first. So much to chose from ( silk, jewelry, clothes...ect.). We went to China Town and they had millions of restaurants to pick from (some places a little bit ruff looking!) Make sure you get a package deal tour of the main attractions before leaving....was very expensive if you purchased tickets at the door. Kids will love Darling Harbor (parks, play area and sidewalk eateries). Very expensive for dinning out and even for 1scoop of icecream on a cone $4.10. 16 oz soda $3.50 -$5.00. Loved the chips a.k.a. french fries, was the best I have ever had. Not crazy about the fish part. American fastfood restaurants does not taste the same at all! But as the Aussie's say \"No Worries\". Do not do the buy back program at the airport it is not worth it( a fee to have them buy back your leftover AUD$). I doubt you will be bringing any money back from the trip. A lot of things to do with your kids at Darling Harbor very relaxing but fun atmosphere. The weather was mild for winter time but it was raining half of the time but this did not stop us from having a good time. There were sunny days where we sat with the children eating icecream on the docks watching the boats go buy and feeding the beautiful birds. It is a place your family will enjoy.", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family accomodation\u201d", "Author": "surfnsally", "ReviewID": "UR8070484", "Content": "We have just returned from 4 x nights Sydney.We are a family of 4 with children aged 11 and 13 years.This hotel suited our needs perfectly.The apartment was roomy with clean.It had a full kitchen and two bathrooms including a bath.We were attracted to this hotel for the indoor pool ( a must in winter) and the location.
