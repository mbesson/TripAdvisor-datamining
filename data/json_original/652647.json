Room OK, aircon very efficient, drain smell in our room but it was qiuet. Its a good 20 minute walk to sanur shopping but taxis are plentiful and cheap Breakfast is not a buffet but a selection of choices which were adequate. We used it as a stopover (USD48) and stayed in the superior room (lowest class) so recommend upgrade to garden or pool villa", "Date": "Aug 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908351826", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nzbased"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d652647-r21671402-Sriphala_Resort_Villa-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "652647", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
