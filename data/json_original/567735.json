{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Perfect Stay! A group of 4 of us spent Easter weekend in Florence and were absolutely taken away with the Florence Apartment we stayed in! We were greeted by an Italian lady (Laura) who spoke good English and showed us around this magnificently decorated apartment with a living room, kitchen and cute bedrooms with shelves full of books and big paintings on the walls - truly amazing. The kitchen was stocked with fresh food and also a big basket of fruit waiting for us. I would highly recommend this place to stay - its close to the town centre (about 2 min walk) and I wouldn't change a thing about the accommodation we stayed in. The people at the apartment were very accommodating. They went out of their way to please us during our stay.", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR671804310", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Kiwitraveller077"}, {"Content": "christ this is a brothel!!!!!!!!!!!!!
