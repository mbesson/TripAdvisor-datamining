So, I stay at very inexpensive hotels near the airport. For several months I stayed at the Travelodge until it became far too much to bear. I have traveled all over the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and spent a decade working in the hospitality industry. By far this is one of the worst hotels in existence. While many air travelers stumble upon this inexpensive option, a notable portion of the clientele is comprised of prostitutes, drug addicts and gang members. For this reason, the property has many security cameras onsite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many of which seem to point directly into guest rooms. The walls are extremely thin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if your neighbor watches television at 3 am, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear it. If a john is beating on a hooker at 3 am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also hear it. If a K-9 unit is searching for a drug suspect, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear it. Guest privacy and security is of little concern to the management. Contrary to privacy standards for many hotels and motels, the front office uses stickers to write the room number on the guest key. If you lose your key and are away from your room, any of the sketchy characters in the neighborhood would know exactly where to try using it. The locks in the room are extremely questionable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some are broken, some require pushing against the door with one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee or a chair in order to get it to lock. With guest room numbers easily seen from the street, anyone can phone your room without going through the front desk. On one occasion I l received a call at 11 pm on the landline in the room. It was a hooker cold calling guest rooms to offer services. I kindly declined but made sure to script the conversation on Facebook. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier to laugh off when you are a single man traveling alone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but if I imagine this would be very disconcerting for families with children or women traveling alone. Cleanliness is also of little concern. The chairs and carpet are horrifically stained \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably with fluids one can easily imagine. On more than one occasion in more than one room I have woken up with bed bug bites. This led me to start traveling with Cedarcide and spraying down the room before I slept in it. The smell is often whatever is being pulled through the bathroom vent. Bathroom drainage and hot water is erratic and varies greatly between guest rooms. I always check in with the same front desk agent who is always rude, defensive and curt. The guest is always the first to initiate a conversation - contrary to the most basic hospitality standards. I have never seen her smile. Once I phoned the hotel from work to ask if I could use the microwave by the front desk for popcorn. Instead of putting me on hold she accidentally left the line active. I listened to her interaction with another guest which was almost identical to my experience. She claimed to not be able to find the reservation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a common issue apparently as I book my reservations 6 weeks in advance and she almost always has difficulty finding it.

Breakfast was less than mediocre: cheap white bread for toast, gas-station style boxed mini danishes, and a cheap version of frosted flakes. No waffles as shown on the hotel website photos. Hotel service was amazingly bad. This wasn't customer service, this was combat. I hung a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door since I didn't think I could trust the cleaning staff alone with my luggage. I asked the front desk clerk for a towel and he snapped back, \"where are the towels in your room, why do you need more?\". Begrudgingly, he said that he would have the towels delivered to my room. After half an hour I asked again if the towels were on the way and he said that the housekeeper had to leave to pick up guests from the airport. I checked back later and found a new front desk clerk that wasn't told that I'd asked for towels. She basically told me there is nothing she can do about it because the last clerk screwed up and that I'd have to wait for a housekeeper to get around to it. Finally, an hour and a half after my initial request, a housekeeper knock on my room door ang hands me a single washcloth and (unsolicited) tells me that if I've been having problems with the staff I need to talk with the morning front desk manager. I walk by the office in the morning to hear the manager literally yelling into a phone as a family with kids waits in the lobby. The staff jumps at every opportunity to put guests on the defensive. Maybe this is a cost saving measure for them as guests are quickly conditioned to not ask for services. If you decide to disregard hotel reviews and stay here bring your own sleeping bag and do not disturb the staff. I was surprised that a large chain like Travelodge would allow such poor service but this hotel obviously doesn't cater to repeat customers (with the possible exception of the prostitutes upstairs).

We flew in from Sacramento to go on a cruise to Alaska. We had found the motel on the internet and figured that it looks ok from the photos that we saw and the price was good. It took us over 45 minutes to get from to the motel waiting for the shuttle. The shuttle driver and woman in the office were rude. We were given a room upstairs on the backside of the property. We had noticed the sign mentioned in above reviews about the safe. We dragged our four suitcases up the stairs after walking clear around the building from wrong directions from staff. We got to the room after passing several rooms with people just hanging out with the doors open. That made us feel uneasy. the security metal pin that the bar latches to keep people from opening the door was broken and missing. We noticed dirty walls and stains on the bed, and bad smell. We realized that this was not a situation that we wanted to put ourselves in. We did a good search on our phone and found a list of other places to stay. We called and eventually found a place that had vacancy's. We notified the office that we were canceling our reservation and stay. We also canceled the reservation for our return trip from our cruise. Not sure if we will get the money back. We had the shuttle driver take us back to the airport. From there, we waited another twenty minutes for the F airfield Inn Shuttle driver to pick us up and took us to the hotel. It cost double the money, but was well worth it.

I should have read the reviews first. I don't know where these other people that say that the hotel is not as bad as some say stayed, but it is EVERY bit as bad as some say. I have the pictures to prove it. When we checked in, the woman behind the front desk was covered in gang tattoos. That should have been my first clue, but not being one to judge, I thought little of it. We got to the room, opened the door and just took a quick glance, because the event that we were in town for was going to start. So we left, and went to Seattle. We left nothing in the room, I don't usually do that even in a nice hotel, and its probably a good thing after reading some reviews. When we came back, it was dark. While we were getting stuff out of our car, some very shady looking people came up and asked my brother for a cigarette. He told them he didn't have any and they walked off. Good thing there was a fence, though. We went into the room, and the first thing my brother found was a piece of burnt brillo pad on top of the mirror. Which for those that don't know, is homemade drug smoking apparatus. Then...we started to look around. The part that comes down and hides the pipes to the sink was broken off the wall. There was some green stuff in the shower drain. The smoke detector, even though hard wired, did not work and we were in a smoking room. There was what appeared to be a blood stain on the floor at the foot of one of the beds. There mattresses had what appeared to be urine and either blood or fecal stains on both of them, and the boxsprings, along with gang graffiti. The bathroom door had been kicked in a time or two, and someone standing at the sink could clearly see someone sitting on the toilet through the large crack between the bathroom door and the frame. The toilet in the room above must have been leaking, because there was a huge water stain above our toilet. There were multiple patches on the walls from what appeared to be fist sized holes. In some other places the paint was peeling off the wall. The light above to table in the room worked if you hit the switch just right, an obvious wiring problem. Thats what prompted me check the smoke detector, which as I said, did not work. Had there been a fire from faulty wiring, I can't say with any certainty that we would have been able to make it out. There was what appeared to be dried vomit on the wall behind the nightstand, and on the floor next to it. There was some black substance smeared on the tv stand in front of the tv. The safe was broken. The floor had NOT been vacuumed. There were some sort of urine(?) stains on both of the chairs, where you sit. I can only imagine when the last time the bedding was washed, or what might have been living in it. I am appalled. I had my 13 yr. old daughter with me. As a mother, I wanted to take her out of there immediately. But being a 7 hr. drive from home, getting in from our event at about midnight, and not having money budgeted for another hotel, we were in a bad position. You do NOT want to sleep in your car in that neighborhood, so we were forced to stay in the room and decided to sleep on top of the blankets.

Nothing decent to eat (i.e. food that wouldn't make me sick or that was even remotely digestible) except raisin bran, but no milk, even when we came back half an hour later.

Parking lot full of long-term airport parking, which is probably the major source of income, since I wouldn't stay here again if it were free. Saved $5 on the way back to the airport 'cause owner in van was waiting for us first thing in the morning on our last day; didn't get to have breakfast because of that, but whatever. I regularly adjusted the curtains for privacy, (I sleep naked, sue me) only to have them readjusted by room service. (Convenient for 'enterprising' folks to case the rooms for valuables, I am guessing) I put my new camera ($135, plus $30 in memory, not to mention about 2 days of my life competitive shopping to get a serious bang for my buck) underneath the bed, left it there, and when I called the front desk to ask them to help me retrieve it, of course, SURPRISE, it wasn't there.

It makes you wonder how it could ever have been ranked #119 of 128 hotels in the area. It seems to me that only Hades could have been panned worse. Actually, the place seemed to me fairly typical of cheap hotels in airport zones in the U.S. I hadn't planned ahead of time to stay in the area, but airtravel difficulties forced me into an unplanned stay in Seattle past 1 a.m. in the morning, and I picked up a copy of the coupon book in the airport to find a cheap place, not looking for Shangri La. I'd tried another cheap place about a month ago in the Seatac area for the same reason, and stayed at America's Best Value Inn on the same highway, just south of the airport rather than north. They had a coupon for a $40 night and the Travelodge had one for $55. I expected it would be somewhat better, but for all intents and purposes the two places are about the same. If you're trying to go cheap, go to the Best Value or the Motel 6, both of which offer rooms for $39.95 a night. I was quoted $59.95 on the phone when I called for availability at Travelodge, but told the man I had a coupon for $54.95 and he said OK. I was never asked to show the coupon. The shuttle came for me without much of a delay, which was fine. The driver was the same as the night deskman. He had to close the office to pick me up. Same situation as the Best Value Inn. Both motels have terrible breakfasts. This place offered wheaties, cheerios, a bagel, pre-packaged cheap muffins like you'd find in a gas station, and a couple of juices. One reviewer complained only dry powder was available for the coffee. I'd suggest using the milk from the carton. It's at the very low end of \"continental breakfasts\", but what do you expect for bottom-feeding rates? I'd say skip it and walk to the pancake house about a half a block away. The airport highway both north and south of the airport isn't exactly a nice neighborhood, no matter how you cut it, and that goes for all sorts of hotels/motels near Seatac. Prostitutes, druggies, and people looking for the same ply the roadway. I found the room to be satisfactory so far as cleanliness went--what furniture there was was cheap motel drab. A round table was provided with two padded chairs. The TV was on top of a dresser. The TV gets cable, but the HBO which is listed on the card is not available. Nevertheless, you could get decent reception, which beats the TV at the alternative Best Value Inn. The bathtub is typical for a cheap place--no way to stop up the water so as to make it unuseable. If you use cheap places in general and like baths it's a good idea to carry your own rubber stopper. I improvised one and had a bath anyway. I didn't experience any horror with the management as others have done, but that may be because I expected nothing and didn't ask. I did have a coffee maker in the room and it worked. There were two bags of caffeinated coffee and none of decaf, which was fine with me. That decaf wasn't available is probably just indicative of sloppy maid service, which you can surely expect at this place. Parking here seems to have been a problem for some. That's probably because the hotel offers travelers flying out of Seatac parking for $6.99 per day whether you stay in the motel or not, which is a very good price for the area. That's why parking is difficult--the places are being taken by people not staying in the motel. No papers are offered. The \"business center\" is a computer with internet access in the office waiting area. For a cheap place to stay in an emergency, this place is all right if you don't expect much. However, the $15 more for this over the Best Value Inn translates into no appreciable difference whatsoever. TV is better here if you're a watcher. I'm not, so didn't care. The Best Value Inn has a 24-hour I-Hop half a block away. There's nowhere near this place late at night except a drive-through MacDonald's a block away. I thought Travelodge was a chain--now I understand it's an independent franchise operation. These folks don't care. Don't expect an average Travelodge. The company should disassociate themselves from this operation--it makes you suspect all of them, although I never expected much of the chain in the first place.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cSurly staff\u201d", "Author": "fishdoc07", "ReviewID": "UR21750700", "Content": "Staff was very unfriendly and unhelpful.

We went into our room and the first smell was of mold, the carpet was still soaked, and large amounts of mold on the window.
