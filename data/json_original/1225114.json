{"Reviews": [{"Content": "New Year's Eve Retreat My husband and I stayed at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle on New Year's Eve so as to avoid exorburant cab fees back to the suburbs. We were really impressed with the high quality of service during check-in, which was a breeze. The room was a King Suite with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on in a hotel in a long while. The room was well appointed and spacious. We had a enough room to pop a bottle of champagne and relax before going out on the town. The on-site food was extremely expensive, however there are a lot of other food options in the near vincinity...we walked across the street to Beni Hana's for a fantastic meal. Unfortunately, the room's mini-bar fridge is not ideal for storing left overs. Check with the front desk for a fridge.Be advised that the demographic we observed at this hotel is 50+, so if you're in for a more relaxed, slower-paced environment...this is the place. Enjoy!", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR286961393", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JustaTravler"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d1225114-r23287166-Fairmont_Olympic_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html", "HotelID": "1225114", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
