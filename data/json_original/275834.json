{"Reviews": [{"Content": "an excellent choice for exploring florence We have just returned from a cycling holiday around many of the beautiful cities and countryside of Italy and a 2 night stay at the Panama Hotel, Florence, was booked in advance for the middle stage of our journey. The hotel is in a convenient location, just on the north of the city centre map, 5 minutes from Fort Basso and about 10 minutes walk into the heart of the city. We were unneccesarily worried about the location being too far, but were pleased with our choice as being in a quiet, stylish area, far enough to escape from the tourist masses but close enough to reach the main sights. Choosing to travel by bicycle throws up many obstacles when deciding on accomodation. Apart from the usual campsites, some hotels aren't so helpful when supplying secure storage for the bikes and often the reception from the staff is not so sympathetic in assisting either. Not so at the Panama. We were greeted warmly by the man on reception who opened some ornate electrically operated gates at the side of the hotel, that revealed a lovely landscaped courtyard and parking area for the guests which was very secure (cctv screens)- no need to lock the bikes at all! and no 'surprise ' parking charges like some of the more central hotels with limited space.We then checked in and went to our room.We had booked a double room direct on the hotels website for 100 euros per night, (the rates were cheaper than through any other agent) and found ourselves in a suite with an inner hallway (with chaise longue) and then through into a large bedroom and spacious bathroom. both the bedroom and hall were linked by an outside balcony which caught the sun all afternoon.The rooms are spotlessly clean, quiet, cool (self regulated air conditioning) and tastefully decorated in a classical style.We later noticed the room rate displayed in the hotel room for our suite was for 190 euros a night! - seems we got a bargain!We would recommend this hotel as a great value accomodation in what can be an expensive city.Our room had the usual expensive mini bar (but they are geat for keeping your own drinks cold) free satellite tv and a telephone.The hotels is extremely peaceful and friendly, with 24 hour reception, a free city map is given and they spoke very good english.Our only disappointment was breakfast, because the hotel was so nice we were expecting a fantastic feast...but as with most of the hotels in italy it was breads and spreads with excellent coffee.Tips for Florence.....We booked ahead for the Academia (david) and Uffizi...you'l be glad you did...although we gave away our Uffizi booking to a very grateful couple at the back of a 3 hour waiting queue (with a booking you got nearly straight in). We chose to spend the day outdoors strolling the beautiful streets.Piazza Michelangelo is a short uphill trek from Ponte Vecchio, but worth it for some great city views and photos.Whilst over the bridge check out the Boboli gardens for a quiet retreat and the streets around Oltrano and Piazza Santa Spirito, where there are studios and workshops and gorgeous tavernas and restaurants.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR771120799", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Bon souvenir       cour int\u8305rieure (parking et 2\u732bme bat. chambres)", "Date": "Aug 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR160957462", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "valy64"}, {"Content": "CLIENTI SODDISFATTI.
