As it was a 'big' birthday for my husband last year, we did look for alternative hotels but couldn't find anything to match the location and value for money at the Relais Saint Jacques. We stayed Dec 2-6th 2011. We booked a superior / deluxe room and whilst compact (particulalrly the bathroom) everything was clean and in good working order and the bed was very comfortable. Mini bar and flat screen TV (supposed to have been a trouser press but there was just an indentation on the wall where this should have been), bath/shower, toilet and hairdyer, tea and coffee making facilities. We also had a blacony which would be fabulous in milder months. i believe the hotel had changed ownership relatively recently and the public areas were in the process of being redecorated and we weren't able to access the small bar for a nightcap - however, the decor looked really nice! We booked room only this time and it was a refreshing choice as we got up when we felt like without having to meet designated times - there were loads of bakeries and coffee shops nearby. Great location - we walked everywhere and were happily exhausted at the end of our 5 day stay. Very helpful and pleasant reception staff always willing to assist. We'd definitely return again. As it was a special occasion, I booked a private transfer from the airport to hotel and vice versa. However, next time we will definitely use the RER as it is so close.

The double glazed windows effectively blocked the street noise of the whizzing Vespas, but could be thrown open to the pleasant morning sounds of school children and University students bustling by. The attractive lounge provided guide books and comfortable chairs. We were grateful for the free wifi in our room. The metro was a short walk away, and we chose to head out every morning rather than eat breakfast in, so as not to waste a minute of our stretch of spring weather.

The decor is just a little bit on the tired side, and the rooms are small (but if you're from NYC you'll think they are completely normal). Nevertheless, the hotel was better equipped than the fancy chain hotel we visited in Germany just before coming to Paris. We appreciated the Molton Brown toiletries, free WiFi, coffee maker, flat screen TV, linen wallpaper, roomy drawers, extra mirrors, and wall-mounted pants press(!). The air conditioning was actually strong, unlike any I've experienced in Europe, and the so was the blowdryer. The hotel has a quaint sitting-room with a library of cast-offs from other travelers. Again, we really liked the staff, who were soft-spoken and respectful, on-site even in the wee hours when we left for the airport, and kind enough to give us directions, recommend shops, call us a taxi, and lend us adapters when ours didn't work.

We stayed in room 402 for three nights from the 19th January 2008. The room was lovely and one of the cleanest and quietest we have ever stayed in. The room itself is not that large and the bathroom is very small. However there was plenty of hot water with clean towels and room service everyday. There is a TV in the room with CNN and BBC World Service and located beneath the tv cabinet was the safe which is free and the minibar which is reasonably priced for a Paris Hotel. We did not have breakfast in the hotel because it costs 18 euors extra. The staff at the hotel are excellent and speak perfect English, there is someone at the desk 24 hours a day, and they are very knowledgeable of what to see and where to go in Paris. We chose the hotel because of the previous good reviews on trip advisor and the location. From leaving the airport at Charles De Gaulle, we caught the RER B train which takes you to the Luxembourg Station. This route is direct and you do not need to change trains and the cost is 8 euros each way. You walk out from the underground Luxembourg station following the Exit sign (sortie) for Rue De l'Abee. When you arrive at ground level walk on for about 15 metres turn left and walk for about another 150 metres and the hotel is on your right hand side. Next to the hotel is a restaurant and cafe and not much else. We walked down to St Michel Place which takes about ten minutes (or you can catch the RER B train from Luxembourg Station to St. Michel Place) that's where the lively nightlife of the latin quarter is situated. We ate in restaurants which had dinner for 15 euros for a choice of three courses and the bars have a happy hour between 18.00 and 21.00 hours or you could grab a gyro (greek kebab) for about five euros. Drinks were about 8 euros for a pint of larger and between 15 - 20 euros for a bottle of wine. This area of Paris I would recommend for its lively and friendly atmosphere and good value for money in what is possibly the worlds most expensive city. We found the best way to see the City is the open top bus tour which is 28 euros for a 2 day ticket and we also used the metro and RER where you can buy 10 tickets for 10 euros (this is called a carnet).

I just didn't commit as I had no idea about it except for Tripadvisor.com reviews. Since I noticed that TA had recent favorable reviews I decided to take a chance and book a room for my summer visit. Luckily my visit coincided with a summer special the hotel runs yearly. I was lucky to get a room with a Pantheon view including full breakfast for 140 euro. Standard rates are between 160 to 200+ euro. I knew that the hotel was not located next to the Seine, but it was a good choice nonetheless. It's a few blocks from the always busy Blvd. St. Michel and the Luxembourg Gardens. It takes about 15 minutes to walk down to the Seine. Upon entering the hotel the reception desk is just that, a desk. To its right is the sitting room/bar where the decor is classical French. The breakfast room is down the hall and the elevator can hold four people easily so it's not coffin size as usual. When you enter your floor you will notice piped in music playing in the foyer. The Prestige rooms are wonderful. They are a bit larger than the standard rooms but are smaller than the suite. Ask for a room that has a Pantheon view. I got room #403 that had a nice view of the dome and of rue Gay Lussac. Besides the view the rooms are decorated with nice antiques. It's simple and there is no toile involved thank God. If you like French classical style decor then you will appreciate the furnishings. Also the bathrooms are complete in rust colored marble countertops that are so spacious it's sinful. There are generous supplies of bath gel, shampoo, and the requisite shower caps, shoe shine sponge, sewing kit, Q-tips, and makeup remover pads. BTW, the Relais Saint Jacques' bathrooms have 'real' hairdryers and not the 'vacuum cleaner' types which are nothing more than a hose that blows out hot air! The breafast is not included unless you got a summer special like me. In that case you're entitled to either a complimentary American buffet breakfast or a continental breakfast in the room. It's a fair spread at the buffet: boiled eggs, cold cuts, cereals, fresh fruits, viennoiseries, baguettes, fried eggs, sausages, yogurt, orange juice, tea, and coffee or hot chocolate. Also this is the only hotel that I've stayed in Paris that if you request it, you can check out at 1 p.m. The staff is polite and approachable, not overly friendly except for Sayma who will chat with you about anything. It was the time just after the London bombings, and as luck had it the day after I arrived there was another set of bombings. Sayma and I talked of it as I had to travel by train and was a bit apprehensive. I received the hotel's excellent summer rate special as I visited Paris in July, one of the low season months. The Prestige room wtih Pantheon view was 140 euro including either American buffet or continental breakfast. Normal rates for this particular type of room is 235 euro with the breakfast charge being 17 euro! Note: There is a well-regarded restaurant, Le Mauzac, located next door to the hotel.

Staff - Extremely kind, helpful English-speaking (if necessary) staff. 2. Environment - Cute hotel, clean and, contrary to what a previous reviewer said, the furnishings in our room and in the hotel overall were not outdated. I found they were appropriate for the design of the building and created a cozy atmosphere. 3. Location - Great location, near the Luxemborg Gardens and Notre Dame. 4. Very clean - There were always clean towels, the bed was made and the room was kept very tidy. A+ Cons: 1. No free Wi-fi access - There is no free Wi-fi access in all rooms - even though it is listed as a feature on many sites. This was essential in my decision and I was really let down. When \" Wi-fi access in all rooms\" is written on a site, it doesn\u00c2\u00b4t always mean free, but on the site through which I made the reservation (and many others), it said free. However, when I got there, I was told that access was 5 Euros per half hour - absurd! At the Internet cafe nearby it was 80 cents per hour. Next time I will send an e-mail and confirm that it is free. 2. Breakfast too expensive - I think breakfast is 18 Euros per person, better to go to a nearby bakery and get something. 3. Phones don\u00c2\u00b4t seem to work properly - I tried to call a few places within Paris and didn\u00c2\u00b4t get through using the hotel phone, however managed to on my mobile phone.
