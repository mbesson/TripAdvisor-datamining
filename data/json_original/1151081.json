I was in town for 4 nights on business and 3 more for pleasure. It was not fancy, but either was the price. Save your money for touring and stay here! Quite a small balcony, but it was overlooking the ocean--fantastic! The pool closed really early, like 5 pm. So we didn't get to use it, but it looked pretty! The beach that is right across the highway was messy-- trash and tree debris washed up on the beach made it not a good place to walk. And there's no swimming there. So, that's kind of a bummer. So if you're wanting a \"beach\" hotel, this isn't it, although it is right across the highway from the beach. Bedding is nice; white down comfortors and bed itself were very comfy. The staff was helpful. I don't expect a full concierge service of course! But everyone from front desk to housekeeping to breakfast people were helpful. There was a computer and printer easily available. Breakfast was nice. Eggs and meat, waffles, etc. Always refilled, fresh, and well stocked. A bonus! A few nights there were loud and rowdy guests, and some road noise b/c it is right on the highway. But otherwise it is quiet. It is in a mostly residential neighborhood; it really feels like you're in Puerto Rico (rather than in some resort area that could be anywhere in the world). Get a feel for the community and stay here, not in the super-touristy spots. The only thing that was a 'negative' is that our shower curtain was a few inches shorter than the rim on the tub, so water hits the shower curtain and goes outside the tub, flooding the bathroom floor. A couple days we didn't get a bath mat, so it was a bit of a mess. A longer shower curtain would take care of the issue.

Need a vehicle since it takes about 20-25 mins. from the SJ Airport. Taxi will cost you $50-60/one way. Easy access to any place from this location. Basic needs are meet in this hotel-nice clean bed and rooms look clean. Pictures on the internet are deceiving-rooms are very small. No hot water at the time that I stayed, cable TV was not available, but wi-fi was functional. Parking is limited but back-up parking is available within one minute-no charge for parking. Breakfast was great, but stay away from the milk(locally produced, taste?, possible stomach issues). rest of the breakfast is good. Lots of noise in the morning since it is next to a major intersection. Additional charges on final bill(normal in any hotel in PR. Some hotels call it resort fee). Restaurant on the 6th floor. One mexican and seafood restaurant right across the street. I did not eat there but was told that all restaurants were good. If you want to safe money and planning to be out most of the day and only go to the hotel to sleep and have a quick breakfast in the morning, then this is the place to stay. If you want to have the luxuries that you expect from the US hotel chains then stay close to the airport, within walking distance to the beach(plenty of hotels but very pricey). If you rent a car stop by the Pueblo Grocery Store right after you exit the airport(ask for directions-it is easy and I strongly recommend). Get some basics-juices, sodas, snacks.

If you are looking to party all night, then you should stay in the heart of San Juan or Old San Juan, but if you would like a little get away where things slow down just a bit, then this is well worth looking into.

The rooms also have a very contemporary look in terms of the decor and come equiped with flat panel TVs, a very comfortable bed, plenty of pillows, and all of the extras like hair drier, iron, etc. Most importantly, the rooms were very clean - although that is something I would expect from a place so new the paint was barely dry. The restaurant is conveniently located on the top level and was actually pretty good. The accordion player on duty was very friendly and the waitstaff made me feel comfortable. If you are on a budget but want assuarance that you'll get a clean room and a good nights rest,, albeit a bit of a drive, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved this Hotel....STAY HERE!\u201d", "Author": "andreasmommie", "ReviewID": "UR20727876", "Content": "10/3/2008 - 10/6/2008 This is a 20 minute ride from the airport in San Juan, (taxi is $50). If you want to get away from the tourism this is the place to go. You will see everyday people going to/from work and going out to dinner. But you will still feel like you are on vacation! This is a new hotel less than a year old. Nicely decorated with a modern decor. Clean as a whistle! The rooms are simply nice.... you can't ask for more! To top it all off...you can't beat the price. Continental breakfast was very good. Waffles, muffins, fruit, cereal.....you get the point. The staff was very nice and helpful. They were even patient allowing me to praticar espanol. Across the street is the beach. I would recommend walking down about 1/4 mile to get in the water, but you are not allowed to swim. It is beautiful. Or travel down to the next light and you will be in Punta Salina. The beach there is even better. There are places to eat across the street. Eat at the taco place and at a restaurant around the corner called Restaurante Meson de Playa. GREAT FOOD there! Try the food from the vendors along the road for authentic food. 1. Go to Casa de Bacardi - Tour with two free drinks 2. Go to El Morro in Old San Juan - travel to Catano and take free ferry across. I LOVED this hotel and I LOVED my stay in Puerto Rico!", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn & Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d1151081-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Suites-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$126 - $185*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Del Valle Ave. 1829</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Levittown</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Juan</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00949</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1151081", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f1/54/f154b65ed30229e5a71c3c5bd0b5dd621large.jpg"}}
