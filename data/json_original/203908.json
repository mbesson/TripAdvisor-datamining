No amount of money is worth a stay at this hotel.I have traveled with student groups for many years, and the Byron Hotel is absolutely the worst hotel that I have ever visited.Water was literally pouring in the rooms from the ceiling above.Dank musty odors filled the rooms and hallways.Rude female staff member was unpleasant to all.Breakfast food was mediocre at best.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR111145844", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "junebug1955"}, {"Content": "NEVER come back!

The staff were rude and unhelpful, the rooms tiny and dirty and our double bed was two extremely uncomfortable camper beds pushed together! The bathroom was the tiniest ive ever seen.

Hotel was centrally located about 50 metres from the main station and about a 8 minute walk to the main 'tourist' area. Positives: Hotel was clean and price I paid for a double was very good (much less than what they quote on their web page). Staff were pleasant, and there was a pc with free internet connectionRoom is large with high ceilingsNegatives: Is in a noisy location, so you should ask for a room at the back if you want to be able to sleep (i had this, and it was fine). Breakfast was very average, and beds were extremely soft (I had 3 singles beds in the room, and one was not possible to sleep in due to the springs). Also like most hotels in italy, you hear the toilet and shower of the other rooms, and the people walking around. Overall: If you are looking for a cheap centrally located hotel then this will do you, if though you want luxury etc, I would not suggest this.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR985214459", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JenM72"}, {"Content": "2 star hotel, not 3 We stayed here from the 24-27th Sept. 2006. our room was on the 3rd floor, luckily not overlooking the street, which is busy all day  night.It's located near the station in quite a seedy place, popular with immigrants.It only deserves 2 stars. It probably got 3 stars based on the facilities it offers, which are listed on its website but please read my comments for each entry:TV color SAT - 17 inch screen, very small  very few channelsFrigobar - meaning empty fridge (not at all a \u9225\u6e28ell-equipped mini-bar\u9225?as stated on their welcome page)Direct dial Telephone - but no phone instructions, not even front desk's numberFree email receiving service - I have no idea what this meansHairdryer / Cosmetic mirror - mirror with 2 great big cracks through itKettle - 4 sachets of sugar  2 of instant coffee, which are never replenishedOpenable window - to let in the mosquitoes  pigeonsPrivate facilities \u9225?again, I have no idea what this meansAir-conditioned - huge air conditioner fitted on the wall, which is so noisy it keeps you awake when on. Same thing with the ceiling fan.The breakfast consists of: Pre-packaged brioche/croissantsTea  coffee (the coffee tasted awful and strange)A plate with sliced processed cheese (one type only) and another plate with processed cold meat (also only one type) A selection of yoghurts, which were warmCereals: 2 dispensers, both filled with corn flakes! An apple pie that tasted home baked and was deliciousFresh juices: grapefruit juice and a mixed fruit juice that was reddish in colour and was too acidic to drinkThe breakfast room was small and had too many tables.The only toiletries in the bathroom are: Toilet paperFacial tissues2 x sachets of all-in-one shampoo/shower gel2 x small bars of soapThe shower curtain was too long and we ended up standing on it while showering. Whatever we did, water still managed to seep onto the bathroom floor.Our shower wasn\u9225\u6a9b working properly, the hand basin was blocked and the pillows were old and flat. We reported this to the front desk and it was dealt with very promptly.The bidet never worked, but we forgot to report it!On our last night, guests in a room adjacent to ours decided to play their TV at full blast at 3am, waking us up. We called front desk and nothing was done about it. Eventually, we had to go and deal with the guests ourselves. It was not nice, especially as they were on drugs, but they did quieten down. The hotel rack rate is \u9227?80 single and \u9227?20 double but I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b pay more than \u9227?0 per room to stay here. I\u9225\u6a93 Italian myself and I\u9225\u6a93 sad to say that this hotel casts a very negative light on Italian hospitality.We'll never stay here again.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR159642578", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "NMRK"}, {"Content": "Do not stay here!

The room is tall and hollow and basically a cement chamber! Maybe this creepy hotel had some influence upon my overall impression of Florence, but overall I was not impressed and don't wish to return.
