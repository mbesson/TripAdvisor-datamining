The executive room offers you a lot of benefits such as breakfast, tea/coffee through out the day and the happy hours in the evening which is a true value for money.

I was upgraded to the executive floor and also given discount vouchers for breakfast and complimentary airport pick-up and drop, which was very convenient. The staff are very helpful and attentive and are quite well trained. What is very refreshing is they help without expecting tips in return which is unlike many other hotels. The location in Deira is convenient if you want a hotel close to the airport. It is a 20-30 min drive away from the major shopping malls but the Deira city centre is about 10-15 min by taxi. Deira has a number of cheap restaturants so if you are on a budget and dont want to spend money in the hotel, then you will have many options. If you are on business and have meetings on sheikh zayed road or in jumeriah beach area then I would advise leaving a bit early. I only ate twice in the hotel and both times the food quality was average. The vegetable soup in the al-shindagah restaurant in the lobby was extremely disappointing and powdery and felt like it was from a ready-to-cook sachet. The chicken biryani I ordered from room service was slightly better but not by a lot as the chicken felt dry and not well-marinated. The rooms are clean, spacious and well stocked with amenities. Air-conditioning is noiseless. Housekeeping services are top notch. Internet costs 20 dirhams per hour which is a bit steep but the speed is pretty good. Check-in was done in a jiffy. The billing took a while during check-out but that was only because it was being done by a trainee who was still learning the ropes. It was all done with a smile so it was no problem.

If the hotel management ever look at guest reviews, this is an area of immediate improvement. I must say that our stay was tainted by a totally unhelpful member of staff who refused to consider our floor request and requirements. Guest Relations had to step in and could not do enough to atone for the check-in experience and the should be commended! Meals - Breakfast was nothing to write home about - literally, lacking in real choice. There appeared to be a choice of restaurants at the hotel, but after sampling room service on out first night, we decided to explore the variety and choice in Dubai. Location - do not stay at this hotel if you want to be close to Sheikh Zayed road or Jumeirah. It is located less than a 20 min drive from the airport (about AED30 by taxi, cheaper on the return). The gym is well kitted out. Rooms were adequate- more high end 4 star. Rooms at the back had a horrendous view of a construction site!

When I landed, I followed the hotel's instructions and located the area where I was supposed to be met by the shuttle driver. No one was there. I found the hotel's airport hospitality booth and walked in to discuss my dilemma. Well, I learned that despite having provided all my flight details to the hotel to arrange my pick-up, the hotel policy is not to actually send the driver until you check in at the hospitality counter at the airport. This is utterly ridiculous and adds at least another half hour (waiting time) to your trip! For someone who had traveled over 18 hrs already, and given it was already after 9:30pm, this was a huge inconvenience and it also made me angry! Why ask for flight details if you're not going to have your driver be there at the airport to greet your guests? Nonetheless, I was stuck. The hospitality counter worker told me the driver would arrive in 15 min, but that 15 min turned into 25 min and I was still at the airport. I'd finally had enough and told the clerk to try to contact the driver again for an update. Well, turns out he had arrived but was waiting curbside for me and just never bothered to call the clerk to advise her. The clerk at the counter, rightly recognizing my frustration, ended up helping me tote all my bags through the airport, out the exit and across the street where the driver was chatting on his cell phone. Wow. And no apology, nothing, for being late. Later, when we arrived at the hotel, I tried checking in and was told the hotel wanted to bill my credit card up front for my entire stay. What? At that point, I was so exhausted I didn't care but I made it known that this was not normal practice and that it felt insulting to be asked to do this. I went up to my room on the 9th floor and was disappointed. The color scheme was orange and a garish marigold yellow. The bathroom sink, countertop and shower were not very clean. The countertop still had water stains from where someone else's glass had left a mark. The shower had hair in it. When I finally went to bed, thinking at this point that nothing more could go wrong, I was shocked to discover the bed mattress (if you can call it that) must have been made of steel. It was the hardest, most unforgiving, most uncomfortable bed I have ever \"slept\" in. I say \"slept\" because I was unable to get comfortable, tossed and turned all night and woke up sore. By the way, my \"view\" from this executive club room was atrocious...nothing but old, worn buildings as far as I could see. Trying to give the hotel another chance the next morning, I got up and went to the \"club\" floor to have breakfast. It was deserted. The waiter working there noted it would be better to go to the main dining area to eat because there was a better selection there (the club level had only cold cereal and juice available because...no one usually ate there...gee, wonder why!). He then offered for me to stay in the club area and that he could go down to the lobby area restaurant to make a plate for me. Not knowing what was offered for breakfast plus finding the request nice but weird, I grudgingly went to the main area to eat. This area was nice but not nearly as quiet or private as I would have liked (and as the club area was). Nonetheless, breakfast was decent and the staff there was nice. In addition to above and the generally, overall unpleasantness of the hotel, I also encountered problems with the level of noise at night on my floor as well as with the hotel's internet service. First of all, the noise...I stayed 4 nights here. On 3 nights, after 10:30pm, inexplicably, the hotel maintenance crew would work on my floor. Between their loud conversations and banging noises (coupled with the already totally unsleepable bed noted above), I was unable to fall asleep. Each night I probably called the front desk 2-3 times to beg them to help and to have their workers do their work at more reasonable hours. The staff always said they would take care of it but the noise lasted at least an hour each night. Completely unacceptable! Second...internet service..for USD 20 per day, you would expect fast and consistent service. Um, no. The hotel's server or network kept going down for hours at a time. This happened on two days. I asked why this wasn't fixed/addressed as guests were being charged a lot of money each day for a service which, essentially, the hotel was not providing. I got no response to this. Overall, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. There are hundreds of hotels in Dubai. Stay elsewhere. Oh, and to say this is a 5-star hotel is completely laughable. I'd rate it a 2 star.

Must-sees in Dubai include the \"At The Top\" experience at the Burj Khalifa tower (you must pre-book, or pay four times as much at the door), the dancing fountain at the Dubai Mall, a Dubai city tour and a Dhow evening cruise with dinner. Dubai is a modern, cosmopolitan and crowded city, and a trip out to the desert, either to the east coast or to Al Ain, are great ways of seeing more of the country. These trips also show the extreme contrasts between urban Dubai with its modern skyscrapers and the rest of the country. The winter months are certainly the best time to visit Dubai, as the weather is warm and pleasant through the day. During the summer, the extreme heat would make it quite unpleasant to stay outside for any length of time. When we visited (February), the temperature was a very pleasant 20 or 21 degrees or so through the day, although sweaters or a jacket were needed in the evenings.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackburn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a five star hotel!\u201d", "Author": "acepower84", "ReviewID": "UR93745477", "Content": "I booked my honeymoon for Dubai and decided to pick the Metropolitan Palace with LetsGo2 Travel.

Upon arrival at 8am after a gruelling overnight flight we were told that our room wasn't available until 2 unless we wanted to pay more - fairly standard - however our bags had already been whisked away. We were left shatered and jet-lagged to our own devises and not offered any refreshments. Reception then told us we could check in at 11am after all. So after wondering the streets for a few hours we returned at 11 to be told by reception that our room had been ready for an hour which miffed us given that we'd been clock watching for the last few hours. Our room was a bit problematic -a smoking room when we'd requested non-smoking. The curtains didn't shut properly and the do not disturb switch didn't work. This resulted in fawlty towers-esque farce as we were disturbed on numerous occassions by (very nice) staff wanting to turn the bed down, deliver us fruit, etc when all we wanted was to get a few hours kip. We asked reception if they could sort out the problems and they decided that we should move rooms. This turned into another farce as the porters did not turn up as promised. After waiting 20 minutes we ended up going back down to reception and finally the porters were dispatched but it took about an hour to move rooms when we would have been quite happy to move ourselves and get on with our holiday! On departure we ended up accidentally getting an unregistered taxi because the door staff were too busy faffing about with a coach party who had just arrived. On the plus side, the hotel is close to the airport and the tube station. The bar staff at the open top bar at the top of the hotel were excellent with brilliant advice and recommendations and the small swiming pool and single sex sauna/jacussi/steam room were very nice. The english bar inside the hotel was ok but subject to random elitism. We were told on several occassions that the nicest tables were reserved and noted that these were never occupied which simply seemed a bit daft. You should also note that there is not much outside the immediate vicinity of the hotel which is in a financial district so choice of restaurants & bars etc. is limited unless you want to get a taxi.

We arrived at 02.00 in the morning from Bangkok aboard the new A380 800 Super-jumbo very quiet, almost silent plane - nice. No problem with hotel check in at this late hour. Very polite and efficient lobby and reception staff. We were in our room fast. The hotel has 11 floors. 1 - reception, a restaurant, a few shops etc. Mezzanine floor and 1st floor - more restaurants and conference facilities. 2-7 are standard rooms. 8-10 are executive rooms with their own lounge. 11 is the pool and gym. 4 lifts. Room was a reasonable size. Flat screen TV, plenty of storage space. Fridge with drinks. Silly, silly prices even for a hotel minibar. Nice large and comfy bed. Fruit in room. Free water. Good, well equipped bathroom. Only one robe!! In room safe was operated by a credit card. The digital ones are better. With this type of safe, you have to keep a credit card on you at all times to open it, when often you want the card in the safe!! Defeats the object really. Though better than nothing. Turn down service with nice chocolates. Hair dryer, but no iron. Nice, though fairly small pool. Good padded loungers. towels available at gym reception. The area has a small bar and snack bar. All very clean and tidy, with 2 attendants looking after you. The gym was well equipped with plenty of TV's to keep boredom at bay. Separate rooms for male & female for steam room, sauna, hot tub, Made the mistake of ordering 2 small beers - over 60d. Breakfast was excellent with a very good selection of everything you could think of. If you want to buy food/groceries etc, there is a small supermarket behind the hotel. Go to the lobby and go past the hairdressers and out the rear entrance. Supermarket is opposite. We did not eat in the hotel in the evening. The hotel restaurants were empty. Again silly prices. Directly opposite the entrance, across the road is a very nice Egyptian restaurant. Huge portions. Great mezzas and kebabs. downstairs a cafe, upstairs a bit more formal. Very busy with a nice atmosphere. Plenty of other restaurants in the streets behind the hotel. Head towards the new IBIS hotel, or past the Taj. We tried Lebanese and Iranian. All very good and at reasonable prices. We took a cab on day to the recently opened Burj Kalifa tower. Not really open yet and the viewing gallery is closed (currently indefinitely). Not to worry, still massively impressive building. Go at night when the musical dancing fountains are running (Bellagio style) - great fun and very impressive. A new show every 20 min and free. We had a lovely meal overlooking the Burj. This will become the main tourist area of Dubai without doubt. Lots of chic restaurants. A stunning area. Dubai does not have much to offer a repeat visitor, apart from its location to break up a long haul journey and its winter climate. I was expecting to be bored after Cambodia & Thailand, but we had a fine 4 nights here. Hotel was what we expected for a 5* in Dubai. Very plush with good service. The location is fine if you don't want to be out at the beach. We've done that and your just too far away. You can walk to the Creek in 2 minutes and there are lots of restaurants nearby.

The room was beautiful and was cleaned twice a day, the enormous bed was really comfortable with feather duvets and pillow's, which was changed daily. As were the towels, bath robes. Slippers, fruit basket and bottled water. The mini bar in the room was expensive, however this true of all hotel mini bars. The hotel service was beyond compare.

The hotel has nice pool on the roof which is tad small but def does the job, there is a gym with running machine, weights, spa bath and sauna.I didnt have any meals included but thanks to reading reviews of this hotel i walked 100yrs to the left of hotel and bought tonnes of stuf for breakfast from a local supermarket for no more than \u00a37 that last nearly the full 5 days, be aware the hotel charges \u00a310 just for breakfast thats everyday! The rooms are decent size nice bathrooms and quiet, i got decent sleep on the 5th floor. The hotel is only 5 min walk from the Dubai creek and a water bus gets you across the water to the sooks (a must see) if your going by taxi anywhere always get taxis with cream bodies some have red or green roofs the hotel taxi is a bit pricey, forget buses they are almot none existant . The price to Jumeriah beach by taxi was 30 dirhams or \u00a36 the journey time is 20mins i would advise the Jumeriah beach park as this is suitable for tourist s who want to show a bit of skin, be warned the migrant workers will stop there JCB's, cranes, to look at women and at one point my partner was being watched by 30+ men whos mind dont need reading lol bizzare. Dont waste anytime in Dubai every minute should be used to explore this wonderful magical place. If you like a drink get ready the average price is \u00a37 a pint ... enjoy!", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "kittenne", "ReviewID": "UR28389486", "Content": "We have just returned from a week's break in Dubai, and we stayed at the Metropolitan Palace for 7 nights. I will admit I was a bit worried about the choice of hotel having read some of the reviews on this site, but I can honestly say we had a great experience and would definitely return to this hotel if we go back to Dubai. Even though we arrived at the hotel at 9am after travelling overnight they let us check into our room an hour later, and on departure day let us keep our room for two extra hours as our flight wasn't until late afternoon for no extra charge. The staff were very friendly and attentive - my only criticism was that some of them had very limited English which made being understood quite difficult at times (there was a function at the hotel one night and we could hear the music in our room, we rang down to complain but no-one understood what we were saying!) The rooftop pool was gorgeous and never too busy - we always managed to get a sun-lounger. Breakfast was great - a good selection of food, but we didn't eat any other meals in the hotel. I used the gym several times and was impressed - much better and bigger than a normal hotel gym and again never too busy. It is in the north end of Dubai, i.e \"old town\" Dubai so yes it isn't as plush as say staying around the marina or Jumeirah Beach, but it is a fraction of the price of some of those hotels, and a very easy taxi ride from wherever you want to go. One night we took a cab to Atlantis on The Palm island - it took 20 minutes and cost about \u00a310 - and that is literally the other end of the city. The decor and rooms are looking a little dated now (again compared to some of the other true luxury hotels in Dubai) but if you are looking to stay in Dubai without spending thousands then the Metropolitan Palace is perfect.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNot a 5 star!\u201d", "Author": "slowcoachme", "ReviewID": "UR27235249", "Content": "Just back from a week in MPH.

The buffet breakfast was pretty standard, without any variation. The decor is dark and dated, and there should be more seating in lobby area. There is no snack or coffee bar, only expensive restaurants. The location is good, just a short walk to the creek. There is a store at the back of the hotel, buy anything you need from there, tin of coke is 1dh, room service tin of coke 17dh!! Most of the other guests were Iranian and I saw them coming back at night with bags full of takeaway food!! The pool area on roof is small but OK, and wasnt crowded. There is no tea or coffee making stuff in the room, no kettle either. The City Center Mall is nearby and they send a minibus to the hotel to take you there, a bit cramped but saves on taxi fares.

I was too busy to notice since I had booked the holiday then went straight back to the library to study for exams - although finding out at like midnight, after a 7 hour flight isn't the best thing, but we got over this. The room was really good - although of course this was my first stay in Dubai ever - the beds were spacious, bathroom was clean and organised, we had a room right at the end so it was definitely quiet, the view from our room wasn't the best but we could still see the marina and some other parts that weren't covered by other massive buildings! Breakfast served (when we paid for it one day) was excellent, loads to choose from hot and cold - other days we just waited till lunchtime and had a big meal (thank you hardees! :P) The location is decent - its around 15-20 mins drive from the airport I remember. To be honest I'd recommend renting a car - we decided to do this after waiting 2 hours for a taxi, and instead of going to our original location we thought we'd go to the airport and get a car - made the trip MUCH better since we had the freedom to pretty much go anywhere - we even drove to abu dhabi and back one night. The hotel run a free valet parking service which made this even more useful, and the renting rates are pretty affordable. (By the way if getting car rental from the airport - make sure you do so upon arrival, apparently the only way to get to the car rental shops is when you've just arrived in the airport, which is silly - we cheekily sneaked past security through the exits to get in, they saw us, shouted at us as we walked away, then just turned around! lol...) What else - ah yeh the staff were ok-ish, to be honest having read other reviews here I'm surprised - but then again I may have gone at a lower-profile time where things were more relaxed. We didn't bother going to the restaurant as we thought it was quite expensive. Altogether the staff were good and responsive - service provided and help provided were good - not excellent (could've provided better maps! We searched high and low for a map and ended up still having to use the one the hotel gave us... Ah well.) I'd recommend this for first-timers in Dubai, my next hotel in Dubai will definitely be Jumeirah beach! For sharwarma lovers if you wander around the back areas of the hotel - ther's a few cafes which do it for like, 3/4 Dh! Thats 50p! And they still taste brilliant Eat your heart out edgware road :P Also there's a cool swimming pool on the roof with a jacuzzi, as well as a gym, steam room and sauna if I'm not mistaken, all were pretty good - the gym only really has a decent weights area, the rest is pretty standard Check it out, if its your first time.

My wife and I, together with our baby, had to then ask someone at a kiosk for help, who was very kind to call the hotel, who unfortunately said the pick was not on their computer system. We then took a local taxi, whose advice not to take private or hotel taxis were very helpful as it saved us from overpaying for transport during our stay. Upon hearing our ordeal, we were offered a Suite which consisted of two TVs and a separate living room with very comfortable sofas. The following day we requested a Superior room in case they forget and we get charged for the Suite! We didnt get the fruit basket till next day but it was merely a bowl, nothing like a hamper or even a basket. The fruits were good though! We requested a cot which we got upon request. The ensuite was clean but the shower in the bath didnt work properly. The towels and bedsheets were changed everyday and room cleaned as usual. Room service was excellent, so was the breakfast, dinner and tea we occassionally ordered. We got a lot of pleasure out of get these services so didnt hesitate to give the staff tip everytime we needed something. We kept forgeting to buy washing liquid to clean our baby's bottles so we kept ordering it through room service which cost us lots of tips which also felt good. The staff were very friendly, excellent throughout including the doormen at the entrance who always helped us get taxis and give advice where to go. The receptionists were superb. The best thing about the hotel was its close proximity to the Gold Souk, great Indian restaurants, Museum and currency exchange bureaus who offered very good rates for \u00a3! I am glad we took local taxis to visit places like Jumeirah which felt great. On our last day we hired a local taxi for the whole day to give us a tour of places we hadnt visited and it only cost us 350 dhirams which is only \u00a350. You'd be lucky to reach central London from Heathrow with this amount by a black cab?! Although we missed most breakfasts, the few that we did eat were very pleasant an experience and in gastronomy. The breakfast buffet here is better than most five star hotels in Spain except that it finishes at 10.30am so if you wake up late due to a late night out you have to take advantage of the all the great restaurants nearby which are very reasonably priced. The only thing I wasnt happy with was the pricing of designer goods in department stores. They vary little in comparison to prices in London. But shopping is best experienced in diamond selling jewellers where you pay less than what one would for gold! Great to see harmony between people of so many races. Not happy at all seeing some British tourists behaving uncourteously with people, eg not giving tips and giving up a taxi for a family with a baby.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cok place to stay\u201d", "Author": "PussycatEngland", "ReviewID": "UR14847843", "Content": "stayed for 4 nights 1-4 april.

We chose to stay in a central location however if I was going back I would stay in a beach hotel. THere is not much to see in the city and there is a tour bus which you can join at all the major beach hotels that will bring you to the deira city shopping centre fromt here you can get the red tour bus which tours the city. I would definitlely recommend this, the tour is plenty to see the major sights and the beach hotels are much nicer.

Based on the city side of the Creek, its only about a 15 min drive from the airport when there's no traffic. We loved everything about this hotel from checking in, our porter, breakfast, guest concerige to actual checking out. We were upgraded to the executive suite (not sure why but didn't complain) and it had everything in there. We could have slept all day in our room, it was fantastic. All the staff spoke great English and were most helpful with booking our tours. The breakfast was fantastic with a wide range of all sorts of food from the buffet. You certainly cannot complain there. There was a great pool on the roof although we didn't get to use it due to our time limitations. Things to watch out for - 1. the tours booked through the hotel have obvisouly been bumped up in price. You will be able to find the same tours (by different operators) for a much cheaper price. It may be worth doing some research on dubai tours and getting an idea for price. We stayed with the hotel tours due to convenience, however, the hotel were more than happy to book other tour operators if thats what we preferred. 2. The breakfast is delicious but can be expensive if not included in your room rates. However, this is a 5* hotel so is probably on par with all other 5* hotels. 3. We managed to get a last minute deal so were very pleased with the price of 170 pounds for 2 nights. This did included breakfast, fresh water and fruit delivered to our room each day and return airport transfer - Worth searching for deals before booking direct. Overall, a fabulous hotel. We would stay here again.We were a fair distance away from some of the main attractions, ie Mall of Emirates, the Jumeriah Beach, Burj hotel (at least 30 mins in a cab) but cabs are cheap so thats not a concern. However, for some staying on the other side of the creek nearer to those attractions may be more appealing. Dubai itself is an amazing city. Don't worry about the heat as you hardly ever spend more than 5 mins outside. From about 4pm traffic is an issue and you wil be be bumper to bumper. Allow time to get to places if travelling after this time (at least double the time). We only had 2 days here, you easily need at least 5 days. If you are only doing a stop over then make sure you do the 4 wheel drive on the sand dunes and visit the Mall of Emirates (and possibly go skiing).There are many other malls and markets which would be worth visiting but unfortunately we didn't get a chance.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Metropolitan Palace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306761-Reviews-Metropolitan_Palace_Hotel-Dubai.html", "Price": "$98 - $305*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Al Maktoum Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "306761", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4e/cc/e8/reception.jpg"}}
