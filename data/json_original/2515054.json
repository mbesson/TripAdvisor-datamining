The location could not have been any better - within minutes you can walk to the Champs Elysees, the Eiffel Tower, the shops of Avenue Montaigne, and a longer, but lovely walk to the Louvre. It is practically next door to the Georges V (4 Seasons), but is 1/2 of the price for a room. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, with making and changing restaurant reservations and making us feel at home. We had a lovely Junior Suite with 2 bathrooms. Probably one of the best recommendations I can give is the honesty and trustworthiness of the staff. When I thought I had lost a very valuable diamond earring in our room, the people at the front desk, and most importantly, the housekeepers, could not have been more helpful - they spent an hour scouring our room - lifting the mattress and box springs and looking everywhere, even in trash cans. They promised me (and I had full faith and trust) that if it turned up after we checked out that day, that they would make sure it was sent to me back home in the States. The hotel even followed up with an email to us after we had left, to tell us that they had continued to look, but unfortunately still hadn't found it. I happily found the earring when I got home and unpacked, but I truly felt confident that had it turned up in the room, it would have been returned to me. Between the awesome location, the wonderful people and the lovely room, my husband and I would highly recommend the Hotel de Sers for a stay in Paris.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cNear Enough Isn't Good Enough\u201d", "Author": "GeorgeIlko", "ReviewID": "UR123517969", "Content": "Le Hotel De Sers is in a good location and is in good condition and provides good service. And that's the problem, its good - but it isn't great. Le Hotel De Sers is simply too expensive to be good. The standard room rate for our room (a deluxe room) was 695 EUROS per night yet we could have stayed at Claridges or The Four Seasons with change for a good meal for the same money. Yet Le Hotel De Sers isn't anywhere near the standard set at either of those establishments. Don't get me wrong, it was a very pleasant stay, with very pleasant staff in a very pleasant hotel but it just felt soulless and bland. For example, there wasn't a pool to relax in or any kind of quirkiness or anything with a remotely unique characteristic - just a wholly unremarkable stay. It felt like a driving a BMW, as opposed to an Alfa Romeo, or like listening to an X Factor winning single as opposed to Jimmi Hendrix. I have already forgotten what the hotel reception looked like yet we arrived home just yesterday. Our whole stay was like watching a movie with expensive production values but no story to tell and the whole experience has left me mildly annoyed that we could have stayed somewhere special for the same money.

Our suite was very well equipped with everything we could possibly need, in particular the bathroom was fantastic.

We asked the hotel to investigate and were told that housekeeping had thrown it away because it was rubbish (we were assured that the cleaner had checked the contents of the bag before disposing of it and was sure it was rubbish - clearly not the case). If this was not bad enough, when I spoke to the Head of Housekeeping there was no apology - she was defensive and rude. We complained to the hotel manager about the incident itself and the attitude of staff in dealing with it, We did eventually receive an apology in response, as well as a scented candle and a teddy bear from the hotel merchandise as a parting gift. We did not however see our belongings again. The upshot? This hotel looks upmarket and swish - but when there was a problem we felt as if we were in a low rate, badly run B&B.

We also had 2 closets, a narrowish sitting room (I think the couch was a sleeper but we didn't use it) and a \"guest\" bathroom. It is so nice to be able to go into the sitting room when one wakes up early so as to not bother the other sleeper. Internet was free.

Free internet and room for 2 people to walk at the same time in a hotel room in Paris is wonderful. But the staff is what really made this place outstanding. Being \"foodies\" we wanted some nice restaurant reservations. They helped me before we arrived to secure some reservations and then continually helped while we were there. They had some VERY competent people behind the front desk to help with anything and everything. They also had a young man who was learning and had a ways to go. But they never left him alone and the more senior people were always listening to his conversations and directing him. The hotel is also in a nice location right off George V. We're walkers and could easily get to many tourist locations. But the underground is also right near the hotel.
