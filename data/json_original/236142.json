We chose to stay at The Hotel San Carlo and not only were we pleased, we were thrilled! The staff at Hotel San Carlo could not have done anything else to make our stay more wonderful. The hotel is lovely, located in the best area for sightseeing and shopping. We walked all over Rome touring the city the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Coliseum, Roman Forum, even a stroll back from Vatican City. Victoria was so kind and helpful she recommended restaurants, even translated a conversation with Italian relatives that came by to visit. Alberto anticipated our every need he made reservations for us and made sure our taxi's were there on time, Rosanna helped us with directions to sights and tours. They never made us feel like a bother, though we had lots of questions. We looked forward to a breakfast of croissants, rolls, cheese, fresh fruits, cereals and delicious cappuccino served with a smile to start the day by Antonella , Marina, and Lina on the beautiful rooftop garden. We stayed 5 days, left for 4 and when we returned Dante carried our bags to our room which was upgraded to a larger room with a lovely balcony, just beautiful! Everyone made us feel so welcome, like honored guests. We cannot wait to go back one day. We would recommend this as THE place to stay in Rome, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malabo", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel In Rome\u201d", "Author": "Malabowabo", "ReviewID": "UR127266713", "Content": "Was very pleased with the room and staff.

We did book a taxi via the hotel for the return trip so we would be at the airport on time (30 Euros set price). The Hotel even gave us the drivers details incase we left anything in the taxi or had any problems. The Spanish Steps and the upmarket shops of Versace, Prada and Gucci are round the corner from the hotel if that's what you want. Staff directed us to restaurants and shops - not the tourist ones, with high prices and frozen meals, but the ones where they themselves would eat and shop. Try out NINOS restaurant nearby which was recommended by the Hotel and we had one of the nicest meals of our stay. We bought a bottle of wine in one of the local shops one day and the hotel happily lent us a bottle opener so we could drink it in the room. We walked everywhere and enjoyed Rome.

Avoid the annex, although the rooms are larger, they are much noisy and outdated. Negotiate and you will get great value for money in this hotel. Just opposite the hotel, there's a restaurant, I've been there once, only because there was very heavy rain on one day in July, I would not recommend that restaurant to anyone. My recommendation for restaurants are: Maccheroni, piccolo arancio, cantina e cucina. At Fiumicino airport, take a taxi to central Rome. Be careful though because while Rome-based taxis charge fixed rate of EUR40, Fiumicino-based taxis charge fixed rate of EUR60. So ask before you get in, and prefer a Rome taxi!

With over 1200 hotels reviewed on Tripadvisor, I was very confused and nervous about choosing a hotel. This was our first time to Rome and I wanted a great hotel with great character in a good location for a great price. We were very pleased with our choice. I made our reservation directly with the hotel as I was requesting a travel agent discount. Victoria was very kind, prompt and helpful with emailing me the information, reservation and confirmation. We made our reservation very last minute and did not have time to convert our dollars into euros. When we arrived at the airport we went to the exchange counter only to find a horrific exchange rate (once all fees were added in, it would have been about 36.00 Euro for 100.00 us dollars). We thought we would get a better exhange at the hotel so we left the airport with our driver that was waiting for us with a sign with our name on it, arranged by Victoria ( for 50 euros) without Euro. Needless to say, the hotel did not exchange money but they were so helpful, they paid the driver and put the cab ride on our hotel bill. We were so relieved, they were like an extended family waiting for us. Check in was quick and efficient. Victoria spoke English and answered all our questions including directing us to a bank where we could exchange our money. The exchange places around the city were expensive to change money (except for the cambio at the Termani station) and most banks would not change at all. Once again Victoria was very informative and pointed us in the right direction. The porter was very efficient, he brought our bags to the room and always had a smile whenever we saw him. The room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable. My next visit I would get a superior room instead for about an extra 20 euro a night for a little extra space, quality and maybe a terrace. Never the less, the room was comfortable enough for us, a decent size bathroom, comfortable double bed, desk, tv, table and 2 chairs and a window that overlooked the street of lovely cafes and shops. We had plenty of closet space for our cloths and the ac worked really well which we really appreciated in the warm Rome August heat (about 88 degrees and sunny every day). The breakfast was ok, I am not a big breakfast eater but they had cereal, great breads and cookies, yogurt, juice and the best capaccino and espresso ever. The girls who served the breakfast and coffee were so sweet and pleasant. They did not speak English and I did not speak much Italian but we conversed without any problems, they seemed to know exatley what we wanted. The afternoon desk associate Rosanna was also so very sweet. She gave us the best restaurant suggestions. Edy and Da Fransescos were totally awesome. Since we always had to leave our room key with the desk, she always had a kind word and smile for us and was always spot on with reccomendations. The night desk associate was so cute and sweet. He always remembered our room number to give us our key and always had a smile and a \"good night\" to us. A good way to end the day. The location was the best. In an upscale, safe area right by the Spanish Steps and the main shopping street. We walked to the Vatican, Piazza Navona, Pantheon and, Trevi Fountain in a short amount of time. We bought a 48 hour pass on one of the double decker tour buses and took that to the Colosseum and the Forum. We did the whole tour on the bus and after seeing all of Rome and some of the other hotels we considered, we were so happy with the Hotel San Carlo and its location and our choice. After a full day of sightseeing in the heat, we always stopped at a little deli one block from the hotel for a bottle of wine, some sodas (I loved the orange Fanta), bottled water, olives, cheese and bread (all for about 12 Euro) and went back to our cool air conditioned room for a rest and a little happy hour before we refreshed and got ready to go out for the evenning. The hotel has a nice rooftop patio but it was not being used for the summer. Check out was quick and efficient, they pre-arranged a car to take us back to the airport (for 40 Euro and this time we actually had the Euro to give the driver) This is not the Ritz or the Marriott and I actually am glad I did not choose such a chain as I felt very absorbed in the romance and culture of Rome with our quaint location and accomodations at the San Carlo. The staff were all great and like a family and really looked after us. It was safe and clean and just perfect. I will definately use this hotel for my clients. Thanks you to all the great staff and I hope my coins tossed in the the Trevi Fountain bring be back to wonderful Rome and the Hotel San Carlo very soon.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antioch, California", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good value\u201d", "Author": "2011_Travel_Destiny", "ReviewID": "UR116137697", "Content": "For the location the hotel was reasonably priced (for Rome), I paid 165 dollars for a single.

I have never written a review for a hotel, but as we were leaving the hotel, I told my husband that I absolutely had to share this terrific little gem with other people, especially those traveling with a baby, as we did. As all the other reviews mention, the location is phenomenal. It is steps away from The Spanish Steps and just a short distance from Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Villa Borghese, and dozens of other fabulous sites. Before we left for the trip, we were worried about how we would get to the things we wanted to see in Rome because we didn't want to haul our carseat around in cabs and we felt reluctant about having our two year-old ride in a taxi without a carseat. But luckily, we only had to take a cab from the airport because we were able to walk (with baby in stroller) EVERYWHERE we wanted. And we are not ordinarily big walkers. But Rome just inspires you to walk and because Hotel San Carlo is so centrally located, you never have to walk all that far. In addition to its incredible proximity to everything, the hotel rooms are perfect for those traveling with babies/toddlers. We were able to get a room with a terrace (our room was on the 4th floor) and so it was easy to put our daughter down for nap while we lounged on the terrace. Prior to the trip, we were concerned that we would have to just sit in a dark room everyday while she napped, but the terrace turned out to be a life saver! We could just close the doors of our terrace (keeping them ajar so we could hear her when she woke up) while she slept comfortably in the crib (provided by the hotel) in the dark room. The terrace was filled with pretty flowers and was lovely for reading books and mapping out the next day's itinerary. Just perfect! Finally, the proprietors at the hotel were incredibly helpful, spoke perfect English and were so friendly to our daughter, especially the sweet lady who manages the front desk in the evenings. She was so loving to our little girl and even gave her a little magic wand at the end of our stay, which of course our daughter adored. Anyway, I wanted to write this review because when I was searching for a hotel in Rome, it was hard to find one that I knew would be good for a young child, so I'm hoping this review points others with small children to this wonderful hotel, which honestly could not have been more ideal (or reasonably priced, given the location).

The mini fridge, although on the coldest setting, never got cold either. The maid would turn off our ac every day and open up the windows.

This was my third trip to Italy in the past 18 months. The purpose of this trip was to escort two college girls to their new home in Florence for a semester of college. We spent the first 5 nights in Rome to do some sight seeing before embarking to Florence for 4 days. We wanted to get a hotel in Rome that was reasonably priced but close to the Spanish Steps. After much research, we decided to stay at the San Carlos Hotel because of its great location and competitive price. There were some other issues with the hotel that left me with a bad taste. Cons: Very loud; the entire hotel has marble floors including all the hallways, lobby, rooms and elevators. Anytime another guest closed their door, walked down the hall, entered the elevator or sneezed, it echoed throughout the entire hotel. It was very hard to get a good night sleep even with ear plugs. Cold rooms- the management had control of the heat in each room and we had to call several times a day to request they turn it on. Even when it was on, the rooms were cold. The last day of our stay there, they would not turn on the heat at all. I think this was because we were leaving although they said the heating system was broken. I had to sleep in long underwear and extra blankets and my nose and face were still freezing. My room, #43, warmed up to some extent but the other room, #41, was freezing the entire time. The doors to the rooms do no always lock when you close them. Check this before you go. No doorman- there was no full time doorman to help with luggage or screen entrants to the hotel. Not all the rooms are renovated and those that are not are in great need of update, we had two of these rooms. My room, #43, had no safe and smelled like sewage part of the time as the ventilation was not good. It seemed to me that the hotel management kept the renovated rooms empty to avoid the heating expense. Here is the event that the really made me uncomfortable with this hotel: On our first night stay at the San Carlos, three male guests that were staying on our floor came in after a night of partying at 1:30 AM. We were all in the lobby using the computer when they arrived. One of the guests in this party was so drunk, that the other two guys had to literally drag and carry him. There was an older lady at the front desk working the night shift. The 3 guys proceeded through the lobby, to the elevator, went to the 4th floor, all the while carrying the drunk passed out guy. Upon exiting the elevator, the drunk man, vomitted all over the hallway outside the elevater in front of our rooms. I went down to front desk to tell the clerk to send someone up to clean up the vomit. I ran into one of the drunk men who also went to the front desk. When he heard me tell the clerk about the vomit, he completely went off on me and the clerk. I was very scared. For the next 2 hours these guys were yelling, moaning, partying in their rooms until 4:00 am. The clerk called us around 3:00 AM and told us to make sure the doors to the terrace were locked as we shared a terrace with them. The next day, I complained to the owner about this situation and he apologized, down playing the situation. These three guys were at the hotel for the next 3 days. I assume the owner wanted their money more than peace and safety for the other guests. PROS: The maids and management were very nice. The owner let us check in early and did give us a free ride to the train station. They were also very generous with their computer and had free WIFI. The breakfasts were very average but they made delicious expresso drinks which were also free. The ice maker was broken the entire time so all drinks were served luke warm. The restaurant to the right of the hotel as you are leaving has good food and excellent expresso drinks for 1E if you get it \"to go\". Would I take the risk and stay here again.....probably not.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "plasma800", "ReviewID": "UR53305994", "Content": "Let me begin with what is great about Hotel San Carlo! The Hotel San Carlo just simply could not be in a better location. The area around the hotel, the spanish steps, is by far the nicest area in Rome period. You feel safe, the shops are fantastic, the people are nice and you can walk anywhere from there! The Hotel San Carlo is super clean. Inside and out from what I saw, it was always clean. My room(s) were clean, bathroom clean, lift clean, everything clean..and that's important. The staff was super helpful and incredibly friendly. That's important to me too. Everyone was always there for you and I like that. No one stole anything from my room, thank goodness. No surprises on the bill! Exactly as advertised. Had the superior, fridge was nice and we had a semi private terrace which was great! When we returned on New Years eve (after some time in florence) they gave us the room on the roof, which was very nice to watch the fireworks from. Very cool people operating this hotel! Now for what I wasn't too impressed with. After 5 nights on that mattress I wanted to throw it out the window.. hard brickish thing just almost killed me! Pillows... flat tiny things.. I missed my bed at home, but you endure cause everything is so nice. The second room they gave us was a little better when we returned from Florence. But don't expect the Ritz. But who cares, YOU'RE IN ROME! Who wants to sleep anyway. The AC / heater unit in the room was a tad dirty, smelled a bit musty. Wireless internet in rooms.. hmm well, it just didn't really work did it. Worked downstairs though. All in all, a wonderful place to stay and I would certainly recommend anyone check it out. For the Price, it was quite brilliant and I'm so thankful it was clean!

One morning there was no hot water at all and when I reported it to the man at the front desk, he acted as if he did not even want to talk to me! Had I known that there were rooms that had been renovated, I would have asked for one at check in. The one thing that bothers me about the whole situation is that I was the only one assigned a room in that section of the hotel. At breakfast, I saw quite a few people who were coming from the renovated side. Could it be because I am a minority and management mistook me for one of their hired help?

The room was ok sized (as far as European hotels go) and the bathroom was very good. The room was extremely clean and adaquate in every way. The hard tile floors in the hallway made sound a little bit of an issue, but not one that would dissuade me from returning. The beds were comfortable and the water hot (and consistant!). Very, very nice. There is no lift, so climbing up the stairs gives you a nice workout (76 stairs) at the end of the day. For the last evening of our trip, we checked in and were given room 77. Just down the hall from 78, this was an immense room that was actually two stories (had a beautiful wooden staircase) with two single beds in the loft.

Loved it. If you get a nice terrace , it makes a small room fine. bed was not as comfortable as the Sheraton Roma, but I loved this location. Went to a reception up the spanish steps at the Villa Medici. It's like disneyland for adults. The fired artichoke at Campana is mouth watering. It's not on the menu so make sure to ask for it. While there, I looked at other rooms at the hotel: There is also a room with a King bed that I would book when I come back with my wife--photos now up on their website. There is also a very cool room (59) that has a Queen bed, large bath with tub and is surrounded by a full terrace and balcony, but you have to go up a very narrow spiral staircase. Note: the hot water heater pump is located on the roof between 59 and 42 and clicks on an off at night -- i am light sleaper and it did keep me up. But the back side of the hotel is very quite and romantic. you only hear church bells and opera singers -- not kidding about this...can't wait to go back.

The price is reasonable since your paying for location, your at walking distance to Spanish Steps, Villa Condotti, bus stops, numerous shops and restaurants. Other hotels in the area would cost you much more and at the end of the day, you get just an average hotel. For our trip, I decided to pay a little extra for a superior room, since it was the last stop of a 2 \u00bd week long trip and I knew that the extra space and luxury would be handy. The down side of having a superior room is that it\u2019s located on the top floor and there is no lift, so you have to walk up several flights of stairs. The up side is that it helped to burn the extra calories I consumed eating gelato, pizza and pasta. The other good thing is that the porter does have access to a lift for luggage only, so you don\u2019t have to worry about making that climb with your suitcases. The bedroom and bathroom were both spacious and clean. The furniture and linens were new and you could tell the room had recently been refurbished. The room had a comfortable bed, TV, and a nice size closet. We had a balcony with a table and two chairs. The balcony didn\u2019t overlook anything special, just the roof top to other buildings nearby. I can understand why some of the comments mentioned that the rooms were in need of remodeling and that there was a lot of noise. While I was there, the hotel was in the midst of being renovated. The top floors had already been done and workers were remodeling other rooms and floors during my stay. However, none of the construction was done during the night time, the work didn\u2019t interfere with your stay, there was no dust or mess left behind and I didn\u2019t hear any outside noise while in my room during the evenings. Breakfast was very basic and consisted of pastries, cereal, jam, coffee and juice. The service was great and the employees are very attentive. They help make reservations for us and recommended some great restaurants as well as giving us great direction and calling taxi's when we needed.

It was my second time at the hotel (my first stay was in Nov 2002) and as usual I was not disappointed. Hands down it is in the best location in Rome, only blocks from the Spanish Steps and half a block from Via del Corso (fabulous shopping that won't leave you broke). You can walk everywhere from this hotel, the Colosseum, the Vatican or you can take the metro which is located only a few block away next to the Spanish Steps. The hotel itself is your typical European hotel. Our room this time was small but very clean and the bathroom was a good size. Our bed was made and bathroom cleaned when we came back to the room every afternoon. The room had a TV and the bathroon a hair dryer. During my first stay at the San Carlo in 2002 I was with a group of 40 people and the hotel staff was extremely helpful and accommodating to our groups needs. I found that this has not changed. We did not spend much time in our room so the smaller size really had no effect on us. The main building HAS NO ELEVATOR so those of you that cannot do stairs be sure to make that clear when making your reservation. We did not mind as the stairs helped us work off the amazing meals we had during our stay. For a romantic and delicious meal try Le Sorelle on Via Belsiana, 30 just around the corner from the hotel. A bit pricey but it was our anniversary dinner so we treated ourselved. The breakfast was just enough to prep you for your day, milk and cereal as well as yogurt, croissants, organge juice, tiny wrapped cakes that you could take with you for a snack later on and of course the yummy cappucino! The desk staff was very helpful in arranging for a taxi to take us to the bus station so we could continue our trip. I also arranged via e-mail for a driver to come and get us at the airport when we arrived - it was worth the 55 euro since we were exhausted. I think this is a great little hotel in a fantastic location, and if you go to Rome off season the hotel is riduclously inexpensive for the location.

We walked down the street and around the corner to a small door which they explained we had to ring a bell to enter. Through a small hallway, into a two person elevator to the second floor, down a narrow hallway to our small room. There was no balcony in sight. I sat on the bed nearly in tears trying to figure out what bothered me. I realized it was because I felt completely unsafe. I talked to the night manger and he agreed to give us a room in the main building. The room was even smaller. The bathroom was tiny with a shower that was a hand held sprayer with no walls so everything in the bathroom was wet by the time you were finished. The air conditioner took an hour or more to cool down the room and dripped down the wall and onto the furniture all night. One of our single bed matresses had coils sticking out of it in three or four locations. The breakfast was barely adequate with most of it being prepackaged toast and cookies.

Our fist night we checked in and they put us in a room that did not appear to have been used in some time, #57. The hotel owns three buildings and this one was not in the main hotel. It was out the front door and around a corner. Enter through a tiny ugly hallway and then up a two person elevator. One more flight of stairs from there. The bell man was in a hurry to drop off our bags and get out, and I can see why. I would describe it as a cross between a youth hostel and a Marine Corps barracks (I\u2019ve slept in both), except a Corps barracks is always clean. Most deffinately NOT how it appears on the web site. My wife was in tears it was so bad. No other rooms available that night, but the next day they moved us to a room on the roof. Room #59 is a room built on top of the main hotel all by itself with a roof top garden terrace. It was MUCH better, but still not what the web makes it look like. I\u2019d say the first night was like a Motel 2 (not even close to a Motel 6). The second room was comparable to a Super 8, but the terrace made it seem much nicer. The seclusion of the rooftop made us feel like the only ones in the hotel. The only catch to someone requesting Room 59 is that you have to go up 5 flights of stairs and THEN you have to go up a narrow wrought iron spiral staircase to the roof (they\u2019ll handle the luggage). Anyone that\u2019s completely out of shape or moderately overweight would have difficulty reaching this room. We had no problems with the stairs and I kind of liked it. This room could have been real nice, but we had that nagging suspicion about how clean things were, probably because of night 1's experinece. The grout and caulk in the bathroom for example had some small areas of black mildew in the corners. Little things like that. Nothing horrible in that room, but I wouldn\u2019t give this hotel more than 3 stars at best, and 1 at worst. Stay at your own risk since it appears that the rooms are inconsistent from one to another, so you would just never know what you\u2019d get. I would bet that the rooms in the main building are better (and generally acceptable) than in the other two. In all fairness, it sounds like most hotels in Rome that won't cost you your first born child are kind of a dump by other standards. The staff was excellent and helped out in any way they could. Breakfast was fine too, if a little monotonous. The location was great. Lots of restaurants and shops and close to Trevi fountain and a Metro stop. I just found it unacceptable for a hotel to have such wild variations from room to room and list them out at the same prices. My tip: Check in as early as possible to get a room in the main building. We checked in late the first night... Sighteeing sleeper: Go to the San Carlo cathedral. It's at the end of the street (1 block) and is beautiful.

We could leave our luggage and it would be brought to our room and we could check in later. We went and did some sightseeing and returned at 3 pm. We were shown to a room in the hotel's annex in another building around the corner from the main hotel. The room did indeed have three beds, but we had arranged for a superior triple and the room we were supposed to get had one double bed and a single bed in a separate area. We complained to the person who brought us over and he said, \"Use the phone and speak to the hotel desk.\" At first the desk said that this is a triple room. When I persisted the story changed. We were overbooked by a wedding party that did not leave on time. We can change your room tororrow. We will give you a discount for tonight.

The bathroom was to the left, the single bed in a tiny room straight ahead and the double bed in a room to the right. Only the room with the double bed had an air conditioner. It could be turned on when you were in the room. The room key went in a slot in the wall. When the room key was removed, all the lights went out and the air conditioning stopped. Rome is very hot in July. We found that it took 2 to 3 hours for the room to get comfortable after our return from sightseeing. Our daughter, in the small single bed area, never did get cooled off. The air conditioning did not really travel that far. We fould the hotel adequate and spotless clean. However, it lacked charm.

Located a short, inexpensive taxi ride from Termini, Hotel San Carlo is convenient to just about everywhere in Rome. We walked to Vatican City, the Forum and everywhere else in-between with ease. When we didn't want to walk, we would take the metro, which was right up the street. The hotel also provides a great map! The neighborhood around Hotel San Carlo is one of the nicest in Rome's Centro Storico. If you're shopping in Rome, this is where you'll do it. Most of the finest fashion in the world has a store front in this neighborhood. Clean streets, minimal grafitti and well-dressed pedestrians everywhere you turn. The piazza spagna is crawling with tourists after around 11 am every day, but it thinned out quite a lot by 8 pm at night. The staff greeted us upon arrival, stowed our bags and asked if we could return in an hour when our room would be ready. An hour later, we came back and the nice lady at the desk sprinted up the (85!) marble steps to our fourth floor room. I thought I was going to have a heart attack as I hoofed behind her, sucking wind the whole way! The steps are tough, but by the second day we'd pretty much gotten used to them. Our room was at the back of the building and faced a small interior courtyard of other residences. The room was small, but immaculately clean and offered sufficient storage for our bags so as to not cramp the room's minimal floor area. The bathroom was average-sized but included a very large shower. The only oddity was if the shower door was opened just a little bit and the bathroom door closed, a horrible odor would permeate the bathroom. It's the same odor I noticed throughout much of Rome - must be something in the city's sewer system. Kind of like a city-wide sour drain. At night, the courtyard was very quiet, even with the shutters and windows open. The breakfasts at Hotel San Carlo were terrible. Aside from the complimentary large San Pelligrino bottles offered, little else was edible. The brioche was awful. The croissants tasted like they were several days old. Even the packaged pastries were terrible. Dry, bland and wholly unappetizing. The breakfast area is well appointed - it's just a shame the food served within is so dreadful. By far the worst breakfast spread we encountered of all our hotels in Italy. Alas, there is a welcome pair of golden arches just down the street that provides much more palatable fare. We did eat at three restaurants on the hotel's recommended list with much better results. Make reservations in advance if you want to get into any of them on their list, though! At checkout, the desk man gave us a discount for paying in cash. That made for an even better deal. Don't stay in Hotel San Carlo for the food. Stay for the excellent location at a good price.

We arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport (wise investment of 50 euros). He was great! Kinda shy, which, when paired with my family, doesn't mix! So, I'm sure we aggravated him to death, but he was such a good sport!! (Sorry can't remember his name!) He was kind enough to take us on a driving tour of the city before dropping us off at the hotel. We had no idea at the time, but once we had become more familiar with the city, it was obvious he had gone out of his way to show us and explain the sites. Wonderful! Actually, the best shot I got of the Colisseum was hanging out of the window of his Mercedes!! Super friendly, and, to all the ladies...very cute! Haha. Again, well worth the money. 50 euros may sound like a lot, but Roman cab drivers (well, Italian in general) will do a number on you. Plus, we had no idea where we were going, and after two minutes on the road, we quickly realize that we would have never survived driving in Rome!! The hotel is perfectly located. I know everyone says that about their favorite places, but really--PERFECT!!! We wanted to stay in centro storico, and hotels do not come cheap here. I happened to stumble on the San Carlo, read the reviews, and decided to go with it. Couldn't have made a better choice!! I think you could group my family with likes of many other travelers--once you pay the grand sum for the flight over, you don't have the luxury of forking over $300 a night for a hotel! San Carlo was a great value in a perfect spot with a fabulous staff. Literally, 5 minutes from the Spanish steps and the Metro stop. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, granted, some were hefty walks. The hotel is situated in an area with lots of fun shops and little cafes. There's a great cafe a block away with fantastic gelato and a killer cappucino. Also, about two doors down from hotel is a cute wine and pastry shop (La Peonia). I'm a wine lover, so I had a great time talking with the shop clerk and selecting bottles of wine to take home. For the ladies, on the same block is a fantastic jewelry and accessories shop. Definitely ask for recommendations for dinner!! Not once were we disappointed! Fabulous food at affordable prices, all within walking distance of the hotel. We had a triple room and I was so impressed with the size! Couldn't believe it! Plus, there was air conditioning! What a plus! Breakfast was great. Croissants, muffins, yogurt, pastries, those Italian donuts that make your mouth water, and the best cup of coffee I had the whole time I was in Rome. Bottom line, and excellent value for a gem of a hotel. Oh, and a tip--if you speak Italian or know someone that does, give them a call. We got 15 euros knocked off the normal reservation price by calling.", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans", "Title": "\u201cFabulous value- great location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4327064", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon in the middle of December.

After returning to the hotel to rest from a long day of sight-seeing, we loved taking night strolls and seeing the Christmas lights and all the shopping hustle and bustle. The hotel itself was wonderful- I believe our room was upgraded (from a double standard to a room with a loft and semi-private balcony- room 78) because we were on our honeymoon. We were in the main building, and on the top floor (with no elevator, which was rough after climbing to the cupola of St. Peter's), but our room was great! It was warm and dry during our stay in the cold, rainy weather. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of both the room and the bathroom, which was clean and elegant. The breakfast of pastries and cereal was all we really needed to not be weighed down as we began our long, full days. We did not find it too crowded, but we ate pretty early. Another reviewer mentioned it was hard to find a taxi to navigate the streets- we did not have this problem as a cab picked us up on the corner directly in front of the hotel.

The staff are friendly and welcoming and the room we were allocated in the annex was v. good. We were wary at first as I had heard good reports about the hotel and wanted to stay in it but we neednt have worried the annex was fine. However a warning to travellers Rome is very dangerous regarding pickpockets, we travelled on the metro and whilst it is a great mode of transport on the second day on our way to the Vatican we were pickpocketed and lost several credit cards and a lot of cash. We had only travelled the length of one stop and were hardly on the train 5 minutes when the wallet was missed. The staff on the metro were helpful but trying to get someone speaking english to direct us to the police station was difficult. At the police station we met a man from Nottingham who had just arrived and lost his wallet the same way out of a pocket that had a zipper, on the plane home we met a young man who was there in a group of 6, his sister had her handbag cut and snatched out on the street. My advice to anyone in Rome for only a short time who wants to see the sights is to go on the open top tour buses as they stop at all the major sights and you can hop on and off all day for \u20ac13 per person, a bit more expensive than the \u20ac11 3 day metro ticket but much safer.

Our room was good, if a little spartan - I'd asked for a triple, and got a 2 room suite, which was great. The staff were helpful and friendly, but the biggest drawback in the hotel comes at breakfast time. Some 50 or more guests try to eat in a tiny space with only nine small tables. People are forced to hop around waiting for someone to finish up, which is displeasing to everyone. Actually, it is probably better to give up because the breakfast itself is poor - all sweet, even the croissants. Outside, another drawback: It is almost impossible to get a taxi to negotiate the one-way system to find the hotel. You are invariably dropped near the Spanish Steps and have to carry your luggage about 3 blocks. Similarly, when ordering a taxi it arrives with the meter already sprinting, so the smallest ride costs a fortune.

You actually have to park at a garage and get a taxi to the hotel if you have alot of luggage.

When we arrived in the late afternoon, the desk clerk reported that our room wasn't ready because of a delay regarding the room's previous occupants. The story was a bit convoluted -- they'd checked out but had left their bags and were overdue to pick them up, thereby delaying cleaning of the rooms. He said we could either come back in an hour, when the room would likely be ready, or he would offer us a discount to stay at a charming apartment a few blocks away. Another guest had done the same a few nights earlier and loved it. My wife and I probably should have chosen Option 1, but we were tired from traveling so we chose option 2, which turned out to be more like 5 blocks away. It was a very simple, slightly drably lit apartment on a considerably less charming street. Bathroom was acceptable, but overall, the place was not a bargain, even at the slight discount off the reasonably priced San Carlo. We came to expect that the sales job for this change indicated that the San Carlo was overbooked for the night and seeking a guest who wouldn't throw a fit over accepting alternative lodgings.

Trevi fountain is about a 10-15 minute walk away, Pantheon is a 20 minutes walk away, Vatican is 25-30 minutes walk aways and ancient Rome is a 35-40 minute walk away. One really nice thing about this hotel is there are several nice outdoor cafes and restaurants within a five-minute walk. We liked the location, though it may have nicer to be a little closer to central Rome, perhaps near the Pantheon. But can't complain too much -- you can walk pretty much everywhere from here! ROOM: We stayed in room 44 on the top floor of this hotel. The room was pretty basic, but clean. We had a triple, and unlike other Italian hotels we stayed in, this one gave us a separate bedroom for the third person. That was really nice. The bathroom was clean and fairly modern, with a bathtub and sliding shower bar, and bidet. There was a minibar and TV, but no safe. PRICE: We paid 198 euros a night for a triple. BREAKFAST: It was a basic breakfast with croissants and jam, cereal, yogurt, juice and choice of caffe. STAFF: The staff was helpful when we asked, though not overly accommodating. They did let us check out several hours early, since we were catching a 4 a.m. taxi to the airport. They arranged the taxi for us, which cost 55 euros. Someone also brought our bags up to our fourth-floor room for us, which was nice considering there's no elevator. ** A couple small gripes: Since our room was on the fourth floor, it meant we were stuck climbing four flights of stairs after every long day of sightseeing. It was manageable for us, but it got tiring. Also, there was a computer set up for guests to surf the Internet, but it only worked one of the four times we tried to use it.

The hotel is on the 3rd floor with offices on the other floors. When we got off the elevator, there was a small office to our left where a hotel staff member was 24/7 and had security cameras of the hotel, stairs, hallway and entrance way. We always felt very safe througout our stay. As we walked down the hallway to our room, the lights got brighter (on sensors). Once inside our room, the air conditioning went on (also on sensors). We could tell that new hardwood floors were put in and that it was freshly painted. Everything was modern and new! The bed was a true king size (not two double beds pushed together) and the room had built in cabinets and the closet had shelves and drawers built in. The design was very simple in creams and beige. The bathroom was also modern with a marble floor, pedestal sink, bidet, and shower with sliding doors (rare in Italy). The towels were white and very large and plush.

Well we stayed here for 3 nights arriving at 1am and greated by a really nice elderly porter who showed us to our room. We stayed in the part of the hotel that is accross the street from the main hotel itself, on the 4th floor (glad for the lift to the 3rd floor) then up a small flight of steps to our room No.56. A nice decent sized room with a balcony simply furnished with double bed 2 chairs wardrobe, tv (mabe only 2 English speaking channels but I didn't come to watch it), large washroom only a shower though but a big one. I noticed the airconditioning but didn't need it in late Feb. The location of this hotel is the best, easily in walking distance of the spanish steps, trevi fountain, panthelon. My wife was most impressed that the parallel street 'via dei Condotti' has all the top designer fashion shops on it and all the best dressed people in Rome shop there. Breakfast is a simple continental one but with a strong cafe latte, that is all you need as you will be walking around briskly seeing all the woderful sights. The staff here are very helpful, and always very friendly, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great location and doesn't want to break the bank for a clean chearful hotel.

Based on past experience of single rooms in hotels in Europe, I was tempted to stay somewhere that I could get a double room for the same sort of price, but decided to stay here based on the TripAdvisor reviews and the great location of the hotel, and booked a single room. As it turned out, the room I was given was very spacious, with a double (or queen size) bed and a single bed. I didn't find the room noisy (and my room was facing the street), especially with the windows closed (the room had individually controlled air conditioning). The bathroom wasn't the most convenient - the shower (over the bath) was not enclosed in any way, and no shower curtain, so I got water all over the place when I took a shower - but both the bathroom and the rest of the room were very clean. Breakfast was simple but good (I didn't have trouble with the breakfast area being too busy (maybe because I'm not an early riser! or just a less busy time of year perhaps). The location is great, within a couple of minutes' walk of the Spanish Steps and not far from the Trevi Fountain. I used the metro to get around to other places, the Piazza di Spagna metro station is just by the Spanish Steps, so also just a couple of minutes' walk from the hotel. The hotel staff were all very pleasant and friendly.

Compared to our first hotel in Rome, we were so happy to have booked this one to end our trip. Unlike another reviewer on this site that stayed on the second floor, we had a very clean and newly renovated room on the top floor. I think we paid 125 Euro per night, which may help explain the smaller, 100 Euro room of the unsatisfied reviewer. We did have to climb 80 or so steps to get there, but that gave us a terrace with a table and chairs, and a nice view of a church dome and the many plants on the terraces of the apartments across the street. A very hard working man carried our bags up (and down when we left) to the room. I was so impressed with how hard he worked I must have not noticed he smelled. When asked, he told us where the local markets were so we could get some food and drinks for the room. Our queen mattress was firm, the floors polished white marble, the walls bright white with brass lights, the glasses were clean and the fridge had bottles of cold water. The bathroom was small, (same as the others we had in Italy), but clean. It could have used a shelf, but otherwise it was fine. The cab to the airport (ours was a VW van) was 45 Euro. We had also been quoted 40 initially, which meant the driver got a smaller tip. We spent all our Euros keeping only enough for the ride. His bad luck. We loved the location and if we are lucky enough to go to Rome again, we will be trying to book the same room. And yes, if you stay in a big tourist area like this, it can be noisy.

They were roomy by European standards and comfortable. The showers though, were small and in Room 57 the shower was over the bath and required some agility to manage safely. You had prepared us for the crowded breakfast room and that was not a problem for us. The people at reception were very helpful. But in spite of your warnings we were ripped off by the taxi driver who took us from the Termini to the Hotel. If you are new to Rome it is very difficult to tell the difference between licensed and unlicensed taxis. My E20 bill became an E5 one in nano seconds and the driver also refused to take us right to the hotel and dropped us at the Spanish Steps. Thanks for warning us about that, too. We would strongly advise that you get the Hotel to organise a taxi to pick you up from the airport. It will cost around E45.00. If you have to use taxis in Rome, pay in E5 bills because they cannot be changed for anything smaller and count them out one at a time!!", "Date": "November 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "chagrin falls, ohio", "Title": "\u201cHotel San Carlo - pleasant, clean, and quiet\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2791453", "Content": "My husband and I loved Rome and Hotel San Carlo.

The hotel staff made all the arrangements for us. Otherwise, we walked or took the subway everywhere. The San Carlo is situated so well that we were able to stop by the room to drop off bags, clean up, etc. We learned to keep our hands in our pockets on the subway (my husband was pickpocketed out of his front pants pocket!) and count out our bills to taxi drivers.
