It shares a lobby area with its sister property the JW Marriott. A system of indoor skywalks makes it a joy to traverse center city in cold or inclement weather. The property and rooms are clean, featuring a family-friendly split bathroom design. The room decor is ultra contemporary, but not quite cheesy or distasteful. The staff was friendly and responsive enough and the free breakfast was above average increasing the value of our stay. A word of caution, though. One of our party developed a \u201cdermatitis\u201d on her lower leg during the hotel stay. She told her fellow staffers about it but did not inform me until we returned. Her son, a licensed commercial pest control operator, opined that her condition was likely caused by bites from bedbugs. A follow-up doctor\u2019s examination ordered by our company could not rule out the possibility. Naturally, I informed the hotel who assured me that the room has been inspected by its pest control vendor and that there was no evidence of bedbugs (except, of course the bedbug-bite looking dermatitis on my colleague\u2019s leg).

Also, the rooms are clean, large, and have almost everything you need. Its really nice to have two bathrooms, one with the toilet and the sink, and another with the bath and the sink, however, it would make more sense to me to put the amenities and the hairdryer in the room with the toilet rather than the bath area. This is so that while one person is showering, another person can be drying their hair without getting steamed out. And yes, if you close the door and run the shower, it gets steamy inside the room. Also, it would be nice if they would have put some amenities in the second bathroom so you're not running back and forth between them for stuff. Nitpicky things, but I wish they had a haircover and lotion. I didn't try calling the front desk for it, to see if it was available, but there was a small area for groceries and notions right next to the front desk if you wanted something at any time of the day. Beds were comfortable, and I asked for extra pillows and blankets, and only needed the pillows. Since I had recent neck surgery a month before this trip, I wanted extra cushioning and comfortable beds, and this fit the bill. I also asked for and received an accessible room, since I was using a walker, and also needed the railings to help in the bathroom. I also had a cane to get around for shorter distances, and had left my walker at check in, since we were rushing to get to the TGIF at night before it closed (arrived late at night off a delayed flight). Yes, its THAT close. I didn't even need my walker, it was right outside the door, and up the walkway about 25 yards! The check in agent offered to let me keep my things while we ate, so I left the luggage with him. When we came back an hour later, he had already transferred everything up to our room, making it so nice to just get myself upstairs and straight to room right next to elevator. And no, it didn't bother me to have the noise from the elevator, but the doors don't quite meet the rug at the bottom of the doorway, so if you're a light sleeper and sound bothers you, then you have to weigh your decision on whether you want or need to be close to the elevator vs the sound. BUT, there was a very inconsiderate guest across the way from us, who had allowed her kids (5-6 boys) to run around playing outside in the hallways. She brought this portable soccer goal, and they set it up right outside my door and used the long hallway to kick the ball down. I was from the west coast, so while it was about 8:30am, it was 5:30am to me,and we didn't get to sleep til well after 2 am after dinner and showers the night before. I didn't really enjoy being woken up by the sounds of boys kicking a ball around and rustling around by the door. I had opened it and looked at them shaking my head and asked them to move down the hall a bit. They did, but I was now awake, so I decided I might as well go get some treats at the breakfast bar before it closed at 9:30. SO, I used my walker knowing it would be easier to carry things in it and walking then to try and balance everything. I found lots of great stuff. They had juice, milk, coffee, danish, waffles, eggs, sausage, fruit cups (sealed) and fruits. I had grabbed plenty of everything, tossing it in the walker, and the girl who refilled the food offered to help me gather things. She noticed I was taking it upstairs to put in the room, and said to use a coffee cup since it was larger and had a cover, and we loaded everything in my walker's bin. I thought it was very considerate of her to help, and to give me the advice, when I knew she was busy. I took enough for me and my daughter, and figured to reheat it in the microwave, and also had the frig for the juice and fruit cups and fruit. My daughter loved having the fruit cups when she woke up while I was heating everything. she didn't care for reheated sausage and eggs, but it worked for me. I didn't bother with waffles, since there was a line and I didn't want to stand there waiting for it with my walker cuz I kinda blocked the area with it. there's not a lot of room to move around, or to sit, so I was actually happy with what I had, and was content to take it upstairs and eat it there. My daughter liked sleeping in, and eating next to the TV, and when i was done, I jumped on the internet and checked mail while she ate. So, everything worked out fine. We were there for a sporting meet at the Convention Center, so I chose this location for its proximity to the center, for the lower price. I was very happy with the results. Our friends stayed at the JW, paying about $25 more for the room per night, plus taxes, had no frig or microwave, had to pay for breakfast and all their other food, as well as internet. They were closer to the center, and had a nicer room, but paid the extra money for everything and had 2 kids and could have used the savings of eating reheated food, and had no way of keeping their leftovers cold. We ate at a pizza place called Bazbeaux on Massachusetts Ave, while we went window shopping, and their pizzas were good, but huge, even for a small sized one! So we had tons of pizza left over. I was happy we had the frig and the microwave. But the other family was saying \"hmm, no microwave... oh well, we like cold pizza. But, hmm, we don't have frig either... so I guess we'll have to leave it out.\" They thought about opening a window/balcony to put it on to keep it cold but couldn't because the JW is all windows on the outside. LOL We didn't have any problems - so I said I was happy to walk the few extra feet for the other conveniences. And we probably saved at least $100 over them. Oh, if you're walking around on Massachusetts, be sure to keep walking all the way up until you get to the Flying Cupcake! Great big huge red velvet cupcakes for about $3.75 each, about twice the size of the ones I've seen at home in Vegas. And they were good! I wanted to try their chocolate peanut butter ones, but someone right in front of us got the last one. Rats! she said it was one of their more popular flavors, so be sure to go earlier and grab some. Mmm. It cost about $19 for 5 cupcakes, but was our special treat for the day. Convention Center notes: It was cold at night when the meet was over, but no rain or snow (first week of Jan), so it was nice to have everything covered and inside. BUT, when leaving the convention center, you don't want to be the last ones out, because they lock the doors betw the center and the walkways, and we couldn't get into them and HAD to go outside to cross the street to the JW. It was freezing! But once inside the JW, were able to use the walkways from the JW to Springhill. It was 100+ yds to get to the back entry elevator of the Springhill, but with my walker, I was able to handle it. You're walking the length of the JW's convention area to get to the Springhill. There's a Starbucks too, right at the point of the JW's entrance to the convention center's walkway, so if you want to grab a coffee and munchie before heading in, do so - cuz there's nothing inside the center except expensive concessions that were down the hall from our event. (another 50-75 yds! no thanks, the coffee/hot chocolate and scones worked fine) We brought our ipod touch for communication since I couldn't carry the weight of my computer around with me this trip. I basically wanted to be able to access the internet for convenience, and check emails and post on Facebook. The Ipod did everything, and they had an ipod recharger unit on the radio. Wow, talk about convenience. Glad I brought the charger tho, cuz their radio unit wasn't charging it very well. But if you just need wireless internet for simple things, wow, the ipod touch saved me a lot of weight and extra gear i couldn't afford to bring. My 11 yr old daughter had to carry everything, so I definitely needed a hotel with services, and understanding staff, and I had to plan well. Since I did, and the staff was great, my trip was an easy one, and i couldn't ask for more. (except for the same inconsiderate guest - she let her boys play in front of my room again the second morning, even earlier. My guess is that the guests down the hall complained, so they moved their game in front of my door, extending it in the other direction towards the elevator. If you came off the elevator, you'd be greeted by nerf soccer balls and kids using the elevator area as the other goal. When I looked out my door, the mom was just packing stuff up and had her door open, so I commented with a \"really? two mornings in a row? cmon...\" and the boys said \"oh, sorry\" and continued to play. The mom said \"they said they're sorry...\" and let them continue. No apologies from her, no \"boys, you need to play quietly, or stop.\" So, I decided to call the front desk and ask them to do something. They apologized, and i told them they didn't need to cuz its not the hotel's fault, they just needed to make them stop. I also told them itd be best to send someone up to see what the kids were doing. It took less than 5 minutes before that game was shut down. I was so tired, and being woken up so early again, I was pretty mad, so I called the front desk and asked if I could have an extra hour to get myself together and sleep for just a few more minutes. He said if its only an hour, then that was fine. The extra hour was plenty, I just needed a little buffer, because I couldn't get everything packed that fast. When I checked out a couple hours later, the front desk asked if it had quieted down, or if there was any more trouble, and I said no. The front desk service was obviously very attentive, and knew exactly who was calling in, and remembered me, and asked if my stay was OK. Yes, it was - thanks to them. So, give them a chance to correct things, and I'm sure you'll have a great stay. BTW if you need a taxi, check online and get the phone number into your cell phone ahead of time. When you call them you can mention you saw their online ads for $25 to/from the airport, and that's what they'll charge, instead of $35+ for traffic and stops and mileage... I saved more than $10 one way, compared to our friends, who just caught the first taxi in the taxi line. But planning it next time, I'll call ahead a few minutes to allow for the guy to get there, because they needed 15-20 minutes to get to the airport, they weren't already there, and you don't catch the taxi in the same place - you need to walk further to another place to catch an arranged taxi ride. Our friend asked me how I got the deal, and wanted to do it going home.. and one driver warned her that you can't just hop in any taxi and say you want to pay $25. So he gave our friends the phone number so she could call for a return ride to the airport. It's also $5 for a ride anywhere within the downtown area - but some taxis charge extra if you have 5 people like we did since we traveled as a group and caught it outside the JW front lobby to Massachusetts Ave. BUT I used my taxi service phone # to arrange our return ride back, and he charged me $5 - no extra. if you're travelling with a limited budget, you can appreciate the savings, wherever they are. Hope this is helpful to other travelers, because I really relied on other comments to help plan my trip. If you're traveling following a surgery, sometimes you just need a little extra TLC and can really appreciate it when someone offers the little extras without having to ask for them or charge for every little thing you need, and that's how the Springhill Suites was. I can't guarantee everyone would receive extra service, but if you ask nicely, I'm sure if they can, they will. Also, I booked this trip early, but I'm a Marriott member, and received a notice that there was sale pricing at the hotel a few days before my trip, so I asked if I was able to change my reservation without losing my accessible room. Marriott made the change, and I got an additional discount, so instead of paying the regular $123 rate (AAA member price), I got the same room for about $103 per night. I saved about $50 for the weekend last minute because of the sale. So keep checking up to the time you travel, you might still find better rates if you're wanting to save a few bucks.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Victoria M", "ReviewID": "UR124814423", "Content": "We were here for two nights and enjoyed a comfortable stay.

This is actually the nicest SpringHill Suites that I have stayed in. The decor is very modern, which is definitely supported since this a newer hotel. It is an odd, but functional, arrangement for these 3 Marriott hotels. The entrance for this SpringHill Suites is shared with a Courtyard and they are both attached to the more upscale JW Marriott. Parking is below the hotel or for a couple dollars more you can Valet park. I have stayed at the Courtyard side of the hotel before but this was my first time at the SpringHill Suites side. The suite is not overly large but functional. You do not get the luxury of being able to close off the bedroom from the sitting area but since our purpose was simply a decent place to stay for the night this hotel more than fit the bill. There is a separate desk area for the wireless, a small fridge and microwave and a couch with a pull out bed. The toilet are is separate from the shower area which is unique but watch the sliding wooden doors if you need total privacy as they don't seem to close fully. The TV is situated in an odd location I think in what was a cost cutting move. I had a double/double suite and the TV was on a table at the foot of the bed close to the sitting area and it was on a swivel so that those on the couch can spin the TV around to watch. If you are like me you will need to keep your glasses on to watch TV if you have the bed farthest from the door as it the TV is not large and it is way off to the left if you are viewing from bed. They offered breakfast in the morning but I took advantage of the late checkout and therefore can't comment on the breakfast. I am actually originally from Indianapolis and know the city quite well.

The hotel did a great job working with us on a block of rooms. Their price was very competitive and the suite set-up was ideal for families with multiple kids. We planned to attend various events and the Springhill Suites proved to be a great location. Even as an Indy resident, I was a little skeptical of the ability (or desire) to walk everywhere. We attended an event on Monument Circle which, on a map, looks like quite a walk if the weather were cold. We were able to walk through the series of skywalks and the mall and it got us within a block or so of our destination without ever having to put on a coat. We also had tickets to basketball games at Conseco Fieldhouse and this gave us a great head start to getting that far away from the hotel. If you have events at Lucas Oil Stadium, the Convention Center, or are visiting the museums or the zoo this location will be ideal. The rooms were very nice. They have these couch/chaise lounge type things in the living room area. They didn't look very comfortable in the picture but they were very comfortable! The bathrooms are divided into a room with toilet and sink and a room with sink and shower -- great when sharing with a family. There was a nice desk area that we used quite a bit. The exercise room and the pool were very nice. Although we didn't ask for one, I noticed that the rooms have the option to be connecting rooms which is great if you have a family that is larger than one room can accommodate.

We love the Marriott chain but have never stayed at a SpringHill Suites. We would definitely stay at one again.

The only problem we had was that there was a major event going on in Indy the weekend we visited. I loved that guests were given a letter asking for quiet and respect for non-event guests (i.e. quiet hours). That same letter included information about a parade taking place over the weekend. Sadly, the wrong location was given for the parade, and many guests ended up in an empty park on Saturday morning. ROOM: The room set-up is unique. As others have mentioned, there is a small bathroom with a toilet and pedastal sink. The other bathroom has a full vanity counter top, shower and bath. It would be nice for the smaller bathroom to have counter space, allowing two guests to get ready at the same time. The way it's set up now, there is no room for a brush, toothbrush, razor or anything else in the smaller bathroom. It seems that this set-up is rather unnecessary, but it was fine. The sitting area was larger than most, with an L-shaped sofa bed. There was a microwave and tiny fridge in the room. The view of the river and park was beautiful. On a Saturday morning we watched quite a few people attempting to ride Segways all over the park. Lots of people were out walking/running, etc. AREA: Everything was nice, safe and convenient. There is a walkway to the Convention Center, different parking garage, etc. Walking to Lucas Oil Stadium is possible as well. The park across the street was very nice. If you want coffee, wander through the many halls of this hotel complex to get to Starbucks. Finding one outside of the hotel was difficult. Indy was surprisingly quiet on a Saturday. RESTAURANTS: We ate at the Fridays in the hotel and one of the restaurants in the connecting JW Marriott (sports bar and grille). While our Marriott hotel waiter was friendly, he was incredibly inefficient. He described the entrees incorrectly, dropped a tray, lost my credit card, and forgot to return with the bill. There is a continental breakfast in the hotel. As others have said, you will walk in and see a very long line. This is only for the waffle makers. Feel free to go around the line if you don't want waffles. There were eggs, sausage patties, bagels and all the usual stuff. The food area is quite small, but there is ample seating for guests. RECREATION: We did not use the fitness center. The pool was very, very small and shared by all the hotels in the complex.

The hotel itself is new, from what the website said I believe it was built 2010. So it is modern, bright and airy it is not a fancy hotel. There is a continental breakfast for free in the morning. Beware of the waffle maker there is only one and you have make it yourself. By pouring the batter mix in the waffle maker and it take four minutes. So at times there is a line for it and whats taking so long looks from people. The rooms are nice and modern good in size. Their are sliding doors, ipod radio, and a flatscreen t.v. Also a small area for working in and a sofa. Microwave and small fridge in the room. There is a seperate washroom and a seperate bathroom with no exhaust vent. So if you use a lot of hot water be prepared for a sauna in your room for a couple of minutes. It is in a great location with parks within view from my 12th floor room. TGI Fridays within the hotel area. Tip if you go to TGI go outside the hotel, instead of going thru a maze of halls within the three hotel complex. The pool is small the shallow height is 3ft and the max depth is 4ft. Good for people and children that don't know how to swim. There is no hot tub which was a suprise. The workout room is modern and open 24hrs a day. Customer service is great and hotel clean without the wear and tear for a hotel after a couple of years.

We had a room with a tub. He asked if I had a room preference and I said, a room with a view. He gave me room 1241. It had a tub, with a bar to hold to get in. I'm not sure if it was rated handicapped or not. So if you have kids and want to stay here, there you go. And the room definitely had a nice view. Everything about the room was really nice. We went to a concert in the park. We had been waiting in line and been outside for almost 6 hours. It felt really good to come back to such a nice inviting space. The shower was great. We had nice glass cups. Breakfast was awesome with things that usually aren't offered, such as oatmeal with walnuts, and berry sauce for the waffles. We liked the split bathrooms okay. The tv placement while not super ideal was not bothersome and I can see why its placed in the middle like that. This is such a nice place and location that I had to decide if it would be a place I would travel with my kids. I might during the week. It was a Friday around 3 when we arrived. My kids like the pool, but are hesitant about water. The pool while nice, and smaller, and shared with the courtyard next door. There were about five late teen boys in the area. The stairs are right when you walk in. We would not have felt comfortable trying to relax in there. The next morning it was more empty. Get to breakfast early. We arrived a little after 730 am on a Saturday to eat. When we came back to the lobby for wifi at around 840 it was teeming with people from various groups getting ready for their day. The seating was filled in the breakfast area and couch area. It was a nice area though. It held everyone nicely and they had games for the kids. PARKING - I was a little worried about the whole parking situation. I knew I could leave my car with the valet, but I wanted to try to park it myself. The entrance to the garage is RIGHT past the place where you would pull into the valet area, right around that corner, you drive right down into the garage. Which way to go when it the garage was not clearly marked . The only signage when we fist pulled in was a color coded level indicator telling you where to park depending on what hotel you were staying in. We were level green. Well we got to stay right on the bottom but there was limited signage saying PARK, or EXIT. There was some on the way out, but I think it be more clearly labeled. At one point when we pulled in, we weren't sure we were even in a real parking spot because there were not lines on both sides. We moved next to a pillar on the lower level. At 530 they had the garage closed off with barricades not allowing people to enter, I assume it was full. We parked with the intention of not driving again until we left so it was fine. Food - Plenty of food. We went to Friday's and it was really good. We also saw their employee's delivering food. We walked past the Bistro area and there was Starbucks sign but we didn't go there. The coffee at breakfast was also the best I have had at a hotel. WIFI Go to the lobby first for wifi, and I think then with the passcode you can get it in your room from their website. Also it is free wired in your room. What to do - Go to the Indiana State Museum across the screen. It is only 14.00 for a couple and worth it. We had a nice morning there.

The location is near the convention center and shopping but would require a little walk, however there are walkways connecting a lot of it. If you are planning on visiting the zoo, this would be a great location. The hotel is fairly new which is reflected in the modern decor. The driveway is very small and shared by the Courtyard Marriott. Valet parking was available and service prompt and friendly. Checkin was quick and the staff was very helpful and pleasant. The room was a little different than other Springhill Suites in that there were two sinks, a small one in a room with the toilet and another large vanity in a room with the shower. When traveling with a family, we found this to be a nice change as several members could be getting ready at once. Other amenities which we enjoy are the free internet, microwave and refrigerator, as well as the sitting area with a desk. Another perk is that breakfast is included. While we have found other hotels to be cramped in the breakfast area, this hotel seems to have taken this into account and expanded the eating and lobby area to make the experience more pleasant. The breakfast options were varied and plentiful and included breads, pastries, yogurts, hot and cold cereal as well as fruit, waffles, meat and eggs. Another unusual treat was that the breakfast area had attendants that assisted with anything you needed as well as cleanup.While most of our stay was pleasant, there were however two negatives about the hote,. First, the indoor pool was very cool. We had looked forward to letting our toddler swim but could only sit on the steps since the water was not warm enough. Secondly, I left an adapter for a charger plugged in at the desk in our room. I called the hotel within 24 hours to see if they could retrieve this for me and I would pick it up during another visit to the area. I was told that they would notify housekeeping who would let me know if they found the item. When I didn't hear anything back, I again called two days later and re-explained the problem to someone at the desk. I was assured that she would personally look into it and let me know one way or another. I never received a call. While I realize it is my fault that I left the item, it seems that it would have been easy enough to simply check and see if the adapter was still in the outlet or check with housekeeping. I would have appreciated a call even if nothing was found.

We didn't find that at all. We pulled right up to the hotel and a valet was there who gave us instructions. Parking was $20.00 if you do it yourself. We chose valet parking as it was only $5.00 more. Saved us the hassle. Check in was wonderful. Friendly and fast and very very helpful. The lobby is spacious and lovely. The rooms are the same. Beautiful and spacious. Decorated in springy colors. We had a sectional sofa in one part of the room with decorative throw pillows and a large flat screen T,.V. The beds were very comfortable and lots of pillows. Room also had refrigerator and microwave. Everything was clean clean clean. Not a speck of dirt. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. I also saw a review that said the fact that the Courtyard, Fairfield, and Springhill are all connected which makes it very confusing. I did not find it confusing at all. Everything is clearly marked where one starts and the other begins. Each has it's outside door so I didn't find it confusing at all. There is also a TGI Fridays connected to the Fairfield part of the building which was very convenient.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at this new Spring Hill Suites\u201d", "Author": "Janice1978", "ReviewID": "UR77285098", "Content": "Brought my niece and her two young children to Indy to see the Zoo & Children's Museum.

Breakfast in the morning was very abundant. I appreciate the key-operated elevator and didn't find it difficult to use at all. In fact, the kids enjoyed activating it with the key.

We normally stay at the Residence Inn on the Canal, but last time my kids complained about sharing the sleeper sofa and asked if there was a way they could each have their own bed. We chose the Springhill because it was the only hotel we could find with 2 queen beds + a fold-out couch. Also, it is part of the Marriott family so we got half our stay free with loyalty points. The unexpected surprise was the stunning view of White River State Park from our 15th floor room. It did remind me of the reflecting pools in DC and was especially gorgeous at dusk and after-dark. Our room and entire hotel had nice furnishings. The beds were comfy, even the fold-out, which was separated from the other beds by an opaque screen. The bathroom is split with a toilet and sink/mirror on one side of the closet and and shower and sink/mirror on the other side, both with sliding doors. This was very handy with a teen and tween girl. We expected a continental breakfast and were pleasantly surprised that the there also hot items: eggs, sausage, oatmeal, and make-your own waffle. The breakfast line could be better organized as the waffles created a bottle-neck, but that wasn't a big deal since we weren't in a hurry. You can easily walk to the canal, State Museum, Etiljorg, NCAA Hall of Champions, Victory Field, canal boat and surrey bike rentals, and even a couple of restaurants. The cafe at the Etiljorg was very pleasant with indoor and outdoor balcony seating overlooking the canal. Zoo and glass gardens with butterflies are maybe a 5 minute drive. The work-out room looks out to the small pool, which is handy for keeping an eye on older kids. Parking is $20 self-park and $25 valet and I didn't see any affordable off-site parking options. While it is steep, it is in line with other Indy hotels downtown. It was a little tricky for family members to find as there are many Marriott properties in the area and it shares a building with the Courtyard. A good landmark is that it is just past the giant red check mark sculpture. We missed the outdoor balcony and grill at the Residence Inn. My girls said that free cookies (like at Res. Inn) would have \"enhanced their hotel experience\". However, Springhill did offer free lollipops and free breakfast. Service was fine--no complaints. I admit Residence Inn was friendlier, probably since we have been going there for years and staff actually remember us from visit-to-visit. At the risk of seeming disloyal to Res. Inn, I think we found a new favorite.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland, IN", "Title": "\u201cNice and New -- But Learn to Say \"Sorry\"\u201d", "Author": "ConnieHighland", "ReviewID": "UR70049097", "Content": "Brand new, nicely decorated hotel situated right across the street from the Indiana State Museum.

That night a note was in my room from the manager finally apologizing and giving me 5,000 Marriott Rewards points. Well, at least that was better.

It is however, a bit on the \"funky\" side in terms of design, and the net effect is that the room is perhaps better suited to a solo traveler than a couple. The location is great. White River State Park is across the street to the North. The convention center is to the East and one block south. For sports fans, Victory Field is immediately south of the hotel, and Lucas Oil Stadium is a 10 minute walk. For most people visiting Indianapolis, the hotel's location will be hard to top. The hotel is brand new and the rooms have the latest tech amenities, including plenty of plugs for cell phones, laptops, etc. The alarm clock supports an i-Pod. The front desk staff was consistently helpful. Parking is underneath the hotel at a rate of $20 per night. The garage layout takes a bit of getting used to, but once you figure out the color coding for where to park for the Courtyard and Springhill Suites, versus which spots are more suited for the Fairfield or TGI Friday's, the layout is easy to follow, and it was easy to find a spot with a short walk to the elevator. In my view, the biggest negative of the room was the layout of the bathrooms. As noted in other reviews, the bathroom is split, with a counter / sink and shower area in one room and a commode and a small sink in another room. There was limited towel space in the commode section, leading me to question how two people - particularly neatniks - might survive in the room. Also, the only place to set luggage was on the sill beneath the window. On the whole, the room is nice, but I would rate it higher for solo travelers than couples or more. One huge service negative: prior to my check in, the maid did not check to make sure the alarm clock was set to off. I got a rude surprise at 5:20 am. Yes, I should have checked. But in my view, this is reflective of poor housekeeping service - although the room was otherwise clean. Two other cautionary notes. I checked in at 2:15 pm, and limited rooms were available. I understand the hotel was full the night before due to the 500 Festival Mini-Marathon, but one would expect better room availability by 2:15 pm. Secondly, the day I checked in, many Indianapolis downtown streets were closed due to the Mini-Marathon. The hotel staff was kind enough to send me (and presumably anyone else checking in that day) an e-mail advising of the street closures. One problem - the directions they sent would require driving the wrong way on a one way street.

It is adjacent to Fairfield Inn and Courtyard By Marriott. All three hotels share an underground garage that sits beneath the hotels. Self parking in the garage is $20/day and valet parking is $25/day. There is a well appointed TGIFriday's located in the Fairfield Inn and you can dine there or have it delivered to your room through room service. The hotel is very well appointed and serves a continental breakfast every morning. Rooms are well appointed and are trendy. Each room has a large Phillips LCD HDTV with plenty of HD channels available. Free internet is available via Wi-Fi or wired connections. Wi-Fi signal strength is very good and download speeds were 1.5 Mbit consistently. The room has an independently controlled HVAC system with a digital thermostat, microwave, and small cube fridge. The bathroom design is somewhat interesting in that is a split bathroom. The main sink/vanity and tub are in one room and the toilet and small sink are located in another area. The beds were very nice with high quality sheets and coverings. The night stand contained a phone along with an iHome clock radio with iPod Dock. As for other features, a fitness room was available with a variety of equipment available. The hotel features a very small indoor pool that probably could safely fit about 20 people in it. A business center is available where you can check your e-mail and print off boarding passes. The lobby is well appointed with free coffee and wi-fi. The breakfast area was very clean and offered a variety of hot and cold items for breakfast. Typically scrambled eggs and sausage patties were available along with a do-it-yourself waffle machine. A variety of cereals, bagels, and juices were available as well. For dinner, as mentioned previously, a TGIFriday's is located over in the Fairfield Inn.
