The bathroom was usable although not the cleanest and had a broken toilet seat. We had to tune the television in ourselves and the reception was awful. There were also dodgy electrics. The walls downstairs were wafer thin, luckily for us our neighbours were quite quiet. Service at the reception was odd to say the least, and we often felt like we were not welcome. The room was advertised as having a hair-dryer though it did not and honestly it was more trouble than worth to complain to reception. We didn't bother with breakfast so I cannot comment on that. One thing that was worrying about our room was the bars on the outside of the window, had there been a fire in the main building we wouldn't of been able to escape. Proximity to Tufnell Park tube station is about a 10 minute walk which is really good for the price of the room, and there are some local kebab and corner shops which is nice. We weren't there to spend much time in the hotel so we were grateful just to have a clean bed and a warm room to sleep in, while I probably wouldn't stay here again, if you're after somewhere cheap and don't mind roughing it a bit then this place is one to consider.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cThis place was bad in 1985 nothing has changed I see\u201d", "Author": "aussie85_9", "ReviewID": "UR120726747", "Content": "This place was bad in 1985 - The outside look ok - Friends living closeby booked us in for a week.

The hotel is outdated and needs an emergency makeover internally and a social skills course for the staff. On arriving at the hotel we were given a room which to find seemed like an episode of the cryptum factor! The room was in the basement with a shower that a homeless person would think twice about using and general decor that was depressing. We had to tune the TV in and there was a fire exit door outside our room that wasn't locked and could be opened from the inside and outside. When we challenged the reception staff they told me that i was lying and there was no way that the door could be opened from the outside, trust me a trained monkey could open that door and on that point would make a better fist of the role on reception than the sarcastic and surly middle aged Asian gentleman i spoke to who in my opinion is a disgrace and should be fired. I was not alone in complaining, in fact in the 10 minutes i waited at reception there were 4 other guest that came up and complained about a wide range of issues and some refused to stay and left. In hindsight we should of done the same. The beds were dirty and i think staying at a youth hostel would of been a better choice! There was loud music played until 2am so not much sleep was had. What i would say is that even though i have stayed in 5 star hotels before, i did not expect this to be a 5 star, in fact i had prepared myself for a 3 star hotel. In my opinion this hotel if inspected would struggle to achieve above one star. I'm not the type of person to review anything i buy but i feel so strongly about this hotel i had to write my feelings down, hopefully to persuade people like me who though 'well it's cheap, i can put up with anything for one night!' not to stay here. The guests are mainly tourists and that is the worst thing, this hotel is unfortunately an ambassador for the UK and i'm ashamed that people visiting the UK stay here, what impression is that giving to them of us in the UK. To the management of the hotel and the general manager who i was told to see the next morning and the only person who could deal with the complaints. All i can say to you is you must be very busy dealing with complaints and either you, your line manager or the owners of this establishment need to wake up and see that the 'hotel' you 'run' is a disgrace and i would be shocked if this is not closed down when inspected next.

When we arrived, it was immediately obvious that there was a problem. The room we had supposedly reserved, was not available. The lady at the desk, somewhat apologetic, informed us that instead of an ensuite room, we were getting stuck with what could only be described as the \"Dungeon Room.\" It took forever to sort things out, as she was on the phone with the Hotels.Com(Expedia) site trying to sort the situation out. Even after a lengthy delay, it did not seem anything was accomplished from her call. I told her that I had seen that room as an option, and I intentionally avoided it, because I refused to stay in a room without a bathroom. We were exhausted from a long red eye flight from New York, some time at the airport searching online for a room, and then a long subway ride into the city, complete with all our luggage. We had few options, and were forced to settle for what they had available. I did not feel like traipsing around London, so we took the room. I was told that my rate would be credited, since the non-ensuite room was $30-$40 US cheaper than what I had reserved and paid for. As of now, Hotels.Com has not issued a credit, and I plan to dispute that difference, if not the entire rate paid with my credit card company. The bed in the Dungeon room, was from the dark ages, and the springs pushing through the \"mattress,\" gave your back an invigorating massage, whether you wanted one or not. The \"tv,\" was a nice 9\" model, and may not have even had a remote. As already stated, there was no bathroom in the room. You had to walk down the hall, and in the morning, past the breakfast room, to find the shower & toilet. I think we might have been the only unfortunate souls to use the bathroom. What made the Dungeon room so unique though, was the constant feeling that you might somehow die at any moment, if the ceiling caved in. Everytime someone walked up above you, the entire ceiling creaked Loudly. The room above was the reception area, so there was continued walking into the night, but thankfully eventually stopped in the later hours, before starting up again the next morning. This was the beginning of our trip, and we thought it might be over before it started, should the ceiling collapse upon us. Regardless, it was impossible to get any rest, with the constant creaking. My fiance checked out the breakfast, which I think was supposed to have some cooked to order stuff, and she said it didn't look like anything special, with not much really cooked to order. Can't really comment though, since I didn't check it out myself. So other than the screwup with the room reservation, the box springs from H*LL and a ceiling in desperate need of attention, our stay at Queens Hotel, at 33 Anson, London, was fantastic.

Location was fine, Tufnell Park station is on the Northern Line and it's also on the route of the 390 bus that runs by Kings Cross. My job was in Moorgate so getting to work was easy from here. Breakfast - I usually preferred to get something close to work so I could maximise sleep (I started at 8am), therefore I never tried the hotel breakfast. Rooms - they had both en-suite (i.e. either a bath or shower in the room) and regular (shared bathroom). My room had a shower. There's still a lot of small independent hotels in the UK like this. I had no problems with the staff, the ones I encountered were talkative and friendly. I'm a bit worried about some of these more recent reviews though, has maintenance been slipping? With prices as low as they charge I can imagine that there's not much budget for renovation. So would I recommend it? Well if you're starting a job in London and don't have much of a budget the hotel is worth checking out. When I expressed interest in booking this hotel as a temporary place to stay when I started my first London job they showed me the room they'd allocate me before I made any commitment. I think this is worth doing to ensure that you're happy staying there. If you're just visiting London for a couple of days holiday I'd say it's worth paying a bit extra for one of the cheaper chain hotels if you're on a budget (e.g Premier Inn) and if you're not on a budget then London has some really nice luxury hotels.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hasselt", "Title": "\u201cappalling - should be closed\u201d", "Author": "Deflumine", "ReviewID": "UR30708188", "Content": "Part of a group, I saw such things as hairs in the bed, rather strange stains on the sheets and covers, holes in the walls, overall disgusting Luckily I brought handtowel from home to put on filthy and greasy pillow Some rooms in basement are even worse Breakfast is a further disgrace - hotels like this should be closed in a country like UK", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, England", "Title": "\u201cavoid this hotel\u201d", "Author": "rickymonsoon", "ReviewID": "UR28953797", "Content": "This Hotel needs closing down.
