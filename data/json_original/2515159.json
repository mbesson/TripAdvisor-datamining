Great building in a great part of town. We share the building with the Apple store - so you know it must be kewl. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. The rooms (although ours was smallish - but typical for Europe) are very well appointed. Decorating in the hotel and rooms is very nice. Has the some of the W quirkiness - which is fun. In-room amenities are great. They have a charging station for almost evey mobile phone imaginable and nice audio/video equiptment.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great room with views of the Opera, still some teething issues\u201d", "Author": "Iainy", "ReviewID": "UR127088413", "Content": "Celebrated our 10th wedding annivesary at W, staying in a Marvellous Suite. Good size room for Paris and great view of the Opera House when laying in bed. However, 1st night was a Friday and kept awake till small hours of the morning due to the thumping bass coming up from hotel bar downstairs. Complained next morning and front of house did a great job in moving us to one of the wow suites and hence great sleep the next night. Another issue we had was with the service at breakfast on both mornings, restaurant staff keen but very disorganised and they really didn't appear to know what they were doing....shown to our table waited 10mins still no service and then same person came and asked us if we had finished.... Bizarre.. Similar experience 2nd morning... So in short, hotel has potential but needs to sort out the teething issues", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMagnifique!\u201d", "Author": "australiantripper_10", "ReviewID": "UR126999342", "Content": "This W is true to form (beautiful quirky touches) and manages to incorporate French chic! We booked a Wonderful room which was large by Paris standards and was quite well designed. A little less mini bar area and more bathroom would have been nice. No where to hang the towels and the basin spout, though it looked very cool, splashed water straight out onto your front! The beds were comfortable but pillows all down/feather so disappear to nothing overnight. The staff were all lovely (and gorgeous) and very helpful. Breakfast was great, good espresso. The hotel is really well located, around the corner from a metro station, a few blocks down from Place Vendome and the Tuileries, Louvre etc and a block away from the big department stores. Such a beautiful building; as you enter, the lifts are straight ahead, small reception area to the left and bar/lounge to the right - because these areas are disjointed, you don't get a really great first impression and it lacks the usual ambience of a W Hotel which is shame.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWonderful W\u201d", "Author": "jetsetter741", "ReviewID": "UR126143904", "Content": "W Paris is in a very central location in the heart of town, a short walk from Galleries Lafayette and Printemps, and with a stunning view of the Opera. The hotel is filled with very chic women in fur coats and staggeringly high heels, so if you like people watching, this is a great place to park yourself (we saw Nikki Hilton in the hotel bar). We booked the standard (wonderful) room, and found the room a decent size for a hotel in Paris, and it came with all the modern amenities as expected, iphone chargers etc. There is also some seriously good chocolate in the mini bar. The breakfast is pricey (45 euro) and wasn't included in our standard room rate, but worth experiencing at least once - the service was great, and they had hot soup, the freshest croissants ever, as well as eggs done in many styles (I had the poached egg with salmon and it arrived topped with fish roe - super yummy). The hotel restaurant has an excellent chef at the helm, and served really good tapas. Worth trying at least once - and DO book ahead, because it was closed for a private event the first night that we were there, and FULL the next night. The hotel bathrooms are glass, and not nearly frosted enough if you are traveling with a business associate! Be warned also that there are no places to hang towels inside the shower area without getting them wet. All in, the hotel is WOW, for location and cool factor. Worth checking out in Paris!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cShocking\u201d", "Author": "Vikas S", "ReviewID": "UR126134983", "Content": "Shocking hotel given the price they charge.

The room was pretty large for Paris hotels and amazing views of the Opera. Location is great 2 mins walk from major department stores, opposite a metro stop and place vendome. The staff were so helpful and are really motivated and make you feel really welcome. Love the W beds and quirky design features. The bar was very cool and had a live DJ and a huge list of cocktails. The breakfast was very noval with a private buffet served at every table. I would stay at this hotel again in a flash.

The location and building were superb but sadly that's where we stopped being impressed. The hotel had been open for three days and already looked dated, the staff were still in the process of being trained so whilst all were very friendly service was very slow. The room had a very comfortable bed but the accommodation was cramped with a very strange bathroom set up that had a tiny toilet and no bath. The door to the room allied all external sounds through and we were woken by work still being done to the hotel at 5am. We also heard all the music from the bar until late into the night- not what you'd expect from 5 star hotel. We returned from a day out in Paris to find the room hadn't been made up.
