{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great times in Addison My daughter and I stayed at the Addison Motel 6 during a trip to San Antonio. We stopped in Dallas for a couple of days. It was a great area with LOTS of great restaurants and shops, etc. to enjoy. The area was in the midst of a business district, also. Great malls and shopping were also around the area in close proximity. This hotel was pretty basic, but clean. Nice laundry facilities and great pool! Everything was majorly clean! I would definitely stay there again!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR238724227", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jg2163"}, {"Content": "nice this motel 6 was one of the cleanest I have been in.
