I liked the area which is a proper neighbourhood, kids going to school, people buying their bread from the bakery and a metro stop very nearby which makes getting around easy. The hotel is in a typical narrow town house and everything is small, including the super small lift. The room although small (it is Paris) was really well designed with no space wasted. The bathroom (shower only) was also well designed with expensive fittings and a very good shower. Bed was comfortable. It was also very warm and we could not get the air conditioning unit to work. It wasn't a big problem for us as we were there in November so we just opened our window a bit. On both the Saturday night and the Monday night I was woken by a strange repetitive sound, a little like a buzzing of a phone on vibrate but it kept on repeating. Sunday night was quiet. I solved the mystery when checking out I think. I asked the receptionist to check the occupancy for the previous few nights in the room above ours. It had been empty on the Sunday and I suspect that on the other nights the air conditioning unit had been left 'on' and was repeatedly trying to fire up as this was what happened with ours when we tried to get it to work. So I'd like to stay in this hotel again but I'd check very carefully that they had sorted out the problem with the air conditioning first, especially if going when likely to be warm. It is some time since we stayed there so it may well be sorted out. We had breakfast in Cafe Vavin very close by as the hotel breakfast was so expensive and we never saw anyone having breakfast there. When my husband suggested to the receptionist on checking out that they might get more takers if they made it a bit cheaper she said they couldn't undercut the other hotels in Paris. Obviously the concept of competition has passed her by! We did find the reception staff to be friendly and helpful. A word of warning, the hotel is on a tiny street and no-one including taxi drivers knows where it is so make sure you bring a print out of the map with you. I found out too late that it was just outside the central Paris maps in my guidebook and none of the people we asked knew of the street. If coming in from the airport by train the easiest thing to do is to get off at Port Royal and turn right when you come out of the station. Walk along the boulevard for about 10 mins until you see the Cafe de la Rotonde. Turn right and then right again to find Rue Chaplain Rive Gauche and the hotel is along here on your right.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cDouble standards of rooms & bad management\u201d", "Author": "754PhilippeO", "ReviewID": "UR127227941", "Content": "I booked via internet (www. hrs.de) for 2 nights. The hotel offered me a room in a small area as a backyard, which obviously was not the standard rooms. There was no indication on the website, where I booked that there are such rooms. First surprise: the room does not have a real window; There is a mini window on the door (like the cells in prison). Have you been in a hotel room without window? Is this really allowed? 2nd surprise: whenever someone from the upper floor goes in the bathroom or toilette and takes a shower you can listen and \"enjoy' the noise because the isolation is NIL! I made a complaint after the first terrible night, because the noise was really aknowing and actually realized that the room is not a hotel room to my understanding. The receptionist proposed me to write an email with my complaint to the manager. I have concluded that he does not communicate with him. I insisted that he has to contact him and then revert to me! He understood and even mentioned that some clients already had some complaints (great reaction) and that I will receive a feedback on the next day. . I mentioned that if they cannot change my room I would like to have at least a compensation ( I have paid for 2 nights in the \"basement\" 280 Euro) On the next day at breakfast and when I checked out there was a new receptionist. She did not speak to me about my request and problem, so I left it and decided to write my complaint. I was on a business trip and when I speak to someone about an issue 10 minutes I do not expect to remind people 3 times and explain again and again. Conclusion: nobody cares about customers in this hotel; Problem management is NIL; the employees are afraid to speak to the management; This is what I call Arrogant management style!

The room was recently updated and quite nice. The bathroom was especially nice in that the shower head lit up green and changed color from green to red. It was fun to turn the bathroom lights out and take a shower with the shower head as the light! The bed was comfortable and room clean. We had a double room and there were two large closets on either side to store our stuff, so that even though the room was typically smaller than American hotel rooms, we did not feel cramped. The windows opened up and it was very nice to have them open to the Paris spring weather. The first night was Friday and the restaurant below must be the place to be since it was quite lively (and noisy) until well after midnight. My smart phone has a \"white noise\" app on it though and so we turned that on and it did a good job drowning out the noise. There was no noise problem at all Saturday or Sunday, so perhaps it is just a Friday night problem. Otherwise, this hotel is on a quiet street and remarkably calm. There are many cafes and restaurants nearby that we found to be quite good and not at all touristy. That is what I liked most about this hotel - it wasn't surrounded by tourists or touristy shops and restaurants. I also liked that there were two Metro stops that were very close by (M4 Vavin and M12 N-D des Champs).

As we try to stay in different areas of the city on each visit, we were looking forward to staying in St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. But, I was mislead by the Hotels.com website who positioned this hotel in St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s when in actual fact, it is located in Montparnasse : disappointment number 1. Upon arrival, the gentleman on duty was so busy texting, he barely noticed us arriving and I had to clear my throat loudly for him to look up. He was however very courteous and helpful once we got his attention. Disappointment number 2 : the room was so small, we could barely get our luggage in and actually move around the room. That problem was resolved however the next morning with a slightly larger room at no extra charge. However, the bathroom was smaller, so I guess there is compromise necessary whichever way you go. The chambermaid was FANTASTIC and helped make our transfer simple and painless. The friendliness and helpfulness of the front desk staff varied depending on who was on duty but for the most part, was OK. Please do not forget your earplugs as the noise level in this hotel is pretty high. Also, if you are into comfortable, fluffy beds and pillows, this hotel is definitely not for you. I actually had back problems in the morning because the bed was as stiff as concrete, very uncomfortable and not very restful nights. Elevator only carries 2 people at a time or one person and one piece of luggage. Be prepared to make a few trips up and down before you settle into your room. The area is great, safe and varied but I would walk away from the immediate neighborhood which is pricey and commercial. You are literally minutes away from the Luxembourg Gardens. There is a neighborhod p\u00e2tisserie who make the most divine traditional ham baguettes : p\u00e2tisserie Saint-Honor\u00e9. Back to this small boutique hotel; we arrived on our own steam but requested a transport to get us back to the airport. They were charging \u20ac40. We paid a deposit of \u20ac20 and had to give the rest to the driver. Upon arrival at the airport, the driver informs us that it actually only should have cost us \u20ac34 leaving the hotel with a nice little net profit of \u20ac6. I was knocked for a loop on this one, they should warn their drivers to be a little more discreet or else split the profits with them!

Location is ideal - far from crowds but just next to Vavin Metro, and near iconic cafes such as Le Rotonde as well as the Luxembourg Gardens.

The first restaurant we ate in (italian around the corner), our server spoke no english. Just Great! But Raspali or St.Michael Blvds nearby are great places to shop for clothes. Hotel service was eh. We checked in, but the girl from Senegal had an attitude problem. We overlooked it. Other staff were fine. The rooms are nice and clean, but a bit small. The bathrooms were very modern and the shower head was memorable. It lights up depending on whether the water is cold (blue) or hot (red). Location wise, it has pluses and minuses. The plus point being you're away from all the tourists, but you're a bit far from the attractions. The green double-decker bus is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Don't go through the famous Luxeumbourg Gardens (unless you want to) to get on the double-decker. Theres a stop closer to the hotel as we learned later. Once you're on the bus, you're set. To go to specific attractions like the Louvre from the hotel, just take a cab. It's not that expensive as we discovered. Be sure to grab a hotel business card. It has a map on the back so if the driver is unsure of the hotel street coming back, show the card.

My wife and I traveled to Paris with friends and we were in Paris for about a half a week. The hotel looked like a perfect combination of style and value, and it was well reviewed here on TripAdvisor, but we had never stayed in this particular part of the left bank and knew little of it. Although ordinarily I would expect a hotel review to address the hotel first, in this case what really surprised me about this trip was how much I enjoyed the neighborhood. I have been to Paris a few times before and have seen most of its best known sights. As I will further address in a minute the hotel itself was all I hoped for but if readers would pass on Hotel Chaplain for a hotel in a more touristed neighborhood I think they would miss out on what I perceived to be a very authentic Parisian experience. The hotel is literally only blocks from the South side of Luxemborg gardens and the Cimetiere Montparnasse, Henri Cartier Bresson foundation and Catacombs were nearby. Also some of the best historic brasseries and restaurants are just up the block at Vavin metro -- including Le Coupole, Select, La Rotonde and Le Dome. We also ate a superior local restaurant called Le Timbre nearby. The hotel is also very well served by Metro and within easy walking distance for those in reasonable shape to all of the left bank and riverside sights, (Eiffel Tower, 45 minutes, Pont de Artes, Louvre, Orsay, Rodin Museum, 25 minutes, Orsay, Notre Dame, 25 minutes). I should point out that although some of the surrounding blocks are lively the area around the hotel was peaceful. We had heard of some complaints about noise from local bars but didn't experience that at all. The hotel was small and stylish. It was quite a value for Paris. Some pictures are attached. Our room was spacious and had all the expected amenities as well as a characteristic rooftops/courtyard view from a small faux terrace. Our room was quiet and comfortable but what set this small gem apart was the very attentive staff, including but not limited to Melanie, who bent over backwards to meet every need.

We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but walked to one of the nearby patesseries and had freshly baked pastry and coffee which was great. The hotel was a bit of a walk away from the sights but if like us you don't mind walking everywhere (it truely is the best way to see a city) then it would be ideal for you. There are plenty of restaurants nearby to eat in. We ate in a traditional French restaurant and a Thai restaraunt during our stay. We also found a Canadian bar close to Notre Dame and a Cuban bar near to the hotel both of which were great for a few drinks (or coffee at the Canadian bar on a particularly cold day!) We saw most of the sights on foot, the Eifel tower was the longest walk as the hotel is over the other side of the city, but we did use the tube and the red bus tour as well to ensure that we got to see all of the city during our stay.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wymeswold", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms but that's all\u201d", "Author": "traveller_lou", "ReviewID": "UR71901664", "Content": "The hotel was very clean and the rooms were nice although small. The hotel was a long way out of the centre although there was a metro stop nearby. The reception staff spoke English but the rest did not which was a little problematic when they were sent to the room to deal with problems.... Our safe didn't work and when a member of staff (no English) tried and found the same, the receptionist suggested that our passports, money etc would be ok in the broken safe since the staff had worked there for 20 years and so we could trust them. What???!!! We weren't offered a room change and had to insist on this, which they seemed to find strange.... The hairdryer was faulty and rather than send another, the non-English speaking maid came to test it in another room. She then brought what she claimed was the same one, which miraculously worked again. I think she just swapped it, but why imply that we didn't know how to use hairdryers by teaching us what to do (i.e. press the button)? After using the working safe in the new room, when we returned in the evening, the safe wouldn't open and was showing an error message. The receptionist had to type in the access code and we had to re-programme it. There was no way we made a mistake with the code and wonder if someone had tried to tamper with it during the day? Who knows. Unfortunately there were no coffee/tea facilities in the rooms. We overheard on the last day that we could use these facilities in reception. However there was a charge, which seemed a little mean! Also, the receptionists were not very helpful at all - we were only given a tourist map on the second day of five when we asked for directions. Also, we asked for the nearest internet cafe to print our return flight tickets. We were told there were none nearby and hardly any in Paris. We then asked at a patisserie nearby who gave us directions immediately - 3 mins down the main road! We then went to pick up our cases and saw that they had a laptop in reception for guests to use!!!

We booked directly with hotel. The room was small (which was expected for Paris), room for a bed, 2 bedside tables, closet and small desk built into corner. I made sure i unpacked both our suitcases and moved around the 2 chairs, so that there was sufficient walking space. The safe didn't work, but we don't usually use them anyway. They provided a small cooler fridge, kept in a hiding space in the wall. It kept things cool but not cold. Air conditioning worked well. Bed was very hard (we arent used to hard beds) but after the first 2 nights we got used to it. The toilet roll holder was positioned almost directly over the toilet meaning you couldn't quite sit straight on the toilet. But the bathroom was quite a good size. There was a shower over a bathtub, but the shower screen was small and not moveable - less than 2 feet and I found that a lot of water sprayed onto the floor. There was a lift available, however it is very tiny (it states max 4 capacity) and we managed to fit 2 people and 2 medium suitcases in, but we were squished. The hotel gives you a large key for your hotel door, however you have to hand this in at reception every time you leave the hotel, which is really great as it is one less thing you have to carry with you all day. There was some construction going on outside, but we couldn't hear it from our room. Vavin metro station is only 5 minute walk away and can be a little tricky to find the hotel from there the first time, Shannon's pub is located on the corner of rue Jules chaplain, so if you get lost, just look out for the pub. The reception staff were very helpful on the phone when we arrived from CDG airport. Also there is a laundromat just across the street, it is unmanned and you will need change to use it. From memory it cost 1 euro for wash powder, 7 euros for wash and dryer was 1 euro per 10 minutes. Hotel is also located near montparnasse observation tower which is quite a good alternative to Eiffel tower. There is also a Velib bike station located across the street from hotel which we found very handy as well.

I arrived at 11pm and the first thing that struck me was the welcome at reception. Not only was it friendly, but I was also told about the free wireless connection in the room and the fact that the minibar was free. It is unusual to find a receptionist in any city who would do this, but in Paris it is unprecedented. The room itself was a good size by Parisian standards, particularly the bathroom. Be warned that the bed is extremely hard and while this suited me fine, it may not be to everyone's liking. There were also some minor issues with the bathroom - for example, the shower is inclined to splash everywhere and the bathroom itself was cold in the morning - but in a 3 star hotel, these are not major issues. I had an early start so ate breakfast there. While it was pretty expensive at \u20ac 14, the quality of the food was good albeit limited. For example, the orange juice was freshly squeezed but it was the only juice available. It was typical continental fare - cheese, cold meats, yogurts, breads and pastries. Overall, this is a very good small hotel and appears to be staffed by people who actually like their jobs.

I just wish it were in a more convenient location.\u201d", "Author": "DrHickenlocher", "ReviewID": "UR41648959", "Content": "Chaplain Rive Gauche as a hotel was delightful, with cute style (although IKEA furniture), great service from the staff, and a very reasonable price. I only wish it were in a slightly better spot. My wife and I spent 4 nights here, using it as our base of operations with which to explore Paris for the very first time. We arrived from Charles de Gaulle and took the Air France Bus to Gare Montparnasse. From there, it was about a 1.0km walk (10 minutes-ish) to the hotel. No problem for our two roller suitcases and a backpack. Definitely print yourself a map, though. The hotel is tucked away into a quiet little side street (great for lack of noise). We were ably greeted and all the staff spoke enough English to help us out. We were then told we'd been upgraded to a Club room from a Classic for our stay, and got Room #5 on the Ground Floor right behind the lobby. This turned out to be just fine for us (very convenient, no elevators or stairs), but if you are a really light sleeper or want a view, you might want to ask for a different room. They have 5 floors to work with. It wasn't that we could hear anything in the lobby, but apparently the stairs were right next to the room, so we could hear people going up and down at night and in the morning. And the only window was out of the way and only faced the courtyard. Again, we didn't mind, so we just stayed put. Room was typically Parisien-small, even if it was a \"Club\". We had enough room to put our suitcases next to the bed on the far side, and walk around the near side plus a little wing chair, along with a small desk and the IKEA closet. The bed was comfortable enough. And the room had everything we \"needed\", like phone, hair dryer, wall safe, and microfridge. THE GOOD: * Free use of a laptop with Internet access in the lobby, along with water and tea, even in the middle of the night. Just beware the funky French keyboard. * Free Wi-Fi if you do bring your own computer (we didn't). * Free local calls. We got a calling card, and rather than having to go to a pay phone, we could call from our room without any additional charges, unlike say... the Hilton. * Literally a hop away from Vavin metro. And the patisserie just before you get to the Metro is really good. THE BAD: * Vavin isn't a really good Metro stop. It only has Line 4. And transferring to any line but Line 12 at Montparnasse-Bienvenue is a LONG hike underground in the tunnels. We transferred to Line 6 (Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, etc.) by going BACKWARDS at Raspail to get the short transfer instead of hiking at Montparnasse. Montparnasse-Bienvenue, Edgar Quinet, and Notre-Dame-des-Champs aren't that far away. But after a day of hiking around museums and monuments, we'd rather just catch a transfer to get to Vavin... eventually. * The glass door in the shower/tub only goes back like 2 feet, and there's no curtain. So LOTS of water splashed out onto the floor, completely drenching the little floor towel. Also, the diverter spout got stuck a few times. My wife absolutely could not switch it from \"bathtub\" flow to \"shower\" flow without me. * The electrical outlets are recessed, meaning one of our converters wouldn't fit into it. We found this was the same in Germany as well, although not in Italy. Just something to be aware of. GOOD TO KNOW: * The key is this heavy silver cone keychain with a physical key attached to it. You have to use the key to lock/unlock the door, from outside AND when inside. Just hope there isn't a fire inside where you need to leave, only to find you need the key to get yourself OUT. Highly unlikely, but something to be aware of. * You have to leave the key at the front desk whenever you leave. Not a big deal, no worries about losing it. But for the first couple of days, we would return home to find a never-met-before staff member and just say \"Room #5\", and they would hand us the key. By the second or third day, they recognized us and pulled out #5 as we arrived, but for those first couple of days, I wonder what would have happened if just ANYONE waltzed in and asked for \"#5\". Would the staff have given the key to them? * I think the A/C is disabled unless you ask them to turn it on. The temperature in the room was always nice, so we never bothered. * Breakfast is optional, but expensive. Better to go out. All in all, Chaplain Rive Gauche provided exactly what we'd expected: clean, safe, comfortable accommodations to sleep in and get ready for the next day in. It's not a resort with bells and whistles, but the free internet access was really nice and the staff were always so polite and helpful (especially the guy who gave us the 5am wake-up call for our flight out!). I would totally recommend the hotel itself to anyone else. But personally, if I was to go to Paris again, I might try to find a place closer to a better Metro station.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cgreat find!\u201d", "Author": "djinc01", "ReviewID": "UR39246629", "Content": "We chose Le Chaplain Rive Gauche based on location and some decent reviews for our first trip to Paris.

I'm sure you could pay more - - much more - - somewhere in Paris to get a larger room, but this one was sufficient for our purposes. We didn't try their breakfast since there were several places nearby to get fresh croissants and cafe, i. e., coffee. They have a lift, as they call it, which is necessary due to the narrow winding stairs. There's a movie theater next door if you can understand the French language. We can't but made ado at the Hotel Chaplain. Asta is a charm from Bordeaux and speaks perfect English. Some of the others do not. The Metro stop is Vavin and is just around the corner from this hotel. That's a plus. You should try the Timbre Restaurant which is a two minute walk from this hotel. It's gourmet French food at an affordable price, considering that room and board is rather high in France with the value of the dollar being what it is. They give you sodas, water, and juice daily for free, but the little refrigerator could have been somewhat colder. The bed was very comfortable. I saw a few businessmen there as well.

The 'classic' room we stayed in was spotlessly clean but very small. Wardrobe space is extremely limited and we could only just squeeze our suitcase down beside the bed and the wall. There was a small flat-screen tv on the wall in one corner of our room, showing French channels. The bedding felt quite cheap and scratchy but the bed was reasonably comfortable. The bathroom was small (no bath) but the power shower was really great; easily the best thing about the room. There was an electronic safe, a hairdryer and a small fridge (containing water and soft drinks) in the wardrobe. The hotel is about a minute's walk from Vavin metro station, which is about 20 minutes from Gare du Nord on the No 4 metro line (it looks much longer on the metro map, but it was surprisingly quick). It's very easy to get into the centre of town either on foot (about 30 minutes' walk) or via the metro. There are also lots of bars, restaurants and take-aways in the streets around the hotel.
