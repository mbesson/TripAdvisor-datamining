The family that owns it is very friendly and have the cutest black poodle named Bilba that had just had puppies, which I very much wanted to take home. The owner brought the babies in from home just to show them to us, and we rolled around on the carpet playing with them.

Okay, upon arrival, I did'nt feel welcome, but got checked in. The room was small. I mean the bed and the wall had about one foot and that is obvious in the photos, but the location was good and the room was well kept up and clean. The breakfast was pretty good. Out of the 4 hotels I stayed at in Italy during my 10 day tour, this was number 4 at the bottom of my list. The hot water heater broke and many guests left. They told me that if I stay they will reduce my nightly fee by 15% and I can help my self to the mini bar. The facility was fixed the next day, in fairness it was a Sunday and I had hot water on Monday and Tuesday nights. They did honor a 10% discount and complained about my two waters from the mini bar so I argued the point and won but I felt uncomfortable. The lcoation was walking distance form the main attractions and museums and the hop on hop off bus actually stopped 2 blocks away so that was convenient. The area was located in the Jewish ghetto so it was safe. I would not stay there again because of the unfriendly staff and small room, I would rate it as average or okay becasue the price was competitive but not great given teh size of the room. I was impressed by the 19 LCD TV in my room but again not recommended for someone that likes more space. I basically had to stay on the bed when I was in the room as it took up the whole room and it was a twin sized bed (really small room, not kidding). I had an unpleasent feeling when I left becasue of the hassels with the water heater and discount and the unfriendly staff but its okay. Does'nt deserve a harsh review because they did honor some sort of discount when I could have been out of luck having pre paid, but not sure if it would have been worth it to pay a little more for another place.

I had read reviews before I went and expected a good,if basic, hotel, but I found it the best hotel (of four) I have stayed in over the past 20 months ,in Florence.It is in very quiet surroundings on a pleasant street but is only a ten minute,or less, walk from the Duomo ,Santa Croce and the main tourist areas. At the end of the day you can get either a regular bus which stops at the end of the street,or the Line C eco bus which stops about a one minute walk from the hotel ! Great for sore feet. As regards the accommodation, the hotel is clean,bright and modern ,the breakfast more than adequate,and there is a small lounge area with Internet and papers/magazines.My single room was the standard size for a single ,nicely furnished and the air con worked. The bathroom was the smallest I think I have ever seen but was newly refurbished and was fine,(if cramped) with a proper enclosed shower and complementary toiletries. As another guest had remarked the walls are on the thin side but are so in many modern hotels-that's why I always travel with earplugs.Being a residential area there is not a cafe on every corner, but there are two in the immediate vicinity of the hotel ,the trattoria Acaddi about four minutes walk on the Borgo di Pinti is good and in the other direction,about four minutes and off the P.Ambrogio are some more.

Overall, I liked the hotel's location, rooms and breakfast. The staff seemed very friendly, but didn't want to and/or couldn't honor the terms of agreement. The summary on hotels.com and other sites stated complimentary parking and internet. They attemped to charge me for both. For starters, there was no internet access in my room as advertised, no big deal, I'll just use my computer in the lobby. There was no wireless access there like the front desk clerk said, so he let me use the computer in the lobby. I tried to use it and it required a password and he charged for the password (6 euros/half hour) and it turned out to be dial-up access.By the way, the only reason I wanted to use the internet in the first place was to show the staff the websites advertising free internet and free parking. After the websites came up 30 minutes later, they agreed to finally give these things to me free.Then 3 days later when I checked out, they had 6 euros for internet and 60 euros for parking on my bill. I explained to the clerk what happened earlier. She said the first clerk was wrong and I have to pay. I demanded she call that clerk on the phone. She wouldn't, so I asked to speak with the manager and she told me she was the manager.After a long conversation explaining to her that management is responsible for employeess making misleading or false statements and/or the information advertised on the websites they are booked through, she finally gave me my car keys so I could leave without paying these extra charges.On a side note, the maps of Florence in the lobby with prices of entry were incorrect as well. We went to several place including the Boboli gardens only to find out that the entrance fee was 8.5 euros, not 2.

The hotel itself also offers kosher meals for groups of a certain size (for a sizable fee, of course).Generally, the hotel was pretty nice. Breakfast is included, and they offer a limited but tasty selection. There is a small lobby where you can relax, with one computer that has Internet access (as of May 2006, 2 euro for a half-hour, 4 euro for an hour, and 6 euro for 2 hours). The rooms are simple and small but clean, and the bathrooms modern (a SMALL shower, not a bathtub). They didn't waste much money on decorations, but the rooms are reasonably coordinated and attractive. The location was good - we weren't in the heart of tourist-land (or anywhere near the train station, which is an area we thought was sketchy), but were definitely able to walk to all of the tourist sites. (It's maybe a 10 minute walk to the cathedral, etc.). The service was helpful but again, limited. (For example, they happily call you taxis when you request it, and helped set us up with a tour of Sienna/San Gimignano for a day.) It's definitely a budget hotel, which is something we didn't know going in. (Personally, I would prefer to pay more and stay somewhere nicer, but this turned out fine in the end, since the service, location and cleanliness were all good.)
