I don't know why you would own a hotel in a reasonably nice neighborhood and install topically \"nice\" bathroom fixtures and allow the guest experience to be some unbelievably terrible, but this place just sucks.

The hotel is located in a nice area of Mexico City. Like all big cities some parts of Mexico can be intimidating but in my experience Condesa is a very nice neighbourhood and is generally clean and we did not feel intimidated at all, even when walking around after dark. There are some excellent bars and restaurants in the vicinity and we had an excellent meal and a few drinks without having to take a taxi anywhere else. We were quite badly jet-lagged so didn't really make the most of all the bars. The Hippodrome has a small bar downstairs which we didn't get a chance to try. Looks nice from a quick peek around the door. The music from the bar was quite loud and a bit bothersome, but it was generally quiet after midnight. I think it bothered us because we were jet-lagged and in bed by 9.30-10pm. If you want an early night this might be an issue for you. I saw some comments about a lack of hot water. This was not an issue at any point during our stay. We had very hot water and excellent water pressure in a big drench style shower. The best shower we had in Mexico in fact! The bathroom was small but well appointed and there were toiletries provided. The bedroom also was nicely designed and the bed was comfy and room cleaned daily. I didn't have an in-room safe which was a disappointment but the hotel offers a main safe. My preference is for the latter, especially in a country I do not know well. All in all we did not see any of the bad points that had been mentioned in some previous reviews. The hotel is comfortable, clean, in a great location and for the price we paid this was a 4* stay. If we were paying the rack rate that would drop to 3* in my opinion - nothing I can really fault but at the full-rate price bracket there is a lot of competition in the D.F.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice room but no hot water!\u201d", "Author": "Brettbasic", "ReviewID": "UR53363981", "Content": "Before staying at the Hippodrome Hotel I did a search on tripadvisor.com and found lots of not so great reviews about the hotel.

I worried when booking the reservation that it was some sort of joke, or that the Hippodrome would turn out to be some dodgy dive; neither was true. I have NEVER seen this type of promotional stunt pulled by any boutique hotel in the world, and I overheard the owner talking to someone and saying he wasn't sure if it'd work either, but it certainly worked in pulling me in! If the $17.50/night rate is still available when you read this, don't even hesitate to book a room at the Hippodrome: at that price it is literally the best hotel deal in the world, even compared to some of the dirt-cheap rates seen in places like Buenos Aires and Southeast Asia. However, for argument's sake I have to assume the promotional rate won't last forever and thus compare the Hippodrome to other hotels in the $175/night range. On that front it holds up in some areas but has some notable weaknesses in others, at least compared to DF's top three (in my opinion) boutique properties: the Condesa, Habita and newly revamped Hotel de Cortes. By far the biggest problem is the hot water issue, which like other reviewers I experienced as well. Hot water was ample the day I took a shower at 9am, but nonexistent the day I showered around noon. This is simply unacceptable for even a basic hotel, let alone one with luxury aspirations. I would think this problem could be ameliorated simply by installing a much larger capacity hot water heater, but it is a critical issue in need of fixing. Other issues are more minor and also mostly fixable. I disagree with the previous reviewer that the hotel is particularly noisy, at least by DF standards; the Condesa, with its cacophonous interior courtyard, and the Habita, with its rowdy roof deck and thumping techno till 2am many nights, are far worse on that count. Yes, there is some noise eminating up the stairwell from the restaurant, but even as someone who's extremely noise-sensitive, I wasn't bothered by it, and I was in what is probably the loudest room, on the second floor (in US terms - first floor in European/Mexican jargon) right next to the stairs. I also didn't experience any problems with wi-fi, but that may be because I figured out -- on my own -- that each floor has its own wi-fi antenna; the \"Hippodrome\" wi-fi network didn't work in my room, but \"piso1\" (first floor) did. It would help if the managers clarified how to use the wi-fi networks with inbound guests ... which leads to my next minor complaint, the lack of an in-room guide to the hotel itself and area attractions. Rooms have generic Mexico City guides, in both English and Spanish, but nothing written by the hotel itself, explaining matters like Internet access, room cleaning, concierge services, airport transport, check-in/check-out times, available toiletries, room service (there was no menu in the room either, although an in-room sign includes a number to call room service, so it's presumably available), phone charges for local and international calls, dry cleaning/laundry availability, TV channel guide, nearby sites in the general Condesa neighborhood, recommended restaurants & bars outside the hotel, etc. The best independently owned boutique hotels have all of this, and the Hippodrome needs them as well. Also, the Red Bull-branded minibar was inexplicably empty; the room came equipped with only one small bottle of water (pretty skimpy given that it was a double room, and Mexican water supplies are notoriously turista-inducing for foreigners); neither of the two shampoo/soap containers in the bathrooms were marked; the bathroom had ventilation issues; the entry doors are not self-locking (I actually left my door unintentionally unlocked the first night); there are no reading lights, and the fluorescents used in most fixtures are harsh; and the hotel's cleaning staff uses some seriously overpungent cleaning supplies. Fixes to these problems are easy: stock the minibars at least with extra free bottles of water; switch to labeled small toiletries, e.g. Kiehl's; replace the locks preferably with keycards, or at least simple self-locking bolted doors if keycard locks are cost-prohibitive; install some Artemide Tolomeo (or similar) reading lights on the back walls behind the bed; switch to odor-free (or at least low-odor) cleaning supplies; and have a decent graphic designer create in-room guides with high-quality, durable card stock and binding. It might also be a good idea to install a door between the small lobby area and restaurant -- and keep it closed during the evening -- to mitigate noise issues. Again, all these are minor quibbles, and ones I will happily put up with for a $17.50/night rate -- even cold-water showers are acceptable at that price point. Ten times that amount is another story, however, and particularly in a city with such entrenched and trendy competition -- never mind the new Hotel de Cortes, which blows every DF hotel out of the water design-wise and room size-wise (unlike the Hippodrome, Condesa DF and Habita, its rooms are nothing short of huge) -- the Hippodrome needs to step it up a notch. I'm giving the hotel four stars, an average between the five stars I'd give it as a $17.50/night hotel and three as a $175/night one. I'd give it four at the $175 level if the hot water issue was fixed, but that's a major problem -- one mentioned on here six months ago, and I overheard the owner discussing TripAdvisor, so I know he's seen the comments here about it -- that prevents me from rating it higher.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY NY", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievably noisy\u201d", "Author": "sebage", "ReviewID": "UR25195761", "Content": "Typical boutique hotel.
