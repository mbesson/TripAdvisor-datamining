{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Reasonable price for walking distance to central Florence but not too clean Booked through hotel reservations desk at train station in Florence, a few days in advance of arrival at hotel. The welcome at the hotel was decent enough and I was able to park my car in hotel's small off-street parking area but only after making something of an issue of the fact that the reservations desk had indicated that it was usually possible to get a parking space. The room I was shown was okay but I asked for, was offered and accepted, a room further from the main road (the hotel is situated at the junction of a street leading off the heavily-used thoroughfare into central Florence which runs along on the left bank of the Arno river). The room was rather dingy, seemed not to have been painted for years and was very, very dusty on top of the wardrobe and under the bed, but the bathroom was cleaned satisfactorily daily. Noise from the lobby and stairs was an occasional problem when guests were passing. At around 20 minutes' (brisk) walk to the centre of Florence, for 55 euros a night for single occupancy of a double room, and with off-street parking and (a basic) breakfast included in the price, in July, I guess it was pretty much what I was expecting, but the standard of cleanliness of the room was not good enough for a two-star hotel.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR758211213", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SalientWitness"}, {"Content": "Well located little charmer This hotel is located a twenty minute walk across the Arno from the city centre, perfectly near while being far enough away from most of the throngs of tourists that invade the city. The hotel has its own car park which is an advantage than can not be overstated. Unfortunately during my stay the restuarant area was being renovated and no breakfast was available but a quality cafe is within just a few yards. The room was large, spartan and the furnishings dated but one couldn't help but be charmed, particularly by the ceiling fresco. The staff were courteous and this hotel would be my first choice when staying in Florence agian.", "Date": "Jan 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR916449373", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Hotel Ferrucci Torino   showReview(18076494, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR558594397", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "luke71"}, {"Content": "Avevo degli esami da sostenere...   showReview(17965474, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR541488106", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Nous sommes rest\u8305s 2 nuits...   showReview(12650589, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR815518967", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d296643-r8366412-Hotel_Ferrucci-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "296643", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
