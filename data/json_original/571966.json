The location is perfect, just a few meters from St Marco square, and a easy walk from the Water bus that we had to take from the airport. Stop at the Realto station and walk about 100 meters to the hotel. A bit tricky to find, but so are all the small hotels in Venice. When confirming the booking by e-mail before our trip, the owner send a map, with directions. The room was typical Venetian decor, and our room faced another building, but that was fine, because that meant we had no disturbance from the street below. The room was small, but very clean and neat. They serve a very small breakfast in bed (no space for a breakfast room), but we did not care much about breakfast anyway, since we bought cheap food and drinks at a nearby supermarket. We absolutely loved our stay in Venice, and the location of the hotel made this VERY easy. Do not expect much, but the city will make up for anything that you miss out on at the hotel. The owner helped us with our questions, and was friendly with us. I can recommend this hotel, if u want to stay close to St Marco square for cheap, and have a nice central spot in the city.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cConfortable hot spot in venice\u201d", "Author": "Marifarage", "ReviewID": "UR119103281", "Content": "A great bed and breakfast, in a splendorous location in venice. 50 meters from san marco square, and just 01 bridge to cross (keep this information).

Upon our arrival a woman met us at the tiny reception area...if you could call it that. She started to explain something to us in Italian and I dont speak any Italian and neither does my boyfriend so I had no idea what she was saying but she explained that the shower was broken and would not be fixed until the next day so we were being put in another hotel. We stayed at Hotel Noemi for one night which was just a few steps away. Way nicer hotel (wish we had stayed here) that actually seems like a hotel. We were told to move back into the room at Ca' del Duca the next morning. This was extremely aggravating because we had to pack up all our stuff again and move. The room at Ca' Del Duca was nice but not nearly as elegant as the pictures show. The room was very dark and the bathroom was tiny. Even after the shower had been fixed it still seemed to squirt water everywhere and all over the floor. The wifi was also extremely frustrating. Since there isnt really a front desk the people who work at the hotel are only there for about 4 hours in the morning and if you need anything after they have gone your out of luck. Late in the afternoon my boyfriend had work to do and we needed the wifi password. We resorted to going to the previous hotel down the street to ask for their password...the man wouldnt give it to us and suggested we just find the machine that prints the password and do it ourselves. We had to resort to climbing behind the front desk The front door was constantly open and is always unlocked. The only form of security was a small camera on the ceiling (and i'm pretty sure it was fake). It made me feel very unsafe. The breakfast was fine and was delivered to our room. However we were 5 minutes past the time breakfast ended one morning and the woman got very aggravated and said something in Italian. Also the 2nd night of our stay a group of people moved into the other rooms and they didnt seem to care that the rooms were no smoking. They not only smoked in the rooms with the doors open but also in the hallway. The woman from the hotel caught them in the morning but didnt really seem to care. All in all I would say if your looking for good location for 1 night in Venice and dont plan on spending a lot of time in the room this may be good for you but otherwise this hotel did not have good customer service.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hull", "Title": "\u201cIf you want good service dont stay here, want pretty room good location stay here\u201d", "Author": "wandererhull", "ReviewID": "UR90206424", "Content": "This hotel is in a fantastic location right on the doorsteps of saint marks square. the rooms are very nice with gold and cream decor throughout giving it a real venetian feel. bathrooms were very nice and air con worked. rooms have mini bar, sky tv, wifi, tables and chairs this is let down by the fact that if you dont arrive early you have to enter the hotel via the front door that is open 24 hours a day to a tiny reception with a key and your name attached, we could not use the wifi (one of the main reasons we booked) as there are no staff on at all until the next day. breakfast is served on a tray in your room which means that 2nd cup of coffee is not available. we were not allowed out of our room on departure as armed police were questioning the staff (1 maid who gave you breakfast and did all the rooms) when we did leave we got to the top of the street only to be frog marched down the street by armed police for whatever reason we do not know? all i can say is it did not ruin our experience of venice, i doubt anything could but the hotel lets its self down with the lack of staff for support and help should you be a first time visitor to venice and want information. if you are looking for a good location and nice rooms book this hote", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Boutique Hotel, Amazing Location\u201d", "Author": "SharonBJ32", "ReviewID": "UR29967518", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 day trip to Venice with my friends staying at Ca Del Duca Hotel. The Hotel was very well situated on a quiet little shopping street, with pizzeria's, Gelato Shops and lovely gift shops. It is only a 2 minute walk to San Marco or a 5 minute walk to Rialto Bridge. The best possilbe location to be in the middle of everything. The hotel itself is very small with only 5 rooms, however this adds to the charm. The rooms are clean and new. Aparently only renovated 5 years ago. Breakfast is delivered to your room every morning with propper Italian Cappuccinos and Lattes...no powdered rubbish. The hotel does not have any restaurants or any special facilities but it does not need them. The rooms are beautifully dressed and the location is the true selling point. The Staff were lovely, I think they actually owned the hotel. Very very nice people. We did not have to check into the sister hotel like other people, we were checked in very quickly on arrival at about 2pm. The price was actually extremely good. I had checked almost every hotel in the area and this was the cheapest by far. For the same price we would have had to stay on the outskirts of Venice away from all the action. We were all very happy with our Hotel choice!! Will definitely be returning in the near future.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "SHVRome", "ReviewID": "UR16187060", "Content": "Top location and not a bad price.

On arrival you must check in to the Hotel Noemi. The staff at both hotels are very helpful. I emailed the Ca' del Duca in advance to get directions on arrival and they emailed me straight back with detailed directions. I would advise anybody who is staying in Venice to do this as otherwise you'll never find it! The hotel itself is very small, just a few rooms at the top of a flight of stairs. Our room was tiny, just a bed, table, wardrobe and bathroom. It was clean and tidy and the bathroom looked as though it was quite new. For us the room was adequate - just a base to sleep and change. A continental breakfast was served in your room. If you are looking for just a room close to St. Mark's Square then this hotel is ideal. The attraction of this hotel is it's location. Having said that I wouldn't fault the hotel. It was just a little small.
