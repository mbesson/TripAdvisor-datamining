Or there is a supdnuts doughnuts near by (much tastier). also keep in mind they charge you an extra $13 a day to park in their garage. Another tip is be wary of the bar. A member of the party ended up with a $1000 bar tab because he was ordering \"doubles\" at a cost of $25 each. A normal mixed drink was $12 (and described as a tiny glass).

The good things: location seems to be excellent, with a mall right across the street, it makes getting around easy; there are a wide range of chain dining options, the staff is great and pleasant; and the workout and pool facility is a great plus. But overall, I have been disappointed when I stay here as it doesn't suit my needs and expectations. For my overnight experience, my rate was high - but I assume most comparable chain hotels are in the same ballpark. My biggest hangup was that because I was on a work trip, I needed access to the internet - I could not get the service to work on my laptop or iPad at all during my stay. Phone coverage was also poor to non-existent, although I would say I had some luck in my room, but for any place else on the property, getting access to a network was a bust. Attending a few meetings there, I could not get consistent coverage in the lobby, the conference rooms, or even outside in the pool area. Others in my meeting could also get no coverage through Verizon or AT&T. Once in a while, it seemed like you'd get a burst of access and you're email would download to the phone, or you'd get a text message, but when you went to reply or call someone, there would be no service. There was one sweet spot in the lobby where I was finally able to get access for about 30 minutes, but having had to be there for almost 24 hours, I was woefully behind in email and returning phone calls that I had to make up for it later the next evening. I can't say that the access issues is the hotel or the phone carrier, but it just seemed like there was a spell cast over the hotel to prevent access to the outside world.

She barely took notice, dismissed this request, and told me that I had room only. When I asked that we contact priceline about the discrepancy, she stated that there was nothing she could do unless I could \"prove it\" and simply kept typing. It took a few moments to pull the info from my iphone, however, a few minutes later, I was able to pull up the priceline page with the inclusions. When I returned to the front desk, the representative stated that these were not communicated with them, and that they could only provide room and tax at this rate. The lady also shared with me that there had been another similiar recent problem with a priceline reservation at the hotel, but they couldn't help the other party either. I asked for the manager. After several moments, the front desk manager, Anthony Elsisi comes out. He tells me that my rate did not include any extras (room only). He said that in order to give me anything, he would require proof in writing. He was not willing to even look at the webpage, pulled up on my telephone, as he stated that I could have \"pulled that from anywhere\". I told him that this was the only method I had with which to \"prove it\". I even shared with him that I didn't really need internet (I have mobile) or free breakfast (I would likely sleep through it), but I wished he could at least cover the parking. Basically, I was asking for a $13 per night ($26 total) comp--something I would have thought fairly minimal. I shared with him that by this point, it was about principle, and I felt as though it was the very least that they could do based upon my reservation. Mr. Elsisi became irritated, then he responded to me that his time was very valuable and he would not speak further with me or help me with this issue. I have to say, this is not about $26. It is fully about being demeaned and berated, called a liar by the front desk manager, Mr. Anthony Elsisi. The funny thing was that the lady said I was not the first person with this issue, I reiterated to them that when multiple people complain about the same issue, they should probably take notice and do something about it. What I find now, after reading through the tripadvisor reviews, is that the real problem is not with priceline reservations, it is truly about a management staff who is not willing to properly care for its customers. Sad, but in this day and age, we have far too many choices to be stuck with such poor customer service. And when I see the managers response to the reviews, I see a bunch of excuses, but I have yet to see any offers of resolution--there's always a reason that they \"can't do anything about it\". Well, if that's how I handled my customer complaints, I wouldn't have many customers. I'll give you one more funny part. After I was incensed by the front desk staff, I searched and found street parking (being of principle, I was not going to pay them). For the next 2 days, I also refused to patronize the bar, gift shop, restaurant, store, or starbucks in the hotel. This would have cost them much more in profit than the $26 for parking. And when I checked out, you'll never guess, but they had placed the parking charge on my bill despite the fact that I clearly shared with them I would not be parking in the garage. Fortunately, someone there removed the charge. And, I did ask for a zero balance receipt just in the case that Mr. Elsisi needs me to \"prove it\". Properly handled, this issue may have cost the hotel $26 cash. Instead, because of the way staff handled this, it has cost Marriott a customer.

The food was reasonably priced for hotel fare ($11-16 on avg). There's a heated indoor pool & spa near the gym, and a sauna in the locker rooms. Self Parking was $14.30 w/ tax...and you can com/go as you please. I would rate this hotel between a deluxe to moderate category. I'd recommend this hotel to friends and family.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cJust a bad experience with Mgmt Staff\u201d", "Author": "Samwise001", "ReviewID": "UR118901606", "Content": "Stayed 1 night back in April on a Sat night Good - rooms fine, standard typical Marriott.

I normally stay at Hilton properties for business travel, but I had enough Marriott Rewards points to burn up to stay here for free (other than the $19 per day for valet parking). I'm sorry that I made this call. First of all, I have a hard time believing the $200+ a night that this hotel charges. There's nothing to justify such a high price. The indoor pool was closed, as were the workout facilities. Although this was obviously a planned renovation, nothing was communicated to convention attendees. If I had known of the renovations, I would have stayed elsewhere. Secondly, the hotel provided a shuttle service to the convention at Cal State-Northridge, which was about 20 minutes away. They had a schedule printed and distributed to convention guests. This shuttle was horribly unreliable. Frequently, it did not show up at all, and when it did, it was either late (by as much as 90 minutes) and/or replaced by a nine-person van-not at all suitable for the 1,600 attendees of the conference. My wife and I were stranded for over an hour not once but twice. When I called the hotel to complain, the manager on duty apologized and promised to call me back. To his credit, he did call back, but it was twenty minutes later and after the shuttle had (finally) arrived. When I asked what compensation would be made to make up for the habitual tardiness, he said that the shuttle was being provided as a \"courtesy,\" but he would ask the GM to contact me. The GM never did. As a result, we ended up driving our rental car to the conference and paying for parking every day for the remainder of the conference. Third, when I asked for more towels one evening, I had an extremely grumpy man deliver them to my door. When I said, \"Thank you,\" he simply turned around and walked away. Even more frustrating was the fact that I could see the nearby Hilton hotel out of my window, almost mocking me for staying there. On a positive note, the valet parking service was the best I've seen in a long time. Also, one of the vendors held a reception in the patio area, and it was quite nice.

On most occasions I hadn't had time to switch the engine off by the time a figuare was at my door. ! HINT: Self Parking is a doddle by the way, just in a multi-storey next door. They DO charge for parking but hey...who doesn't in LA ? The rooms are extremely roomy and clean but if you like to sleep with the sliding doors open like we do for fresh air, pick your room carefully. Initially we were facing the front where we got hit by quite a bit of road noise. They helpfully moved us to the back but were then hit by \"air conditioner\" noises but not to the point where it disturbed our sleep. With the doors slid shut you couldn't hear a dicky bird...nothing where-ever you were situated. The pool area was great, especially at night, very relaxing. Woodland Hills, to us, appeared to be an extremely safe place to be, with a large park and Mall near by. Denny's is a short walk away also for a \"cheaper\" breakfast. My STRONGEST recommendation though, when travelling in towards Universal Studios, Hollywood and LA proper is DON'T use the freeways between 7am and 10am or say 3pm to 7pm. they are a nightmare. Ventura Blvd travels paralell to Ventura Freeway, just South of the Marriott and although it took about 45 mins to get to Universal, between several million stop lights, it was well worth it over getting stuck in traffic for hours on the freeway....plus ALL sorts of life is seen on the Blvd...makes for an interest drive ?? The ONLY negative as far as we were concerned is why a large Hotel chain, of this quality, have the gall to charge for Internet access. In fairness the \"Business Centre\" isn't actually run by the Marriott, they just supply the room for a 3rd party to set up and charge guests but for our familly we were extremely disappointed, not least that the 3rd party charge so much ie: 15 mins was about $5.00 PLUS the connection was often quite slow.

I usually gauge hotel stays based on full-service Marriotts, because they are very middle of the road for the business traveler. The Woodland Hills Marriott is just slightly better than average. The rooms match to Marriott standards exactly, right down to the wooden nightstands, the L-shaped desk and famous Marriott green desk chair. Most rooms will also have a comfortable easy chair and armoire with TV. All rooms meet the new Marriott bedding standard as well as down pillows and down comforter. It put it on par with your average Westin bed and I can say that I never had any problems sleeping and always found it comfortable. Bathrooms again are average with granite countertops and a single sink. I never had an oversized tubs - all appeared to be standard sized. For the most part all room amenities are up to date. There are larger rooms and suites on the 17th floor. May be worth asking for a 17th floor room when you check in. Room service at this Marriott was very good. Most orders were delivered within 30 minutes and they took good care to make sure that the order was filled out correctly. I did wish that the menu had a greater variety of appetizers, otherwise it's what you'd expect from a full service hotel - there should be something on there for everyone and they did have a small kids menu. The hotel does have a self-serve laundry facility onsite in the form of 2 washers and dryers - bring lots of quarters or you can get them from the front desk. They do have full laundry service that was, of course, priced high but within the range that you would expect from hotel laundry. As far as the staff goes, I only interacted with the bell, front desk and room service and they were all very friendly and competent. The lobby area of the hotel is nice and up to date including the bar. Most evenings it was full without being overcrowded or obnoxious. Despite all my nights there, I never did partake of the restaurant. One nice feature is the Starbucks in the lobby - it's a full service and is a popular stop for the business crowd on weekday mornings. There is an executive / concierge lounge on the 12th floor which can also be accessed from the 14th. This lounge was above average as Marriott's go. Good space and a good spread. Breakfast had the standard fruit, pastries / breads and cereal fare that you find at all lounges, but also had hot trays of eggs, bacon and sausages. In the evenings there was a hot appetizer early along with crackers and cheese as well as cookies later in the evening. Sodas are free and there was a stocked cash bar. Getting lounge access was pretty difficult and it was obvious that the front desk staff was trained to be pretty strong about limiting access. Even after my 4th week in a row I couldn't get in. Finally, I was checked in by the assistant manager one evening who helped me with the remainder of my stays until I hit Gold status in the Marriott Rewards program. Across the street is the mall (what else would you expect for the Valley?) There is an AMC movie theater and a couple of chain restaurants (P.F. Chang's and the type.) It's all within walking distance, so that's nice. So overall, an adequate Marriott for the business traveler. I had no major problems during my stays, but also never had them go the extra mile to do anything particularly special. In other words another middle-of-the-road Marriott from the chain that owns \"middle-of-the-road\". There is a Hilton right down the street that I had heard good things about too, so you might want to give that a look, otherwise those are going to be your two best choices in the area.", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paco de Arcos, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cI was very pleased with this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "astro50", "ReviewID": "UR4972785", "Content": "In my recent trip to California I stayed at the Marriott Warner Center for 2 nights at the beginning of my trip and 4 nights at the end and I only have good things to stay about it.
