I saw this hotel from internet and saw some reviews at trip advisor. Before I made the payment through book online, I asked the staff at Sagrada Familia for several questions, and they respond was fast, since I lived at Singapore, there was a time difference with Barcelona, but to my surprise their respond was quite fast. The fastest was around 30 minutes reply. And they always polite to answer my endless questions. They also had a company partner to made shuttle bus upon arrival & I took the shuttle bus as well. Before I came there the management sent me email to welcome me. And while I was there, the staff were polite. I had problem with the direction that the female staff gave me (couldn't remember her name), I think she gave me wrong direction but it was OK since I found the place by myself. The room was a bit small and dark, but to my surprise the bath room was spacious. I love the shower ! At my first night, I still could hear sound from outside my room. And I didn't feel comfortable with the door. Because usually when we closed & lock our door from inside, usually the door will locked, but I still could open my door directly. It was like the locked was spoiled. According to the staff, nobody could open the door from outside unless it was staff hotel & cleaner (who had the other card to access my room). Since I'm traveling alone, I don't feel really comfortable with the door. But for 55 euro this hotel was awesome ! They also cleaned the room everyday. And also near to La Sagrada Familia, only 7 minutes walking distance. The rooftop according to the staff during winter time only open until 6 pm. Since most of my stay, I walked around Barcelona, so I only had a chance to see the rooftop on my last day. And it was nice.

Having had a nightmare journey (not because of the hotel, of course) we arrived at 11pm. At this point the receptionist informed us that there was a problem with our room booking and that we'd have to move five minutes in a cab to another hotel. As our son was screaming, I couldn't quite believe their ineptness as despite having a booking receipt in my hand, there was no booking! Eventually we swapped with friends. The room was a decent size, as was the bathroom. A/C worked well (despite leaking extensively during the first night causing a slippery surface on the laminate flooring). Additionally friends who stayed in the room next to us had to call up the receptionist at 2am due to an unknown 'buzzing' noise in their room, which went undiagnosed and they had to move rooms the next day! Beds were uncomfortable and although this was a double bedroom, the beds were two singles with single sheets, covers etc. The one provided pillow was too thin to be of any use. Breakfast was \u20ac11 per person and acceptable. Not extensive but the staff were very helpful, sterilising baby bottles and providing hot water. Breakfast was from 8am which was quite late in my opinion but did last until 10.30. There are plenty of cafe's/supermarkets nearby so there is plenty of choice when needing an alternative to breakfast or dinner.

We booked it as a package via Lastminute,com and it was by far a cheaper package than the others we looked at. We paid \u00a3170 each for the hotel and flights and airport parking. We hopped in a taxi at the airport to the hotel and it cost 28 euros and took about 15/20 minutes. The hotel is 2 blocks away from La Sagrada Familia, where this is a metro (underground subway). I was worried that the hotel may be a little far out from the tourist attractions, but it was fine. We walked to nearly all the places we visited (La Rambla, Parc Guell, Port Vell, La Riberia etc). It was a long walk - may be 40 minutes to La Rambla, but it felt very safe and with our map it was very straight forward. The only time we used the metro was to get to Montjuic and to get back to the airport. Each single journey only costs 1.70 euros, no matter how many changes you make. (The airport run costs 3 euros extra as you also have to get the train aka Renfe). The hotel itself, is very clean and quiet. We didn't see many other guests. The maid cleaned our room every single day, except one (but I think that was because we laid in too long!). The only noise we did hear was furniture moving/doors banging in the morning, but it wasn't too much of a nuisance, The receptionists aren't overly friendly/chatty, but that may be a language thing. Any time we asked anything they were helpful and kindly booked us a taxi one evening. We also emailed them before our stay to ask about having one of the rooms with the fridge and they replied straight away and sorted it, which was really good. There wasn't a tea/coffee making facilities in the room, The rooms are a lot more spacious than I thought they'd be. We had room 309 which had a double bed (not the most comfortable, but it was okay), a mini fridge which was really handy. We took out the overpriced drinks in there, and filled it with our stuff from the supermarket (go to Carrefour Express - it's like a Tesco Express - and is just before the Sagrada Familia). The drinks in the fridge were priced two euros each, but the same one in the supermarket costs 0.5euros! The bathroom was probably the best part - the shower was super hot and really powerful. It also had a bath with bath lights. Spacious in there. Two big mirrors in the room. It also had a hairdrier and shampoo/showergel which was restocked everyday. The breakfast would have costs 7 euros extra each day for a basic continental, so we didn't bother. We bought pastries/fruit from the many bakeries for 2 euros! There is also a little bakery/shop a few doors along that sells gorgeous baklava - well worth a visit. The free wifi didn't seem to work during any part of our visit. There was computers in the lobby that charged 1 euro for 5 mins or something like that. There is a main street two blocks down that has lots of cafes/restaurants - bear in mind though that most independent stuff shuts between 2 - 5pm, and most Barcelona people eat at about 9pm! We ate earlier some days though and it wasn't a problem. It was more pricier on those streets as its near the tourist attraction - the area La Riberia is cheaper and nicer.

We arrived to the hotel on Wed 24th - we were put on the seventh floor facing the back in room 704 - we went into the room and closed the door - the handle came off in our hands. We phoned the receptionist, Marco and explained the situation - he didn't seem very interested in coming to help us and said he would 'try' to phone the maintenance man. We eventually got ourselves out of the room. Then he put us on the third floor in room 311. The air conditioning unit started leaking (it's located just outside the bathroom) into our suitcase - saturating our clothes - while we were sleeping. We were understandably angry so we rang the receptionist (this time Tania) and she said 'this was normal' - I love her explanations. I tried to explain to her having a huge pool of water in the middle of your room (a tiny room at that) is not 'normal'. So then we were moved to room 204. Here the toilet cistern kept flooding so everytime you went to use the toilet your trouser legs ended up saturated. We were so sick of changing rooms and wasting so much time (we kept being told we would just have to pack our bags and leave our bags in the reception which was not ideal) - every day we were wasting about 1-2 hours changing rooms. Complete nightmare. The breakfast was also very very basic (baked beans, cold tortilla, cheap yoghurts) the one highlight of the breakfast was the melon (very fresh). The biggest problem though for me was the wifi or rather the lack of it (they gave various excuses such as someone used a MAC and the wifi stopped working, Steve Jobs would be happy, so the only solution was to sit in the lobby everytime I needed the internet which was highly frustrating), we were warned after checking-in by Marco that the internet would not be working at all from Thursday 12pm to Friday 12pm so in other words for an entire 24 hour period. This turned into a comedy, I asked his colleague Tania to direct me to the closest wifi cafe - she sent me out three times to three different cafes, it turned out the one she was trying to send me to actually was an internet cafe but CLOSED TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY, so I asked Tania (extremely unhelpful person) how long she had been working in the hotel for - we chose the hotel based on it's location (it was extremely expensive we paid 125Euros for what we thought was a double room for two people - when we got there Marco charged us a 25 Euro supplement as we'd apparently booked a double room for one person - so a complete and total rip off for this price) - they also try to OVERSELL you tickets - their 'reduced price' ticket for the Barcelona Bus Tour cost me 25 Euros (on the bus it cost 23 Euros). In short, I've stayed in a lot of hotels (I'm currently writing this review from a very nice Holiday Inn in Frankfurt) in my business life but this is undoubtedly the worst - PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR and even if it's the last hotel available in Barcelona - DO NOT TAKE IT, STAY WELL AWAY - these people think that the BBC comedy programme Fawlty Towers - is a business plan that they should try to aspire to.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and Value!\u201d", "Author": "Nicky4477", "ReviewID": "UR116565759", "Content": "My family stayed at the this hotel in early June.

If you do not have breakfast included, I recommend La Boulangerie bakery on the next corner: perfect croissants and sandwiches, good coffee and service. However, if you plan to focus on beaches, it is not the best option (too far). Rooms: According to fire escape plan, rooms are very different. Mine had very small and dark living room (with very very small window to inner yard) but enormous bathroom. I think that the staff should not select this room for 10-night stay but I was traveling alone and decided not to complain. Also, as it was in corner of the floor, wi-fi coverage was awful. However, rooms with window to the street are large and nice. Room design is modern but cheapish (in line with room price). Generally hotel design is nice. Maintenance: Rooms are done every day and cleanliness standards are very high for this price range. However, some walls are dirty and need fresh paint and two light bulbs were not working on arrival. Service: Reception staff does not look friendly and client-focused, however all problems were solved easily. They do not bother about small details, e.g. you need sweater at +30 outside to use free internet terminal (there are two) as air conditioning is directed exactly on users' backs.

And if there was no one at the front desk at the time I was SOL. The location was great. The Sagrada Familia Church is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There's also a metro stop about the same distance. Internet access fairly limited as there is only one computer accesible to all the hotel guests, so I'd find myself waiting for the computer when ever I needed its use. The breakfast buffet was decent, although at one point the front desk told me that I couldnt take the food from the breakfast area up to my room.

He did not greet us, tell us what room we were in or how to find it. Thankfully, we never encountered him again and the other receptionists were much more helpful b) Although the room was a good size, clean yet basic it was a connecting room. The rooms had wooden floor boards so we could hear people in the next room walking around and talking...every word! We hardly slept our entire stay because of the noisy couple next door. Need I say more! c) The location of the hotel, although obviously close to the Sagrada Familia, is quite far from the main hub of the city.

We got a free breakfast and were moved to a much more pleasant room for the remaining three nights where aircon was not needed at all because the windows opened to outside.

Our first night was in a twin room, then we got a double. There is no way I could get my standard size laptop into the safe (as stated on the hotel's website), apart from the screen it does not fold up any more! The breakfast, at 11 Euros seems expensive, but is good value if you are hungry because you can eat as much as you want. There are no tea and coffee making facilities available apart from in the air-conditioned dining room at breakfast time, so pack a travel kettle.

The hotel itself is clean and modern and the check in area is very smart. I started off in room 504 but when I went in, only 1 light actually had a bulb in and the room door wouldn't lock. I went straight back down to the reception and a very helpful man grabbed some light bulbs and a wrench and followed me up to see what we could do. After fixing the lights, he realised that he wasn't going to be able to fix the lock but did point out that no-one could really enter without a keycard. However, I did want a room that locked from the inside so he helped me move my cases up to room 708.

For lunch or dinner (since they light up the church at night) its just great to seat at one of the tables of the avenida gaudi restaurant terraces, and then after a couple of glasses of wine, head towards el Barrio de Gracia to find the nontouristy bars or just go back to your room, because it is all walking distance and if going far, the metro is right there as well.
