Read this!\u201d", "Author": "Tamara C", "ReviewID": "UR123696890", "Content": "This is a 2 star hotel. That should be enough said right there... But even with 2 stars you would expect some basic necessities which this hotel did not fulfill. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week in January, and were VERY surprised with all the good reviews it got on Trip Advisor. We chose this hotel based on 1) TA reviews, 2) proximity to Termini station and 3) Budget. Trip Advisor let us down big time for the first time! Hotel Teti is located on the 2nd floor of an old building. This building houses a few hotels like Hotel Milo, Teti, and a few more.... Now, the good, the bad and the ugly: I'll start with the UGLY: The beds were HARD AS ROCK! Even my husband who likes firmer mattresses agrees that we would be more comfortable sleeping on the rocks of the Colosseum! I only slept well for 2 nights out of 7 because I ended up taking a sleeping pill, and was coma-toast! So if having a good bed, and in Rome you do need a good bed as you will be exhausted after a day of walking, is something that should be a necessity!!! The BAD: I guess that the rooms were clean because everything (EVERYTHING!) smelled like bleach! Sheets, curtains, towels, bleach, bleach, bleach... I don't understand what food people who write reviews on TA are used to (if any), but the breakfast could NOT be any worse... Here are your choices: corn flakes, white bread buns, butter, honey, jams, sweet croissants and danishes... I'm sure you're thinking \"yum! this chick is nut!\" but try eating sweets for breakfast for a week! You get a sugar crash by 11! And every day, same thing. The rooms were tiny, but that doesn't really matter, what's worse is that the bathroom is so tiny you might miss it! Shower is 2.5'x2.5', you couldn't turn around without your butt touching some wall.... The water pressure was very very poor... the door to the bathroom can't open all the way because the bed is in the way... and of course it smelled like bleach. This Hotel has an elevator but it rarely works and it starts on the 1st floor (not from the main floor). Internet connection kept failing, so we kept going to reception sometimes 5 times in one night asking them to reset their modem. The Good (or only OK): Staff was OK - there were some good ones and the ones that exhibited the behavior \"I can't wait to get the hell out of here\"... Location is perfect: esthetically and safety speaking: it's one of the worst areas of Rome being right beside the train/bus/central metro station; you will see homeless people everywhere, drunks, hookers (yes!!!) and transvestite hookers (YESSS!!!!) everywhere, but on every corner there is police, so it's relatively ok. But being right by Termini station (not even 5 minutes walk!) which is a central metro station in Rome, you can by metro get anywhere in Rome in about 15 mins... My husband and I are walkers so we walked a lot. You have 15 minutes walk to Colosseum, about 20 min walk to Trevi Fountain, about 30 mins to Spanish steps and the main shopping street.... Vatican by metro is about 10 minutes ride. Once we even walked back from the Vatican (about 8 km.) Keep in mind that everything in rome is relatively walk-able... and if you take Metro too much you will miss all the charms this city has to offer!

The inner walls are a bit thinner, so I could hear people in the neighboring room talking during the night. There is a wireless internet (included in the price) available in this hotel. I took breakfast there, which was the basic one: sweet croissants, cereals, packaged cookies, jams, fruit yoghurts, coffee and juices from a machine.

Inside the wardrobe was a safe-box - no extra charge. (No hair-dryer.) The breakfast was okay - but I didn't enjoy the drinks from the self-service machine. We were two mature ladies visiting Rome for the first time and found the location of this hotel ideal for us, near to the Termini station. On arrival didn't like having to carry suitcases up 13 marble steps in order to reach the lift.
