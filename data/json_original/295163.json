Couple The Hotel is located at Taksim square, which means that you are 15 minutes (by tram) from most of \"worth to see\" monuments.

The service in the reception was depended on the person that was in charge. Some of them were helpful, some of them not. The breakfast is quite ok and the breakfast hall has a nice view, since it is located on the Top of the hotel.

The hotel is decorated in a modern yet retro fashion. Although the rooms are small, the hotel is very clean.....extremely important factor when choosing a place to stay. The breakfast room was also clean and organized and nicely deocrated. The breakfast itself was the same every day, but enough there to satisfy most appetites. Overall, if you don't plan to spend much time in the hotel and require many facilities, this hotel is a perfect stop to rest peacefully at night and feel safe and clean.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cOK place, I guess\u201d", "Author": "MajorVoid", "ReviewID": "UR5899279", "Content": "Well, it's a basic tourist hotel in a basic tourist area.
