The rooms were clean and spacious. My only gripe is the fact that unless you appear to be spanish the staff seem oblivious to your existence! We waited patiently at reception for help and were continually ignored, i felt insulted and angry. This was'nt limited to the reception. The bar man bothered to get from his stool after several minutes wait, and eventually served us. He was arrogant and smug, why i do not know as he it seems he has another 30 odd years left of serving tourists in a fly infested bar. Overall....perfectly normal hotel run by ignorant oafs.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cAcceptable hotel close to airport at a decent price\u201d", "Author": "PracticedTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR20546030", "Content": "Drove into Madrid at 6PM needing a hotel for our flight out the next day and saw the hotel.

Its airport shuttle is prompt, and the ride is short. The only problem is that you have to call from the airport. They are happy to supply the phone number and kind about travelers' confusions. Indeed the staff is generally very helpful and well-informed, a good source of advice. Bar restaurant offers appetizing food (great fish, for example) at very good prices and is crowded in the evenings, but service is limited outside Spanish meal times. Free internet is available in the lobby and works fine, though there is sometimes a short wait. The rooms are pleasant and clean; everything works; and the amenities are nicer than average. Hotel design is pleasant, wings off a large central atrium, though I didn't particularly care for the decor. If quiet is important, ask for a room on the third floor.

Worst shuttle service ever, really unfriendly staff (with the exception of the restaurant waiters), bad rooms (poor mattress, very loud A.C, very poor TV channels reception in our room). we stopped there for one night coming from Sevilla and before heading back to New York the next day. What a change from the hotels we stayed at upon arriving in Madrid 2 weeks earlier!!!!!! Avoid to make the same mistake as we did. This place is a shame.
