Immediatley, we were surprised by the fact it was a hostel, not a hotel as advertised. Regardless, we went in and had our evening emal straight away. The food was decent, although hardly up to restaurant standard. We then progressed to our rooms. We were shocked by the dirtiness of it. On the floor there were black spots on the floor and I was appauled to see a big muddy footprint by my bed. I was anxious to see the beds. It was covered in hairs. This continued throughout the week and it was as if, the cleaners were moulting on my bed. It is extraordinary to see how dirty the beds could get simply by making them each day. My roommate found a fingernail in his! The walls were extremly thin, and during the night, you could hear the noise outisde so clearly, it seemed like there was no wall or window at all. The rooms were extremly small and there was hardly enough space to move about. The bathroom was extremely tiny as well. The leak in the toilet had been 'fixed' by sealing it with masking tape and the toilet seak was covered in urine stains. The shower was not fixed to the wall and went out of control if it was used at any power at all. The tiny sink did not even have a plug. The whole room was covered in scratchings of writings and the pictures on the walls had been grafittied. The plugs did not work very well and the balconies were almost non-existent. Although the evening meal was not that bad, what the hostel served as the morning meal was the worst attempt at breakfast I have ever seen. It was a tiny stale bread roll with a miniscule muffin and a cold cup of hot chocolate. Take extra money to buy food in the morning becuase the breakfast was truly revolting. The service at the hotel was very minimal and quite lazy although the staff at the reception and the hotel weren't unpleasant. Despite the many negatives, the location and price is very good. It is situated in central madrdid and is very close to many monuments. There are plenty of shops nearby including the 'Corte Ingles' and the bus stop and metro station are very close. Overall, the worst accomadation I have ever stayed at but the location is excellent.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, basic and clean\u201d", "Author": "jacko657", "ReviewID": "UR36475676", "Content": "The hostel is in a great location, just a few minutes walk from bars, restaurants, shops and nightclubs. The nearest Metro station is just two minutes away and is the Sol Station stop. I arrived at the hostel with a group of friends and I found the reception staff to be quite rude and unhelpful. The rooms are small and clean, there is no air conditioning but our room had quite a big window. We were on the 4th floor and I didn't find that noise was a problem. The bed was comfortable and even though we were only there for two nights our bed sheets were changed and the room cleaned. The bathroom was very clean , a small shower but it was powerful and had a good supply of hot water. When we left the man on reception was very helpful with some questions I had for him about directions so I think it depends who you get on the desk as to how you get treated. I would recommend the hostel to anyone on a budget just looking for a bed for the night and then going straight out in the daytime.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxfordshire", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location!!, tho noisy & really bad beds!!!\u201d", "Author": "Replayette", "ReviewID": "UR29066072", "Content": "After reading reviews of this hostal, I was really worried that it was goin to be awful!!... The location could not have been any better, in fact we discovered that the best places to eat and drink we're right on this street. Room sizes are ok, our room had a separate bed/bathroom area, which was ok. Usual small bathrooms, shower was nice and powerful, water goes all over floor tho!! But the maid came every day, and left fresh towels and cleaned/made beds (changed twice in week), which we were not necessarily expecting. Beds.... OMG- Very uncomfortable, very 'springy' - I sleep on my side and I felt 'bruised' every day!!! Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast - well, yes, leaves a lot to be desired!! we only had 2-3 times as bread not enough for me! and cold coffee not good. Noise - take yer earplugs!!!! we were on 3rd floor facing street, yes - it's very noisy, can't have windows open, but wasnt too hot for us. Weekends are just mad!!! - 6am till noise stopped for about half hour, then it all started again!!! All said - it was ok... location outweighed the negatives!!!, and it could have been a lot worse!!!!", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT GO\u201d", "Author": "steph-2007", "ReviewID": "UR8666138", "Content": "Iif you like back street dirty grottos with rude service then this is the place for you! if you want to eat like a dog this is the place for you or if you like minimalistic rooms the size of my yorkies dog kennel when you ask for a double and get three single beds then come here!", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cDo not pay to eat here!\u201d", "Author": "Vivien91", "ReviewID": "UR7752516", "Content": "In April this year after over a year of planning friends, teachers and myself set off to Madrid for a school trip. The group included pupils of ages 14-18 and also teachers. After a veyr long and tiring bus journey from Fife, Scotland down to Liverpool and then a flight to Madrid we were desperate to reach our hotel. We all had low expectations for the hotel/hostal (not sure which) after reading all the comments available on here. However we were still slightly shocked and disappointed once we arrived. We knew that we werent going to get a luxurious hotel as not many would put up with a party of over 30 teenagers! The exterior of the place said it all! The bright yellow tacky paint work (however did make the place easy to recognise and find), the small prison cell like windows and the very distinctive two stars! As we entered the reception area we werew greeted by a strong smell of sewage! The hotel were not organised so we had to sit on top of each other and our luggage in the loby area for quite a long time. Eventually rooms were sorted out. I was sharing with two of my friends. The rooms were basic! There was veyr little space after three single beds were in, however we moved them around to make it more comfortable. The beds were hard and the springs were visible and easily felt! The windows were disgusting! I am a 15 year old girl and even I just wanted to get on and clean them! However there wasnt much of a view to see anyway (a grubby white wall and other rooms windows!)! The bathroom was also basic but clean. There were very few sufaces available for toilettries etc but we managed. On the other hand the shower was quite powerful and there was always enough hotwater for us all to have a shower. We seemed to have managed to have gotten one of the best rooms. Other firends' room stank of sewage throughout our stay! Everytime their door was opened the corrider stank! Noise travelled between rooms and along the corridors very easily. Other members of the groups had room out onto the street which were very noisey during the nights at the weekend. After our long jourey we were lookign forward to a big yummy evening meal but no such luck! We were served cold rice, then some sort of fried meat (we never managed to work out what it actually was!) ren either a piece of fruit (mushy apples etc) or a youghurt. We were so miserable! Evening our native Spanish teacher was appaulled! The food always arrived cold and in a puddle of moisture on your plate. And to say the waiters were in polite is an understatement, a smile really wouldnt have gone a miss! The fact that we were eating here every evening put a slight dampner on the trip however we just stocked up during the day! Breakfast was an extremely hard roll (left over from the night before we thought), a bought-in cake (the best part!) and a cup of hot chocolate (sometimes it was cold however). It seems from what I have said that the trip was a disaster but I loved it! I think that the hotel/hostal would have been perfectly adequate if we did not have to eat there every evening. If we had had the choice we would have eaten out evry night but our trip was arranged through a specialist group travel company so we didnt have a choice. Most importantly for us I suppose was the excellent location! Perfect for sightseeing! Overall I would say if your after a low budget place to stay this place wwill be fine but just dont eat here!", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiwi in London", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!!\u201d", "Author": "kiwikiwikiwi", "ReviewID": "UR7414352", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed in this hostel ( not hotel as advertised on the website we booked through) for 3 nights. We were given a twin room, despite the fact we had specifically requested a double when we booked 3 months previously. When we asked to be changed they said it was not possible. The single beds we had were very short and our feet hung off the end ( I am only 164 cm tall), and were very hard and you could feel the springs poking into you. The breakfasts were terrible- a hot drink with one very old hard bread roll, and a small packaged cake (definatly the highlight of the breakfast! ). The worst part of all however was the noise! The street outside has a very busy bar/ restaurant that seems to stays open until around 6:30am and it is absolutely impossible to sleep as there is constant shouting/ singing/ screaming etc from people outside. After the first night I got some earplugs which helped a bit but it was still extremely loud and hard to sleep. Also while we were there there were 2 different large groups of teenagers staying with seemingly no supervision who ran around shouting and slamming doors each night. Also dont think you can sleep in to make up for no sleep all night- some of the rooms are being renovated and the hammering/ drilling etc starts up before 8am, even on saturday morning. Also if you want to watch tv, you need to pay 5 euro deposit to get a remote to turn it on.( we didnt bother) On the plus side, the location is excellent- we were able to walk to all the sights we wanted to see ( although we were so exhausted from the lack of sleep we didnt really enjoy sightseeing as much as we should have) There is also a metro station located about 5 mins walk away with easy access to the airport. Also the rooms are reasonably clean and serviced daily, and soap and towels are provided. I would only reccommend this hotel to people on a very tight budget planning on partying all night, needing a central base to stumble back to at dawn- otherwise STAY AWAY!!!", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent england", "Title": "\u201cgood location but...\u201d", "Author": "becca1809", "ReviewID": "UR5292097", "Content": "I stayed at the cantabrico hotel at the end of may for 5 nights with a friend, and if your only looking for a cheap room to sleep in then this hotel would be ok for you.

The food at the hotel was disgusting i would save yourself money and eat out. For breakfast you get one hard roll and a little cake with a drink and for lunch and dinner it was a first course like rice and potatoes (weird) then a fatty piece of meat and chips for the second course most nights.
