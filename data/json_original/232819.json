There are hundreds of other hotels equally well placed. The staff and breakfast also lived up to previous positive comments. For a city hotel it is reasonably quiet and the free soft drinks in the fridge is a nice touch. However on the other hand there was no coffee or tea making facility in the room and the cost of a simple cafe con leche was \u20ac2.50 one of the most expensive in Madrid. But there were numerous other cafes etc in the area so not a serious issue. On the first day of our stay there was a crowd of youths staying involved in a stag trip - their language was appalling. I suppose it's expecting too much for the hotel to avoid the booking, but they failed to take any action which was a little surprising. I was also a bit miffed in that having agreed the bill in Euros and given my credit card they then debitted the amount in \u00a3 sterling. To add to this they gave me the receipt in an envelope which might be construed as deliberate deception. They are not alone in this practice in Spain, so beware ! In fairness the exchange rate was not excessive, but as a principle if you pay a bill in Euros you do not expect this to be converted to another currency without your agreement. A little naughty to my way of thinking.

I learnt about free minibar from Trip advisor, nothing they seem to promote very much, a pity since that's a nice thing when you arrive late. Note: there was a street party going on so the taxi couldn't go all the way, but maybe that was a one time thing. Next morning street was cleared and a taxi was arranged by the door within five minutes. Best of all - the breakfast buffet!!!

The hotel staff was helpful and provided information that ranged from how to navigate through the metro to where can we see flamenco dance. Front desk spoke English well, especially Ann Belen. I am always impressed with the hotel staff sunny and helpful attitude. This is definitely a hotel I would recommend to everyone and would go back. Our trip included a Bravo Bike tour of Madrid and a Bike tour of Segovia. These were the highlights of our trip. What a great experience! When in Madrid, must stay at Hotel Preciado and take Bravo bike tour. They were able to accommodate bikers of all different levels and give everyone a wonderful experience.

Look come on, this hotel is corduroy trousers of hotels, beige in every way. Rooms? Meh, doors don't close properly, cheap furniture, fluorescent lighting, smell of damp. I will say one thing positive, the window/door could have come straight from a submarine, it stopped all noise from outside, which was great & not only that it stopped putrid smell of the bins from rising up into our room, maybe little things like that got this hotel in the No1spot? Location, meh, yes it's very close to Sol, but it's not the closest, however it is very close to a dubious looking back street if you're into that type of thing. Staff, meh, pretty sure they were wearing corduroys. They weren't rude, or polite, robotic would be a good description, which is cool and all that, well it would be if they were painted silver and had heads like lightbulbs, but they didn't, unfortunately. Food, excellent breakfast spread, best I have ever seen & I've stayed in many many hotels, no in fact that's a lie, once in Thailand I had fresh mango cut like a boat floating on a stream of orange juice. You know, buffets, they're cop out arent they? Think about it, yes they're quick, but they're always overpriced, nothing is cooked for you & you have to get your own food, there's always some yellow slop that could be scrambled eggs or perhaps not, bacon, always so much bacon, do people really eat this much bacon? Please for the sake of my sanity, ALL hotels, hire a cook for the breakfast meal and start having a nreakfast menu....

The booking website can be a little confusing at times but in the end, I got the rooms that I wanted. Prices are surprisingly good considering a hotel located so centrally. Getting to the hotel can be a little bit of a pain in the rear due to heavy downtown traffic. However once there, you leave the car with a valet who parks it in a small garage located underneath the hotel. The garage seems to be geared more towards smaller city-style vehicles. We had a standard Sedan (Audi A4) but a large van would definitely not fit. The hotel rooms have wonderful decor and a nice balcony view. There is a free minibar with non-alcoholic beverages which is a nice surprise. The wifi signal is also clear and strong even on a 4th floor room. Despite the available amenities, the best part of the hotel is its location. It is literally next to a few great restaurants and discotecs so you will never wander too far from home base. Additionally, the major plazas and streets are all within walking distance. The hotel is quiet at night and your rest will not be disturbed by late-night revelers walking about the street.

I stayed at this hotel on Christmas week and mostly liked it. The only downside was my \"single room\" didn't have windows with a street view, which was quite shocking. I wanted to change the hotel since this one didn't have small rooms available, but on a first night I was too tired and then it kind of grew on me. The room did have a window to the courtyard, so I renamed my single room to a \"single cell' and decided to stay.Probably if it was summer, I would move, but in winter it was dark most of the time anyway and cold outside, so the air I got from the tiny window up in a courtyard and air conditioner was not so bad. I could adjust a heater and use it together with a conditioner. Everything else was fine. The location is great, close to everything. The breakfast was very good. The room was small, but clean. There was a hairdryer in a bathroom and they gave me a bathrobe when I asked with no charge. I also had a teapot with hot water to make tea every night also free of charge. Internet worked fine and there were two computers downstairs where you can check into your flight and print tickets. There is a nice Salad bar place across from this hotel open until 11PM, with salads and really good hot meal. The staff is great and speaks English.

We booked a superior, and came to realize that it meant, along with probably larger room, sloped ceilings in the bathroom, and weird small terrace which was completely unusable in the winter. So overall, I don't think it's necessary to stay in a superior. The personnel is extremely friendly and helpful. Which, to be honest, I found in most hotels in Spain, regardless of the price range. Overall, if you considering doing the museums, I would recommend staying south/southeast of Sol. For us this hotel was more of a base to explore Descalzas Reales/Palacio/Conde Duque/Universidad areas. I agree with some reviewers that while this is an excellent hotel [especially for the money], it is misleading to have it as Tripadvisor's number one in Madrid [which was partly the reason why we picked it].

Our favourite restaurant was La Catedral, near the Plaza Sol, this is a busy Tapas bar/Restaurant, the walls and furniture are dark wood and gilded, the staff friendly and efficient.

This was the first time we had stayed in the number 1 hotel on Tripadvisor & I've got to say that on the whole, we were pretty disappointed. I always try to identify all the positive aspects of a hotel first, so will do so again here. Firstly, the location is perfect, smack bang in the middle of where you want to be & close to the subway & within walking distance of central squares, great shops, restaurants & bars. Secondly, the breakfast is terrific. Really varied & catering for just about any wish or whim you might have. We also ate in the excellent & good-value restaurant, where we probably had our best meal of the stay. Staff are friendly enough too, but not entirely & in the restaurant seemed a bit snooty. Our room was comfortable & we loved the black-out shutters & complimentary mini-bar. However..... this hotel is really expensive for what it is, (I'm not sure quite how much, as my partner treated me for my birthday,) but I do know it didn't represent any kind of value for money. The room we started off in was close to some fairly noisey work being carried out in the hotel & although we were relocated without fuss, our new room was as small & felt like a pretty standard hotel room. Not what my partner expected. We stayed for 3 nights & on 1 occasion, the room was not cleaned Furthermore, there is nowhere to actually sit & relax. No lounge, no bar, just the foyer & the restaurant. We found this most bizarre & ultimately annoying. All in all, we were disappointed. This is allegedly, the number 1 hotel in Madrid & we felt we were entitled to feel a \"wow\" factor. Sadly we didn't. It was pleasant & comfortable & the breakfast/food was good, but I expected that.

The hotel is well run by a capable and friendly staff. It's a good base for an American tourist. Location: It's on a pedestrian \"mall\" that takes one to the Puerta del Sol, which is one of the primary squares in central Madrid. There are many restaruants, bars, shops and the like very near the hotel. One has many choices of metro stops for Madrid's clean, efficient public transportation system. Also, if one likes to walk to sites (as we do) most of the major attractions are an easy stroll through the always atmosphere-filled streets of Madrid. There might be better locations in Madrid but I have not stayed in any (and I've stayed in three other Madrid hotels). Rooms: We had the \"penthouse suite\" (Room 622) which had a marvelous patio and plety of space for the three of us. The modern decor was functional and the lay-out was well done. However, there were a couple of issues with the room. The bed is not comfortable by my standards (or compared to the beds at Corral del Rey in Seville). Further there was a sewage smell seeping from the toilet on our last night there. (In the hotel's defense we did not notice it until late Friday evening and we were leaving early Saturday morning so we did not alert them to this issue and give them a chance to fix it). Finally, the elevators make signficant noise and vibration and that woke us up from time to time. All in all the room was a bit of a mixed bag. Restaurant: I don't take points away for the quality of food in a hotel's restaurant but I will give extra weight if a hotel restaurant is awesome. This one is not. We had free breakfasts with our room and we did not even eat breakfast there on the second day, opting to go to Starbucks (which everyone knows does not exactly serve high quality food). There are many places close that are good but that restaurant is not one of them. Service: The hotel's staff is top rate and well trained. Most speak good English (better than my bad Spanish) and are eager to please. They made some fantastic recommendations for us for meals and we appreciate that. There is no complaint about service at this medium-service hotel, but there is also not the effusive praise that one would find in my Corral del Rey review. Value: This is a good value hotel. Our room was 300 euros per night and it is very large by Madrid standards. No complaints at all about their pricing. Overall this is a good, well located, medium service hotel that would equate to a nice Hyatt or Hilton in the states. It's not going to \"wow\" you but it's not going to be a problem either. The attitude of the staff and the location move this hotel from a three star category to a four star category, but it's really not a five star hotel (nor does it hold itself out as one).

Only faults were the very small ironing board that was delivered to the room in record time, and the sound of drains coming from the bathroom area which woke me up, but this was only because we had left the bathroom door open overnight.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Quiet Rooms\u201d", "Author": "fredruth", "ReviewID": "UR120681206", "Content": "Loved this centrally located hotel...we were also on the 5th floor and rather enjoyed our balcony in lieu of a bit of a bigger room...personal preferences is all.

Last reviewer mentioned lack of A/C...I was there the exact same days and the high of 70 with lows in the 40's made A/C seem not to be needed and I suspect they had it shut off for the season. Anyway, the highlight was the staff especially Eva from Segovia. My wife and I took the AVE train to Segovia for a day trip on Saturday 11/12...really worth it. Anyway we bought 4 beautifly hand painted glass plates in Segovia. Spoke with the artist who showed us her studio, kiln and home. Carried the plates around all day, but, upon arring back in Madrid I dropped them and 2/4 of the glass plates broke. In the AM I asked Eva to call the store (closed.but the artist had her cell number on the store card)...Eva called...the artist would give us similiar plates but we would have to go and get them..we were leaving the next day and couldn't go. Eva was going to visit her family that day (pure serendipity), got the plates for us and gave them to her aunt who was going to MAdrid Sunday evening and dropped them at the hotel for us AMAZING...now..in many years of traveling I have NEVER had someone go out of their way for a stanger like this...kudos to Eva ((Management...you should give her raise and an employee of the month award).

A metro station is about 2 minutes walk away and accesses Madrid\u2019s main line stations serving each of these locations Last time, Mrs EPR and I had a fab Junior Suite. None available during our visit this year, so we chose a \"Superior\" Room instead. Our interest was alerted because it had an outside terrace. Upon arrival we found a perfectly functional, not particularly large room, most of which was filled by bed! By the entrance area was certainly plenty of closet space , with loads of hangers and a small, easy to use, safe. Inside the main room there was a desk, minibar and flatscreenTV in an alcove along the wall. As I mentioned, the main area of the room was all bed (two twins with a double mattress), with a bit of space at the foot to walk round, together with an area to park the suitcase. Off the entrance hall, was a galley-type bathroom, with double sinks, full width mirror, and normal sized bath with whirlpool features. There was no separate shower cubicle; one had to use an attachment over the bath which worked satisfactorily. The bathroom\u2019s fitted out in large brown marble tiling which can be subject to water marking in sharp sunlight. The hairdryer worked well; the shaving mirror was rather elastic. A doorstop in the middle of the floor was infuriating (especially in the middle of the night!). Also, the bath is under a sloping roof, so extracting one's 6ft 2in self around the shower screen whilst ducking below the slanting ceiling was something of a daily contortion. Finally, the terrace - approached by patio doors adjacent to the bed (a gap of about 18 ins adjacent to the bed!), is built within the sloping roof of the hotel. It\u2019s about 3 ft wide and about 8 ft long. Just enough space for a table with a chair at each end. High walls meant no views, apart from more roofs, but all the hustle and bustle nonetheless evident from below. However, before we came, I knew we would be guaranteed three things - complete quiet at night, comfortable bed so a good night's sleep, and a big wide choice of spread for breakfast; all successfully achieved again. I was pleased to get a free beer in my minibar everyday (which didn't happen last year), and was very impressed by the jolly maid who diligently attended to our room at 6 p.m. one evening after a practical joke involving our \"do not disturb\"sign. It was also good to sit on the street terrace outside the hotel watching the world go by during the evening - and Madrid is a pretty lively place. So, Madrid and environs was great again, the hotel was as dependable as before, the room was functional but not our first choice - but for a Brit , four days of 30C temperature at the end of September puts a guaranteed smile on the face whatever the circumstances", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel, well located\u201d", "Author": "MSView", "ReviewID": "UR118643113", "Content": "Tastefully decorated and clean from the moment you walk in.

The hotel is in a good location, near the metro, and walking distance to lots of sights and restaurants. Good bed, pillows, shower, and towels. Free (albeit limited) mini bar was really nice luxury.

For meals nearby, I\u2019d recommend Lo Scolapasta, Casa Botin, and Asador de Aranda (literally across the street from hotel).

My wife and I had our luggage, backpacks, etc., and I\u2019m a fairly savvy traveler, but those thieves are pros at what they do. My wallet was attached to my belt by a chain, so they did not take my whole wallet. But they were able to take my wallet out of my pocket, remove cash, and put the wallet back into my pocket without my realizing it. It was like a magic trick. Fortunately, I only lost 70 euro and no credit cards or ID. If again faced with such a crowded train, I think I would wait for the next train.

Trip Advisor has yet again served me well!!! We walked in after a tedious 8hr flight from EWR and lengthy subway ride with luggage and immediately they had a room ready, I grabbed my free apple from the front desk, some free candy from the bowl and was walked up by hotel staff to my room and given an overview on how everything operated in the room and that everything in the mini bar was free and would be repleneshed daily. I was immediately impressed as was my sometimes skeptical girlfriend. Room was well appointed, bathroom had a skylight with motorized shade, and I had two sets of french doors that walked out to a spacious balcony. My bed was super comfortable, and the staff helpful if asked any questions they even provided us maps to get around. AC worked great and used my FREE internet to work on sightseeing plans daily. Plenty of free bathroom amenities/toiletries. The best part besides the room was the hotel location, literally in the middle of everything and the Metro was steps from the hotel which is CRUCIAL in spain if your american your dollar isnt worth much so you will be using the Metro constantly (which isnt a bad thing its clean and prompt) unless you have alot money for cabs. Concerns: Not really much, there was some construction either in the hotel on our floor or in the building next door that I heard some jack hammering on and off BUT it was around noon so it wasnt an unreasonable hour and time to get up anyways. Suggestion: Charge your customers another 10 euro a night on price and put it towards a free breakfast available in the mornings in your lobby restaurant and in my opinion you will have the PERFECT HOTEL. Keep up the great work guys!!!

I'd rate this hotel average at the very best and pretty lousy versus the expectations I had. Quite a lot of issues even though it had some good sides as well. I had a single room on the 5th floor and the room was really small. And I mean really, really small. There was room for the bed... and that was it. I've stayed in a lot of hotels around the world and I think this was the smallest single room I've ever been in. Also the room was located right next to the maids' equipment closet. That meant that loud noises started every morning at 9am sharp, as well as vacuuming right outside the room's door. So absolutely no chance of sleeping in a bit longer. The room didn't face the street but an inner staircase. This caused some issues as well, because the curtains in the room were pretty flimsy and almost see-through. So first thing: you couldn't get the room dark if you wished. Second thing and the one that bothered me more: when you have the lights on in the room anyone from the staircase can see inside your room! Forget about privacy! Good things about the hotel: * Location is perfect, right in the middle of things * Breakfast selection is exceptionally good even if somewhat expensive * Everything was clean and in order An additional note to everyone: Be really careful with your bags & possessions everywhere and especially if staying at a terrace late at night.

The lobby is pretty, the staff are very nice and the room and bathroom were lovely and comfortable. So far, so good. The first problem we encountered was that the safe in the room was locked closed. We didn't want to go out without locking up our passports and money, so we waited for someone to come to unlock it, which took longer than it should have (they said, \"right away\"), about 45 minutes. Second problem: first morning, the shower broke and one of us had to take a bath. That, fortunately, was fixed by the time we got back that day. Third problem: We inquired about a bus to Toledo to spend the day. The staff told us, \"don't take the bus, the train is much better\" (even thought Frommer's said the bus was the best way to go.) They printed out a train schedule for us and told us where to get the train. Never offered to book our train tickets for us. We got to the station in plenty of time, only to find out the train was sold out (\"it always sells out\") and the next train was 2 hours later. We ended up getting back on the Metro to the bus station, where we very easily got a bus ticket and traveled very comfortably and quickly to Toledo. Fourth problem: 2 days before our departure, we asked about transportation to the airport. We were told a taxi is the best way to get there. We asked if the taxis take credit card, and they said if they book it for us, they will make sure they take credit cards. The next day, we asked them to book the taxi for the following morning, again reminding them that we needed the taxi to take a credit card, (\"sure, sure\") and they asked if we needed a wake-up call, which we did request. Next morning -- no wake-up call!!! (\"So sorry\") We rush to get ready, the taxi is waiting, the ride to the airport is fine, and the taxi driver tells us, \"Cash only!\" We were furious. The poor taxi driver is upset, we're upset, my daughter runs into the airport to use the ATM, leaving us with euros to take home! While she's gone, the taxi driver calls the hotel, and the staff offers to pay the taxi and put it on our credit card charge. Too late! (\"So sorry\") Also -- it would have been nice for them to have told us about free entrance to the Prado on Tuesday evenings and to the Reina Sofia on Wednesday evenings.

Further, the front desk staff was not unfriendly but the desk was always understaffed and it was not a place to go for restaurant recommendations or tips on the city.

The rooms have safes but we had to call the front desk to have ours reset during both of our stays as they were not reset after the previous guests.

Tip: I would honestly say not to bother getting the metro to the hotel - just stick with a taxi. From the airport it was 4 line changes and after a few wrong trains it took me and my sister 2 hours to get the right station - all with a suitcase up and down stairs. However once I got to the right station it took us 2 minutes to find the hotel which was fantastic! Our room was also ready - even though we arrived very early. From the easy check-in and great staff, to the terrific value deal we got (free breakfast) for a #1 hotel on trip advisor you would expect this hotel to be high priced but its great value. As others have already commented - the location is fantastic and I must recommend the yummy yoghurt shop nearly opposite the hotel - Lloalow (poorly misspelt). We managed to pick up the bus tour round the corner from the hotel and the metro was also a corner away. The only negative was that our room had no view what-so-ever - but when your in this fabulous city its nice to be out exploring it! The beds were really comfortable - everything was in a modern design and the bathroom was lovely. The mirror heated up when I had a shower so that I had some steam-free mirror. This sounds simple enough - but when there are 2 girls cramming for mirror space to get ready and go out - this was much appreciated! The breakfast was fantastic and if you are deciding whether to choose breakfast - I would definitely recommend it. I've stayed in alot of hotels and I thoroughly enjoyed it - a full spread of breakfast, freshly prepared and plentiful: hot cooked breakfast, ham, salmon, cheeses, yoghurt, fresh fruit, chilled milk and cereals, pastries - cannot compliment the breakfast enough really and it would really set me up for the day. The sight seeing was great - I recommend the Prado museum as a must. I'm no art fan but I really found my appreciation of art in this museum. I also went to the Reina Sofia museum but I must say I didn't like any of the modern art - both museums were really close by to each other and on the bus tour. Something that I must recommend to everyone though is Madrid Place - I really enjoy seeing old castles and buildings but never before have I seen such a beautifully preserved castle - a must for everyone.

Rooms were very clean, nicely appointed, had 2 TVs and an exercise bike! The sleep quality is good with nice beds and double windows/doors to the picturesque balconies overlooking the pedestrian Calle de Preciados. When you hear about the sound-proof rooms, the windows aren't just double pane, there are literally 2 separate window/door frames! It couldn't handle the noise of the most rowdy of drunkards outside, but adequately handled the traffic and general noise and was a nice feature. The additional fold-out bed for the children isn't for adults, but perfect for kids which are happy to be in a hotel and aren't concerned with the comfort. The bathroom was very spacious, with a separate shower and bathtub, 2 sinks and toilet/bidet. The staff was friendly and helpful and attentive. They provided recommendations for restaurants, highlighting maps of attractions and asking if we needed a taxi upon departure. The door man happily greeted us every trip in and out of the building. Location is great for walking and touring, very close to Gran Via and near the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol. It's a hike to the Prado and Parque de Retiro, but we made it easily with kids in strollers and enjoyed the cityscape and unique buildings on the way. The free mini-bar is a nice touch, but don't expect it to be overstocked - i.e. one beer, one coca cola, one juice, 2 waters, etc. Breakfast is not included in the room charge, but the on-site offering was very nice and worth the price. The restuarant staff managed the offering well and kept everything plentiful and in order. A couple words of advice, not about the hotel, but in general. The Old Town is quite dense and tour book maps WILL NOT suffice. Get your map at the TI or the hotel for a very detailed street map. Also, if you take a taxi from the airport, be sure to ask for the Plaza Santo Domingo! Our driver dropped us at the Puerta del Sol (since calle Preciados is technically pedestrian). It's a haul from the far end of the calle Preciados with luggage and children in tow and even more challenging without an adequate map.

It became a nightly thing that once we came back to our rooms, we would sit down, and have a coke and a siesta. Happy times! The maids were EXTREAMLY nice and would always give you a smile and a hello when ever you passed them in the hallways. The location is key. Either a 2 minute walk to the Gran Via (a very busy street) or a 2 minute walk to the quaint little side streets, which we found many adorable resturaunts. The breakfast was amazing, as well.

When visiting a city for the first time one isn\u2019t quite sure where a hotel might be located to areas of interest, sights and restaurants but Preciados is right there for everything. About the hotel: check in was quick and efficient and we were given room 304 on the 3rd floor which looks over Calle Preciados, a semi-pedestrian street. Throughout our stay the reception desk staff were friendly and helpful. The room is large by European standards as is the bathroom. Bed was a good size with a selection of pillows and the room has plenty of storage space. Wi-Fi was free and quick and the room included a free mini-bar that included soft drinks and some beers \u2013 both the mini bar and the Wi-Fi can add to the cost of any hotel stay so both of these are very welcome and again, comes down to the thought that has gone in to making a guest feel welcome. The bathroom is a good size with a bath/shower, bidet and plenty of toiletries, hair dryer, etc.; lots of hot water and fantastic water pressure. Other nice touches included music from the in-room radio in the bathroom and LED reading lights by the bed. One point to note: by one of the sides of the bed are switches with up/down arrows that raise and lower external blinds which allows for a pitch black room. We travelled from the airport by Metro to the Callao stop as we only had carry-on luggage and wanted to experience the subway but I would recommend that anyone with heavy luggage take a taxi form the airport and get dropped off at the hotel \u2013 the trip by Metro required two changes and a few sets of up and down stairs which wouldn't be much fun with heavy suitcases. Apart from the trip from and to the airport we walked everywhere as the hotel is well situation for just about every major tourist site in central Madrid. We did not eat at the restaurant that is attached to the hotel but we did find a couple of local places of interest. Coming out of the hotel and turning right towards the open area with the Callao metro station, turn right again into a small street and you will come across Valor on your right which is a famous place to have chocolate and churros \u2013 there is sometimes a line but well worth the wait a good way to start your day. Just a few doors down from Valor on the right is a small local restaurant called Carpe Diem with welcoming staff and great tapas. Prices are about the same as all other tapas bars but we found their selection to be fresh and tasty \u2013 a good selection with a few beers came to about 50 euros for two (which was a full meal) which is about what we paid the previous day in another place that we had found to be disappointing. The next day we stopped by for a late lunch and took advantage of their 3 course 11 Euro menu which was very good.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tierra Verde, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, small but well-appointed, clean & quiet room\u201d", "Author": "piegirl52", "ReviewID": "UR87080382", "Content": "Recently spent 2 nights at Hotel Preciados and was quite pleased with my stay there.

The fantastic Madrid Metro--which is really easy & convenient--was a 2 minute walk. Although Madrid is very walkable, using the Metro helped save our tired feet a lot of extra steps and since we didn't have a lot of time, also helped us to see more by saving us time (*note: a 10-trip ticket is EU9.00 and can be shared!) Although the room was quite small (our cabin on the cruise we took was larger!) it was super-clean and very well-appointed with plenty of places for our things, and had a great shower. Double windows meant it was very quiet (and we were on the 2nd floor), and the very comfortable bed & pillows meant a good nights sleep. I would have liked to have a more comfy chair to sit in, but that is a minor point. Ana at the front desk (late afternoon/evenings) was very nice & helpful, sending us to La Latina area for dinner where we found tons a cute restaurants to choose from.

Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor are within a 5 minute walk,, Royal Palace maybe 10 minutes and the musuem area is about 15-20 minutes or a short metro ride. There are tons of restaurants within a few minutes walk. There is a department store a 2 minute walk away with wines, beer and food in the basement level for drinks or snacks in the room. The free mini bar was also a plus with water and 1 beer and several fruit juices that was refreshed daily. Several metro stations are also very close including Del Sol which will take you directly to the train station in about 10 minutes. Very convenient if you are leaving Madrid by train as we were. The room is upscale with plenty of room to unpack your clothes. Bathroom was nice. The best thing though has to be the double paned windows with the blackout screen. We didn't hear one sound in that room - the only one in Spain that we stayed at with that feature. Our only complaint was that there was only one English speaking channel on the TV whereas our hotel in Barcelona had 5. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so have no comments on that. A couple of comments not related to the hotel that might help some people save money. If you want to take the metro from the airport it is pretty simple even with 3 stops - however you don't want to do this if you and your traveling companion cannot pick up your luggage and take it up and down escalators and more important stairs as there are quite a few along the way. If you can walk 20 minutes don't waste your money on the hop on hop off bus. The commentary is rudimentary and actually was interrupted every few minutes by the bus driver yelling out the next stop on the intercom. Also, the Cultura card was handy for the priority line to get into the museum but it is very pricey so unless you are planning on seeing more than the basic 3 museums - Prado, Thyssen and Reina Sofia and aren't going during high season don't waste your money on this one either. Last, we took a tour with Julia tours - L'Escorial and Toledo in one day - 11 hours (website says 7) and half of that was in the bus or a pretty basic (being nice here) lunch in Toledo. Save your money and take the train to Toledo and sightsee on your own. Last, very few people speak Spanish in Madrid - or at least they don't like to so brush up on your Spanish before you go and ask at restaurants if they have an English menu because they won't always offer one up even after they realize you don't speak Spanish well. This was probably our most disappointing part of the trip - other than the food. We really expected the servers and shop personnel to be friendlier than they were - and we aren't ugly Americans - we did run across a few.

We stayed five nights in Room 312. I'll state what disappointed us first: The ventilation in the bathroom was not satisfactory, taking way too long for the air to clear up (we had to open the balcony doors for this). The wall-mounted swivel mirror in the bathroom was so rickety I had to tighten the screws in all joints to be able to use it. The one available seat, an armchair, was past its prime (the seat would sink really deep when one sat on it and you could feel the wood frame press against the back of your legs -- not comfortable). A change of fabric was also in order. The fabric-lined inside of the \"sous-main\" was stained from a sort of liquid. The sheets were changed only on the fifth night, after I placed them on the floor (perhaps they were due to be changed anyway? We'll never know) The good points: Though with minimal space on each side of the twin beds, Rm 312 was roomy enough in all other areas. Overlooking the pedestrian and not noisy Preciados street, it also had double glazing -- so it was very quiet. Spacious double wardrobe, good mattresses (on the hard side, which I prefer), choice of pillows and a focusing personal reading light, aside from the standard sconce near the headboard. Black-out double curtains. A long, deep shelf-desk that gave us ample room to place our travel papers, guides, buys, personal stuff. Breakfast was fantastic: aside from the usual corn and bran flakes, breads, croissants, butter, cheese, marmalade selections, we had wonderful freshly baked cakes including the almond Torta de Santiago and baked cheesecake, creme caramellee, panacotta, rice pudding, creme anglaise... Plus jamon, little tuna sanwiches, egg tostadas, a variety of fruit pieces and more. Cannot praise it enough.The staff was friendly and spoke passable English, computers with internet connection were available for free and we were not charged for the minibar. The location is excellent, right in the center of the city, minutes away from metro and bus stations, the lively Gran Via and Arenal streets, as well as the historic central plazas and neighbourhoods.

The bathroom was great and had a great shower with loads of hot water. The breakfast (not included in the price) was really good with plenty of choice (even for vegetarians!). The best thing about this hotel is its location, you can walk almost anywhere you would want to go and none of the major sights and galleries are more than fifteen minutes away.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cshame the air con wasn't working\u201d", "Author": "mogley71", "ReviewID": "UR82489786", "Content": "We have just returned from a trip to Madrid for a family wedding where we stayed at the Preciados for a week. My mum and dad stayed in a superior room which was lovely only small niggle was that the balcony was very small and didn't get the sun in the afternoon, the reason for superior room was so they could sit outside in the sun in the afternoon so this was disappointing however everything else in the room was perfect. My mum was most impressed with all the complimentary toiletries. Our room was a standard double and lovely unfortunately the air con wasn't working,we contacted the reception staff who sent up a repair man very promptly however he told us there was nothing wrong with the room (I did try and explain that the windows had been open all night hence the cool room). We were hopeful that it had been fixed however upon arriving back to the hotel that evening we discovered it most certainly was not fixed. We again contacted the reception staff who looked at their computer who told us it was 21 degrees in the room which was normal!!! They told us that we could not be moved that night as the hotel was full. After a very hot sticky night with very little sleep we again contacted the reception in the morning. We were moved very quickly into another room, but felt that they did not believe us as they again told us the temperature of the room dispite us again explaining that we only had achieved 18 degrees as again had slept with the window open (in the middle of Madrid this is not ideal). No apology was given and no help to move our stuff. We had 2 nights of very little sleep and an apology would have made a huge difference. The rest of our stay was excellent with good working air con. Depite this annoyance the hotel was beautiful the complimentary drinks in the room fridge was excellent as was the breakfast. We also loved the blackout blinds in the room. The reception staff let the hotel down, for example when we arrived to book in the receptionist answered the phone once he had started getting our details and spoke for approx 5-10 mins on the phone laughing and joking again no apology given. The doormen were all excellent and very keen to help pity the reception staff could not have shared their cheery disposition and helpful attitude. A smile goes a long way.

Our taxi driver off the airport stand took a slightly scenic route which was irksome, but the cab booked by the hotel for our return was like a fixed-target missile and cost rather less. The Metro, though considerably cheaper, would have been fiddly with the changes required whilst dragging around the usual tourist luggage. The Preciados is set in a busy part of Downtown Madrid but slightly away from the main cut and thrust of the nearby Gran Via or Puerta del Sol (famous for the illuminated Tio Pepe sign). The entrance is just a doorway between a restaurant (which appears to be attached to the hotel) and an adjacent shop, and the road outside is pedestrianised at night but open for vehicles to unload during the day. The reception area is small but pleasant in a formal sort of way, and all the staff we met were diffident and helpful \u2013 and could speak English well. We had a junior suite on the fourth floor overlooking Plaza de Santo Domingo. The Hotel is shaped like a flat triangle i.e. pointed at the front, widening at the back. Our room was the \u201cpointy bit\u201d widening out into a bedroom in one half, and a lounge and bathroom in the other. The adequate bathroom was light-brown marble tiled throughout. There was a large separate shower stall with a sliding height adjuster for the shower head. A bit of water seepage prevailed but not much. The bath had a whirlpool facility and was fitted with a shower too. There was also a large double sink top with a full length/width mirror, and an impressive array of freebies and some very pretty botanical displays! The W.C and bidet were tucked at away at the end of the room, and all ceramics were of the mottled wipeable non-stain kind. Outside, our lounge area was comfortable, and had a sofa with a desk opposite on which sat a flat screen TV. The minibar under the desk had free drinks but worked on a basis of one small beer day and nothing much for ladies, other than soft drinks or fruit juices. Stocking with our own additions didn\u2019t cause any problems though. There is no bar in the hotel, but there are plenty of street opportunities to refresh in all directions. Our bedroom also had a TV, plus an exercise bike (an all time first!) and a pair of odd human \u2013sized coathangers \u2013 male and female!! The bed was big and comfortable with adequate pilows, and more available in the large adjacent closet if required. This closet was adjacent to one side of the bed, and had ample coathangers and drawer space, plus an easy to operate safe. The whole room was double \u2013 double \u2013 glazed and had automatic window shutters (look for the double-arrow buttons) for each aperture. Madrid\u2019s a busy place but I heard nothing once our lights went out. All three areas were cleaned and serviced to a high standard everyday, and the air conditioning, circulating via the lounge area only, was easy to operate and relatively quiet. Breakfast was taken in the restaurant downstairs, and 15E per person seemed fair. It was a better spread than I\u2019ve recently had elsewhere, with plenty of meat (including ham off the bone), cheeses, fruit, cereals, pastries (lots!), juice and coffee. It\u2019s a bit cramped inside, so it\u2019s best to get a table at the edge otherwise people constantly barge back and forth through the tables in the middle. Also smoking is permitted in one half of the room, so some perturbation occurred when a guy came in and lit up a fat cigar! Once you get out, the Metro is simple, cheap and easy to use. San Domingo Metro station is across the road and probably quieter than nearby Callao. It\u2019s only 1E per single journey via a touch screen transaction that\u2019s translated into English. Trains are quick and clean, and seemingly entirely full of madrilenos. Central Madrid seemed nowhere near as obviously multicultural as London, for example. The city is wonderful and well-maintained with fantastic architecture and some inspiring museums and gardens. There seemed to be police everywhere so safety is probably not too much of an issue. Be prepared for direct begging and hawking, however, and there are several examples of rough sleeping around the city. Eating and drinking is also easy here. There must be about a hundred places radiating out in all directions only a short distance from the Preciados. As mentioned previously, smoking is permitted in many bars and restaurants, and we also found meal quality and bit more rough and ready than most of other places we\u2019ve been to, but the choice and quality is clearly endless. So, all in all, I was quite pleased with this hotel. I can understand all the positive reviews and the enjoyment of Madrid which most people seemed to share. So if you want a comfortable, quiet room in an understated establishment with excellent access to the city and its sights, then this might just be the place for you.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta GA", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel oasis tucked away from the big city\u201d", "Author": "tuckercal34", "ReviewID": "UR80492631", "Content": "Hotel Preciados was a very nice place to stay.

I've been somewhat skeptical of web site ratings of hotels in the past, but decided to go with this hotel based upon excellent ratings on TripAdvisor. We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. First of all, the location is excellent. It is within reasonable walking distance to most of the places one might want to go in the city center (Palacio Real, Museums [Reina Sofia, Prado, etc.], Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol), and outstanding shopping is literally a short stroll away on the Gran Via. The thing that makes Hotel Preciados such a great place, though, is its fantastic staff. They are courteous, helpful, responsive, and - get this - they smile a lot and actually seem to enjoy providing good service. We had a number of special requests that were accommodated without hesitation, such as holding our bags for several hours on our first day (our flight arrived much earlier than the usual check in time) and making sure our two rooms were adjacent to one another (we are an older couple and were traveling with two older children, so needed two rooms). After spending four nights here in late August 2010, we returned ten days later for one night before our flight home, and we were greeted at the front desk with the comment, \"so glad to see you back, hope your vacation has been going well.\" This was BEFORE we told them our name, so I am sure the gentleman recognized us from our earlier stay and made it a point to make us feel welcome upon our return. I could go on and on about how great our experience was at Hotel Preciados, but let me conclude by saying this is one of the best hotels we've ever visited in numerous countries, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Hotel - Clean, modern, nice beds, great bathrooms, free wifi, great breakfasts, free minibar (nice touch), staff are friendly, knowledgeable & speak good english Location - approx 300 yards from either Calloa or Santo Domingo Metro, so dont bother to get a taxi from the airport just use the Metro, it took us 40 minutes from the time we got on the Metro at the airport to walking into the hotel reception. Cost 6 euro for 2 people, versus potentially 30 euros for a taxi. The hotel is situated about 1000 yards from Puero el Sol, which is considered the centre of Madrid, and is where all the shops and the Plaza Mayor (restaurants) are situated. Metro - use the metro system, it is clean, air conditioned and cheap, each journey cost 1 euro, and we bought a book of 10 between 2 people for 9 euros at the airport, note you have to pay 1 euro each additionally for travelling to and from the airport. Getting around on the metro is simple, dont forget to pick up a map of the subway network at the info desk at the airport metro station. (Note if you land at Terminal 1, it is a 5 - 10 minute walk through Terminal 2 and 3, to get to the Metro station.) Restaurants - Madrid is packed with places to eat, it is as of half the nation are waiters !! For a quick but substantial lunch I recommend Museo de Jambon, (it is a chain selling hams, sausages etc), they are currently running a campaign, where you can have a big peice of french bread stuffed with cheese, ham or both for 1 euro, a beer or a glass of wine for 1 euro, a coffee for 1 euro. This is incredible value and good food as well, you have to eat it standing at the bar as the locals do, but that adds to the occasion. For something more formal and for either dinner or lunch, try the oldest restaurant in Europe - Botin, (just off Plaza Mayor) it's specialities are suckling pig (which was delicious) or lamb. For some really tasty tapas, try the Mercado, St Miguel, (next to Plaza Mayor), go around to the various merchants, buy your tapas, buy a bottle of wine, find a spot to sit or stand and enjoy!!", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cTerrific location, good value\u201d", "Author": "christiaan82", "ReviewID": "UR78726701", "Content": "Chose the hotel because of the location, wasn't disappointed.

If you go to santo domingo you will have to carry your cases. Both are very close to the hotel. It took about 40 mins each way. The overall location of this hotel is fantastic! Within walking distance are all of the major sights, and if you want to go a little further away you are right next to the metro which will take you anywhere you want to go. We would highly reccommed a visit to the Museo del jamon. This is where you will mingle with the locals. You can get a plate of Ham, cheese, Croissants, beer and a glass of wine all for a euro. It also double up as a butchers, where people are still in making purchases at close to midnight!!! It is on Calle Major, walking from Puerta del sol along towards Plaza Major it is on the left hand side, you should not miss it.

On our first night they even dropped off a small box of chocolates in our room. Service is excellent. For example, I had trouble getting the room safe to work when I first checked in. At first the safe was closed and had to be opened with a key. Then the battery for the safe blew out and the batteries needed to be changed. Both times when I called to have this fixed, the staff came promptly and resolved the issue. The only nit I had relates to the window blinds. There is a heavy blind behind the curtain of the balcony doors that is intended to block out the sunlight when the sun rises each morning. It didn't work properly because the width of the blind was smaller than the size of the doors. All they needed was a few more inches of fabric for the thing to work properly.

Never had to take the metro ANYWHERE except for airport. Once u arrive to airport: go to Tourist Info desk & ask for: metro map + city map, and u are set! To hotel from airport take metro: 1st L8 line to Nuevos Ministerios stop, then Line 10 to Alonso Martinez stop, then L5 & get off at Callao (closest stop to hotel less than 1 block or so away). If u take metro from airport, make sure u travel LIGHT (lots of steps up & down metros). 2nd, hotel room very good -- hard wood floors, modern, clean, great bathroom, FREE minibar with beer/soda/water/juice, flat screen tv. They have 2 free computers with free internet in basement, but one was not working well, kinda cramped, but still great to have. 3rd, when we 1st checked in, they told us we didn't have a reservation (b/c they had switched my 1st & last name around) -- so please bring a COPY of you reservations! It was an honest mistake. They are actually pretty friendly here. 4th, there is just way too much construction around the hotel at this time. Took away from the beauty of the place, but hopefully by the time u go, it will be completed. Overall, a GREAT hotel. Make sure to see: the Prado (free tues to sunday evenings 6-8pm), Thyssen museum, Plaza Mayor, Puerta Del Sol -- all within walking distance easily from hotel. Skip the Royal Palace -- not that interesting at all, especially if you've seen Versaille (this place was a real disappointment compared to Versaille in Paris). We researched which place to see flamenco shows, and found Casa Patas to be EXCELLENT. It's 31 euros/person which includes a drink. There were locals there too, which was a sign that it is genuine & not just a touristy place.

That room had a lovely, small terrace set into the roof, and a huge bathroom with a sloping ceiling. When I saw that we could get a suite in October, 2009 for 195 Euros Saturday, 175 Euros Sunday, I decided to splurge. (In both cases, breakfast is an optional 15-20 Euros extra per person.) I'd actually been hoping for the massive suite we saw on the roof in 2005, but I guess that was too much to expect. We did get two big rooms, with the curved corner-of-the building bedroom. Every window was french doors with double glass, and every door was actually a pair of doors. So the soundproofing was very good. We had two flat-screen TVs. Our suite bathroom had both a jacuzzi and a stall shower, as well as dual sinks and a bidet, of course! The shiny shower stall, which we both prefer, was gorgeous, but had badly designed weatherstripping. Since the suite came with two bathmats, we could sop up the drips. This hotel was a \"gut renovation\" within the last ten years, and is still in great shape. There's lots of custom wood paneling and shiny surfaces. It's immaculately clean, and the friendly staff speaks enough English to take care of anything you want. The breakfast is worth the price, including a whole table of cakes and tarts, poached and scrambled eggs, several kinds of Spanish ham, including dry-cured, juices and sparkling wine and espresso made to order. There were only four American-style dry cereals, which I usually prefer. But there were gorgeous fresh fruits, including sliced papaya and sliced pineapple. The hotel is closer to the Royal Palace than to the three \"big\" art museums, but we walked to all our destinations from this hotel. It's very close to the Puerto del Sol, the two important Monastery/Convent museums, the opera house, and the shopping district. It's an easy walk to the #4 museum in Madrid, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. (This is very worthwhile, and often overlooked by tourists.) The street (that is, Calle Preciados) is being turned into a pedestrian mall, which makes it hard for your taxi to get there. I suppose there's construction noise on weekdays, but we didn't experience any for the three days we were there. There are three subway stops nearby, but we still needed two changes to get to the airport. But for 3 Euros each, I'm not complaining about better airport access than most American cities! If you're crazy enough to have a car in Madrid, the Preciados is just steps from the municipal parking Santo Domingo garage, and only 3 blocks from other garages. We liked that it was near the Trapsatur tourist bus tour company, which we used to visit places like El Escorial and Segovia. I booked this room in 2009 through Continental Airlines because I saw that it was at the same price as the hotel website. I think they would be amenable to direct-bargaining during an off-season like October, but I'm not incline to bargain. This is a very comfortable place that's worth a slight stretch in your budget. Even if you get the standard room we had in 2005, you can expect enough room to live in, and reliable air conditioning in the summer. This is a very good value, with the appearance of a slick business hotel.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel in the center of Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Marina107", "ReviewID": "UR48317132", "Content": "Everything about this hotel was lovely.

They spoke English at the front desk, they always said Hi when we walked by. There is quite a bit of construction on C. Preciados and when I checked in, I asked if I was in a room facing the construction. They said yes, but quickly changed the room facing the side street. Then, after about 15 minutes of being in the room, one of the hotel staff came up and gave us Lindt chocolates to welcome us to the hotel. The free minibar was refreshing after walking around all day. A couple of beers, soft drinks and water were refreshed daily. The location is PERFECT. Right off the Gran Via, close to Callao metro station, Puerta del Sol, walking distance to Plaza Mayor. Free Wifi was nice since the Marriotts I stayed in throughout the trip (Cairo, Lisbon) did not offer this (even in the executive lounges). The rooms were nicely done, nice bathroom, balcony, soundproofed windows (really good soundproofing). The Cons: Since there was a bit of construction on C. Preciados, it took a little longer walking down C. Preciados as there was minimal space for pedestrians, but this is not the hotel's fault. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.

I can see that somebody with higher expectations could have had a few issues with our room and that's why I had to go with a 4 rather than a 5 rating. My wife and I stayed in room 106. This room is on the first floor almost directly above the entrance and above the restaurant. The hotel is located on the corner of Calle Preciados and Calle de Veneras, which is a block or so south of Gran Via. Being on the 1st floor even with both windows closed we were still able to hear people talking on the streets, as well as buses and garbage trucks going by. I'm a pretty light sleeper and didn't have issues sleeping at all, but of course we walked many miles a day so I was pretty tired every night that we were there. Also, with our room being above the restaurant at certain hours of the day you could hear the banging of things in the restaurant. From time to time we did also hear the neighbors, but it was never too bothersome. The bathroom was large and had nice warm showers every morning. We had some water go on the floor from the shower, but it was easily stopped with a towel. We really liked the decoration of the room. It was simple but stylish. We didn't use the TV much with us not being Spanish speakers. We tried to get English subtitles on the channels, but never figured it out. The hair dryer in our room didn't work well. It would turn on for about 20 seconds and then stop. We tried to get it fixed, but when they visited our room it always worked fine. So if you have room to bring your own hairdryer and it is a necessity, I would recommend bringing your own! Our bed was slightly on the hard side for us but again we didn't miss any sleep because of it. If you like to sleep in a dark room I would highly recommend using the rolling shutters (switches are by the bed and easy to miss). These were great at blocking out light and made taking a nap on our first day out (to recover from jet lag) wonderful. The free minibar drinks were a godsend. I think we emptied it out almost everyday. The selection included soda pop, juice, water and beer. The free wifi was nice as well. The front desk workers were friendly and spoke English well. We came into the hotel late a couple of nights and didn't have any problem waiting to get in. Location was great. I'm glad we weren't directly on Gran Via. Gran Via is pretty busy at all times during the day. Restaurants, shops and theatres are all within easy walking distance as well as 3 metro stops.

You are within 1 minute of 2 different metro stops. The hotel is a business class hotel, with extremely sleek interior and professional staff. The staff was very helpful - fair English, very willing to help make reservations, call taxis, etc. Made good suggestions for restaurants, shopping, etc., and provided a useful map, too. There are 2 computers with so-so internet access in the basement. The room is small to average for Europe, small by US standards, but is extremely sleek and with a lot of features that were unexpected. For example, there are electrically-controlled window shutters; a flat-screen TV with about 40 stations; tons of lighting including 2 different individually-controlled reading lamps for each bedside; a small refrigerator; safe and hair-dryer. The bathroom is very good size, with lots of space for toiletries. The shower is a full bath-shower combo. Nice soft towels. The bed is a little soft but perfectly acceptable, with lots of pillows. We had asked for a crib in the room, which was already in the room when we arrived. The room was ready at 10 in the morning, which was very nice. I want to commend in particular the housecleaning services of the room. The room was always cleaned on time, and at a very high level. As an example, every morning they refolded the sheets and blankets of our baby's crib; folded up the blanket that we used to cover the crib (to keep it dark while we watched TV) and placed it neatly in the crib; folded up her pajamas and sleep sack; and straightened the crib out in the corner of the room. I was very impressed by the housecleaning staff. The only drawback is the strong smell of vinegar in the towels, but that wasn't a big deal. The room was very very quiet and dark. The room has 2 large windows, each having TWO sets of double-paned windows with a mechanized rolling shutter between them. When you bring the shutters down, and close the drapes, you are talking about 4 panes of glass, drapes, curtains, and the metal shutter separating you from the street. Believe me, it was dark and quiet. We often slept til 10 am without stirring, even our infant daughter who is a bit of a light sleeper. This was a great night's sleep!

We are well traveled and recognize the difference between good and excellent service. Any and all requests were immediately responded to. Extra pillows arrived within five minutes, a request for cups and saucers in our room was met without hesitation, a call was made to our room the night before check out to ask if we needed a taxi for transport to the airport, and on and on. We had the hotel breakfast each morning and it was worth the cost and kept us going for the hours before a late lunch. It is more like a brunch than a breakfast. Fresh baked goods, fresh fruit, ham, salmon, ham and salmon mini sandwhiches with fresh baguetts, scrambled eggs, bacon, eggs sunnyside up, yogurt, cereal, and granola. I am sure that I am missing some of the items but it was great. Once again, the service at brunch was impeccable. The reception staff can appear to be stoic but they are extremely helpfull. They made dinner reservationss and printed out Renfe time tables and weather forecasts when requested, and again, within minutes.

We were in a good hotel in Seville but it was made better by having the best room in the hotel. So, be certain to discuss room location and view when booking anywhere.

Like another poster, we thought the beds were too hard, but we got used to them (still I do prefer a softer bed). The rooms were so well designed that the [small] size of the room was not a problem. The shower is outstanding. The staff was very friendly and helpful, not that we asked much (we arrived at 1 a.m., and they had our paperwork all ready, so all we had to do was sign and go...much appreciated at that hour; next day, we mentioned that we couldn't get the TV on the night before, and one of the desk clerks, just left the desk and came to our room with us and got it working straight away). Location of the Preciados is great. We were glad we were staying close to the Puerta del Sol.

Our stay was for 5 nights and we had one of the Junior Suites (Room 307) which was spacious, modern, and very quiet. Overall we were very pleased with the room. The junior suite with a separate bedroom and living room was quite large as was the very modern marble bathroom. The bath had two vanities and two showers, one a glass enclosed shower and the other in a large tub that also included whirlpool jets. There was a problem in the bathroom with the enclosed shower leaking water out onto the marble floor making it necessary to mop up the floor after each shower. One great feature that I did not expect was that each window and exterior french door had a blackout shutter that we could close and make the room virturally black, blocking out the bright city lights that otherwise may have made it difficult to sleep. The double glazed windows also made the room almost sound proof from the very busy street below us. I suppose being a spoiled American there were a few minor details that would have made the room perfect. There was no coffee maker of any kind. I like having my coffee first thing before showering and going out, and this made it a very long morning having to wait to shower, get dressed and then find someplace with either cafe con leche or just plain joe. Another lacking detail was an iron. When you are traveling and just going to walk around and go to cafes, a wrinkled shirt is no big deal. But if you want to go to a nice restaurant or club, an iron would come in handy. I asked for one, but they said they did not have one, but could send someone up to iron at what I am sure was some outrageous rate. I made do with a few wrinkles. The third detail was that the in-room mini fridge was not working very well. When I mentioned it, they said it was not suppose to be very cold. Again, suppose I am spoiled, but I like my diet cokes cold and not luke warm. The only other comment I would make is that they have ruined the wooden floors by using some the wrong type of cleaner. The floors will need be resanded and restained to make them look good again. Okay, now for the major complaint. When we arrived at the hotel on Monday evening, the entire lobby was being renovated. I knew from pictures that the lobby was not spectacular or large, but I was very dissappointed that while there, we had no lobby at all. It was always dusty and loud from the construction, day and night. Fortunately, our third floor room was very quiet and the construction noise did not bother us. One elevator was always out of order making the wait for a elevator car very long. I complain because when you pay that much for a suite in a hotel, you do not expect to have to put up with construction. The hotel should have made us aware that they would be doing this while we were staying there and should have offered sometype of apology and quite frankly sometype of discount or possibly free breakfast for the inconvenience. Instead, the staff seemed at best indfiferent and annoyed at the construction and that was past along to us. Not everyone mind you, but most of the staff was just not as friendly as I had been told they would be and certainly not helpful. On two occasions when I asked for help with reservations at restaurants, I was very disappointed with how it was handled. The first time, when I requested help in reserving a table at Botin, the desk clerk said it would be impossilbe to get a table at such late notice and did not want to bother to call. I had to request him a second time to do so, and when he did, we easily got our reservation. On our last night, I requested assistance and advise on a new popular restuarant at the ME Madrid Hotel, Midnight Rose at the Plaza Santa Anna. The desk clerk had never heard of it and I had to make the reservation myself. Turns out Midnight Rose is the hit of Madrid and our meal was excellent as was the service. The Penthouse Bar on the top floor terrace is a great place to see all of Madrid. Given what I have said, the hotel still has great promise. The location is first rate, within walking distance of eveything and a subway station very close (although we never used the subway). If not for the construction and the indiffernce of the staff for our inconvenice, I would have rated this at least above average and very close to excellent. But service is the name of the game and the hotel failed to provide excellent service and lacks the trained ststaff that knows how to make it clients feel special.

If this sort of thing bothers you, bring your own towels. Also the stuffed animal that my daughter had hand-made disappeared from her room, and it took four visits to the front desk before they would call the laundry to see if it got mixed up in the sheets.

This room is described as 'superior', but its size does not suggest that. Making the room even more cramped was a padded seat along the foot of the bed. The bathroom is massive and special, but I would prefer to have had some of its space incorporated into the bedroom. The skylight with electric shutters is an interesting addition to the bathroom. But, I fail to see how the sloping ceiling in the bedroom is considered a selling point! Just adds to the cramped feeling! We failed to gain access to the rooftop where we could see evidence of seating. The lobby is not somewhere you would want to sit to read or relax as it is too small and positioned between the desk and the door to the restaurant. The brochure still shows a residents' lounge, but, when we asked, we were told that it no longer existed!!! And the room,as I said, was not big enough to allow for comfortable lounging and reading. Sorry for sounding off on the negatives, but it was supposed to be The No 1 hotel in Madrid. (I note that it has now slipped a couple of places) On the positive side it is one of the cleanest hotels we have ever been in. The standards could not be higher throughout the entire hotel. The staff are friendly indeed and we saw only one who had a grumpy look, in the restaurant. The soundproofing from the street is perfect. Not a whimper from outside. It surprised us then to find internally how noisy an American sounded when talking at a late hour in a neighbouring room. We dined in the restaurant on three days and the food was excellent. We found that the set price and set menu, running from 12 to 4pm each day, was excellent and very good value. Calle Preciados is as central an area as you will find in Madrid, whether it be for shops, eating, galleries, parks. I have no doubt that this is one of the great advantages of Hotel Preciados. The small free bar containing juices, water, soft drinks and two beers is unique and is refilled each day, no questions asked or payment sought. We had decided to use transport which would drop us at the door of the hotel and back at the airport. We avoided the taxis and used Aerocity. Their small minibus is comfortable, prompt and costs \u20ac21 each way. We had it to ourselves when arriving and had just two others using it when departing. When I contacted the hotel in advance, I was quoted \u20ac70 each way for what they would provide. It was probably for a limo! Aerocity can be booked on the internet for both journeys in advance and you simply go to their desk in Terminal 1 when your flight arrives. If you have hand luggage only, you can get into the city by rail for just \u20ac2, but you need to know how to use the Metro to get to the hotel, getting off at Metro Callao.

This however, was not my favorite hotel of my recent visit to spain. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the room was unbearably hot. We complained, and although someone from the maintenance staff was sent up to the room, bottom line was that the a/c was not on. We had to sleep with the windows open which would have been fine but for the fact that Madrid (and most of Spain) is a late night place with people walking the streets and talking most of the night. I'm not an early bird, but once it hits about 2 a.m. I like to sleep. With the windows closed, the hotel was quite soundless, but without A/C, we had to either not sleep or try to deal with the street noise. My other complaint is the knowledge that the front desk staff has of the city. I am a food freak and love to visit the food markets/mercados of the places I visit. I came armed with a list of the main food markets of madrid ( La Paz, Chamartin, etc) and the man at the front desk had not only not heard of them, he looked at us like we were crazy when we asked where the markets were. Since I had a list of at least 10 that I had found in one spot on the internet, had seen on tv and read about in various books and magazines, I was quite taken aback that I seemed to be asking for something so unfamiliar to him. He was familiar with the Sunday flea market ( El Raestro (sp?) and was happy to direct us there, but I think a hotel from a large chain (NH) should have better informed people at the fornt destk. Othere than these two complaints, I would say this was a good hotel. Would I return?

I took my girlfriend this time and i booked the VIP suite on the 6th floor with the roof top terrace as it was her first time in Madrid.

Oscar checked us in and was the most helpful. We arrived very early, around 9am, and were able to check in right away. It is in a great location near Gran Via and Puerta Del Sol. Great shopping, restaurants, and bars nearby as well as the Metro station at Callao. The hotel offers free wireless internet access in the rooms, as well as two PCs in the basement guests can use to access the internet. We also very much liked the free mini bar. Our room was on the small side but the furniture was well positioned to allow for movement and the closet held all our belongings. We stayed on the 3rd floor, facing Calle Preciados, but had no troubles with street noise - double sets of doors on to the Juliet balconies and the mechanical shutters blocked out all noise (and light, which was nice for sleeping in!). A few minor negatives we noted. First, the towels in the bathroom smelled very strongly of vinegar. They appeared otherwise clean. Also, the room had a very slight musty smell. There was an air freshener in the bathroom that dispensed a minty spray every 20 minutes or so. Finally, the 1/2 wall in the shower did not keep the water inside the shower, and we had a puddle on the bathroom floor after each shower.

Still, the man at tthe front desk did genuinely appear to do his best, apologizing that all other rooms on the top floor was fully booked.

Having spent some time in both of these rooms, I must say that there are a couple of problems...first the intense smell that gave me a headache...it\u00b4s a mixture of heavy body odor and aggressive cleaning agents. If you are sensitive to chemicals as I am, you will not want to stay at this hotel. I am trying my best to spend as little time as possible in the room.

The only reason I do not give this hotel full marks is that we arrived late (about 2215 hrs) and, despite having phoned about 10 days in advance to advise that we would check-in late, the hotel claimed not to have a room for us due to problems with electricity (even though outside it was lit up like the Blackpool illuminations). They had, however, organised another hotel which was pleasant and close by and we only had to stay there one night (we would have been seriously hacked-off if it had been for more than one night). When we returned to the Preciados the next morning, we were able to check in almost immediately and I think the problem was one of overbooking rather than anything to do with electricity, which is why I recommend getting to the hotel early. Anyway, as for the hotel, it is in an excellent location, close to Plaza de Santo Domingo metro (red line, no 2) and minutes from the Gran Via. The metro system is excellent and we bought a 10-journey ticket for Euros 5.80 (we passed the ticket between us, which is allowed).

The room was not large but was modern, clean and well appointed, with a good-sized bathroom (and big, fluffy towels!). The free mini-bar is a god-send after hours of walking! The hotel fronts a busy-ish street but our room was round the corner on a quieter street and, in any case, the rooms have electric shutters which block out the majority of outside noise and a good air-con system which drowns out most internal noise. We were amazed at how quiet it was when you saw how close it was to the incredibly noisy Gran Via! The desk staff were helpful (though I'm not sure how much was due to the fact that I speak passable Spanish). The person in the room prior to us had shut the safe, despite the instructions telling you not to, so I went down and asked someone to come up and sort it out, which was done in minutes. I had asked for extra pillows before going out on our first night and we arrived back to no extra pillows. I phoned Reception a couple of times to try and sort it out but there was obviously a fault with the phone (I could hear them but they could not hear me) but someone turned up at the door within about 5 minutes to find out what the problem was. They were happy to keep our bags on the last day as we checked out about 1100 hrs and then came back for them at 1700 hrs, so that was very useful. As a gesture for messing us about on arrival, we were provided with free breakfast. The food was very nice and there was a good selection (fruit, cold meats/cheese and pastries) but it was a bit shambolic - the room used (the hotel's restaurant) is not big and we struggled each morning to find a clean table with cutlery. There only seemed to be one girl who was trying to do everything (clear tables, make them up, make coffee) so it was a bit hit and miss about how long you had to wait but we weren't bothered. The only bad point was that we decided to have a slightly longer lie-in on our last morning so did not get down until about 1000 hrs - it was as if locusts had been and taken just about everything! I don't know whether it was replenished after we had gone but we had our coffee and a few bits and pieces and left to the sound of grumbles from people who had arrived even later than us! All in all, this was a very good choice of hotel which lived up to the reviews we had read, so much so that my husband is going to recommend it to work colleagues who travel out to Madrid on business. My one gripe (a small one and one which I have for lots of hotels, not just the Preciados) is that they do not offer a choice of feather or synthetic pillows - I cannot abide synthetic pillows as they are either lumpy or it's like putting your head on a marshmallow but, for the 3 nights we were there, I could live with it! One word of warning - on all my visits to Madrid, I have been targetted by pickpockets or people trying to rip you off. This time, we were walking along a quiet street near the Plaza Mayor at about 2000 hrs. A guy approached us asking in Spanish for directions and, as we were looking at his map, two other guys appeared, flashing \"police\" cards and badges and demanding to see identity papers. We smelled a rat straight away and walked off and, based on the fact that we were not challenged by the so-called policemen, this must have been a scam though I am unclear what the purpose was. Sad to say, if anyone asks for help then my advice is to walk away unless you are 100% certain that they are genuine (if we had thought about it at the time, why would a Spanish-speaking person ask obvious tourists for directions, it just doesn't make sense).", "Date": "October 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat modern central hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3842114", "Content": "A lovely oasis in Madrid.

Our room was small but really clean and very modern: I loved the polished wooden floor, and the pale wood effect finishes kept it very bright. The bathroom was quite small but was sensibly laid out and thus seemed bigger than it actually was - and it was beautifully clean with plenty of toiletries etc. Our room did look to be one of the smallest and looked over a very dull side street (we booked the day before, literally, and got the last one available I think, at a very good rate) but we still liked it a lot. As other reviewers have mentioned, the minibar is free which is great - and you can just about squeeze a bottle of cava in there to chill if you want (the basement supermarket at El Corte Ingles at the top of the street is useful for this!). There are two metro stations very close by (I was about to write 'within a few minutes walk' but they're better than that - for a fast walker like me you could almost count it in seconds!) and the main square, palace etc. are all within easy walking distance - in fact, walking back late after a day sightseeing and an evening trying different tapas bars, it was really good fun to walk back to the hotel through all the busy streets. The lobby area is small and there didn't seem to be much atmosphere at the hotel - but there's more than enough out on the streets so who cares! The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

The first was just a lucky guess while browsing the Internet, and the other two are because I just plain love it! Running down the list of key factors to consider: Service: top-notch, always! The staff really goes out of their way to help any way they can. Rooms: fantastic layout, well-maintained, nicely equipped, and comfy. Special features: free minibar fridge. Yep, you get juices, soft drinks, water, beers, and more, and you can consume all of it on a daliy basis free of charge. That shows class. The bathroom has a nice sized tub with air jets (jacuzzi effect). Ask at reception how to use it, or lay out about 20 towels on the floor the first time. Windows keep out all but the loudest street noises, but you can hear stuff from adjacent rooms. Location: the best. About 1 kilometer from the true center of the city (Puerta del Sol), but it is somehow on a quiet street. By the way, there is no such thing as a safe street in Madrid, but the safety is above average for its specific location. Many attractions nearby, plus a subway station about 200 meters away. Breakfast: a buffet style assortment which is not too varied, but nicely selected. The staff is really nice there too, so just ask for your eggs any way you want them, etc. I am an iced tea lover, and each morning (after the first, when I expressed an interest) thereafter it was freshly brewed for me. Granted, iced tea is a simple thing, but what I liked was the caring service. Price: a bit pricey, but well worth it! Amenities: not many. The lobby is small but cozy, and in back there is a bar exclusively for guests of the hotel. The restaurant offers good food, but if you are in Madrid you should eat out. Healthy eaters tip: the best salad bar in Madrid is at VIPS (they are all over the place, and some have the salad bar.) I bet you did not know they had salads in Madrid. Ha ha, a little hotel review humor. Besides this, I have absolutely no complaints. Well okay, just one: there is no gym in the hotel. If you want to work out during your stay in Madrid it will cost you.
