The lobby and check in area is modern and we were welcomed warmly. Our room was ready when we got there so we had a quick check in. We had a room that overlooked the pool. The rooms all have outside entries and the interior is small but upbeat and clean. The pool is very lovely day or night. We felt perfectly safe here. The staff was very friendly and checked quite often if we needed anything and asked how everything was. Even though the room is small, the bathroom is completely renovated with appealing tile surfaces. There were plenty of towels, hand and bath soap, shampoo and conditioner. There was always plenty of ice. All lights worked and airconditioning was fine. Breakfast was served at 6:30 which was nice; because it is so warm here the breakfast area is outside on decks which overlook the pool. They had the same menu both mornings we were there. Boiled eggs, bagels, assortment of sweet rolls, juices, coffee, tea, milk,cold and hot cereals, yogurt and waffles. A big bowl of oranges and apples sat out each morning. The location of this place is about a mile from the historic downtown. It is located on busy Roosevelt Avenue. The big problem in Key West is parking. There are two parking decks in the historic area and lots of parking meters which take one quarter for each ten minutes, so it's $1.50 an hour to park. The meters also take credit cards. There are a few all day $10 parking lots. However, we did locate a free parking area by The Hemmingway House. We went the first week in November which is a relatively low tourist time. Even so, there were a lot of people there and parking was difficult to find. The trolley stops at this Fairfield Inn, and it costs $29 for an all day off and on. Definitely the large pool is the crowning characteristic of this hotel. We paid $110 a night with a Senior's rate, so it was a nice place for a reasonable price in a high tourist area. Before we left, we went over to the \"beach\" side of Key West and discovered it is completely different from the busy area where we stayed. There is a nice beach with an uncrowded street with a wide sidewalk for bicycling. There is a much more tropical feel and look on this side. We will try this the next time we visit the keys.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aydlett", "Title": "\u201cSmall tiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "Darlene B", "ReviewID": "UR120856607", "Content": "Rooms so tiny you cannot pass one another inside the room - no place to put your luggage except on top of the bed or step over it.

The hotel is on N Roosevelt Blvd, which is one of the main roads on the island. The area that it is in is a very commercial area (fast food restaurants, car dealerships, strip malls) but it seems like that is true for most of the chain hotels in Key West. We had a room with two doubles, facing the pool. All rooms appeared to have exterior entrances on the pool side and none appeared to have a personal balcony, just the exterior walkways. The appearance of the room was nice and modern, but the doubles are somewhat small, suites are certainly better. As with all Marriott hotels, the rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly. The nicest thing about this hotel was its pool area. It was much nicer than I would expect for a Fairfield Inn. There was also an outdoor bar by the pool, I think it stayed open til 7pm. There were a few food/snack options at the bar, but it was mostly there for drinks. If I have the opportunity to stay in Key West again, I would certainly consider this hotel.

Check in was otherwise fast and she answered all of our questions. Rates for our stay were reasonable, considering the event that was going on at the time. The room itself (208) had a king-sized bed. The room is a little small but otherwise decently sized for 2 people to move around. Air conditioner was loud but worked very well. TV was excellent. Shower stall is very large. Only main problem with the room was the tiling around the shower drain was sharp in one or two spots - we put a washcloth down for protection. Only other problem was when we tried asking a maid to come into our room for something; we were unable to communicate to her in any way that we wanted her to stop by! (We mentioned the minor issue to the front desk as we left) Taxi fare from the hotel to Duval Street was about $12, including tip. We called the front desk to ask them to get a taxi for us. They said 5 - 10 minutes but they yielded a taxi very quickly - under 5 minutes both times. Parking is free and about 1/2 the spots are covered (under the hotel).

So we had to pay $200 in cash for the deposit on the scooter. Upon further investigation the hotel mistaking charged us again for the hotel stay.

I talked to 4-5 people at the hotel and 2-3 people at my bank before it was finally resolved. VERY AGGRAVATING. 6 HOUR ORDEAL. The other very aggravating issue was the location of the ice machine. There is only one for the entire complex. It is located in the far back corner above the parking garage. It can only be accessed by stairs unless you are lucky enough to be located on the far wing of the complex.

Bathroom was more spacious than most hotels of this type, and tile floors throughout the room were a welcome change from difficult to keep clean carpeting we've encountered at other places. Service from the staff was truly outstanding and always friendly! Everyone we encountered went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and to offer suggestions on how to best enjoy Key West! The pool is lovely (actually as nice as pictured on the hotel website!) with lots of seating available and features a poolside tiki hut that serves a daily reasonably priced drink special along with its regular full bar menu. A poolside limited buffet breakfast was included each morning; food was fresh and menu included a couple of non-standard items along with the typical cereal, fruit, and make-it-yourself waffles. The hotel is located about 2 miles from the \"downtown action\"- but the ease of free parking onsite and sight-seeing trolley that stops there frequently make up for that small inconvenience.

Maybe they had a bad day when I checked in but I found the manager had an \"attitude\" and not very pleasant at all. When we arrived to our rooms (I was there with a group of 7 friends and four rooms) manager's attitude left a \"bad taste\" in my mouth. Good points: Nice attractive lobby with a comfortable seating area, exceptionally nice swimming pool, comfy beds and pillows. Did my usual check for beg bugs nowadays, everything was fine. Room minimally decorated shades of blues and whites, windows did not have curtains, but shutters, giving it a nice tropical feel. The bathroom was on the small side but adequate. There was a long narrow shower with a glass door and the toilet was right next to the shower. The sink was located outside the bathroom in a vanity area and had plenty of room for two people to spread their stuff out. The floors were not carpeted but tiled, which I found unusual for a hotel, but I'm sure it was easy to keep clean. Fairly nice free breakfast, although I am not much of a breakfast eater. On the other hand, I did find a black hair on the sheets which concerned me a bit. My friend suggested it probably was from the maid that made the bed up, so I just let it slide. I am very fair and blonde, so it could not have been my hair! The TV needed to be updated to a flat screen. The rest room needed a cleaning in the lobby when I first checked in. I felt that it should have been checked regularly. Although I made two negative comments about the cleanliness of the hotel, I do not want to give a false impression that it was dirty, basically I found it to be very clean with these two exceptions. The hotel is located on the land side and it is about a $15 taxi ride to get to Duval Street. Would I stay there again? Probably not, the only thing that would bring me back is the pool.

I think almost all of the rooms are set back off the highway far enough to keep the noise to a minimum & also the rooms have a continuos fan option on the air conditoning system to muffle any highway noise. A good choice would be a room set back as far as possible from the highway but still overlooking the pool. The Old Town Trolley is the way to go to get downtown. They stop every half-hour at The Fairfield & 11 other stops on the island between 9am & 4:30 pm. It costs about $29.00.(It was good for 2 days which may have been a special being offered while I was there.)

I had checked the reviews constantly up until we left on 3/12 and everything is pretty accurate. Check-in went smoothly and we were greeted with drinks and necklaces. We had booked a room with two queen beds and I was concerned since I knew it wouldn't have a fridge. But all we did was ask for a fridge to be brought in and it was, free of charge!! We were in room 136 and it's a good room, good location right outside of the pool. I was also concerned that we would hear the people above, but I didn't hear anything the entire week, on any side for that matter. I loved the shower, but I wish it would have had a seat or something, it's certainly big enough for it. But other than that - typical hotel, I didn't think the room was that small from the other posts, even with two of my family members there. Clean linens, but fyi - there is no closet, just a small shelf thing with some hangers. And good/standard continental breakfast each morning. And one more thing, there are posts regarding the air conditioner - it is loud, but not loud enough to wake me up (I'm a light sleeper) and we didn't hear any roosters at dawn. I LOVE the pool there and you can always find chairs.. easy. This was a big deal for my family and I so I paid attention to the chairs and was happy they were always available. The only thing was that they do have construction going on so it's noisy in the afternoon, but it wasn't bad. Plus they have several fountains which are on. I would much rather stay at the pool than go to the beach. We went to Fort Zachary Taylor - pretty expensive from taking a taxi, to the entrance fee to renting an umbrella/chairs.. should have stayed at the pool!!! In terms of location - it's pretty far from Duval and all of those activities. We ended up taking a lot of taxis, which aren't cheap. I suggest the pink taxis. There is a CVS/Walgreens/ TGI Fridays/ Dominos within walking distance - maybe 5-10min walk. We also got delivery from a place on Duval street (Amigos?) one night - delivery for this hotel is a good option. The last thing was when we checked out, we noticed that there were two Trolley tickets charged to our room. They were not ours so someone had used our room number and ended up getting the tickets for free since according to the front desk staff. They were good about removing the tickets from our bill and making sure my credit card wasn't charged (at least they said it wouldn't be). I just can't believe people these days - using someone else's room and forging a signature. Make sure you go over your bill!!

Coffee was very good, kids loved fresh made waffles, oranges were real fresh. Two best parts are having breakfast outside in glorious weather and the incredibly friendly staff. POOL: We're not much of a beach swimming family to begin with and the beaches in Key West aren't as nice as a lot of other places. So the pool was important to us. Swam every day we were there, the pool is warm, clean and spacious. Never a problem getting lounge chairs, having room to feel comfortable...or anything really. Poolside tiki bar is just steps away for whatever kind of drink you need, different frozen specials every day...we went for Pina Coladas that were excellent. LOCATION: I prefer to stay outside of the main drag (no pun intended) to have a little more quiet, be able to go to come and go as we please, and not feel too crowded...so this was perfect for us. Did the Old Town Trolley first day (stops on site) to get some history and feel of the area, gets a little long at times but we all enjoyed it. Drove close to Duval/Mallory Sq just about every day & night..takes about 5-6 minutes. Was concerned about parking but there are a bunch of lots close to the area if you don't mind the $15-20.

The hotel overall is styled like a Cape Cod inn, with pastel clapboards, ceiling fans, Adirondack chairs and plantation shutters. The continental bkfst by the pool was just delightful.

We took a taxi (the shuttle, $29, goes in a loop and you won't get into the main part of town for 45\") and were glad we didn't take bikes because of the extra time it takes to tie them up, stash your helmet, etc. In one day, we managed to make the Hemingway House and gardens, Key West Lighthouse (with panoramic view) and museum, Duval St. strolling and shopping, Mel Fisher Maritime Museum, sunset and dinner at the little-known but acclaimed Colombian Grace.

But with high prices come an expectation of decent accomodations, amenities and service, and I was very disappointed in all of these departments. The King Suite we had booked would have been nice for two people. The king-sized bed and bedroom were fine. But we had booked room for a family of four, which means someone was going to sleep on the sofabed. The problem is, the sofabed was horrible. It was like sleeping on a toolbox covered by tissue paper. In other words, agonizing. I certainly expected better for almost $350 per night. We're talking New York or Miami luxury suite prices, and this room was like a furnished garage compared with a luxury suite. As if the sofabed weren't bad enough, a delivery truck outside my door woke me up at 6 a.m. and continued to make an incredible amount of noise for 25 minutes. Before I knew it was a delivery truck, I actually called the front desk to report that someone was trying to break into the room next door because it sounded like a hammer against metal. Confronted by all of this, the manager was highly apologetic and said that deliveries were normally made after 9 a.m. in order to allow guests to sleep in. He said he was as surprised as anyone that the truck had arrived so early today and made so much noise. He gave me a discount on the room. But he had no explanation to justify the torture of the sofabed, which he claimed was relatively new. The only bright spot in this stay was the staff, which was friendly and helpful -- especially the guy at the bike rental desk. In short, given that the hotel is far from the historic center of Key West, I consider it vastly overpriced for the level of comfort and service that I received, and would never recommend it for a family of four. At best it only justifies a 3-star price and only for two people who can share the main bed.

Tropical atmosphere with a covered outside bar which has ceiling fans to keep you cool. A great place to hang out.

Otherwise a car is needed. The staff was very helpful and friendly. No slow local attitude at the front desk. A couple of annoyances: The air conditioning (that worked well) was very loud, as if it had a super sized fan blowing in the air. Also, the plantation shutters on the window let hallway light into the room when closed at night. There were no curtains to make the room pitch black. I would stay here again.

This hotel provides an excellent buffet breakfast included with your room. Food choices were varied and very good. Definitely take advantage of this feature. There is no other restaurant on site.

Our room was on the back poolside of the complex and was very large and worth money on Key West standards. The outer rooms did look a great deal smaller, and watch not to get rooms to close to the busy road. The positives of our stay were the room, very helpful front desk dudes, huge resort style pool, giant breakfast bar, nice Tiki bar, and free parking. The negative would have to be only that it is too far to walk to the Square, but there are several other options. They have bike rentals on sight (plenty close of enough to all spots of interest by bike), Old town trolleys stops in the parking lot, and the actual City Bus (2 dollars) stop is just about 100yds up the street(look for the sign).

The continental breakfast was average - waffles, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, cereals are some of the items I remember. The pool area was very nice. The chairs were arranged to make you feel like you were at a private pool. There was a tiki bar (only open until 7 PM); the bartender wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too friendly. The Duval street is not far from the hotel, only a couple of minutes by car. I would not walk. There is also a many franchise restaurants and grocery stores nearby.

The first is cleanliness and overall appearance. The Fairfield Inn is situated on busy Roosevelt Boulevard about 2 miles or so from Duval Street. That is fine if you have a car, but when utilizing public transportation, the bus stop is on the opposite side of the road and walking there is dangerous for there is no sidewalk on the side of the hotel. The hotel is painted in bright Key West colors and the hotel lobby is comfortable and nicely appointed. The room was clean and brightly painted as well, but nothing to write home about. The bar was the highlight of the hotel because it appeared handsome and sleek with its dark wood table and white panels. The pool is a huge free form, but a little gaudy with numerous shell statues (12 to be exact) around the edges spitting water into the pool. The pool depth remains fairly shallow at all ends, probably no more than 4.5' deep. The second thing I look for is customer service. When we entered the hotel lobby we were greeted by a young lady who took care of our reservations and the gentleman behind her gave us two cups of strawberry slush to welcome us. That was a nice gesture because it was sweltering outside! They young lady also gave us valuable information, like what time sunset was and where the best place to watch it was and a map to get there. From there we needed extra towels at one point in the stay and it took over twenty minutes for anyone to come after we had been told they were, so we called the front desk and cancelled the request. Lastly, perks. The hotel serves breakfast which consists of english muffins, bagels, oatmeal, yogurts, cereal, breakfast sandwiches, juices, coffee, tea, etc. There are newspapers for you to peruse as well as a fitness center on site, which we did not use. We did, however, use the computer in the small business center which was helpful. So, I would say that this stay was \"eh...ok\". Why? I really wish there was some water pressure coming out of my shower head. The water saver seems like a great idea, but I wonder if I would have stayed so long in a shower where the shower head actually had pressure. Maybe, maybe not. Also, logistically getting to our room was awkward. Wish the layout was more natural. And I really wish there were sidewalks on that side of the street!

The hotel will provide detergent free of charge for you if you need it (we had our own), and it costs a straight $1 per load to wash and $1 to dry (amazingly, not just for 10 minutes like you usually get in a laundromat, but depending upon the size of your load, up to 45 minutes drying time!)The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The front buildings seem new, but the back two buildings have the look of an old 1950's motel that has been repainted and remodeled. We stayed in a room in one of these buildings -- very small room. I mean VERY small. However, it was clean. The \"courtyard\" pool was also nice, and seemed new. The \"tiki bar\" left something to be desired -- especially the bartender. He seemed a little bothered most of the time, and didn't seem to enjoy his position. Would've also been nice to have a waitress circling the pool, taking drink orders. Parking was OK at the hotel, but it's lack of proximity to Duval St. meant driving downtown and paying at least $10 per night to park there. Breakfast was normal Fairfield Inn fare.

The property is off the beaten track and easily located. Our first impression was that we were not going to enjoy the Fairfield Inn. However, the building where you checkin was very nice and the desk clerks very helpful. The pool was very nice and the lobby inviting, so we figured that we would be OK. We were assigned a suite on the first floor. However, the first floor requires stairs/elevator--not good for persons with physical impairments. The Fairfield Inn has exterior corridors, which presents safety issues. Upon entering the unit, we were shocked at the cavelike atmosphere. Not only was the \"suite\" extremely small, but with very low ceilings and little light, it had a claustrophobic feeling. The bedroom was decent sized, with tile floors and a king bed. The bathroom was huge--especially considering how small the room was. The pie shaped \" living room\" had a sleeper sofa and built in refrig/microwave. The problem with this arrangement is safety. Not only is the sleeper sofa near the entrance, but right above it is a window on the exterior corridor, making it easy for child snatching . Also of concern is a fire issue---with the sleeper sofa opened, there is no way to walk around it in the event of a fire. Because of the safety issues, we checked out of the Fairfiled Inn . The desk clerk, Kelly, was very understanding and gracious and offered to move us.

Oh, and the pool! such a wonderful and enjoyable area around the compound. We found the rooms to be very cozy, the beds were comfortable for being away from our own bed at home, and the housekeeping cleaned everything. Checking out was also a so very simple.

They served the apples, bananas, cereal, bagels, toast, yogurt, waffles from the make your own waffle maker and jimmy dean breakfast sandwiches to microwave. Everything was well stocked and fresh thanks to my favorite staff worker, Barbara from Georgia. She greeted everyone good morning all week and when my son had a waffle sticking problem, she was glad to help. Also, the breakfast dining room is outside and under a large covered area next to the pool. It was a great way to start the day. The housekeeping was great except that they did forget to clean our room once but the next day management came by to check on it. Also they did a good job of keeping up with the sand from the beach everyday.
