When we checked in we were asked to make our breakfast booking there and then which was served between 6 and 8.30, we said 8.30! They asked \"would you like tea or coffee and would you like a boiled egg\". I waited for the rest of the breakfast list but that was it so we duly ordered our egg.(they know how to live it up in London). After our evening out we stopped at Janet's Bar which is attached to the hotel but not owned by the hotel I don't think, for a night cap. This was an odd bar with a friendly if slightly eccentric owner and the place became very busy around midnight, but had a great atmosphere, so good we stayed until 2am. The next morning there was a knock at the door and a shout of 'breakfast is ready'. We somewhat groggily got up and dressed to go and find the dining room only to find on opening our door a tray on the floor with 2 cups of tea some cold toast and the infamous boiled eggs. We found this very funny and giggled about this and the whole Brompton experience for some time, it still makes me chuckle now..but I dont get out much.

Carpets were terrifyingly grimy and presented a depressing picture on entering the front door to face the first of many dirty flights of stairs. I would start by stripping all the carpet out, and replacing with a dark colored runners on painted wooden steps. Most of room furniture was cheap, didn't fit the room properly and was often broken in some way. Again, a minimalist look would be much better. Ditch the blankets and ugly bedspreads for a duvet and cover that can be washed between guests. Carpet was digusting and needs to be replaced with something that doesn't hold all the breakfast crumbs and spills since breakfast is served in the room. Bathrooms looked reasonably new, but had all kinds of operational problems. Glass shower door didn't seal at all, and the duct tape repair job looked even worse, besides not working. The floor ended up with a lot of water on it no matter how hard we tried. The real tragedy is that this is a primo location - right next to V&A, Natural History and Science Museum and South Kensington Tube Station.

Even after waiting for 1,5 hours still nothing. That's when we went back again to the reception to request for a different room again, which we got, room 507, in a different part of the hotel.

The location is great- around the corner from the South Kensington tube. But the hotel was not much better than a hostel. The bathroom was tiny and the door would not stay open. The toilet barely worked; the shower was in need of repair. There is nowhere to have breakfast- they bring it to your room.

We had to ask for extra towels because both rooms allocated to us had only one towel available for guests per room. The continental breakfast was a joke, consisting of a boiled egg & two slices of toast each with tea or coffee. AVOID the bar located on the ground floor of this hotel (Janet's Bar) We paid over \u00c2\u00a310 for one small bottle of beer and a small glass of undrinkable cheap wine.

The headboards were ripped and stained, the beds themselves narrow, saggy, and uncomfortable, with pillows the thickness of pancakes. The couch was also ripped and stained, and the carpet was too creepy to walk on barefoot. On one of our two mornings there, there was no water in the bathroom. For over 2 hours. And although we were paying for internet, it was a very weak signal and kept coming in and out. We finally couldn't handle it anymore and had to switch hotels; we gave them 24 hours notice but they refused to refund us, saying they needed \"72 hours notice.\" 72 hours? Are you kidding me?

Our room, a supposed 'Deluxe Triple' was dreadful! It reminded you of poor 'student' accommodation. The furniture was old shabby and very dated, the carpet was dirty, the fridge in the room was full size and old, it was noisy and very close to the bed. Wallpaper was hanging off, paintwork was filthy. Most worrying and very unsafe, were plug sockets hanging off the walls. There did not appear to be an obvious alternate fire escape route, except the main entrance and no fire regulation information was displayed in the room. Probably the most annoying thing of all at this hotel was the noise in the early hours of the morning. It sounded like 'freshers week', people chasing each other and shouting. Do not be fooled by the lure of its location, although it omits to mention that it is sandwiched between shops, bars and right on the junction of major traffic lights. Yes it's very near the tube station, but so to are many other high standard hotels which on inspection actually deliver what their web sites say!!!!

That's it! No choice at all. And most of all...DIRTY rooms, DISGUSTING bathrooms, and BUGS! I stopped four nights, and had to change rooms three times. First room was so indescribably filthy I refused to sleep in the bed at all - ripped the cotton sheet out, placed it on top, and slept under my own shawl. The decor: stained, grubby, gritty carpet full of spill marks and fag burns; floral wallpaper from the eighties with stains and marks all over it; bedhead and wall lamps thick with dust. The net curtain at the window was black, it was so dirty. There were accretions of brown grime in all the corners of the bathroom, and only lukewam water would come out of the faucets. The room adjoined the disgusting 'Janet's Bar' (a gloomy little shack under separate ownership, but next door) - and they held 'singalongs' until 1 - 2 a.m. Every word was audible thorugh the paper-thin walls. I got NO sleep at all. I could not check out because my friend was also staying in a separate room, and she had flown into the country to see me. So I insisted on moving room. Second room was also grubby, shabby, dusty; but not noisy. Found BUGS crawling on the bed. I have captured one and am sending it to Environmental Health. I suspect it to be a cockroach.
