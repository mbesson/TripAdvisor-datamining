It is in a great location, has very comfortable beds and a good bath / shower. Check in was quick and easy and the staff member was very friendly. We did an express check out which was also hassle free. However...parking is ridiculously expensive at $56 per night. We stayed in a club room with access to the club lounge. The lounge is fairly drab and uninspiring although the service for evening drinks and canap\u00c3\u00a9s was excellent and staff friendly. Compared to other executive clubs we have been to the canap\u00c3\u00a9s on offer at the Westin were not as good. A few negatives about our room. The bathroom has a big glass window looking out over the room. While it is OK during the day ( you can drop the blind), at night if someone needs to use the bathroom the lights wake you up. Our room still had rubbish near the kettle from the last guests. Finally the most disappointing aspect of our stay. Unfortunately I left my cleansers in the shower ( expensive products) and I phoned the hotel as soon as I realized I had left them. I was told that if housekeeping found them they would be logged and the staff member said he would call back. I did not hear from them and when I called back was told nothing was found. I definitely left them in the shower so I can only guess they were either thrown out or pocketed by housekeeping. Although they apologized they weren't really interested. Such a shame that a beautiful hotel is so greatly let down by poor service. We will not choose to stay at the Westin again.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Okanagan Falls, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCENTRE OF THE CITY\u201d", "Author": "akmacca", "ReviewID": "UR128308314", "Content": "I stayed at the Westin Sydney on business for two nights. I was impressed with the Central location as it was close to everything Sydney offers. I had asked for a room in the Heritage wing but was told that none were available. The check in was quick but impersonal. A bank of fast lifts awaited to take me to my room on the 16th floor. The room was above average size and contained a few ammentities you wouldn't find in a lesser quality hotel. Even though I was on the 16th floor I had no view at all, my room looked out on office building and the scene was bleak. The queen bed was very comfortable and was well-stocked with comfortable pillows. A large flat screen TV filled the wall at the end of the bed. This is by far the largest TV I have ever encountered in a hotel room. The standout feature was the bathroom which was oversized. A large bathtub filled one side of the bathroom whilst the other side was taken up by a shower stall and separate toilet. The bathroom ametities were of a high quality as were the bathtowels. The room was fine, my biggest gripe and a continuing one with staying in large cities was the cost of ancillaries. Parking was expensive as was internet. The room service fare was broad but the cost inhibitive especially with a $8 room delivery charge.

Even though the Westin is part of the Starwood Group of Hotels, which is part of a large, global corporation and the hotel is geared more towards business travelers (my opinion), I cannot emphasize enough how cozy/homey and sincere the staff was and has been with regard to attitude, attentiveness, professionalism and anticipation of my individual needs. 3.

There is a health club (gym) which we used during our stay....some advice if you wish to use the health club...avoid the peak hours 5-7 pm as office workers nearby use the gym after work. The hotel is in a good location, next to Sunrise Channel 7 studio not far from the main shopping precinct Myers and David Jones, and Circular Quay/ Opera House. There is a post office right in the same building which you can buy bus tickets. Tip - there is also a free bus 555 that does a circuit around the city. Look out at the bus stop signs as they indicate if 555 stops there. We had dinner at Mosaic - food was excellent and presentation was good too. The hotel has a lounge that is very popular with the business community in the evening. We had a few drinks and it was very relaxing. Check out was so easy. We received a note in an envelope and we were asked to sign the form if we were agreeable with the charges listed. Just put in the security cards and drop off in a box or give to reception as you leave. No queue unlike some hotels that we had stayed in the past.

Mixed feelings about our stay at The Westin: The room was on the small side but adequate as we don't spend much time in there. We loved the beds, very comfortable with a good supply of pillows. We loved the lifts, fast and prompt. We loved the free wi-fi in the lobby downstairs and wished it could be extended to the rooms. We loved the rain shower in the bathroom although the diverter is quite difficult to operate. We hated the room decor, stainless steel and glass, sharp corners everywhere, not to our taste. Glass panels with glass doors in the bathroom, can't be closed quietly, the bathroom counter is too small for use and the washbasin is designed to splash water all over the counter if the taps are turned on too strongly. A couple of outstanding negative points: The electric kettle in the room is dangerous, it has a small steam outlet exactly where ones thumb goes when lifting the kettle with a normal grip. After being burned twice I learned to pick up the kettle with an abnormal grip. The other point concerns complimentary water: two free but small bottles of drinking water are provided but are hidden away from view in the closet. But on the bathroom counter in prominent view where other hotels leave their complimentary drinking water, there are two inviting bottles of water with an invitation to \"stay hydrated\". Unfortunately, the $7 charge for each bottle is printed very feintly in tiny letters, seen too late ! Water for purchase should be located more obviously in the minibar, this comes across as an underhand marketing trick. Talking of underhand, a charge of $1.50 as a donation to Unicef appears apparently automatically on the room bill. When questioned, the cashier informed us that there should be a note in the room inviting us to donate, no such note of course. No-one would begrudge a small donation to Unicef I am sure but does it have to be done in such an underhand way ?", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cPOOR VALUE FOR MONEY\u201d", "Author": "AUSSIETRAVELADVISER", "ReviewID": "UR127214369", "Content": "I was disappointed with the assessment of Westin Hotel Sydney shown on TripAdviser. That said, what is right and what is wrong with the Westin? On the positive side the hotel is centrally located and is very convenient for persons doing business or going shopping in the CBD. In these cases, location may well outweigh the negatives and a stay of only one or two nights may be acceptable in a room which is not up to standard. Also on the positive side is the service provided by the concierge, Ron. He is as good as any I have experienced anywhere in the world. On the negative side, we found that the hotel was unsuitable for a couple spending 5 nights on a holiday in Sydney. So what's wrong? First is the size and standard of the rooms. Be aware that rooms are not all of the same size. Despite being a SPG member and having booked an executive room, we were allocated a tiny room which would not pass muster in a 3 star hotel. Next is the spartan decoration of the rooms - the top 31st floor at least is in need of urgent refurbishment. Compared to other 5 star executive hotels, both in Sydney and worldwide, the room standard is not up to scratch. We requested a move to another room but were told that this could not be accommodated for another two nights. Why not when other guests were arriving and being allocated larger rooms? I can only presume that the hotel plays hard ball on its frequent stayer policy and they get first preference - farewell Westin your policy has lost you two regular visitors to Sydney. Next is the limited refreshment serviced provided in the club lounge. The limited choice of canap\u00c3\u00a9s and other refreshments is a disgrace for this standard of hotel. the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is also in need of refurbishment and there is a safety hazard with an unmarked small step adjacent to a number of tables located near the widows. Finally, don't be taken in by suggestions that the upper rooms have views. The so called views are of offices and buildings. If you want the views that Sydney is famous for then stay at the recently renovated Shangri La, or the Intercontinental, or Mirvac's Quay Grand Suites. Our other disappointment was to find that we were trapped for five nights with a non refundable room rate. Perhaps that is why we were allocated a small room in the first place. If we had the flexibility we would have moved after the first night. In summary - if you are staying in Sydney on holidays then, for a similar price for an executive room you will be better served at the Intercontinental or the Shangri La hotels.

The buffet breakfast was very good - not the best I ever had (Grand Hyatt, Jakarta, for that), but, like everything in Oz (even if it is at the Westin) it isn't cheap. A$42.00 is waaaay too much! It left me cold (both times) because there was no atmosphere. Even the staff are, for the most part, as cold as the sandblasted stone in the atrium. Coldly efficient, yes. Yes, I would stay there again, it is a comfortable place to stay if you can get a decent rate, but I sure as hell wouldn't be going there if I was looking for any warmth or atmosphere, so not likely my choice for a vacation stop.

Lighting is good for those who would like to do some work in the room. I had better time working on the desk here than at the Sheraton on the Park (see my review to compare).

I got used to it after a few hours and thought it made my stay a bit more unique.

Furthermore the hotel entrance gets cluttered and it isn't readily clear wether you are entering the hotel or an office block. The open plan layout in the lobby is done very well although it reminds me too much of a shopping mall, more Westfield than Waldorf if you know what I mean. The rooms are fabulous! Very comfortable bed, incredibly well done bathrooms and a superb eye for detail. I flinched when i read the price tags associated with the room service menu, but this is not a bed and breakfast. The most disappointing aspect of the hotel is the spa and fitness facility. This appears to be contracted out to the gym in the same block and subsequently to get to the pool you need to leave the rooms, cross a bridge over the 'Westfield', walk past other hotel rooms (the ones that get disturbed by the gym), find a lift, go to the 4th floor, go up a short flight of stairs into the gym, walk through the gym, up another flight of stairs, cross a gym floor, walk through a laundry room, past another exercise room, up another flight of stairs and find you left your goggles in your room.

I used to say that the Sheraton the Park was my choice of hotel in Sydney. Now it is the Westin. It really is a fantastic hotel, world class. There are so many things to like about it that you are unlikely, even the worst room, to have a bad time. * Quiet rooms. Is the location good? It depends. If you are interested in a view, with the exception of the city views that come from the higher floors, there really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one. There are many hotels with great views including the Sheraton on the Park (those rooms facing the park), the Four Points (those rooms facing Darling Harbour), the Marriott on Circular Quay (all the high ones, and those looking towards the Opera House), and also the The location benefits for the Westin are the mid-city location. Being on Martin Place, it is not far from anywhere, including the shops, the Hyde Park, Circular Quay, public transport (Wynyard or Martin Place stations), Darling Harbour. It is also pretty quiet. It has plenty of local areas that are good to go for a walk or run in the morning too. What is the room like? If you book or are lucky enough to get a heritage room these are absolutely tremendous. They are very large, some enormous. I actually prefer these from all of the standard tower rooms that I have stayed in, though none of these are bad! They are well appointed and reasonably fresh, with very nice bathrooms. All rooms are sizeable and easily useable, with nice desks, chairs, TV, places for luggage etc. I love the showers in particular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rain fall shower heads are fantastic. But are the beds comfortable? The Westin Heavenly beds are quite good. They are all the same in the Westin brand, so you know what you are going to get. What was the food like? The food, whilst expensive, is absolutely top notch. I regularly stay with an included breakfast rate and the quality of what is on offer exceeds anything I have had at a hotel. The staff are very attentive, and it is a really pleasant place to dine with a large selection of papers on offer. I have also had room service. The quality again was very high, but it is very pricey. There are plenty of restaurants in a short distance walk that the concierge can point you to. Was it quiet? Yes. Having stayed quite a few times I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found the hotel to be free of most noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it takes some effort for the neighbouring rooms to create intrusive noise. Anything special? There are some special things about the hotel: * The heritage facade and elements of the General Post Office are really nice. It is interesting to see and explore, particularly in the heritage area (which is also where the gym is located). * The staff are really good. I am offered water and towel on return from my morning walks, and nothing is too much trouble. * The right newspaper is delivered to your room, when you ask. * The photos in the heritage corridors of the post office history are really interesting, and worth a wander.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201c2 Sides\u201d", "Author": "MLORD13", "ReviewID": "UR126258283", "Content": "I have stayed at the Westin Sydney 2 times in March 2012 and both were acceptable.

The large marble and glass bathroom was a luxury spa which was separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. Enclosed within the glass wall was an automated blind that went up and and down for privacy. The room was immaculate, spotless, and very quiet which allowed us to sleep like babies. The bed was super comfortable and encased in luxury sheets. There were two complimentary bottles of drinking water which were re-stocked every day. Our rate included breakfast buffet at AUD $38 for two per day. Breakfast was served on the first floor restaurant which was just magnificent and breathtaking with its domed glass roof. There was a vast array of fresh, delicious breakfast selection which made it very difficult to eat just enough - we wanted to taste everything! The muesli and fresh baked bread were to die for. We have traveled quite a bit and stayed only at hotels and B&B's highly recommended by TripAdvisor. I can honestly say that Westin's breakfast is so worth what we paid for. The location is very central. We took the train from Sydney airport which took 15 minutes before walking about three blocks to the hotel. The hotel is located on the corner of Martin Place and Pitt Street. We walked everywhere - to Darling Harbor, Chinatown, Paddy's Market, Botanic Gardens, Opera House, and Circular Quay.

I read a review suggesting going down the basement food courts at any of the shopping malls near this hotel. We weren't disappointed!

Not finding it, I called the hotel operator who told me that it was electronic, on the TV. This turned into quite a hassle. To find out a detail which might take a few page flips from a folder, on the TV one had to navigate through various menu choices (guessing some of the time), and often getting it wrong as the delay between choice and response was pretty slow. May sound a small thing, but by the third time I gave up and simply called the operator for information. A place like the Westin shouldn't construct these type of hassles. Would have been a 5 rating without this. No wi-fi in the room, only hardwire internet for $20/24 hours. Not the most expensive I've seen, but another small irritant.

I called to report the findings and someone was sent up right away but instead of coming with cleaning supplies to remedy the issues, she came to investigate. She then left and returned with the cleaning supplies.The in and out and the fact we could not freshen up in our bathroom for thirty minutes was mildly irritating. After the cleaning person broke the shower sprayer and called maintenance to repair it, I insisted we be moved to another room. The wifi was not available in the rooms (500.00/ night?? - puhleese) so we had to trek up to the 28th floor where we experience an incredibly slow connection. We did not have better luck in the \"business center\" on the 6th floor -- a windowless room not much bigger than a small walk in closet. The last gripe is when I requested no maid service for the duration of our stay. They told me that they would oblige the no service but that an agent would have to come by daily to inspect the room -- they said for \"security and well being\" -- what??!! When I pressed them on this I was patched to the manager who just reiterated the mantra \"security and well being\" with no explanation. When I pay over 500.00/night at a hotel of this caliber I expect some privacy. Let me say we were two Americans traveling with a ten year old child. Security? Really? AMERICANS TRAVELING WITH A CHILD IN SYDNEY. Other than these annoyances, the views were lovely, the beds Westin comfortable, and the service in the Club lounge quite nice. The staff we encountered were friendly and accommodating and the location of the hotel was good although I would have liked to be closer to Circular Quay.

The hostess with the complimentary danishes kept walking past me over and over offering to other guests and not me for some reason and I was famished. I thought that was just tormenting me. When a Hotel knows they are at capacity and they know how many guests have booked a bed and breakfast package they should be able to anticipate how many staff should be allocated to serving breakfast / clearing tables etc.. and also perhaps ask guests to indicate a time for b'fast arrival.

The room was large, with a separate lobby area with the bathroom off to one side and a small walk-in robe on the other. The bath was fantastically oversize and there was a large walk-in rain shower. Toiletries were high end. The main room was large with 3 Georgian style large arched windows. The bed was heavenly. The old stairway in this hotel was a location in the movie The Matrix, and makes a great photo location. This hotel is in walking distance from may of Sydney's attractions - the Rocks, the Opera House, Art Gallery, Circular Quay and the CBD shopping district. I searched around for prices before booking through the hotel's own site - it had the cheapest rates. A couple of tips, the restaurants under the hotel are overpriced (we ate at two, maybe the others are better?). Internet connection in your room costs extra which is a bit strange for a classy hotel, however we picked up the free wi-fi from the Lobby from our inward facing room .", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bathurst, Australia", "Title": "\u201cStunning, amazing, brilliant~\u201d", "Author": "tabras", "ReviewID": "UR124333998", "Content": "The Westin Sydney exceeds all expectations and reputations.

However, it was lovely - spacious and light, clean and comfy. The bathroom was very nice and the bathroom amenities were great. The bed was very comfortable and luxurious. It was nice to have a iPod dock. The only fault in the room was there was some noise through the night - sort of like metal clanging, but duller. It was hard to pinpoint where it came from and it was irregular. When we stay overnight at a luxury hotel, we like to spend an afternoon by the pool and spa to relax. So the Westin was very disappointing in this regard. The pool, as previous reviews have pointed out, is quite a walk away from the Tower rooms and it's in a gym. It's like going through a rabbit warren to get there. And it is a very small pool, in an enclosed area with zero atmosphere. There is no spa bath, but there is a steam room in the change room, where the atmosphere is not really conducive to relaxation. I suppose they don't claim to be a 'spa' but a health club. The hotel location is excellent if you want to explore the city. The service and food at Mosaic restaurant, where we went for dinner, was very good. There are lots of restaurants at the basement level, which we would have tried if we stayed longer! Breakfast at Mosaic was good too - nice selection and eggs made to order. Check-in service was courteous enough and we didn't really deal with any other staff apart from that as we did the express check-out, which was very easy and convenient. We probably wouldn't go back because of the lack of pool/spa facilities, but I would definitely recommend the hotel if that doesn't bother you.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "BaltNj", "ReviewID": "UR124299230", "Content": "Great hotel, more geared towards business travel.

We stayed here for the 2012 new year's celebrations. The hotel was clean and more importantly, so were the rooms. The staff was friendly and professional. Very helpful to us when we had questions about where to go and what to see. The SPG club lounge was also great. Quite full \u00c2\u00a0each day due to the holiday weekend. What was great was that when it was too full, they would send you down to the restaurant downstairs which had a much better selection of food.\u00c2\u00a0 This hotel would get a five star overall rating from us and if we could rate it a 4.5 we would. However, our only complaint was the lack of wifi in the rooms themselves. Wifi was restricted to the lobby or the club lounge - which was so inconvenient. Anytime we needed the Internet, we had to go all the way downstairs. When you're tired, sometimes you just want to get ready for bed and curl up with your iPad with wifi - not have to trudge out of the room each time you need to check email or Skype. I don't know if this is true or not, but a staff member told us that the hotel does indeed have wifi capabilities within the room themselves - but that they turned it off for the holiday weekend due to capacity issues with all the travelers. Again, I don't know if this is true or not. But if it is, I would think that was a \u00c2\u00a0very poor decision for the hotel to make just to save a little cash on bandwidth. Other than the wifi issues, this hotel is pretty close to the circular quay, the rocks, and other tourist spots to see.

Overall, I was very pleased with the standard of the room and it's cleanliness, with the only criticism I have being a bit of mildew in shower grouting and a 'sour' smelling shower curtain. Fairly picky but I do like a spotless bathroom and I do believe this should be a given at any 5*. This was the only fault I could find with the room though and I loved the soft bed with fresh white linen and soft fluffy white bath towels. The best thing about this room was the absolute quiet, no traffic noise! This was due to the room opening onto the covered central atrium and the quiet is a trade off with the lack of any view however, having stayed in much noisier rooms at other hotels in the CBD, I'll take a peaceful night's sleep over views any time! We had a night cap in the hotel bar and as you would expect, quite expensive but very pleasant and relaxing service (so pleasant I recall the young Asian man that served us drinks was named Jason and he was absolutely delightful despite it being near the end of a long shift and he was a credit to his employer, thankyou) Breakfast was fairly average in variety but acceptable (excellent poached eggs though) and service was pleasant.

It was modern, warm, welcoming, beautifully furnished and had every possible luxury and amenity you could think of -I could and did stay in it for hours and enjoyed the ambience and the comfort that it provided.

Service was professional and courteous to a fault with staff going well above and beyond what was required of them to meet my needs and provide me with a wonderful experience. The concierge was especially helpful and knowledgeable with a depth of information that he was able to give me almost immediately nearby shops and restaurants My only complaint was the exorbitant rate this hotel charges for Internet usage. I realize that most Australian hotels,unlike most of their American and some of their European counterparts, insist on charging for Internet usage from their rooms but $24.00 per night is way too expensive even given that. Nevertheless this fact thankfully didn't detract from my stay here for anything other than the first night and certainly the one disadvantage did not cancel out the huge benefits and the great pleasure and privilege of staying here.

The exquisite architecture and warm interiors are mixed with modern and luxurious amenities. The hotel is built upon the landmark Sydney General Post Office constructed in 1886. In 1996, the building was sold, and refurbished, and turned into shops, offices and the Westin Hotel. The Lobby & Check-in : The lobby is grand and welcomes travelers from all over the world with traditional and comfortable furnishings. I was greeted as soon as I arrived by the bellman and felt very welcome. He took my bags and showed me to the Starwood Preferred Guest Check-in line. The check-in process was simple and quick. I had two reservations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one paid and one reward reservation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the hotel combined them for me and ensured I could stay in the same room the entire stay. Upon checking in, I was told about the Executive Lounge, free internet access (due to Platinum Status) and Westin Workout options. The Room: Wow! What else can I say? I was upgraded to an executive room with a king bed and it was spectacular (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure the pictures do it justice!) The room was modern and bright and made me feel at home. From my room, I could see the clock tower, which is beautiful, and had a great view of the city. The room had a king sized bed, desk and gigantic bathroom. The bathroom had a large soaking tub and separate shower. The wall separating the bathroom and bedroom was glass and had an electric curtain that could be raised and lowered as needed. I absolutely could have moved in and felt right at home. The room had wired internet connection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no wireless in the rooms. The room was very clean and housekeeping came by in the evening for turn-down service refreshing the towels and bottled water. Executive Lounge: The lounge was very nice, but very crowded. There was free wireless internet in the lounge and therefore there were always people (including me) on their phones and iPads and other devices. The appetizers were platted and served by the staff - so you were stuck with what they gave you. The appetizers were pretty, but not to my liking. There was cheese and veggies available for self-service. All drinks were complimentary and also served by the staff (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). While the staff was very friendly and very accommodating, it was a little odd to have to ask for a bottle of water or apple juice every time I wanted one. The hotel: A block from Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central shopping district (Pitt Street Mall and ueen Victoria Building), close to all major attractions and with easy access to public transportation the hotel is in the perfect location for visitors (business and holiday alike). The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant is overpriced and service is poor. I arrived on Christmas Day, and there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many dining options. I had a Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken and a coke and with taxes my bill came to $48. The salad was good, but expensive (I should note that the coke was $6.) Under the hotel are a variety of restaurants and shops \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however none of them were open during my stay since it was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and then everything was closed the day after Boxing Day because it fell on a weekend. I found myself walking down the street to the Pitt Street Mall and enjoying the restaurants and Westfield Food Court for most meals. Overview: I loved the Westin and will stay there any chance I get.

Mulitple choices of pillows No in room wifi for free is correct. We had to go down to the lobby and hang out for a bit with our Ipad if we wanted to check our email or find a good place to eat. The hidden spot is the biz center so no one seems to use. Free computers, free printing. Don't bother asking the concierge on how to get around town via public transportation. They look at you as if you've sprouted three heads, the audacity of someone using some of the best public transportation in the world, something that is non-existant in the US. Note to all, its easy to get around, don't waste your money on taxis. Also, the concierge does have good suggestions for food if you want to spend around A$50 a person, less then that and they are clueless. Just use tripadvisor or urbanspoon for ideas. Location is not the best, but is near to public transportation. We walked several times to Circular Quay and it wasn't bad. Then found there are free buses that go that way, oops. Hotel is actually in the middle of the CBD so is easy to get to anything. We wouldn't hesitate to return, we also stayed at the IC during the visit and it doesn't compare at all to the Westin ...", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201c3 days in Sydney\u201d", "Author": "smokyharry", "ReviewID": "UR122019636", "Content": "From the first friendly face helping with our bags and parking our cvar, the service was first class.

When I went down stairs, I was made to wait a very long time, only to be told that there were no other rooms. They did reduce the room rate and gave us breakfast. But still this was not the experience I had booked in here for. In the morning I checked what else was available in sydney only to find out that there were other room at the hotel, so when I called, I got the same lie that there were no other room. When I called them on the lie i was told that they could upgrade us if I was prepared to pay an additional $40 dollars per night, which was still $30 less then what I had actually booked the room for and was prepared to pay!! So I was really been ripped off given the room they had placed us in by $70 per night according to all the calculations. They did move us, finally to a Starwood floor, and to a room with a view.

I have stayed here numerous times and for a variety of reasons (business, when I was dating my wife as a couple and now with our three young children). This is the best hotel to use as a base for exploring Sydney. You are an easy walk from either Darling Harbor or the Rocks / Circular Quay (main ferry terminal / major train stop), and of course you are in the heart of the city for business. A few tips: - There is a dining area downstairs in the Post Office building with a variety of ranging from quick food to fine dining; there is even a great wine / cheese room - yum and romantic! There are neat things to see down there (old bank vault, 'caves' and a neat archeological area) - Just down the block is a Cole's supermarket at King and George - can stock up on food and has a nice wine section (get the Nobel One desert wine and thank me later) And a few more tips for traveling with little ones: - The lobby is great at 3am when the kids are still on US time and you want to let your wife sleep - lots of fun things to see and play on without disturbing (many) people - The dining area downstairs in is just so-so for little kids at lunch, but they do enjoy seeing all the neat things. I believe at night kids are not allowed at all. What I have done is ordered take away from the pizza place (very nice pizza) and then either run the kids to the grocery store to pick up a few things or just let them have fun going up and down the escalators - See the tip above about the grocery store. You can pack light on diapers, etc... and stock up there once you arrive at reasonable rates - We used points for the last stay and for an extra 2,500 per night you can get a bigger room which is worth it - For things to do in Sydney make sure you hit the aquarium, Darling Harbor is so-so but worth a bit of time, the Opera House tour is a lot of fun, ride a ferry (Bondi makes a fun day with a playground, the beaches to see, lots of neat places to eat), and the zoo is a must see. There are tons of good parks for letting little ones have a run around and a picnic, ones to try are Wynyard Park (a few blocks from the hotel, lots of places to buy take away including Subway); the Royal Botanical Gardens are huge, have great views of the harbor, great plants, a nice cafe and of course the BATS which kids love; and Hyde Park is gorgeous with the Archibald Fountain, neat birds and lovely views of St Mary's.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England, UK", "Title": "\u201cSecond visit - still very good but....\u201d", "Author": "shearn", "ReviewID": "UR121154077", "Content": "Second stay at the Westin in Sydney following a 2 week stay in late 2008.

Our initial room was not up to standard (the mattress smelt of stale urine - not pleasant at all for a 5 star hotel) which was very disappointing but to be fair on the staff - and this is where they excel - Carly Stone took on our concerns and upgraded us to a Deluxe Tower room for no extra charge. She also arranged for chocolates and fruit to be delivered to the room which was a nice touch. Our new room was on the 18th floor and was much better overall and in line with our stay three years ago. However, similar to some other reviews, we did feel that there was a lack of experienced staff overall and the concierge desk was nowhere near as helpful as last time. Also the cost of breakfast and dinner was ridiculously high although part of this is down to the weakness of the english pound compared to our last visit. We ended up at nearby Vivo (cafe) every morning for breakfast which was excellent. Overall, would we stay again when we are next in Sydney? Probably not but the Westin is still a good but not great hotel in my opinion.

I called Service Express at least 10 times, and they always pick up on the 2nd ring or less--they must have a big staff responding to customer needs. Big star in my book. 2) The rooms are exceptional. I am in the tower (I think), but the bathrooms are big and well done (lots of glass), the desks are workable, and the beds comfortable. 3) The workout facility is--bar none--the best I have ever scene. It is a full scale facility with well maintained equipment and everything you could expect. They must have had at least 30 pieces of cardio equipment. 4) The food is well prepared and very good..and delivered as ordered. 5) The property itself is beautiful and the location is amazing. You can easily get to any of the attractions by walking as well as access to amazing shopping and open areas. 6) If you have club lounge access--it is well stocked and the food is excellent--and the folks that work there are extremely nice and helpful.

Again, I am pleased to report that even while checking-in before the normal hour, I was accommodated We stayed in a well-appointed Executive Club King on the lounge floor/SPG floor. Our room, just as with every other time, was spacious, and all of our needs and requests were met throughout our stay. One of the things I appreciate about the Westin Sydney is that the rooms which we've stayed have 2 rooms together tucked inside there own separate foyer, thus providing an additional feeling of privacy. Also, I have never heard passersby in the hallway, as I do in many other hotels. The room's color scheme and tone adds to a feeling of calm and relaxation. Some people don't like the setup of the bathrooms; I like them. And, if you want more privacy, there is the automatic black-out shade for the window between the tub and room area. The choice in shower heads is nice, especially the rain feature. And I find the scent of the white tea aloe to be soothing as well. This was my first time using the lounge. In comparison to other hotel lounges, it is on par. Light breakfast options are served in the morning, access is provided throughout the day (w free wifi and non-alcoholic beverages), and canapes and drinks are served from 6-8P daily.

A wonderful hotel that cleverly mixes new with the old. Built at No 1 Martin Place in the old Sydney GPO building, the Westin has transformed the historic site, whilst keeping true to her original uses. For those who prefer the more subtle, homely hotels why not choose to stay in the heritage rooms, built in the historic part of the GPO building, or if your like me, book one of the Tower rooms/suits. These rooms, with wall to ceiling windows and bathrooms that have beautiful city views, or overlook the famous Martin Place will simply amaze those people looking to see, stay and play in Sydney. Yes there are the hotels that line the beautiful harbour with views of the Opera House and our iconic Harbour Bridge (if your traveling def do the bridge climb, either as the sun is rising or at sunset, there is nothing quite like it). But you will never find a hotel with beds like the Westin, and I know what the weary traveller is in desperate need of. After walking around all day, and exploring all night you need a great nights sleep. Simply... heavenly. You are located in the centre of Sydney, with beautiful restaurants down stairs, and if you are into shopping we have Burberry, Armani, Louis Vuitton, and for the girls Tiffanys and Cartier only footsteps away (plus we have our newly refurbished Westfield shopping centre filled with every amazing clothes shop you could imagine, anyway go just to see the design of the place, it looks fantastic), why not see a show at the state theatre or Capitol theatre, visit some of the best restaurants in Aus- Bilson's, Tetsuya's, Est., Marque or why not head over to Surry Hills, the melting pot of Sydney's very best food and wine bars, think SOHO in NY or a little San Francisco. While at Surry Hills, pop over to Oxford St and enjoy the night life, or dance the night away in Kings Cross (for those who like to party hard). When I choose to stay in the city, I choose the Westin, the service is tops, the views a great, the bathrooms are beautiful and the beds just amazing. It is what all hotels should be like. It puts a smile on my face each time I go to Sydney. I have stayed in many hotels and this has to be one of my top 3. So no matter where you choose to stay, promise me one thing...

Leaving the taxi, our bags were taken by the friendly concierge staff at the properties entrance and we were directed to reception for checkin. As it was just after 9am in the morning we were expecting to leave our bags so we could explore Sydney while our room became available, we were all quite surprised when we were told our room was ready, we were also directed to where the hotel facilities were such as the gym, business centre and restaurants. After telling the man at reception our plans over the long weekend he provided us with maps and \"best route\" ideas to get to our destinations - excellent customer service. Our room itself was on the 23rd floor a Starwood Preferred Guest floor (we aren't actually members of that group) and was located facing the clock tower of Martin Place. Don't be concerned about this, though the clock tower chimes every 15 minutes we hardly noticed it. The room was spacious and luxerious, lots of complementary items and bottled water, we especially liked the rain shower like fitting in the bathroom and the \"heavenly bed\". Upon our ventures out to explore Sydney we were always greeted with smiles and offers of umbrellas to brave Sydney's rainy weather, the business centre though small and tucked away was hardely habitated and free printing was handy when wanting to print our boarding passes to fly home. Even as Sydney explodes with people on a Saturday night we remained comfortable and safe in the area we were in and a chance meeting with Pat Rafter and Bernard Tomic while in the elevator perhaps confirmed to us that this property must be good.

This was my first stay at the Westin, although I have been to Sydney many times. This was a bit of a treat as I normally stay at more moderately price hotels. I paid $355 per night for a deluxe tower room through the hotel website. This was the cheapest available price and it was pre-paid. The entry to this hotel is very low key. I realised I had walked past it many times without even knowing it was there. The taxi drop off area is woefully small and crowded. My taxi couldn't get in and I got dropped off int he street and walked in. No problem but if you had a lot of luggage or it was raining, I guess you would just be stuck in the queue for a while. Actual check-in for me was very quick and pleasant but the reception desks are quite small and there were sizeable queues at other times. My room was on the 23rd floor. The room itself was very pleasant. Larger than standard, with great bathroom (see through from the bath, though with blinds), and very large windows. While the view was nothing special, I loved the light. A couple of niggles. the first was the appalling size of the wardrobe. It was the smallest I have encountered in a hotel. See the photo. What full height hanging space there was was taken up by the iron and ironing board. I just fitted in a suit. If there were two of you staying for a little longer, you would be stuck. There is no excuse as there was a wasted space next to the wardrobe that could be used to double the size. The work desk was also badly set up. Maybe I am odd, but I like to watch telly while working and that was impossible. I had to manhandle the desk into a more convenient spot. Also there were only two, quite cheap and uncomfortable chairs. There was plenty of room for something better but the only comfortable place to sit was the bed. The bed was great as other have commented. the final problem with the room was no wireless Internet at all. Broadband was available but @ $24 for 24 hours (should always be free!) and it was slow. There was supposed to be wireless broadband in the public areas but I could never connect. These are relatively minor niggles but could be easily fixed and should be. The room was serviced efficiently and quickly. All the staff were efficient and pleasant. The public areas and the rooms are nicely decorated and the hotel is very centrally located. I did use room service and the food was very pleasant, though very expensive - $80-$90 for three courses. The only other problem was that way too much food was provided. A smoked salmon starter must have had at least 500g of smoked salmon. An unusual complaint to get too much, but I certainly couldn't eat it all.

Rooms: We stayed in a Superior room using points for both stays. We were in town for special events away from the hotel, so time spent in house was to relax and sleep! Decided not to pay extra for an upgrade to an executive room. We had 26th floor both times which was fine. D\u00c3\u00a9cor was fine, see pic. Large king bed area with wide screen TV. Bose side radio. Side high back chairs, desk with lamp. Bed was to die for literally\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6hard to leave it in the mornings. Pillows wonderful. Bathroom was clean marble/frosted green glass, nice walk in shower, large soaking tub all behind glass with electric roman blind to hide away. Bath products fine. Robes in the hanging closet. Fair sized hang space with the usual things. Safe included. Mini bar/fridge etc, offerings, all very expensive. Do yourself a favour and avoid it! Try the Quality Cellars beside the Menzies. They have all tastes in wine from $15 to $200 plus. Coffee plunger. Hot water jug and sachet coffee/tea as well. Food: In-house not bad for the price. We did indulge and it was great, especially when the last night laziness creeps in! Depending on the reason for your stay, this Hotel is a good one. Location is central, and as a guide a AU 7.50 cab ride gets you to most other central areas including Circular Quay. Hotel access drop off can be a drama, but the HC drivers we use and taxis know about it Overall, a great place. They do have a LOT of conventions here, so the main foyer areas can be noisy on weekends. Retreat to the deep tub after a long afternoon.

It is at One Martin Place at the cosmopolitan CBD heart of Sydney. During the weekday you are surrounded by the busy and glamorous suits and high heels of corporate Australia. On Saturday there is a buzz around the glamorous high end shops surrounding the hotel. On Sunday, well it really all feels a bit dead as the CBD empties and its hard to even find a coffee until later in the day. Try and get a room looking over the old GPO clock tower. Our room was above the tower and gave a great view over the clock, towers and glimpses of Sydney Harbour and the North Shore in the distance. The lobby of the Westin Sydney shares an atrium with retail and eatery areas. The lobby has always felt to me like a bit of a thoroughfare, but a very grand one at that. Desk staff are Westin professional and of a world class standard. The lifts whisk you up into the tower of beautifully decorated muted colours and blonde wood highlights which are a recognized signature of Westin these days. The rooms are comfortable, but not as big of some of the Westin rooms. I believe there are larger rooms in the lower sections of the Hotel. Large windows reveal the great view, a glass wall into the bathroom lets the great vista in. The bed is heavenly and comfortable as always and the room palette of brown and blonde is very pleasing with a fresh and contemporary feel. The silver fixtures glow and make for a light filled room. The bathroom is spacious and the rain head shower is great. The hotel is in affiliation with the corporate gym next door which fills a couple of floors of an old building. The gym is cramped and the pool is too small to exercise in and located at the wrong end of a rabbit warren of corridors. The exercise facilities really are a weak point of this hotel. The service really is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Express\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and nothing is a problem for the well mannered yet slick staff. I have eaten at the hotel restaurant before and was pleased. The barmen also mix a mean cocktail.

With the price we paid, we thought it was very worth it.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cElegant combination of old and new\u201d", "Author": "SB488", "ReviewID": "UR115201802", "Content": "Although we live in Sydney, we stayed overnight at the Westin because we attended a function in their ballroom that night (Testra NSW Business Awards). We decided it was easier to go upstairs after the function - allowing us to eat and drink as much as we liked - rather than catching the train home. It was also an opportunity to spoil ourselves. The hotel is in a modern building behind the old GPO (Sydney's main post office) which is a sandstone structure dating back over 100 years. In the redevelopment, they retained the facade of the old building and created some interesting spaces around the hotel entrance foyer. When we were checking in, they upgraded us to a very nice room on level 25 overlooking the GPO. On this floor, there was a sign near the lifts saying \"Starwood Preferred Guests Floor\" and so I guess they upgraded us because we are SPG members. From our room, we could see the GPO clock tower with the Australian flag on top . We also had a good view of the buildings down George Street and Pitt Street leading down to the Harbour. The bathroom area uses glass screens. The screens for the toilet and shower are opaque but the window between the bedroom and bathroom is clear. Our porter told us that this is so you can lie back in the bath and watch the TV in the bedroom. If you need privacy, you simply lower the blind. There was a broadband cable internet connection in the room (for a fee). I didn't need to use it because I didn't bring my laptop with me. They offerred free WiFi in the hotel foyer area but not in the rooms. Nowadays a lot of hotels also have free WiFi in the guest rooms because most people have iPhones (or similar). Breakfast was on level 1 (just above the hotel foyer). The restaurant overlooks a large open space between the new building and the internal walls of the old GPO structure. Although it has the feeling of a large atrium open to the sky, there is a glass roof to keep the weather out. It's a charming location to have breakfast. The buffet breakfast had a very good range of options to choose from. The hotel is as central to Sydney as you could possibly get - right on Martin Place near the Cenotaph. It is within easy walking distance of shops, theatres, department stores, Circular Quay and the Rocks. We drove our car into the city on the Friday afternoon and drove home on the Saturday morning. It was a good feeling to be able to drive up to the front door of the hotel and leave the keys with the porter to park the car in their carpark under the hotel. We enjoyed our night at the Westin. It is everything that you expect a five-star international-standard hotel to be.

Pros: The location is great; close to Circular Quay (10 min walk) and Darling Harbour (10 min walk), with the new Westfield Sydney and almost any store you could want less than 5 min from the front door. The hotel is also situated on top of quite a few different restaurants (sushi, spanish, steak, greek, etc), the two of which we tried were very good. The suite was very spacious with a bedroom, lounge, bathroom and walk in robe. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bath incredibly deep. The service provided by every single member of staff we met was fantastic. From check in, to an emergency laundry requirement, to getting a beer in the bar at midnight (the two incidents unrelated), nothing was a problem. The service request phone, where you just push one button regardless of your needs, is a great idea. The executive club had a great view of the city and provided good service both at breakfast and later when we returned for complementary canapes and drinks each night. My wife used the Endota day spa one day and felt it was the best spa she's ever had. Cons: The pool is almost impossible to find without taking a GPS. It is situated within the health club next to the hotel who, we felt, were not happy with the concept of hotel guests using their equipment. The coffee in the executive club is machine made, not barista made and, consequently, doesn't give you that wake up zing in the mornings.

It was served beginning a very early time, even on Sunday, which was very helpful. They had every type of fruit I could think of and more. The only real negative was that because it was a holiday weekend, the fitness center hours were very limited. I am used to the Westin gyms being available to hotel guests on a 24/7 basis with the room key. This gym must belong to a third party and the Westin guests only have rights to use it. There is a sign in the room to bring your own towels to the gym so they don't charge you for a towel. This was very disappointing to us because we left the hotel before the opening of the gym and returned after the closing. I don't remember exactly, but it seemed like it was only open between 9 am and 5 pm or possibly even fewer hours. Very limited for a hotel even on a holiday weekend.

My first experience in 2009 was not too good. This time, the Westin really came around and stepped up to the plate. I'm a Starwood Gold Preferred Member, and it always means a lot to me when my loyalty is valued and recognized -- which they did. Since I arrived early, my room was not ready and I had expressed how tired I was and would just prefer a room ASAP to sleep. I was assigned a room at the end of the hallway on the 8th floor (not a Starwood Preferred floor), which was the best they could do at that point. However, it was next to the elevator motor room, which was quite noisy. I requested a change in rooms the next day, and was placed on in room 2215. This was definitely an upgrade -- spacious, a Preferred floor, etc...I was MUCH happier. The staff was friendly, responsive and efficient. Also, I am very thankful to housekeeping for making an exception by providing my room with a full service rather than turn-down at 8PM; it was very considerate of them. Prior to arrival, I had requested a nice bouquet of flowers (protea), which was delivered in beautiful fashion. Also, I had scheduled the 2-hr men's indulgence spa package, and there was a little confusion there. No one had informed me that it would take place in my room. The massage therapist was late; and, although very nice (and talkative), I prefer to relax in quiet when I have a massage. I asked how long this person had been licensed and was told 2 years. I think, for the Westin, a massage therapist with more experience (and based on a price of $310AUD), is necessary. I also found it uncomfortable when she had requested I fill out her review in front of her. Because of that, I was not honest when I filled out that form. So, I hope management will look into that. Since I was having such a great time with my special someone (btw, the bathtubs are GREAT for a romantic interlude with your partner), I extended my stay and reserved a tower deluxe room. The hotel upgraded me & I remained in the same room, but was offered a comparable room with a different view. I decided to stay put, so I didn't have to pack, etc. For this trip, I intentionally chose the Westin, as it's centrally located. I've also stayed at the Four Seasons & Intercontinental, but those are nestled in Circular Quay, and I wanted to be close to -- rather, IN -- the CBD. At the Westin you have quick and easy access to all the best shops, museums, the gardens, etc. There are a number of great restaurants in the basement level (I'm most partial to \"Prime\"...if you like steak, but they have many other types of food, too) The decor in the lobby is chic, yet comfy and brilliantly complimented with brightly-colored flower arrangements. The rooms are, on the whole, spacious, also comfy and understated. I love the partitioned bathrooms with the opaque, aqua-colored glass doors to the bathroom, shower stall and bathroom closet.

Several days before my planned check-out, I spoke with the front desk about extending my stay for another 4 days. At that time, I was told that I could do so for the same rate all but one day on which the hotel was booked full. I was fine with that, since I was actually planning to be somewhere else that night and was only keeping the room, so I didn't have to pack and check out. Well, on the day I was originally supposed to check out, the housekeeping staff told me she was surprised that I had extended my stay, since their records showed me leaving. I called the front desk right away. After some time, they called back and confirmed I could stay the current night and that they would look into the other nights (thought this was just a formality). Finally, they called me back to tell me that I could indeed stay those nights, but that the room rate went up by $500/night. They also seemed to doubt my story about reserving the a few days earlier, stating \"we have no record that it occurred.\" This is outrageous!

Yes this hotel is indeed filled with smarty dressed business types, however this is not a tourist class hotel so I don't see a issue. Some people think that the lobby is a little cold and sterile, but I have to say that is why I like it. I like the clean lines and the big cavernous uncluttered space. The rooms are quiet, very large and the bathroom are beautiful. It is a quiet hotel all round and this is important to me. I still think that wifi should come standard in all 5 star hotel rooms for free, but this is a rare thing, and unfortunately Westin charges $24.50/day (that's why the 4/5 for value). Room service is prompt and tasty (although I have to say one of the most expensive I have come across). The lads that deliver the meals are also very friendly. I ate at Mosaic for most of my breakfasts and one dinner. Food is pretty good, only complaint is that the service could be snappier (that's why the 4/5 rating for service). Ate once at the lobby bar, also pretty good food there. There are lots of restaurants at the GPO (yes they are pricey) and the surrounding areas.

Easy. These words - astronomically appalling. I have never been treated with such contempt. It started the moment we walked in. The Westin Hotel in Sydney is pretty enough, but for the price we paid it should have been extravagant. Unfortunately for us, we weren't dressed as other patrons of the hotel, say in a suit and tie and were immediately frowned upon. Check in was a disaster. At 9am when we arrived to drop off our bags, we were told the room wasn't paid for and that they'd have to check with the person who's name was under the booking (unforunately he could not make it due to medical reasons) that we were supposed to be checking in. This is protocol and we were fine with this. They told us to ring back at 11:30. We rang and nothing had been sorted. We came back at 1:30 to check into our room again and it was not ready, nor could we again check in because of the missing person. We had to go through the entire 15-30 minute process of the morning's saga again. We were told that everything would be fine and we could pay the account on check out. The room was not ready until 2:15pm, that is, that we could enter it because it was finally clean. They did not offer us a porter to our room, we asked. They also didn't tell us where the gym, pool and any dining facilities were including where we would be eating breakfast in the morning. They were only concerned about money and not us as guests. The hotel bathroom is beautiful and everything is clean and neat, however, the beds require more pillows (three pillows for two people?! Why?). We ordered room service that night - they forgot part of the order and it was cold. Breakfast the next morning was delicious, but we were ignored by staff the entire time. My friend watched on as he sat patiently waiting for a refill in his coffee, as the staff went to every other table with patrons and gave them refills and never returned to us. It's the little things that count. The cleaning lady was especially good. Wished us a good day, asked if there was anything she could do. The front desk staff could learn from her. The next day we received a phone call at 4pm saying the account had not been fixed. There was no emergency in the woman's voice. We said we'd sort it and no more was asked or told to us. At 1:30 in the morning when we got back from Marti Gras we found our cards weren't working in the lifts, when we asked at reception we were told that we were not allowed into the room until they had a credit card with enough limit on it to suffice the bill. 1:30am. To get your head around this, we then had to call our sick friend (who, by the way, is sick because he is getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer) at this time in the morning to sort out the bill. He didn't pick up. When I asked why they didn't ring him in the afternoon, they stated that they didn't have any contact details. He booked online, he is a star privilege member of the chain of hotels and they'd rung him TWICE the previous day. No details huh? Asked what would happen to us if we didn't have a credit card, the night manager replied that we wouldn't be allowed back into our room where all our possessions and belongings were. Luckily for us (or perhaps unluckily?!), I happened to have a credit card available (the others do not) and was ESCORTED to our room to retrieve the card and escorted back down to the hotel front desk to place on the bill as a back up in case our sick friend did not pay account. By the time we got back to our room and asleep it was 3am and this was after we kept ringing our friend and his wife and doing the HOTEL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S job to get the account paid. This could have been handled so differently. The manager could have said, \"I'll give you a ring at 7 and you can come down and fix it up then.\" They thought we weren't supposed to be there and we would run off without paying. That was what our whole experience was about. They honestly thought because we didn't look like their usual clients, that we'd abscond without paying. Way to judge Westin. The next day we missed breakfast because we'd overslept. Check out was uneventful. Our friend had rang up and abused them over the phone. We never received an apology, a thank you for staying or a warm smile. Everyone on that front desk needs to pull the stick out of their bottoms and greet people with warmth, not robotic insolence. We paid to stay at that hotel and we treated with such disrespect we might as well have been fleas on a dog. When we received the bill they charged it to my credit card, not our friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and charged us for an upgrade that was free. They couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get that part right. I haven't written everything that happened, only major (and a few minor) events that all bundled up made for a cataclysmic diaster of a weekend holiday. The only reason they can give for this? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protocol. Get some compassion and empathy. If everyone ran a business with the service they have, we'd be a third world country.

The room was beautifully decorated in a minimalist design with fine bed linens and a selection of pillows. We had a large wide screen TV and comfortable arm chair with footstool. The bathroom consisted of a wonderful deep bath tub, separate shower and separate toilet all encased in tinted green glass and marble. We were provided with plenty of soft towels and quality bath products. We found the staff very helpful and check-out prepaid eliminating the need to queue. Breakfast was included in our package which was amazing value and one of the best we've had in a hotel anywhere. The waitress even made me a pot of Earl Grey leaf tea without additional cost, it arrived almost immediately (in a nice teapot) and with a smile and offer to make another. The hotel is in a great location close to shopping and restaurants. The only negative comment I could make would be the cost of the valet parking which was $56 although the charge covers 24 hours and we left our luggage after check-out and did some shopping. Since our package (booked through the hotel's website) was generous we did not resent the parking cost and understand parking is at a premium in the city.

I parked the car nearby and caught a bus to the hotel. Initially, it was hard to find the entrance from Martin Place and then difficult to access the reception and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much easier to get to the reception area from Pitt Street. The reception service and attitude were both ok on check-in. I was allowed to check in during the morning, before the official check-in time. The room looked to be of a good quality and reasonably large. It had a wide and spacious design with soft traditional carpeting throughout. There was a separate area for the storage and wardrobe. Unfortunately, the curtains were not of the full block-out variety and still let in some light. The TV was a large LCD and had a good channel selection available. There was also a dvd player provided as well as a Bose clock-radio-iPod player, where I had difficulty operating the iPod function. I called the helpline and a technical staff member quickly assisted with my problem. (It turned out that the volume on both the iPod and the player had to be turned right up in this case.) The couch looked very comfortable and proved to be. There was the master switch on the side of the bed which was successful in turning everything off. The switches in the room were all of the soft-touch variety, meaning that it was pleasant to use them. Despite the bed being a Westin Heavenly, I find that whether beds are heavenly depends quite a lot on personal preference and, in my case, I found the bed a little soft and perhaps not the best when combined with the firm pillows. A soft bed with softer pillows also would not work well in my case. The room looked out over the clock tower and had a good view of the Sydney CBD area. The bathroom was large and had a nice and large rainshower as well, which was pleasing to use as it had strong water pressure. Apart from the rainshower, the other shower head seemed to be quite difficult to adjust between the different types of water streams. The bath itself appeared large and of an ergonomic design, it was certainly quite comfortable to lie in and it took a short time to fill with water, relative to most other hotel baths. However, despite the generally good design and layout of the room, the furniture was not of the highest quality and was looking a bit worn. The wood used was not solid and it was hard to open a few of the cabinets and drawers. There was no hardcopy of the room directory but it was stored on the hotel system, which could be accessed via the TV. I asked the reception why there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hardcopy provided and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to respond appropriately because they wanted to know what I needed. Instead, they could also have pointed out that it could be accessed through the TV as well (which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know at the time). The public areas of the hotel were just as nice as the room itself with the lifts and hallway being quite nicely appointed. My room was set back from the hallway, which helped with reducing noise levels from the corridor and certainly there were no noise problems during the stay. There was quite a large security presence in the lobby during the first day of my stay and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why but it could detract from the enjoyment of that area. I tried the room service once, where I had the shiitake mushroom udon noodle soup. The service attendant was very friendly. The dish tasted very authentic and was probably as good as could be expected in a high-quality Japanese dining establishment. It cost A$40 just for the small bowl so seemed overpriced and the hotel had also included a delivery charge. However, these prices would appear to be standard in the higher-range hotels in Sydney. I was also able to try the gym and swimming pool, both of which are not housed within the hotel itself or owned by the hotel but are part of a separate chain in another building which could be accessed internally through the Westin. It was quite a long walk from the Tower superior rooms, as I had to walk through the hallway housing the Heritage rooms before getting to the gym. The gym seemed to me to not quite be a complete gym with the full set of equipment as far as gyms go but still seemed more extensive in equipment than most hotel gyms. The swimming pool, on the other hand, which was also connected to the gym was quite small even by hotel standards but I think it was heated. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is right in the financial district of Sydney so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably not the best area for rest and relaxation, particularly during the weekdays. However, the hotel is still close to the main tourist spots. It was a good first stay in a Westin and prompted me to try the Westin in Kuala Lumpur later, which was also a good experience which I will review later.

The location is fantastic and the room was beautiful. We upgraded to a tower room overlooking the clock tower and the bathroom was huge. Unfortunately the service at this hotel leaves a lot to be desired. I use a handkerchief to clean my glasses with lens cleaner. One morning I used it and left it on one of the night tables to dry off. We left on a day of sightseeing and when we returned my handerkerchief was gone. It was a cloth handerkerchief..it is impossible to think it was a tissue. I notified the front desk and talked with the assistant manager who told me he would contact housekeeping and get this taken care of. Well basically he told me that the maids denied ever seeing the handerkerchief and that they didn't know what I was talking about. So no more handerkerchief. That same night I asked for fresh towels to be delivered as I had a shower before dinner and wanted the old ones to be removed and replaced with new ones. We went out to dinner and came back about an hour later. Two bath towels were sitting on the bed and the used wet towels were still sitting in the tub. I don't understand why someone would leave the towels on the bed. You pass the washroom before getting to the bed why wouldn't you drop the towels in the washroom and remove the old ones? Anyway another phone call to Service Express and it was done 30 minutes later. I was also very upset when I had to ask for ice to be delivered as this hotel does not offer ice machines and the employee bringing the ice actually expected to be tipped for bringing ice! Another night I again ordered fresh towels and went to dinner. When we got back from dinner the towels still hadn't arrived (we were gone for more than an hour). I called Service Exp and got the same person I originally ordered the towels from who confirmed that she definitely talked to housekeeping and arranged for the delivery. She told me that she would alert housekeeping and call me back to confirm that the towels were delivered. Well after 45 minutes the towels were still not delivered. I then went to the front desk and talked to the assistant manager again. All he did was apologize and after I tore a strip off him made sure my towels arrived in under 7 minutes. The lobby is huge but very poorly air conditioned. The restaurant is mediocre. Everything at this hotel is ridiculously expensive.

The Westin, Sydney is lauded as a 5-star hotel. Based on my experience with hotels in general and in Sydney, this particular Westin falls short of that status. If it is a 5-star hotel you're expecting/seeking, I recommend you stay at the Four Seasons, Shangri-La or look into some of the great boutique hotels that are popping up (depending upon the nature of your trip and the amenities for which you are most partial). To put into perspective: I've also stayed at the Four Seasons, Intercontinental and the Sheraton, Darling Harbour. The hotel definitely gets bonus points for its location (George St. is a prime place to be & Martin Place is decorated quite nicely for the holidays). For anyone who has been to NYC, the location of this Westin is almost like being a couple blocks from the studio of NBC's \"The Today Show\" (Rockefeller Center) re: Sydney's equivalent, \"The Sunrise Show\" (Ch. 7). Shopaholics, armed with an AmEx Platinum or the like, will be in heaven (QVB & shops around George -- great deals @ Haymarket). The Royal Botanic Gardens, museums, Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Opera House, the Rocks, etc. are all easily within walking distance. That aside, and being a Starwood Gold Preferred Member, what was advertised as an appealing room (to me), was mediocre by Westin standards. My membership status, room preference and potential perks were ignored and were not applied. There were multiple tech problems that had to be fixed. The room was so bland and sterile looking that I actually sent out for a bouquet of brightly-colored flowers! On a better note, my stay, with my boyfriend at the time, was romantic in nature. The tub was adequately-sized for us to relax and comfortably unwind together with some champagne at the end of the day.

This is a good thing for customers because when businesses compete, the products improve. The Westin Sydney (hereafter WS) is a prime example of a hotel that does not stop trying in order to retain its position as one of the finest business hotels in Sydney. Though it was not a perfect one, my last stay here was one where I could witness these efforts in all corners of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family. One thing to note for those who have not visited Sydney is that the WS is located at the heart of Martin Place. This is the center of the CBD where you can reach Circular Quay (Opera House, The Rocks, Harbor Bridge) or the Darling Harbor (Aquarium, IMAX, King Street Wharf) by foot. In terms of location, I would rate the WS above the likes of Shangri-La or Four Seasons (which are located closer to the Rocks) or even the Sheraton on the Park or Hilton (closer to Darling Harbor and Town Hall) as it is strategically located in between. Furthermore, being in the middle of Martin Place means you get to stay on a street with impressive history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the very building that the hotel is housed in is over 100 years old. It is no doubt one of the most prestigious addresses in Sydney \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if this is any indication, the hotel is side by side with the Macquarie Bank Global HQ. Service is exceptional in most cases but is surprisingly flawed in others. The staffs are generally trained well and it shows through the way they interact with guests. Most notable are those at the check-in desks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those who represent the image of the hotel as they are first ones to meet guests. They are cheerful and helpful and do not mind doing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 things if it makes its guests have a more comfortable experience. The service issues I had was with room-service. I had realized in the morning that there were no dental kits in the bathroom so I had asked for one to be brought up. This took the hotel forty minutes to deliver. If I was on business and had to run for an appointment, this would have been fatal. When it finally arrived, I told the deliveryman that it had taken much longer than I thought was acceptable, and that this should be taken as a complaint to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management. To this the gentleman who brought the dental kit shrugged his shoulders and said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSure, no problem. Whatever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and walked off. I was simply stunned that I stood there for a while thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what just happened???\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The other minor issue I had with WS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service was every time I called the service line. The hotel seemed to have incorporated a process to have the agent hang up on you once they think you are done talking. There were a couple occasions when I was not done when the agent still said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGoodbye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and hung up on me. I thought it was a given that these agents usually say something along the lines of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis there anything else I can help you with?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 before bidding farewell. Still, when these matters were shared with the management, they listened and took action immediately to assure me that these issues will not repeat going forward. I may not have been 100% happy, but having been given the assurance at a personal level by the management let me know that this is a hotel that does listen and care, and that my voice is one of value to the management. I would not expect these service issues to repeat itself for anyone else now. The hotel is a beautiful one as the design evidently tries to maximize the artistic blend of the hotel building with the modern comfort of the Westin brand. Mosaic restaurant is a fun place to dine as you get to dine in between the new tower and the old heritage building of the Westin. Service is superb. The lounge was a bit smaller than the ones I am used to but still provided comfort and a service level that was on par with some of the best hotels I have stayed in. There are hot offerings for breakfast at the lounge so make sure you stop by in the morning if you are at a club level. In all, this is a beautiful hotel, centrally located with great service (minus the small incidents) and a fantastic product that one would expect from a Westin. Add to this the willingness of the management to engage guests where there are issues, this is a hotel that I would not hesitate staying in again in the future.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service and location!\u201d", "Author": "StefK1", "ReviewID": "UR84579376", "Content": "We had a great stay at the Westin, room was large and the bed was comfortable.

However - when I arrived in a cab with luggage at just after midnight on a Friday, there were NO STAFF in the lobby even though it was busy with guests/assorted Friday night crowd. No bellboys - noone at reception and one unfriendly doorman who watched as I struggled with getting two large bags and a suitcase out of the cab, across the lobby and into the lift.

We were sort of thinking that we would have the same experience, however this is more of a Buisness travellers hotel, rather than somewhere to stay when you're on holidays with a family. Having said that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be reccomending this hotel to friends. The service was excellent. I was extremely suprised when I came back froma jog one evening and the concierge handed me a bottle of water and towel as I came into the hotel lobby (obviously I looked like I needed it:)). It's this type of service and help that sets the Westin chain apart from most of the others around the world. My only tip to families deciding to stay here is to get the Deluxe rooms. My wife, 7 month old baby and I stayed here initially in a Heritage Superior room and found it unbearably small with all of the luggage etc that goes along with a baby. We ended up upgrading to the Heritage Deluxe for the rest of our stay. This was 100% more livable and the staff were so helpful in heling us move. Nothing was too much of a chore for them...v.impressed!! Breakfast was great, we can definitely reccomend that you get this as a part of your room rate. It might cost more, but is worth it. Excellent buisness centre there. Internet, scanner & printer are all there and suprisingly free to use. We were going for our USA visa interview near the hotel, so needed to do some last minute (frantic) scanning & printing...was no worries here. Location was 100000000%. Just walked down to Circular Quay & the Rocks for dinner everynight. Reccomend a trip to Manly (via Freey) and also to Watsons Bay (Doyles Fish & Chips - best Takeaway). Only negative I can find is the views. I was told over the phone that all rooms had 'city views'. Now I took it that this was a good thing...I was wrong. City views means a view of the next buildings windows. When we changed to the Deluxe room the view was pretty good (looking out to Martin Place), so I can really reccomend room 322 if you want to have a decent view. Oh, one otherthing. Dont bet on getting a massage at the hotel. This we tried so much for and no spots were ever available. This was a bit annoying, but like I said, it's a buisness hotel and not a resort so we guess that the spa part isn't like the one in Dubai.

The bathrooms were pretty wild, but you have to love a shower that is big enough for a group and includes a handheld shower head as well as an over head rain shower. Overall the rooms were very nice. The beds are advertised as the \"heavenly bed\" and they are. The flat screen TV's are nice but pretty limited on channels. Luckily, we were not too interested in watching TV. The complaints are the ticky tacky things that are probably no big deal to some, but just annoying to us. No ice without calling \"Service Express\" (aka room service) for example. We had no idea how to even figure this out without a call to the front desk. When we called we were told all the information you would normally find in print in the room could be found on the TV. That's fine, but it would have been nice if we had been told that at check-in. It seemed like everything we needed required a call to the front desk or room service....sorry, \"Service Express\". One personal irk: I wish the high end hotels would take a tip from the Holiday Inn Express and SpringHill Suites type places and charge like a dollar more per room and give everyone free wifi instead of the crazy $13 to $27 per day fees for the few who actually pay that we saw this trip. You would think that 10-20 people at a time using the free wifi in the lobby would give them a clue.

It was located centrally in the Central Business District in Sydney. It's about a 5-8 minute walk to Circular Quay and a 5 minute walk to Daarling Harbor. The rooms are absolutely amazing and the heavenly beds are just heavenly. I had the best sleep of my entire trip at this hotel. Granted, it was our last stop for our tour around Australia and New Zealand but we want out with a bang. The cost wasn't as expensive compared to other Westins but you should still expect to pay over $200 a night, which is completely well worth every penny. We checked in and were escorted upstairs with a bell man. The bell man then showed us around the room and on top of that even came back after helping us with our luggage and gave us a map detailing out the restaurants recommendations we had talked to him about. The breakfast each morning at the Cafe was amazing. There was fresh fruit, smoothies, pastries, all types of food. The variety completely surprised me and the food was delicious. The lobby is large and spacious. You can also get free wi-fi for one day in the lobby which was nice. My only complaint was the concierge. I had gone downstairs to ask for help in booking a reservation at Cafe Sydney and though I may have been dressed in sneakers and jeans, I was given a snooty attitude and was glanced over as if I was questioned about being a guest at the hotel. I then asked for help in figuring out what to do on our trip there but there were no suggestions given. I had to request specifically for information and even then I was not given much help. Overall, I would still recommend the hotel minus the concierge problem. I didn't let it bother me but if you have high hopes on service then this might dampen your stay a bit.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "Alice_t024", "ReviewID": "UR67546286", "Content": "I have enjoyed the Starwood hotels (to which the Westin is one of) all over the world and was excited to see what the Sydney Westin had to offer.

Our first three nights were in an Executive Suite which was absolutely fantastic. The room had a good sized lounge, separate toilet off the enterance and a large main bathroon with a great view over the city. This room also included access to the Club lounge on the 28th floor. We had drinks here each evening along with canapes and a cheese selection. The breakfast in the lounge each morning was the best I have had in an executive club. It included a huge range of fresh fruits, pastries, cereals, espresso coffee and four decent hot selections. Everything was super fresh and well presented. The service in the lounge was great both in the morning and evenings. On the second night in the club lounge the waitress remembered my drink preference from the previous night. We stayed in a superior room for the last two nights as we used Starwood points for these. The shift between the rooms was done smoothly for us while we were out and they just updated our keys on return. This standard room is still far better than most in Sydney and as in all of their rooms, they still feel like new. You can pick this room up for around $AU140 on special over the off season which is superb value. Another nice touch is the free use of computers/internet to all guests in the business centre (hard to believe that most hotels charge for such a basic service). The Westin is one of the most central hotels to stay at in Sydney (along with Hilton and Swissotel) and it is only 5 minutes to circular quay or 2 minutes to the main shopping area. There are main train stations which head east or west within 2 minutes walk as well. The restaurants around the Westin are superb, and there is a fantastic steak restaurant \"Prime\" in the basement of the GPO building attached. We had a couple of great day trips out of Sydney that I would highly recommend. The first was the Jenolan Caves (about 3 hours drive) which were truely spectacular. The other was a horse trek along the beach and sand dunes at Anna Bay (2.5 hours north of Sydney) with Sahara Trails. An absolute blast for a complete novice (myself) and my very experienced wife.

I usually book a rate that includes breakfast. The Mosaic restaurant is a light-filled, bustling spot and breakfast is a cut above the average hotel buffet.

We had an Executive Suite on the 27th floor of the tower building with a living room with a two seater sofa, arm chair and flat screen TV and a corner bed room, again with a large flat screen TV and floor to ceiling windows on two sides. The bathroom was probably the best part of the suite however; with a large bath right next to the window offering panoramic views of the city and a large separate walk-in shower. The executive lounge on the 28th floor offered great service although food offerings were somewhat limited; breakfast in the lounge was good. We tried the Mosaic restaurant on the first floor for dinner one night and were impressed by the standard of cooking.

The room also had a complimentary safe which came in handy and was a nice addition. Shower facilities were great too. The room was very clean and modern. Complementary gowns were also provided. Mini bar facilities were also available. However, they were quite expensive for what they were offering. BREAKFAST We paid for a room rate which included breakfast in the hotel.

Tea and coffee was offered constantly and actually was very nice. The restaurant was large and airy and you also had access to free internet should you need it. Staff were always attentive and it made the experience overall pleasant. The Bar A very nice meeting place area. We had a couple of vodka and cokes one afternoon after a long day of Sydney exploring. We were greeted by a friendly barman who took and interest in us and what our order was. We were also brought a selection of nuts to enjoy. The only downside was the price of the drinks. For 2 Vodka and cokes and 2 Bombay Sapphire G and T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it came to an eye popping $60. Just bear this in mind if and when you go. A great spot for people watching though!

No one even says 'good morning' when you walk past.

The toilet is also in a separate cubicle which is rarely the case in a hotel room. The bed was comfy and sheets were very fresh & clean. Our only complaint was the pillows were uncomfortable- we were supplied with a duck feather pillow and another pillow which was very thick/puffy. Both of us had sore necks in the morning- the thick pillow puts your head at too high an angle, whereas with the feather pillow your head sinks down too low and there is no neck support. Admittedly we are very fussy with our pillows and rarely find a hotel that uses comfortable & supportive pillows! Breakfast was a buffet for $42 each, which is very pricey but we found it to be quite nice with a pretty large selection. There were a couple of issues however- the table we were allocated was uneven and rocking side to side as we ate. Also the coffee cup on the table was not clean and had lipstick stains & coffee stains as if it hadn't been washed. We complained and the cup was promptly changed. Also the coffee wasn't of very good quality- very bitter and burnt tasting. They seemed to just use one of those standard machines where you press 'cappaccino' or 'espresso', which was disappointing. We didn't use any of the hotel's facilities such as internet or pool, but we were happy enough with the check in/check out process and also our bags were stored for us while we did sightseeing before checkin at 2pm. We got a cheaper rate for our one night's stay, which we felt was reasonable for the quality of the room. I would recommend this hotel, especially for couples who want a bit of luxury.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cTop Tier Hotel - Bottom Tier Amenities\u201d", "Author": "GMKVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR52881202", "Content": "Wow, beautiful lobby and all.

The Westin is overpriced ($650US for week leading up to new years), understaffed (16 hours to clear the room of dirty dishes despite TWO requests?!), and the farthest thing from a five star hotel. STRIKE ONE: Despite astronomical rates, the hotel nickels and dimes you for everything. $30 internet per day (that's the reason you see all the refugees in the lobby using the free wireless); $45 mediocre breakfast brunch and the best of all - AN AUTOMATIC $8 service charge for all room service orders. Everytime I ordered milk for my 2 year old toddler, the bill was actually $11.50 because of the $8 service charge. RIDICULOUS! STRIKE TWO: The service is atrocious from the manager down. We do not believe in airing complaints on a website like this without bringing them to management's attention so they have an opportunity to rectify them; however, in the case of the Westin, two separate managers were indifferent to our complaints and explained that we should expect poor slower service during busy times. One went so far to say that we were lucky to have a room at the Westin and if we were unhappy we should stay elsewhere next time. Unfortunately this attitude is reflected in the concierge, bellhops, waitstaff, etc. STRIKE THREE: The concierges were absolutely useless. They had never heard of a bagel place one street away from the hotel; left out KEY pieces of information (e.g. you have to have a PREPAID ticket to board the bus); and were impossible to get a hold of (shortest time we waited to have the concierge pick up the phone was 12 minutes). STRIKE FOUR: There is no benefit to being a SPG member. We are gold members and were told that there was no upgrade available despite our friends being upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite that same day. We have stayed at 5 of Conde Naste's top hotels in the world.

While the Westin rooms and beds certainly live up to their high class reputation, the people working at the Westin fall far short. The price for room service was beyond absurd, as were the dining prices. Also, the concierge directed us to an overpriced and bland restaurant in the Rocks called The Rocks Cafe (granted, we've heard most restaurants in this area are overpriced though not inedible.). Another absurd upcharge was the internet service, which the Westin thought appropriate to charge us $30/day for. NB: if you are there for more than a few days, but a broadband card at the post office for $80, and a $15 card to pay as you go. Much better deal. We are using our Virgin Mobile card now. When we asked the concierge how to get to Kings Cross, he first suggested that we take a taxi, when the easiest way was likely the subway (aside from the fact that it was only a 15 minute walk to begin with.). Concierge had no idea what the cost of the subway was, or whether it was a good deal to get a weekly pass. Additionally, we asked a different concierge how to get to Newtown. He also recommended first, that we travel by taxi in a surly manner. After we insisted on public transit, he told us the wrong street to catch the bus, which also was two blocks away and incredibly simple to use. NB: get a weekly pass if you're there for more than a few days and plan to take public transit. it's $47 for the week, taxis are overpriced, and the pass includes trains, buses, and ferries all over the city. Great deal. We also requested that the concierge book us a reservation at a nice restaurant before we saw a show at the Opera House. He said he would do this and leave us a note confirming our table. Obviously this was too difficult of a task. Finally, our room was not properly cleaned until i called to complain after three days of terrible service. They did start cleaning the room better once I notified them. On a positive note, we have not slept better than in the Westin beds. The shower is fabulous, as is the bathtub. The room is spacious, and while we didn't have a view of the street, the clock tower was nice. Make sure to get a room on the 7th floor or higher, as you will not have a good view otherwise.

Comfy bed with very crisp linen that smelled fresh and not dry-cleaned as often is the case. Room was large and was in a good state of maintenance and was kept very clean throughout my stay. Bathroom - something I am very particular about, in addition to the state of the bed - was totally spotless. The illusion that I was the first and only person ever to use the room - the feeling one should get in every hotel - was helped greatly through perfect maintenance and cleaning. Dinner at the Mosaic restaurant was of exceedingly poor quality added to which the restaurant had all the charm of a very cheap basement canteen. My table was lazily cleared in a nearly empty restaurant - many tables had not been cleared - and I was left with a sticky and downright dirty table. Paneling next to my table showed food smears that had not been recently made. Upon request the waiter wiped the table (using the second napkin) but left it every bit as sticky. Breakfast the next morning in the same restaurant showed in daylight in what a poor state the restaurant was. Inquired about a la carte menu at breakfast and told there was none; discovered on third morning that there indeed was an a la carte menu - I advise guests to go for this instead of the vastly overpriced buffet. Internet access was an eye-watering AU$30 a day! Free access in lobby. Generally the hotel is in a very good location. A short walk from the hotel to Circular Quay (The Rocks, Sydney Bridge, Opera House) or Darling Harbour (good choice of restaurants); 24-hour well-stocked supermarket round the corner (turn right at exit, make a right at the first street and go down escalator on next corner - vastly cheaper than minibar); David Jones food hall down the street has very good and very affordable choices for lunch and early dinner. Underground about a block and a half away from hotel which allows for very easy, very quick and very comfortable access to the airport. My main gripe apart from the very disappointing quality of the food was the poor service. Check-in was frosty and even haughty by someone who evidently did not think it necessary to make eye contact. We all have our bad days so I did not think too much of it, but I had an inquiry the following evening and talked to the same person and her demeanor was exactly the same, if not worse. Her colleague at check-out was worse and even downright snippy: when my bill had been settled, the invoice had been tucked in my bag and I was ready to leave but still had to ask for my credit card, his response was a very angry \"in a minute!\". I ordered tea in the lobby and waited for 20 minutes before calling the same waiter again, inquiring about my tea. He seemed to have no recollection of my order and left. Ten minutes later same thing. When I finally managed to draw his attention for a third time (lobby was quiet, no more than 3 or 4 other people at as many tables - funnily enough, all seemed to be there for the same reason I was, free internet access) he still seemed to have no memory of my order placed twice. By the way, tea never appeared. Ordered tea in my room the next evening, still waiting despite a return call and order placed again. On balance a nice hotel in a perfect location, room was pleasant and comfortable and worth the price. Food was hugely disappointing and not worth half the price, if that much. Service was the issue that made me decide I will most likely not return to the Westin Sydney soon if ever. For a vastly reduced price I would advise the Hilton right down the road. Sure, smaller rooms and tiny bathrooms, but a vastly better breakfast buffet (included in price of room) and not half the aggravation due to bad service.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWorth it for the bathroom\u201d", "Author": "spiderpig01", "ReviewID": "UR52053445", "Content": "We stayed here for our wedding night in December.

We have been planning this trip for a couple of years. We flew in from Cairns last Saturday and the landing path took us right over Sydney Harbor on a crystal clear summer day. We have all seen travel photos of Sydney, but I kept saying that the actual views are more spectacular than any photo. The aerial view was breath taking. We stayed five nights at The Westin. Great location, amazing re-use of a very important Sydney landmark building, GPO. Service was indifferent, (I knew more about Sydney than the Concierge) the Heavenly Bed was polyester. Business Center was poor and not air-conditioned but the gym was first rate. I really think that staying away from Circular Quay gave us more of a feel for the City. The CQ is overrun with tourists and shops selling tourist crap. George and Pitt Street have all of the nice stores (David Jones food hall -not to be missed-wait for a seat at one of the counters for a well priced high quality meal.) Took in a play at The Opera House- $44 beats spending $135 for a tour. Do not miss the Sydney Architecture Walks (wed and sat) from the Museum of Sydney. These are a great way to learn about the history, politics, economics and of course architecture. Also took the Bonza Bike tour - was outstanding, a great way to cover lots of ground quickly- starts in The Rocks, follow the harbor around into the Observatory and then up and halfway across the Harbour Bridge -quick stop at a Rocks Pub and then over to Darling Harbor, ChinaTown and into Hyde Park-ANZAC Memorial, Hyde Park Barracks, Through the Domain, Potts Point, Botanical Gardens and Opera House. This was my highlight but I am a biker while it was the low light for my wife who was petrified all the time. The rides takes you through crowded pedestrian and vehicular areas and I would recommend this for people who are comfortable riding in traffic. We took many ferries rather than organized tours. Watsons Bay, not to be missed-walk along the sheer cliffs of the Heads-beautiful. Must walk along and above Bondi Beach and have a snack at Bondi. Ferry to Manly and walk to Shelly Beach and eat at The Kiosk. Manly Beach is a 2 mile crescent. Took Parramatta River Cat ferry just to experience the west side of the city. Another highlight-Sydney Harbor Kayaks, organized 4 hour tour of Middle Harbor from Mosman just under the Spit Bridge. Beautiful homes and unspoiled Park land all 5 KM from the Opera House. Middle Harbor was lake like for me, little boat traffic and totally protected from wind. Strongly recommend. Kayaking in Sydney Harbor would be reckless and crazy- unless you are very experienced-too much traffic. Took buses often- to U of Sydney-beautiful English like Quad worth the visit, Sydney Jewish Museum in Daringhurst -very well done and informative, and Surry Hills, away from tourists, a chance to see how real Sydneyites live. Funky but I found the street life lacking compared to SoHo in NYC. Food Recommendation: Pony in the Rocks- great meal. Ripples at Milson's Point. May be the best view in Sydney- is a cafe under the North end of the Bridge looking up at the Bridge and out at the Opera House. Food-so/so but view amazing. Shopping- My wife was not impressed. Stores all looked like NYC stores but more expensive. Same name labels. Very view things seem to be made in Oz so they are more expensive.

The window coverings were great, clock radio etc all easy to use, which is sometimes rare in a hotel. Cable channels were generous, acknowledging that there are female guests who don't want to watch sport. Bathroom was large and had lovely products. Hairdryer was great, not one of those cheap, small ones mostly used by hotels. The only two complaints I have was the size of room service meals - the quail breast, sorry chicken breast - they must breed small chickens in Sydney for a cost of $50 was about 5 mouthfuls. I think the cook trimmed it to within an inch of his life. All the room service meals were too costly, but standard for Sydney. Scrambled eggs in the morning were way too runny and had barely hit the heat, very disappointing. Other than that, no issues. Room cleaning for this hotel was a little below par, soap dish was never cleaned, nor used soap replaced. Sink etc were barely wiped.

Great location, central to most things in Sydney whether you're there for business or leisure. Approx 10 minutes to Darling Harbour, approx 10 minutes to Circular Quay. About 2 minutes to Wynyard station. There's a charge for use of internet in the room but there's a small business centre in the heritage building with 3 PCs and a laptop point - free for guests (access via card swipe). Caution: main hotel entrance is NOT in Martin Place as suggested by their address, it's in Castlereagh Street. Now the negatives! As with other reviews I did find the overall attitude by staff was somewhat unacceptable. Check-in was efficient but impersonal. My experiences at the Concierge desk however were generally good - helpful and polite, although when I wished to discuss a problem with a duty manager I was treated a little differently. The concierge on duty at the time seemed disinterested in my request and the duty manager treated me disrespectfully by keeping me waiting for more than 15 minutes whilst he checked guests in (despite having agreed to see me at a specific time). I gave in waiting and spoke to another duty manager later in the day who was apologetic but seemed unconcerned at the way I was treated. I expect to receive courteous, professional treatment wherever I stay because I'm a paying guest and not because I'm an SPG member. Equally so I will always treat staff with a similar level of respect. The staff overall were polite but you get the impression it's because it's their job to be polite and not because they want to be! The singular exception was a 'lowly' bell hop, who was genuinely warm and friendly. A previous reviewer complained about the long walk to the gym which amused me as I often wonder about people who visit my local gym and clamour to park as near to the entrance as possible to avoid walking further than necessary! It probably takes a minute longer to reach this gym than it would if it were integral to the hotel itself. The gym IS a public gym next door to the hotel but this means that there's a very comprehensive range of equipment available along with personal trainers (if required, at extra cost).

The property is certainly a flagship within the Westin brand and the combination of the old General Post Office and high-rise tower provides for interesting architectural contrasts and updated standards of luxury. Our room was quite large, the air conditioning strong yet quiet, the Bose music system pleasant to the ear, the lighting superb, and the bed and bath worthy of their \"heavenly\" moniker, especially the extremely deep soaking tub and the separate shower with both rainbath and hand showerheads. The room was virtually spot-free and the housekeeping service timely and efficient each day. Breakfast (normally $42 per person) was included in our special SPG promotional rate and was bountiful and of great quality, and the restaurant really showcases the architectural interest of the building. Food in Sydney tends toward the expensive side yet the quality of the meal is often unremarkable. Given that, we ate several meals at the casual restaurants in the bottom level of the hotel, even though they aren't directly affiliated with the Westin. Quite satisfactory pizzas and fishes can be had quickly for less than $20 AUD, and we found that a good option compared to food that was no better, but twice the time and money. Because I loved so many things about the hotel, I'm giving it a top rating, but I did have a few niggles: 1. The health club available to hotel guests within the complex doesn't belong to the hotel, and while the equipment was decent and plentiful, the steam room and change areas weren't of 5-star luxury status and the pool had been closed for an emergency issue. 2. I fully agree with other reviewer comments about staff attitude. Many were great but some were not. The concierge mentioned in an earlier review had a condescending attitude that was laughable and since it has been mentioned in more than one review, the manager should polish that up a bit. 3. I always get Hilton upgrades and never need to even ask, but I often have trouble getting the comp. upgrades with SPG. The young lady who checked us in didn't even mention my Gold status, and when I asked about the upgrade she simply responded that it was not guaranteed. I then indicated that I knew upgraded rooms were available for the length of our stay and that if she was having trouble finding them in inventory that perhaps we could consult the manager. That said, she produced the upgraded room in a blink. The location is excellent and actually a bit quieter than some other tourist areas. Sydney is quite walkable, but ferry and bus service are both excellent and the Wynyard Station is 3 minutes away and gives train service direct to Circular Quay. We stayed a week and found the $46 combined transit pass a bargain, especially if you use the enjoyable ferry service and travel out to Bondi and Bronte Beaches. The Opera House tour is memorable and if you arrive without having secured performance tickets in advance, it is wise to go immediately to the box office as soon as you arrive in the city, as seats to better-known performances can be difficult to come by and do sell out.

From the grand entrance through the old GPO, to the great service, gorgeous rooms, amazing bathrooms and very comfortable beds, this place is by far the best hotel we've stayed in in Sydney. Not only that, but unlike a lot of Sydney CBD hotels, it's extremely quiet. Because it's on Martin place (which is not open to traffic) and behind the old GPO building, the rooms are completely free of any traffic noise. Not only that, but the walls are thick and well insulated, and we didn't hear a peep the whole time we were there (we stayed on the 7th floor of the tower). People have mentioned over-priced room service, but it seemed pretty average for a hotel of this quality, and we ordered some huge sandwiches with fries for only $21. One thing you can't miss out on (and we were lucky in that it came complimentary with the room) is the ENORMOUS buffet breakfast in the mosaic restaurant. This restaurant is located on an indoor balcony on the 1st floor overlooking the GPO and the massive glass ceiling. The staff there are very friendly and it's all you can eat style with everything you can imagine: from hot meals to sweet breads to fruits and cheeses. All of it is delicious (I think I ate about twice as much as usual) and the setting is superb. Even if you try it just once - make sure you do!

Room service is pricey, but that's hardly a surprise, and the food we ordered came in huge portions, and was very good. We had a fair amount of requests for the concierge; every time our questions were immediately answered or items were instantaneously delivered to our room, and the maid service was near-magical.

They gave me a discount card that says \"enjoy special rates if you dine at the Mosaic\" and they said it will cost about AUD15 for 5 hours. However, when they were about to park at the basement, the rude parking attendant disregarded the card and said there is no such thing and will STILL charge them AUD28. This really pissed our friends off and decided not to have breakfast at Mosaic anymore. It was really embarrassing for me and my husband. I complained to the concierge about it and all they could say was that the basement parking was operated by another company (Secure) and that the attendants were not employed by Westin so they had no control over them. The concierge apologized and said that Westin had an agreement with Secure on the discount and maybe the attendant was not properly informed.

Well, I wanted to spend more time in the shower! And there was also a separate detachable showerhead if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan to wash my hair. The toilet bowl was in its own stall so everything was out of sight. Neat. The tub looked spacious and plenty of glass so the toilet looked bigger. The only problem was the automatic blind which screens the bathroom from the bedroom. I prefer to leave the toilet light on in unfamiliar rooms and this meant that when we slept, there was some light shining into the bedroom through the toilet glass window. The blinds do not shield out light completely. As a Starwood member, bottled mineral water is complimentary but HIDDEN in the closet. And what happened to bedroom slippers? Location: Located in the CBD area. Shops close EARLY. 5 or 6pm except for Thursdays. Which meant that the food court below Myers closes early too! The hotel is less than 5min walk from David Jones, Myers, Dymocks book store, a huge pharmacy, Coles supermarket and boutiques of Jigsaw & Country Road. 10min away is QVB. 20min walk to Cockle Bay Wharf at Darling Harbour and 25min walk to Harbourside where you can get cheap internet access. About 35min walk to Star City or Sydney Fish Market or Bus 443 took us to Prymont Road/Street where we walked 5 min to Sydney Fish Market.

I had two stays at the Westin in June and really wanted to wait until I had finished my second stay before writing this review. The first stay was extended from a one night in a standard room - with points, to a paid three night stay in a suite/club lounge room. I had contacted the hotel reservations directly with my request to upgrade etc, which was handled well. Well until I get to reception. Total confusion with my booking ensued. Eventually solved or so I thought. The suite was large and comfortable with the usual Westin style. Seperate lounge and bedrooms both with flat screen TV's. Bathrom was clean large and smart. The bed/pillows need no introduction to me or my wife. They are great. On the 36th floor you would think that street sound would not be a problem? Wrong! Sound travels from the night clubs that surround the hotel in Martin Place as do the noisy cars. So if you are a very light sleeper then you will notice what is going on 36 floors below you. But to be fair it should only be a problem on Fridays or Saturday nights. On our second night we tried to get up to bedroom using the room card/key. Would not work. So after spending two trips in the lift trying to get the card to work we ended up at reception. We had to get new cards as we had as the hotel computer system said two seperate bookings. If we had have been told this at check in - then end of problem. Nothing major just darn iritating. So be aware if you have two consecutive bookings then a trip back to reception may be necessary. The club lounge is the worst lounge I have ever visited. The seating/chairs are absolutely terrible - very uncomfortable and not welcoming. The nightly food offerings are terrible. The ambience is terrible. The size is terrible. The breakfasts offerings are terrible. The view is great. The staff are terrific. On our first morning to attend breakfast the lounge was well attended, with no table for my wife and I. We were told to wait. I mentioned that we could use the buffet down stairs only to be told we can but it would cost extra. I have never, ever been told that in all my visits to any club lounge in the world. On saying this was totally inappropriate a pair of seats became available. It was the most uncomfortable breakfast meal I have had for many a year. We asked for omelets, only to be told they cost extra!!!!! For the extra you pay for the pleasure of a club facility this offering by the Westin Sydney was a disgrace and total waste of money. My advice is do not pay the extra for this lounge it is terrible waste of time and money. The downstairs lounge/bar seating is also terrible. The beers/drinks are expensive, the service is terrific. Not a comfortable area to rest or lounge in. Our second stay was for one night with points. Everything was handled well the room was excellent. A king bedded room overlooking the inner courtyard of the hotel. Superb bed etc. It was a stay that was enjoyed by us both. The buffet breakfast is superb with everything you could wish for.

Bathroom is also excellent with seperated shower and toilet and a divine deep tub. Bathroom wall opens up so you can lay in the tub and watch the television or spy the view outside (although i dont recommend doing this when nearby offices are in full swing). The only issues, which are quite minor, is overnight parking charged at $50 and buffet breakfast served in the lobby restaurant. Im sure that in-room breakfast would probably be available if in the right rooms but for the rest of us, its breakfast with the masses.

We didn't eat in the hotel, as we chose to eat from one of the many cafes that are in the surrounding streets.

It oozes business everywhere, from the relatively moderate sized rooms (built for 1 in comfort), high prices to charge to the corporate card ($AUD42 for breakfast), smack-bang in the middle of the CBD location and the incredibly large selection of alcohol (hotel sized of course) awaiting in each room ala mini bar (again with prices reserved for the corporate card \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if corporates still allow it these days). Not to say the room is small, but for the price you would expect something a little bigger. It is just enough room for 1 standard king sized bed, desk, single arm chair, ample storage space and bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without bumping into someone if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a room for 2. Of course the LCD/Plasma screen on the wall helps reduce clutter as well, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think about a rollaway bed or 2 queen sized beds. The room features Westin Heavenly Bed, a cabinet just filled with mini-bar stocks, a great Bose alarm clock where you can connect your iPod, floor to ceiling windows, and enough lights to create whatever mood you need. Bathroom size is much better though. It is larger than standard, and glass (or laminated coloured glass) seems to be the theme. Shower includes both rainfall and hand-held shower outlets, a bathtub which is barely big enough for 2, full length mirror and magnifying mirror with light. A neat feature is the wall between the bedroom and bathroom is a glass wall (the bathroom has an electric blind to block the view if need be). But I was impressed that I could watch the TV (and the remote worked!) while in the bathtub, while there is plenty of shelving space within reach above your head to store tissues, iPod, and even a cup of tea so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to get up! TV has cable channels, as well as pay movies (standard hotel stuff) and DVD player but no connectivity to a laptop (like some of the newer hotels these days) which is a shame since all of the features and furnishings of this hotel seem to be first class. Noise seemed to travel quite a bit (our room being first near the lifts), however we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really notice it that much as there are only a hand full of rooms on 1 floor, so traffic is minimal. Service was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 10pm we called housekeeping to come and make the bed (turndown the room), they were there within 2 minutes of the call on our way out. Very efficient and friendly! Wish I could say the same about service in the restaurant. Only had breakfast here as it was included in our rate. Normally it would cost a crazy $AUD42! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had cheaper breakfasts with much more choice in other Starwood hotels in Asia and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been anywhere near $AUD42. The design is long and quite narrow, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a very spacious feel. It seemed ever-crowded, even though you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see most of the other guests. I have to say though, most hotels do not have a clue how to cook hash browns. These were the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had! Just the right amount of salt and the lack of excessive oil meant I could actually taste the potato, at the right temperature. They also have some interesting energy shots (I tried something with beetroot and it was surprisingly not terrible). They also had smoothies like mango flavoured, in addition to just the normal juice. Other items included lots of breads, pastries, 4 variations of cooked egg, cereals, miso soup, smoked salmon and waffles. The Westin is at 1 Martin Place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a historical building dating back to the 1800\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Martin Place is almost the focal point of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CBD. At one end is the State Parliament, library and Macquarie Street (all of the courts seem to be here), all along Martin Place are corporate offices with some higher-end fashion stores. Toward one end is Pitt Street Mall, THE shopping mall in Sydney for anything you could want. There is a Coles Supermarket on the same block. Martin Place train station is 50 metres away. 5 to 10 minutes walk away is practically any CBD office building in Sydney, as well as Circular Quay in the northern direction; home to the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, and China town and the George Street cinemas in the Southern direction. George street itself has plenty of buses toward the South of the city. It is literally one of the best located hotels in this city. With location and 5 star luxury, it is no wonder this hotel is constantly at the upper end in terms of rates, particularly week days due to high demand of business clients. Although given the current economic conditions, Starwood is releasing continuously lower rates either by payment or through SPG. Only issue really is that it is not a Harbour view hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and given its central location, what else could one expect apart from a view of other buildings? But overall, definitely one of the better hotels in Sydney \u00e2\u20ac\u201c give it a go next time!", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MONTREAL", "Title": "\u201cvery impressed\u201d", "Author": "SOGA", "ReviewID": "UR29857261", "Content": "We just got back from a 40 day cruise who took us from Sydney to Vancouver.

However after reading some of the current reviews, I thought it time that I say something about this overrated hotel. My wife and I generally enjoy staying at the Westin chains around the world, but the Sydney Westin was a let down. On arrival, we weren't greeted with a smile or any pleasantries by front desk. Although check-in was prompt and efficient, it was all too cold and clinical. Some warmth and a smile would've been nice! Westin prides itself on personal service - I didn't see any sign of that. The room was nice and tidy, which was welcomed. We had the Deluxe room. The room fittings were of relatively high standards, the bathroom was clean and modern, and the general living area was spacious enough for a family of three. The bed was comfortable enough. Room service was prompt in their delivery of the cot for our then 16 month old son. The concierge was always very helpful and courteous. He gave us great tips and advice on how to get around the city, and of some general sights and attractions. Although we knew quite a bit about Sydney (having been there several times before), he still managed to give us a great rundown on Sydney. Our room didn't come with breakfast, so I'm afraid we can't comment on the quality of their food. Our main gripe was at check out time. We discovered that approximately AUD110 worth of local phone calls was mysteriously charged to our room phone. I disputed this with front desk but they were adamant that we made them! Why would I have kicked up a fuss about local calls if I didn't make them!? I found them to be extremely unhelpful, cold and very clinical in handling the issue. There was no sign of any empathy or concern whatsoever. I wasn't even offered a refund. Another hotel we stayed at in Jun 06 (Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas) and had a similar issue with offered us a refund on the spot - no questions asked. I was very dissapointed with the Westin Sydney to say the least. When it comes to hotels, you can have the nicest and modern looking rooms. But being the service industry, if your staff can't empathise or 'connect' with your customers (us), you'll never retain their business, and quite possibly lose them forever. The Westin Sydney has lost us as customers, and it will take a lot of convincing for me to give them a second chance.

The closest train station would be Martin Place and the second closest would be Wynyard. THE ROOM: We stayed in a standard room with a king size bed (which was extremely comfortable) in the modern wing (rather than the historic wing which is somewhat more expensive) and it was highly impressive. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was very modern and the design of the room is quite unique: there is a glass pane separating the bedroom and the bathroom which means that you can see between the two rooms (although there is a shade that you can raise and lower if you so wish and the shower and toilet are in separate rooms protected by frosted glass). It also means that if you were in the bath, you could still watch TV (which happens to be a very large flat screen). Broadband internet is available in-room and wireless in the lobby at a rather high price. The toiletries in the bathroom were generous and smelt great. The room also provides bathrobes and there is an in-room safe and complete mini bar with free tea, hot chocolate and coffee-making facilities. SERVICE: We arrived at 11.30am and our room was already ready which was a nice touch, despite the fact that check-in usually isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until the early afternoon. Every single staff member that we encountered was so very helpful and friendly and the hotel adds nice touches like a free newspaper outside your room in the morning if requested and some iced mineral water in the late afternoon (which we found when we returned from the gym). AMENITIES: Hotel guests can use the gym and pool free of charge at a section of the building which is part of The Westin property but the fitness centre is not owned or operated by the hotel. The gym is, however, quite large with a multitude of treadmills, stair walkers, bikes and rowing machines as well as a range of weighted equipment and free weights. Personal training and services at the spa can also be arranged at a fee. The pool is more like a lap pool and is much smaller in a section above the gym. There are many conference rooms in the hotel for business use but we never used any of these or the business centre. IN-ROOM DINING: We ordered room service which came promptly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were given an ETA of 30 minutes but it did arrive slightly before that at 27 minutes.. I highly recommend a wood fired pizza \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthy and absolutely delicious! The food was quite pricey but it was in line with what I would expect from a hotel of this calibre. We never ate at Mosaic but the in-room menu boasts several dishes from the restaurant which contain \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuperfoods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and there is an explanation in the in-room brochure about such foods which promote healthy living, etc. MISC: One of the brochures in the room states that there are special running sessions with a Running Concierge but when I phoned the front desk, they informed me that this property doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a Running Concierge. They do, however, have running maps (6kms or 8kms) available from the front desk. The Westin is a strictly smoke-free hotel and there is a $300 cleaning fee charged to your card if evidence of smoking is found in your room.

Our experience wasn't up to standard. Firstly, the initial room we were allocated (Rm 303) was very noisy, as it overlooked the restaurants and central atrium. We were so close you could tell what the guest sitting below ordered for dinner. As we had work committments the following day, we went to reception to request a room change. The reception staff member didn't handle the request well - he informed us that the hotel would be quiet after 10.00pm (?), that no other rooms were available and that there was no way he could be expected to remember us checking in as he was a busy man (we'd checked in with him less than 10 minutes previously). Anyway, after a 15 minute wait and consultation with the manager, we were eventually moved to the 18th floor. A much better room, lot quieter but it hadn't been cleaned properly. There was a sticky mess, perhaps juice, on one of the bedside tables and the other had a foul smelling liquid under the radio. We used a flannel from the bathroom to clean this up. In fairness the rest of the room and the bathroom were very clean, so I'm not sure how this grottiness was overlooked. I'd also say that the room decor isn't up to 5 star standard. The carpet looks like it escaped from a basic hotel chain, ditto the upolstery fabric. A long way from luxe. Breakfast was very good.

It's odd because on my last stay here in April, my colleague and I were bowled over by the helpful, friendly staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The first room I was given was certainly not an upgrade - one of the benefits expected as a Gold SPG member within 2 stays of Platinum membership and on my 10th visit!!!! When I opened the curtains in the first room I was allocated, it faced on to the bridge across to the heritage building. Anyone walking across the bridge would look straight into my room....certainly not what I expect of a 5 star hotel nor as a very frequent, repeat guest. When working in the business centre, my colleague and I tried to order 2 cups of coffee. We called room service and were told that we could not do that. Neither of us could understand why it is possible to order a cappuccino in your room and charge it to your room but NOT possible to order a coffee to the business centre and charge it to your room??!! I honestly feel that some of the staff need to be reminded of some basic facts of the service industry. 1. Guests (never mind FREQUENT REPEAT guests) are the only reason the staff at the Westin have jobs. 2. the really frequent, repeat guests are the ones they should go the extra mile for. 3. NOTE to reception desk staff : If you're going to lie to the customer, make damned sure it's a whopper ... not some half wit excuse you came up with on the spur of the moment.

Our recent experience in Sydney fell short of our expectations of a five star hotel. For starters, when the taxi arrived there was no one to greet us or collect our luggage. Bad first impression. After I hauled our suitcases out of the cab boot we walked past three staff members as we wheeled our way to the reception counter. Not one offered to help - they just stood there and watched. During our stay, I also noticed other guests wheel their luggage through the reception area. I thought this was really odd for a five star hotel. Despite this, there was evidence of exceptional service worthy of a 5-star hotel. The housekeeping staff were fantastic including the excellent turn down service - thank you. Some reception and management staff were also exceptional with their friendly and thoughtful service; however, management needs to ensure other staff perform to a five star standard e.g the porters, or rather lack of them, on arrival and departure. The rooms' are contemporary, comfortable and spacious. The bathroom is huge and luxurious - one reason why we like Westin hotels. The room service menu is standard hotel fare - personally I think it all seems so 1990s. It offers your usual club sandwich, burger and pasta fare. This was a room service menu at its boring best. I think there was a 'restaurant menu' option but it was too late when we ordered so I didn't even bother reading it. Low-fat menu options available 24/7 would be welcomed by us e.g healthy salads, fish, anti pasto, low-fat chicken dishes. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to test run the gym - I decided to go for a jog over the Sydney Harbour Bridge instead.. well worth it.... stunning views! We've stayed here a few times and we're not sure if there are rooms with harbour views - it's a good distance from the harbour...it's closer to the mall and business district.

We have stayed at many Westins over the years, and this one fell short of expectations. After all, if you are paying for some pampering, you should at least get a little. The positives: Our room was located on the SPG Executive floor, just a couple doors down from the Westin Executive Club. Breakfast is served daily in the Club. Pleasant, though the selections were average and do not change. Free wifi is also available in the Club. The room and bath were spotless and spacious, very contemporary, with a few notable touches.

Concierge made a face (!) handed me a newspaper, and told me to find the local cinemas in there. Asked if he could he look it up for us and print out the times, like the concierge usually does? No. The next day I saw another concierge was there, and thought I would try again. I asked Gary if there were any restaurants in Chinatown he could recommend. He said sure, listed a few, said there is nothing nice in Chinatown in Sydney, and we should just show up and choose one in the area. I asked if he could make us a booking. No. Are any of the ones he listed better than the others? Quiter? Better service? He stated they were all the same to him. When I got back to the hotel a few hours later I went back up tot the room, paid $30 for an internet connection, looked up the restaurants, called, and found they were completely booked, except for one available time at 5.30. I then tried calling the concierge again, got another person and asked if he could recommend something else. He was unable (or unwilling) to do so.

After reading through mixed reviews on this website, I went ahead with my booking because , well, there does not seem to be any better choices in Sydney. Each luxury hotel in the city has its own issues, be it a small-sized standard room, or poor management, or both. Oh, did I forget to mention the famous heavenly bed at the Westin? The heavenly bed was indeed from the other world. The choices of pillows were fantastic as well. We booked an superior room on the executive floor, which is a bit on the smaller side (probably smaller than my ideal size of 45 sqm). View was standard city view into other office towers. Our Bathroom has a rainshower stall and a deep soaking tub. The executive lounge is located on the 28th floor of the hotel. The size of the lounge is again small and it can get crowded during breakfast time. The lounge serves a small buffet breakfast with a few hot items and evening drinks and hors d'oeuvres. Unlike a few other club-level lounges we patroned, it is up to the individual waiter/waitress whether they would give you a bottle of water outside the lounge for your sight-seeing during the day. As one waiter put it \"we only allow you to consume our food and beverages within the lounge.\" On a number of occasions, we saw people \"sneaking\" food and drinks out under the cover of their newspaper. Services were spotty and in accordance with the \"relaxed\" attitude of Australian culture, as advised by one popular travel book. The front desk staff denied my membership entitlement to upgrade to a preferred room and stated the room I reserved for was a preferred room already. Housekeeping was forgetful about replacing toothbrushes and other vanity items. One conciege staff did not know how to go to the Fish Market via public transport. The list can go on, but you get the point. Overall, Westin Sydney has the hardware and brand name of a five star hotel and service of a 3 star.

Whereby other hotels do charge for general additional services, the Westin charges to excess. Room service, restaurants food is average and don't warrant the prices they charge. A charge for the use of the privately run gym is also somewhat exhorbitant (and the gym's not that great either)and the charge for using the internet is also above those of other 5 star hotels. What the Westin does offer however are modern, clean and very comfortable rooms. Decor blends in well and calming. The bathrooms are large and modern and try and book one of the tower rooms where you can sit in the bath and look out into the city skylne. Beds are the classic Westin 'heavenly', very comfortable.

Cons - lax service (1 out of 2 room service orders are bungled up despite specific reminders), no recognition even if you stay 30 nights a year, room service menu limited and unchanged in 3 years, food in room and in the Mosaic restaurant is very poor quality for what you pay, in-room toiletry is standard issue Westin (poor), management is not very interested in feedback FOUR SEASONS: Pros - excellent service, food is generally high standard and very accomodating, great location, great toiletry, fantastic views (if you get the right room), overall friction-free experience, and a hint of romance Cons - rooms are small and standard-issue except for the views(definitely not FS standards) HILTON: Pros - HHonors points, location is good for shopping Cons - incredibly small bathrooms (even after a room upgrade as a Diamond member), views into other office buildings from room window, crowded lobby SHANG: Pros - views (opera house facing rooms only - \"harbour view\" rooms face the bridge expressway!), rooms are decent size, good bar (Altitude) Cons - location is a bit out of the way, food is not very good (room service advised me that some of their room service food was made in bulk elsewhere and trucked in, so cannot be altered!), service generally laid back and lax, a very ordinary hotel and a world away from the usual Shangri-La standards In sum, I think the Westin is acceptable for a short business visit, but you pay too much for merely a competent room and good location.

We are platinum SPG members and were treated like loyalty. Got an upgrade to a corner suite. We also stayed using corporate rate, so we had a great deal. Here are the pros and cons. PROS: a. Very clean and modern hotel. Supervisor checks the room after maid/cleaning service has done its job and make sure its up to Westin's standards. b. Plenty of closet space to hang clothes and lots drawers, if you are here for extended stay. c. Close to popular shopping areas d. Staffs are young, but very friendly. e. Parking is expensive but very easy. Valet service is flawless and always on top of their service. f. Hotel is secure & safe. Elevator access by key card only. g. Recognizes SPG Gold and Platinum members. h. Club lounge has plenty of seats, space, and great service. i. Taxi service is always available. j. Bed was always made, bathroom cleaned well, extra towels always provided. k. Great floor to window view! CONS: a. Far away from popular restaurants and dining options (such as the wharf and the harbour). Walkiing distance about 1.5 to 2 miles. b. Very business like hotel, does not feel cozy or resort like. This is definitely a business hotel. c. The staff are very young (mostly under 30), may not be able to recommend or fulfill requests or questions more geared towards older clients. d. Internet acess very expensive... I think about 20USD per day. e. Club lounge has good breakfast, but lacks hot food (eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc). f. Dining options are expensive and very limited within the hotel. g. Most stores and restaurants around the neighborhood close down around 7pm, very little night life. Overrall: I think this is a great BUSINESS hotel, it is not very romantic or family oriented. If you are travelling to SYD for pleasure, stay somewhere else.

However, we were allocated rooms immediately and in fact were upgraded so that this could happen. The room was a good size, not huge but there was plenty of room and tons of storage. The decor was unusual for a international hotel in that it was fresh, modern and bright. The 'Heavenly Bed' was very comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows provided a fantastic view of Martin Place. The bathroom was another novelty, with glass shelves and modern cermaic basins and best of all, a glass wall between it and the bedroom. You could sit in the bath and watch TV through the glass - perfect! The shower was another big plus point. It was a separate cubicle with a rain shower head so you really did get a good soaking. When deciding on hotel rooms in Sydney you invariably have to decide between harbour view rooms or rooms that provide good value.

Thus, I agreed to pay for the upgrade for the first night, as long as the night on points would not incur an additional charge - I was assured that it wouldn't. I paid the AUD60, and pressed on. I was surprised to find an additional AUD116 on my bill at check-out. In fairness, they took care of it after some complaining, but it should NOT have happened.

It was our first time to Sydney, and sightseeing was our sole purpose. I admit Starwood points was the initial draw to this hotel. First the negatives about the hotel. The hotel basically has no view except the standard city view. If you are really looking for a harbor view, this hotel is not for you. We did not have one, so we are not sure what we missed, but given that pretty much every day of our stay involved leaving from Circular Quay and moving through the harbor, we feel that we did not miss much. The hotel is also in a central business district. Great for business. Not so great for sightseeing. Although we did not miss the harbor views, we did miss being right on the harbor for the sake of convenience. We could walk to Circular Quay easily. However, it is a 15 minute walk and those extra 15 minutes when you are coming back from a long day of sightseeing. Also, everything in the immediate area pretty much shuts down on weekend evenings (as far as we can tell). The Rocks area or Darling Harbor had a lot more happening on weekend evenings. Now the positives (which there were many). Our room was great, and our bathroom even better. We were upgraded to a Heritage room in the old section of the hotel. My wife and I like sleek, modern hotel rooms rather than classical type rooms. So, we initially wanted to stay in the Towers. However, the front desk clerk recommended the upgraded and we trusted her. We were not disappointed. Once you enter the room, you get the feel of \"tradition,\" but appropriately balanced with a \"modern\" feel. We loved the room, and especially the walk to the room. You exit the lifts and walk across the bridge to cross the beautiful atrium between the Tower and the old building. You get to fully appreicate the architecture as you cross over, and for tourists like us it is a great feeling. The bathroom in the Heritage room did not have the \"window\" into the room that the Tower rooms have but it was large and very modern. The bathroom amenities included everything that we needed including detergent. The basement area has a very modern, upscale food court that caters to the business people working in the area. A great place to pick up quick food at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to try out the hotel's restaurants. The concierge was very helpful in making recommendations for us. All in all, it was a great hotel. I would rank it as one of the top of the line Westins. If sightseeing is your main goal, the lack of being on the harbor is a slight downer.

I asked one person \"what makes this Westin so different from any other?\" and was greeted with a \"trust me\" response. So I did. And my husband lived to regret it (as he bore the brunt of my complaints!!) Don't believe the pictures on the web site that show great pictures of Sydney views - I tried 3 different rooms and none had a \"view\". The swimming pool is off limits at the times we tried to go there - 6pm on a Sunday evening for example when there's not much else going on anywhere else in Sydney. The rooms were no different to any other Westin - decidedly average. The fact that you have a bath next to a window is nothing to shout about. It just becomes a pain when someone needs to get up in the middle of the night and goes into the bathroom - the light is turned on and bathes the entire bedroom in light. You also need to be careful as anyone from the office blocks across the way could happily see you in the bathroom if they so wished. Housekeeping - obviously don't get the concept of \"do no disturb!\" We went out one morning and came back later in the afternoon to find our room had still not been made up. My husband went for a jet lagged nap and so I put the do not disturn sign on the door. Next thing I know, housekeeping are phoning me (and waking up my husband) asking when we want our room made up as we have do not disturb on the door. I advised them that I had meant it. No apology, just annoyance. The concierge service was also nothing to shout about. they gave us a great suggestion about the behind the scenes tour of the zoo, but ddidn't mention that this needed to be booked in advance of going to the zoo, so we were disappointed upon our arrival there.
