Unfortunately, they were full and told me that they would only have the original room. Fair enough. However, when we arrived, I mentioned to the receptionist on the off chance that one had become available, and lucky us, it had. We were therefore given a room with a canal view at no extra charge, and we couldn't have been happier. Our room was on the top floor, and from our windows we could look up and down a typical Venetian canal. Over the rooftops in front, we could see the church of Santa Maria della Salute, one of Venices most iconic landmarks. In general, we were happy with our room. It was quite large and very clean. The decoration was contemporary and simply. Our only problem was that the mattresses and pillows were hard. But that's a personal choice. The service in the hotel was exceptional. All of the staff were very happy to give advice and tips to get the most of your stay. If they didn't know the answer to your question they would find out. On two occasions we had restaurant recommendations, both of which were just what we were looking for. You genuinely felt like a welcome guest. Breakfast was surprising. I expected a few platters of cold meats and bread. There is actually a hot selection of sausages and scrambled egg. This is great, as Venice can be tiring with all the walking and so you feel much better set up at the beginning of the day. My one piece of feedback to the hotel would be about the wi-fi. It's free to use, but you must get a password from reception. This access only last 5 hours, which for a couple of days is fine, but we were there for 5, and found that we had to keep asking for a new password.

Marco is ideal for Venice and I recommend it to you in case you plan a 1 or 2 night stay in the city. If you stay away from S. Marco you will need to use the public (boat) transportation -the \"vaporeto\"-. It would be therefore better for short term visits to stay close to St. Marco. The Hotel dell'Opera location is indeed ideal and serves this purpose!! Its biggest strength is its location: 5 min walk to S. Marco square and 1 min from one of the finest/fanciest streets of Venice (with all impressive fashion shops). It is also 5 min. from the public (boat) transportation and therefore very convenient. I recommend that you follow the instructions (map info, etc) suggested from the hotel website -to avoid any trouble in fiding it, since Venice is truly a labyrinth-. We used the gondola waiting you at the entrance of the hotel!! It was magnificent and very romantic. DO NOT MISS THIS EXPERIENCE!! We stayed 2 nights in the weekend before the 2011 Feb. carnival (costed 200 euros per night) at the Superior Double room with view on the canal, inclusive of champagne at the arrival, trip to Murano island Glass factory, and buffet breakfast. Everything was fine. Nothing to worry. In terms of cleaniless, the hotel was well rennovated and bathroom/room was clean. Only the blankets were old/dirty -which the hotel might consider changing them at a certain point. But overall clean.

Our room was next to the breakfast restaurant so from 6 every morning it was quite noisy, not from the hotel workers more from other gueats using the breakfast room. The room was very large with a tv, unfortunately the tv was small and on the furthest wall from the bed. Another point I found that goes against the hotel slightly is the non availabilty of irons (not good if you wanted to dress smartly for an evening meal and have just travelled with everything in a small suitcase) so please bear that in mind. Apparently the proximity to the opera house makes their insurance premiums too high to provide irons ??!!

These directions assume you have arrived at the San Marco / Vallaresso vaporetto stop near Harry's Bar (NOT the San Marco / San Zaccharia stop - that's a trap for the unwary). The mention of a \"bar\" in the hotel's amenitites is a little misleading, though. There is not a bar in the English-speaking sense of the word. The hotel uses the word to mean that coffee or drinks are available 24 hours a day and that these can be had in the breakfast room or in your room. There isn't a bar in which you can relax and meet with freinds at the end of the day as you might find in a larger establishment. I managed to score a four nights for the price of six deal (via the octopustravel.com website) which was not available on the hotel's own website, so this obviously was a plus.

We appreciate that an Italian breakfast is not as full as we are used to in Britain but feel that more could be done to cater for our tastes.

I have no complaints about this hotel, but feel that all the 5 star reviews are a little generous. Yes the location is great, but I don't think the hotel is all that special. The room was a decent size (we didn't get a canal view) and the bathroom was nice and modern (the shower was pitiful but I guess plumbing isn't the best in old Venice so that might be the same everywhere). The bed was two twins pulled together, but it was still comfortable and not a problem. The room was nice, not that different from the photos on here, but I wouldn't say it was 5 star worthy. We arrived at midnight and left after breakfast so didn't really speak to the staff much, so perhaps the service was lovely, but we didn't really have long enough there to notice anything different from any other hotel in their attitude. Breakfast itself was standard fare, though the blood orange juice and apricot croissants were very nice - though the coffee wasn't so great and the fruit a little tired. Actually the only not amazing coffee i've had so far in Italy, though I think if you asked the waitress would make you something better than the stuff in the jug. There was nothing special about the breakfast, nothing Italian or different from what you'd get anywhere. So as I say a perfectly serviceable no frills hotel, and maybe I am expecting too much, but for $100 it seemed a little pricey for just bed & breakfast (no swimming pool or any other facilities) though in fairness Venice isn't cheap so it was fine, but if i'd actually paid $380 then i'd be really upset. It was fine for the night and I have no complaints, just don't expect anything grand.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an opera-lover and this time I came to Venice specially to listen to La Traviata at the La Fenice opera house \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a few meters away and in the evening before the performance you can watch an interesting procession of smartly-dressed people coming to the opera. Think of the tickets in advance and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a fantastic experience! ROOMS AND INTERIOR. The main feature of this hotel is elegance. Soft colours - brown, beige, white, - soft light, spacious rooms (I was alone in a double room overlooking Rio delle Veste (302) which is on the top floor under the roof, but I can say that for two people it is great, too.) In comparison with many other hotels in Venice (or at least their photos) this hotel can boast of modern interior which I really appreciated, as you can find a lot of antique style in the city itself - and I had no wish to have tired old-looking things in my room. Everything I needed was there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a safe, a mini-bar, 6 towels and a charming view of the canal below \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so I could even sing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Lucia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd together with the gondoliers passing by (and I really did, actually!) STAFF. Oh, what a pleasant company to talk to! I spoke Italian with Giovanni who was also giving me useful tips and teaching me some of the Italian phrases I needed, English with\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6em\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Jason, Jesu\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. - (mamma mia, it seems to me I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch his name right and, perhaps, made a mistake in my direct review to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sorry!), Russian with Ivan\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Everyone was so helpful and nice to me, and I really felt being a friend not a guest. BREAKFAST. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a heavy eater so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not the best person to ask. But you can get all you need there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c juice, fruit, cereals, cakes, buns\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 caf\u00c3\u00a9 latte served in tall glasses\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cappuccino with the foam of whipped milk which you can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a spoon. If you come to breakfast early you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find yourself alone in their charming breakfast room, so try to make yourself noticed by the staff or you risk having eaten everything before you are served with hot drinks. It happened to me once but I eat little and do it fast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so perhaps that was the problem. SURROUNDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. La Fenice is a must for all lovers of music. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a reservation, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chance you can get a good ticket just one day before the performance (I reserved mine half a year in advance, but on the next day after my first Traviata I dropped into the box office and bought one more ticket to listen to it for the second time!) What I also recommend is to listen to Vivaldi in the church of San Vidal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a great pleasure and very relaxing after a day of sightseeing. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great choice of restaurants and cafes in Venice. The closest to the hotel is a little restaurant VinoVino where I came 3 times and was glad to receive fast service and a pleasant meal. If you want to go away from Venice for a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c choose Vicenza, Bassano-del-Grappa or (a bit further) Verona. Among the islands of Venice I recommend Burano with its picturesque bright houses (about 1 hour by vaporetto from Fondamenta Nuove) AND AGAIN I would like to say that I was really happy to stay at the Hotel Dell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Opera and can surely recommend it to everyone!", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location, nice service\u201d", "Author": "ditya6um", "ReviewID": "UR37782660", "Content": "This is a good hotel with friendly staff. Be sure not to buy a map of Venice for 2.5 Euro because you will get one once you check into the hotel. The location is great - 6 minutes walk to San Marco and 10 minutes walk to Rialto bridge. The best way to reach this hotel is to get off the water taxi at Giglio (one stop before San Marco) stop and then ask someone for La Fenice theater. The hotel is right there. I asked a person at the Venice airport in the tourist information center and she told me exactly how to get here. Hotel also has the free breakfast from 7:30 AM - 10 AM. The hotel also has a small elevator,so you won't need to carry the luggage through the stairs. Overall we had a very nice stay in this hotel. Jason was especially very helpful.

Slightly tricky to find but I'm sure that is the usual with Venice. We arrived by water taxi though - a great way to arrive and sure beats the hassle of wandering around with your luggage looking for the hotel. The location is literally one block from St Marks Square but there is none of the tourist noise associated with being so close. The hotel is reasonably new - I think it was opened just this year - and is immaculate. Both men on reception were brilliant. Extremely helpful and funny. We booked a standard room (no canal view) and were given the most gorgeous room on the 3rd floor with its own private terrace. It was extremely large with a generous bathroom (no shower but a shower nozzle in the bath). There was wi-fi but we couldn't get it to work unfortunately. Breakfast was included and it was a typical Italian breakfast, croissant, cake, cereal, fruit, meat and cheese. Very nice though. This really was a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone staying in Venice.

The hotel is perfectly located within a short walk from Piazza San Marco but not in a crazy busy (touristy) location. From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by a wonderful staff in a great (renovated) looking hotel. Our room was updated but in a classy, traditional way (nice to have the glamor of Venice without the old, dated look that many other hotels offer). We were treated with a welcome bottle of prosecco and a congratualtory letter which was a great touch. We loved the furniture, view of the canal, and everyting the room offered. The only negative was the lack of a shower (the tub had a shower head but no curtain), but we found a way to make the most of it. The front desk staff made great recommendations and helped arrange transportation throughout our stay. The gondola ride we took right outside the front door is a must (being on the smaller canals is more romantic yet you still do a brief stint on the grand canal by the Rialto Bridge). Breakfast was very good and offered a nice selection. If you decide not to stay at the Gritti Palace or some other high end hotel, this place is the perfect hotel for an excellent Venice experience. Stroll out to San Marco in the morning before the tourists take over and enjoy getting lost in the area's back streets.
