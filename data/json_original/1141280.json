False advertising \"ALL SUITES RESORT\" The rooms were horrible.. small with a \"lovely view\" of a construction wall and service road after the first room had no air conditioning. Very poor lighting in the rooms and no place to hang anything, but yet they want you to use your towels more than once!! Room service is offered but the poor fellas have no place to set up your meal! The drive into the resort from the main road was such a disappointment. Usually the resorts have georgeous grounds as you approach and are most welcoming..this did not. Paid extra for private transportation to the resort from the airport and I understand why...This resort would not want a buss full of people viewing their unwelcoming entrance. Front desk lobby would compare to a Super 8... small and not very inviting. We are accustomed to beautiful open lobbies with staff greeting you on your arrival. Very dissapointed in the entire check in process..also the first place that copied our passports...What's up with that???? Food in the main restaurants was very good..slow service but we enjoyed that since we were with friends. Difficult for families with small children as many were crying or fell asleep with the slow service. Pools were great though not much of a beach.. water too rocky in front of the hotel but a short walk and you can swim and snorkle. All in all we made it a great vacation lots of sun and relaxation. Would never go back to the Azul Fives as we have been to so many All Inclusive properties (this being our 12th) with 4 or 4.5 star rating that far exceeded what was offered at this 5 star rated facility. This was our most expensive vacation property and we rate it near the bottom. I guess I will never understand how these properties earn their ratings but I will say the \"Dreams\" , \" Now \" and \"Iberostar\" properties by far exceed the Azul with better value and superior service. I am positive we will return to Mexico but this experience at the Azul Fives have given us serious doubts as to where we want to spend our hard earned vacation dollars...", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent vacation can't wait to return next year!\u201d", "Author": "jgrimold", "ReviewID": "UR126471305", "Content": "Azul Fives was an excellent resort, especially for families with smaller children. We stayed from March 14-20th, and wished we booked for longer. We absolutely loved it! We have 2 boys 7 and 9, and they loved it. We met a lot of really nice people, and the service was just excellent probably the most attentive, hard working and friendly staff of any resort we've stayed at and we have been to many many nice 5* resorts. I can't understand negative reviews, honestly people need to relax a bit and take a chill pill. I want to put your mind at ease this is a really nice place especially for families with young children to stay. Would I stay here if it was a couple only trip? Maybe not as there are a lot of kids but that is what Azul is all about and they focus on. If looking for adult only consider Karisma's El Dorado resorts perhaps. Room Our room was excellent. It was a 1 Bedroom Suite in Villa 14, ground floor. A Swim up pool varnish right across from the outdoor patio. Room is awesome, tons of room, definitely go for a suite and request to face the pool. Food Food was definitely overall above average with other comparable resorts. We loved Tsuki - Japanese and Sea Olive. Excellent waiters and food was very good. They both have a kids menu which parents with picky eaters like us really appreciate! We went 2 times to each. Arezzo was pretty good also, but they didn't have a kids menu there. It may have been what we ordered, it was good but we actually preferred the others. Many others we spoke to loved it though. Flavors the buffet was good, we mainly went there for breakfast which was very good! The Beach Grill had the best view of the beach and water, had burgers, fries, pizza, was good. Went to the Lizard Outdoor cafe for lunch or afternoon snacks. It was good too, tacos and nachos, gourmet burgers were tasty. Always could find something good to eat, no one got sick at all and my wife is a pretty picky eater. We got room service once for breakfast, it was OK, make sure to order lots as the portions are pretty small so I wish I had ordered more. Pools Really nice pools running throughout, with a few swim up bars open around noon to 5 or 6pm. We had one right behind our room it was great! The temperature is a little cool but not too much. It is Mexico and it is very hot so we didn't find this a problem at all, as I read in some reviews. Infinity Pool close to beach is nice, again a little cool but not too much, it was welcome with the heat. A little busy, music, animation crew around but was a lot of fun if you like this. If you want quieter go back to the winding pools around the rooms. Service, Staff We found the staff and service to be excellent! Everyone truly works very hard and tries their best to exceed hour expectations. There were so many individuals I could mention but Manuel at The Rainbow Bar is an excellent bartender and really took care of us all week! Thanks Manuel, you're awesome! Also Erika at Azulitos the Kids Club, thanks so much. You were so friendly and our boys had a great time with you and your great staff! Really, we were very impressed with the high service level at Azul Fives. The landscaping and grounds staff were always working hard grooming and making things look so beautiful. Grounds The landscaping and grounds were impeccable. Beautiful! Beach The sand is nice and soft. The resort was full when we were there and we didn't find it hard finding chairs. It is pretty rocky in front of the resort, but if you walk around 5 minutes to the north (or to left) there is a nice swimming area there in front of the Princess resort. It would be nice if it was a little easier if less rocks and easier to swim right in front, but wasn't a major issue for us. Lots of beach to walk. Still enjoyed sitting on the beach relaxing, was a beautiful view. Some did go in with water shoes to enter through initial more rocky area into the water, we may look at purchasing for a future visit. Animation Staff Were really friendly, and not as pushy and in your face as much as many resorts we've been too. They have lots of activities if you are interested, but if not they don't bother you which is nice. Kids Club It was the best most organized kids club we've seen, which is important and made our trip so much more enjoyable. They have several staff, and had several kids attending when we were there. They had a baby, toddler room. Most kids we saw were around similar age to ours, between maybe 5 and 9. I was really impressed with the number of hours they were open everyday, opening at 9 to 5pm; then again between 7 and 9pm for movie and disco nights for the kids which was really surprising and excellent. We went to dinner one night while the kids were at disco night for an hour. The kids loved it and it was a nice little break also for us! Nice facility, nice small pool outside it. Overall Again, we loved Azul Fives. We would like to get a big family trip going for next year here. It is great for families, and don't be turned off by some of the negative reviews, seriously. You have to put things into perspective, it may not be the Ritz Carlton but it is a very nice what I would rate a 5* resort for Mexico and other comparable locales for beach getaways in places like Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cuba. We've been to many 5* resorts and it is one of the better ones we've stayed at. Very good value also and unique with the suites which are so nice versus standard hotel rooms for families. We definitely want to return to Azul Fives next year!!!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice place on the beach\u201d", "Author": "SusanM15", "ReviewID": "UR126450584", "Content": "Azul Fives is a nice place for families and OK for couples.

The other 2 were still planning to take the trip. We made multiple attempts to switch our other 2 friends to a smaller suite but the resort was not willing to help us make these changes, leaving us with the option of paying the remaining portion of our \"all-inclusive\" booking or leaving the expense to our friends, which we were not willing to do. The resort claimed that they were holding rooms for another wedding and that they would not allow us to switch to a smaller room. Ultimately, with the final payment due, the resort bullied us into paying our full \"all-inclusive\" rate or else canceling our friends room. They were unwilling to even lower our rate to just cover the room. If they are unwilling to let you out of your booking with the loss of just a $75 dollar deposit 2 months in advance, what is the purpose of a deposit? I have traveled to many places around the world and never experienced such horrible treatment. Though I have wasted a significant amount of money, I am glad I am not wasting time at a place with such little integrity and concern for travelers.

It's a great family all-inclusive with some inconsitencies that keep it from a 5-star rating. At the outset, I would tell you that this is not the place for you if you are a young couple without kids, looking for a party or are looking for a quiet resort. On the other hand, this is the perfect place if you're with a group of people who have kids (like my wife and I were) or of course, if you have kids yourself. Rooms: The rooms are very nice. We had a 1-bedroom suite and it was enormous for two people. As the pictures show, the 1-bedroom suite has a huge spa bathroom in the same room as the bedroom. The other part of the suite is the living room/kitchen/dining room. The bed was a bit hard and we needed to ask for an additional blanket as the standard is two sheets. The pocket doors separating the bedroom from the living area are relatively flimsy, so I'm not sure that they would keep any noise from the living room out of the bedroom if someone wanted to sleep and others wanted to stay up. The one-bedroom suites also have a bath and a half, with the half bath in the living room. Air conditioning worked great. The whirlpool tub in the bathroom is definitely big enough for two people as is the shower. One issue we had with the tub was that when we turned on the whirlpool jets for the first time, brown particles came out and settled on the bathtub bottom. I assume this is because it isn't used all the time. The fixtures in the shower are very nice, with a rain shower head and a separate shower massage attachment. No problems with hot water. The lighting in the room is a bit dim, especially at the bathroom mirror. His and her sinks were a nice convenience, though. The couch is also a pull-out. We had friends who were given a crib for their baby as well. No complaints from anyone. The kitchen is a bit of a waste for most vacationers, but nice to have the space. If you request you can get plates, flatware and cooking pots and pans. Also, if you really want to cook on your own there are ways to get to a reasonable grocery store or to have groceries delivered. Just ask the concierge. Only real complaints about the rooms are: (1) the lighting in the bathroom is too dim; and (2) the fans in the bathrooms are loud and annoying and sound like they're half broken. All of the rooms have a walk out patio with chairs. I'll talk more about this when I talk about the pools, but our patio was relatively useless based on where our room was. We were on the first floor facing a path that lots of people walk down to get to the main building or the beach. So, it wasn't very private. Also, across the walking path was a main road that is fenced off. You can still hear workers going up and down it and smell the exhaust off of cars traveling down it. Other patios would be awesome, especially ones that are on the second floor or higher, or that face internally toward the internal pools. Food and Drink: Let's face a fact: if you're going to an all-inclusive and you're not shocked by the price, you're not getting gourmet food. They can try, they can come close, they can make the presentation look nice, they can put french words on the menu, but it ain't gourmet. That goes for any nice all-inclusive. That said, the food at this resort is very good for all-inclusive. By the main building where you check in is Flavours, the buffet (they call it a \"food display\"). The buffet itself is a touch on the smallish side, especially given how big the dining area is. But, it was rare to have a line and when there was a line it moved relatively quickly. Flavours is open for breakfast and dinner. We had breakfast every morning and it was pretty good. Fresh eggs and omelettes were cooked quickly with a nice selection of additional ingredients. Lots of your otherwise standard hot and cold breakfast fare was also included. Plenty of choices for everyone. One very nice touch was the bloody mary and mimosa bar setup off to the side every morning. The building next to the beach and activity pool has Arezzo (Italian), Tsuki (Japanese), Sea Olive (Mediterranean) and the beach grill (bar/grill food). I think Arezzo and Tsuki are only open for dinner. We had lunch at both the beach grill and Sea Olive. Both were good. Sea Olive for lunch had fish, mexican dishes and both standard and \"dressed up\" lunch type dishes. The fajitas were awesome, as was the caesar chicken salad and the shrimp burrito. The beach grill had your standard burgers, dogs, nachos, etc. The only downside to the beach grill is that it's outside, so if you're looking to come in from the heat you need to go to Sea Olive. Tsuki for dinner was good. Plenty of good (not great but not bad) quality sushi and other asian dishes. Arrezzo for dinner was amazing. This is coming from someone who lives in a very large city with many excellent italian restaurants, nearly all of which I have eaten at. I would put Arrezzo up with most big city italian restaurants. The food was tremendous. Try the flatbreads, the rissotto and the osso bucco. Tremendous. I was really shocked at how good it was. Arrezzo is the only restaurant you have to get reservations for. What they will tell you officially is that you have to get your reservation at least the day before you want to eat from 2-5 from a guy sitting near the pool with the reservation book. Maybe you need to do that for the first night, but we found that we could reserve a table for the next day by going up to the hostess stand at Arrezzo and asking for a reservation. Nice little shortcut. Room service is available, pretty timely, was always accurate for us and the menu is wide and varied. The only downside is like most room service at all-inclusives, the quality is not as good as in the restaurants. But, if you order something more basic like nachos or cheese plate you'll get something you'll like. The drinks are good. If you like a strong drink, then I recommend you have them make your drink and then you ask them to top it off with your choice of booze. I found the drinks mostly good, but there are a few bartenders who don't know what they're doing. Also, the selection of liquor brands is kind of hit or miss depending on what bar you're at. At some bars they'll have grey goose, at others only absolut. At some they'll have a nice reposado tequila, at others on only Cuervo. Pools/Beach: This resort has your standard activity pool and beach. Nothing really unique. Plenty of chairs on the beach up to about 10:30 or so. Chairs by the infinity pool went away by 8:30ish. No limit on towels which is nice. Drink service was very good. Obviously, the activity pool is very loud and boisterous. The pool itself is a bit small for being the main pool. The beach area is, as everyone has noted, pretty rocky. Some experienced ocean swimmers found a way to get into the water and swim past the rocks. But for everyone else, I suggest you walk north (take a left as you face the gulf) and walk up until you get to the area that is opposite a vacant area which is fenced off. It's probably a two minute walk. The beach there is not rocky and it's easy to get into and out of the water. The other unique part of this resort are the internal pools. There are two large pools that wind internally between the villa buildings. At some points, they are narrow like a lazy river. At others, they are quite large, almost the size of the main pool near the beach. These were pretty cool. Many rooms actually lead out directly to these pools. So, you could setup shop on your own patio and be steps from the pool. Also, these pools have three separate pool bars, two of which have seating outside the pool and you could have an open-air lunch there (off a more limited menu, basically like the beach grill near the activity pool). If you want to be close to your room, or you just want a more quiet area, these internal pools are for you. Many people don't even think to look at them because they kind of resemble the more private, swim-up rooms that other resorts have. This is not the case. None of the rooms are \"swim up room\" with direct pool access, though some are just steps away. I would encourage you to meander through these internal pools and find a little nook for yourself if that's your thing. These pools have areas with wade-in spots for smaller kids, or just steps leading in. There are also \"hidden\" nooks and crannies with three, four or five chairs setup that weren't taken all day. Definitely worth exploring, and still easy to get a drink. Spa My wife and I each got a massage. It was great. Go a bit early and do the \"water treatment' which is basically a rotation of a sauna, steam room, hot whirpool, cold whirlpool and rain shower. Very nice. The massages were wonderful. Kids Club Obviously I didn't use the kids club but our villa was next door so we walked past every day multiple times. What an awesome place for a kid. They have a small kiddie pool outside, and inside they were always doing something with the kids from using the indoor gym to showing movies to pinata parties. Very cool looking. Nightlife: None to really speak of. Not too many people go to the shows. The Zky Bar doesn't get too crowded, either. Fun to have a drink on the veranda overlooking the activity pool adjacent to the Zky Bar. Overall It was interesting to see all the little things they have setup in the restaurants and other areas for kids. Toys in every restaurant. Kid friendly foods everywhere. Very accommodating for strollers, easy for others in our group to get clean boosters and high chairs. Overall, just seemed like it was really set up well to make it easy to have your children and enjoy yourself. The service was a bit inconsistent. Very good at times, very mediocre at times. All of the restaurants are slow, so if you want to eat fast then I suggest the beach grill for lunch and the buffet for breakfast and dinner. One thing we noticed was that as it got busier, the service really suffered. So, if you see a large crowd in a restaurant maybe delay your meal by a half hour and let the crowd thin out a bit. Also, the administrative policies were a little bit confusing and not consistent. One morning we showed up at the towel stand and were told that we could only have one towel per person. We come back a half hour later and now we can get as many towels as we want. I mentioned the issue about getting a reservation at Arrezzo. So, if you hear an answer you don't like then maybe you should just ask a different person at a different time...you might get the answer you want. I would definitely go back if I had kids, or was again with a group of friends that had kids. Probably wouldn't go back if it was just a couples retreat.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWould go back in a heartbeat!\u201d", "Author": "Angel795", "ReviewID": "UR125948411", "Content": "Just looking at the photos posted, makes me want to go back!

We upgraded to a 1 bedroom which was beautiful and clean and we were on the ground level we could enjoy the pool while our 18 month old daughter was napping. Here are my comments on a few key areas: The food \u2013 gourmet is probably not the word I would use to describe it. It is much better than other resorts I have been at, and there was always something for our daughter to eat. We tried Tsuki the last night there, and it was delicious, we wished we had tried it sooner. Ezekial was one of the best servers we\u2019d had in our entire stay! There was one night when there was a wait to go to this restaurant so we did the seaside grill, every other night we were seated and eating within 15-30 minutes at the restaurant of our choice. Check In - Upon arrival we had a nice cool glass of champagne, our daughter had a chocolate milk. In our room was already waiting for us a crib, baby monitors, bottle warmer, and bottle sterilizer. At every restaurant there are a few toys by the entrance for your child to play with during dinner \u2013 this was all very much appreciated. I would suggest bringing some of your own toys and books to keep in the room and for at the pool. We tried to use the baby monitors they provided and just a note they were a bit fuzzy\u2026we had brought our own so you may want to do the same. The pools \u2013 they were a bit cooler, but our last few days there were so hot that it was very welcomed! It never bothered us or our daughter at all. They water was so clear and clean, all day there was someone keeping the pools clean. The infinity pool was the coldest with the breeze coming off of the ocean. The beach \u2013the water is very choppy with rocks at the bottom\u2026it just wasn\u2019t usable for us with a child at this age but again, we loved all the pools Kid\u2019s club \u2013 very clean and inviting, we only went in for \u00bd hr on our last day, but next time we will use the facilities a bit more. All the kids seemed to really enjoy it. The layout \u2013 you do have to walk max 5 minutes a bit to get from each end of the resort etc\u2026 I needed to burn off all of the calories I ate there each day so I welcomed the bit of exercise The rooms \u2013 I agree with others comments that the bathrooms were a bit dark but they were clean and the beds were very comfy. We were on the ground level and you could hear people above you sometimes but I still loved being on the main level. We did experience a few glitches throughout our stay, it was a bit tough to upgrade rooms as the front desk was kind of brushing us off. But we went every morning to inquire and by the 3rd day our diligence paid off. An employee at the resort \u201cshop\u201d severely overcharged me on a few items, which I discovered when a different employee was working and charged me less. So make sure you get a receipt for all of your purchases there. We had a few issues with room service, but overall it was fine, it was anywhere from a 20-45 minute wait. The location of this resort is fantastic...close to the airport, and Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable vacation\u201d", "Author": "JRIowa_8", "ReviewID": "UR125727537", "Content": "I was very happy with this resort.

It is a long, narrow road that looks like you are heading into the \"hood\". Ironically, this road was charming by the end of our vacation. The entrance and lobby were very simple. The \"deluxe room\" is large but only comes with double beds and no tub. We upgraded to a one bedroom penthouse suite on our second day. It was well worth the money! We didn't use the upstairs balcony much so if I were to go again, I would book the one bedroom suite. The room is HUGE with a large couch, table, kitchen, jetted tub, and two bathrooms. Hot water does seem to be hit or miss. We had fewer problems once we were in the one bedroom suite. Bring a hand held mirror! The lighting in both bathrooms was poor and it was difficult to put on makeup. I took my mirror and got ready on the balcony. The food was excellent. We especially loved the Italian restaurant. It did require reservations but we never had a problem getting in. The sit down food service is slow (average 2 hours for a meal) compared to US restaurants, but it didn't bother us. We traveled without children so we enjoyed the time visiting with our friends. This may have been a problem for us if we had hungry children waiting. The restaurant staff were attentive and very kind. We loved the pools (yes, they are not heated but they felt great with the February heat) and espcially the beach beds. We spent many hours reading and relaxing on the beach in comfort. The drink service on the beach was consistant and there were various activities going on (horseshoes, volleyball, water aerobics, etc.) if you wanted something to do. We found the staff throughout the resort to be very accomidating and attentive to our needs. Their responce was always, \"it's my pleasure\"! The grounds are beautiful!!! and constantly being groomed. We loved the monkeys, iguanas, and other wildlife from the neighboring preserve. We had a wonderful week of pure relaxation.

Or take a lesson from the locals, never heard any of their kids whining. This is my 4th trip to this area and maybe the other resorts did a better job at keeping the young ones in their own little area, but I dont recall being annoyed at almost every meal with crying kids. Which in turn effected the night life, everyone was in their rooms with their children. Hence no night life, I may be 50 but this place was a real drag.

This is an ideal holiday spot for families and highly recommend it. Travelling with an infant can be stressful, but the resort accomodated us by providing a crib, bathtub and baby monitor. We had a pool walk-out room so when our baby slept inside, we could lounge by the pool. It is clear that the staff (from grounds keepers to service staff) take great pride in their work. Everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The resort is small, so we never felt crowded or had to wait for anything. The spa is first-class and I would dare compare it to some very high end spas anywhere in the world. The atmosphere was serene and the service excellent. I'd like to address some of the negative reviews that almost turned us off this resort -the beach is lovely and perfectly sized for this size of resort. We always got beach chairs and were always well-served by the beach butler. The only negative is that once you get into the water, there is a rock shelf that might be intimidating to unexperienced ocean swimmers. However, the beach itself is clean and sandy. -the restaurants were great. We never had to wait to get a table at the buffet or the restaurants. There was lots of variety and the food was good. The only reason that I did not give this hotel an \"excellent\" rating is because I am comparing it to some very high end resorts in the middle east and europe where facilities and staff truly are excellent. Although we booked a room with a king sized bed, we received two doubles (which staff pushed together when we requested). The mini-bar was only restocked when asked (which we did daily).

After a much delayed, extremely annoying flight we arrived at 4 am at the hotel to be greeted by Angel and several other staff members. The welcome and the smooth, pampered check in set the tone for our entire holiday. The room we booked, a 2 bedroom penthouse suite was exactly as pictured on their website. The air conditioning was perfect temperature, everything was spotless and smelled wonderful. Our family travels alot and this was definitely one of the best set ups for a family with older teenaged children - lots of room and everyone had their own space. The resort itself was small enough and safe enough that we felt very comfortable letting them do things on their own. The layout of the resort was fantastic with the pools meandering around the villas and the swim up bars (with access at the sides for those not in the water) conveniently interspersed. The path to the beach is through a park like setting (not a long distance) with a tennis court, outdoor chess and checkers, ping pong, shuffleboard and swinging hammocks. The grounds are immaculate. When you turn the corner at the restaurants the view of the infinity pool overlooking the beach and water is breath taking. In the morning we would go for a walk on the beach and pick our chairs (around 8 am everything is available- it started to get busy after 9). The staff were very helpful and cheerful. There was always plenty of towels and you could also pick up cold water, sun tan lotion or books at the towel booth.Due to high winds we did not try the snorkeling or kayaks which are available for your use. There was also yoga, beach volleyball, water polo, water aerobics, horseshoes, and bocce to keep you active. We played tennis 4 times while we were there. Pedro, the pro offers lessons (for a fee) but you can also just play on your own. To book a court you just talk to him at the court. He'll provide the racquets, balls and cold water! On Sunday you need to go to Azulito's - the kids club to pick up the racquets. Too bad they didn't have lights because it would have been preferable to play in the cooler evenings. Although I didn't use it, my daughter said the gym was good for those of you wanting to keep up with your daily routine. My husband and I love to cook so we usually only dine out at very good restaurants. We found the food at all the restaurants very good ( I wouldn't call it gourmet) but much better than the average restaurant and outstanding for an all inclusive. The service we received at Arezzo and Tsuki however was comparable to the best restaurants at which we've eaten. A word of caution, we found the service got slower (not terrible) when we went around 7:30 - 8, no problems at 7. Arezzo, the Italian restaurant has a sommelier to help you if you wish to purchase a nice bottle of wine. The house wines are okay - they offer a couple of differnet reds or whites which depending on your taste you can find one you like. Their house champagne is good too. We used room service almost once a day and didn't have a problem. They always repeated your order back to you and even followed up with a phone call to determine if everything was alright. Although ther were alot of families with small children, there was a good mix of all age groups. This resort would suit anyone except those looking for a very loud Spring Break atmosphere. I liked the variety available at the resort - the livelier dining/beach area, the quieter pool sides and finally the absolute privacy of the roof top terrace. Depending on your mood you could go to the place that suits you best. Perhaps the thing that impressed me the most about the resort was their commitment to continually improve. Managers were often asking for your opinion on services, they were extremely apologetic if something went wrong. Given my experience and talking to others, I truly believe that those negative reviews are isolated incidents. Finally, although all the staff were friendly and very good - there were a few exceptional ones Caesar - our maid, Ezekial our waiter in Tsuki, Gregorio a waiter at the Beach Grill and Emilio, the bartender at Palmas.

Let me just say, if you expect 5 star service, then you should most likely be staying at the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton, but also, expect to pay a premium. I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews given and questioned each one while I was there. This is a 4 star based on the standards of this country. Food was very good at all restaurants. No, it is not \"high\" end as one may led to believe, but for Mexico standards, was probably as good as it is going to get. Flavours for breakfast, anything you may want and more, the fruit was exceptional. Service by Roberto was excellent in the morning, he would have our drinks ready upon arrival without asking. Yes it is buffet style, but did not feel that way at all. We ate lunch at the Beach Grill each day as it was easy, convenient and very tasty. Again, its lunch and following a big breakfast, you probably should not be eating a big lunch anyways. Dinner at Azzaro was very good, service was right on. The Matre'D, Jumanico, I think that is how you spell his name, took pride in taking care of his guests, including my family. Never waited for a table. Tsuki, well, Sushi in Mexico? Really, they should shut it down and replace it with a nice Mexican Restaurant, we are in Mexico. Room service was very good, prompt and order was always correct and meals warm. The property is extremely clean, rooms are well furnished, spacious and accomodates families of 4 with no problems. We stayed in Villa 14, you cannot have a bad view from this Villa as it is in the middle of the resort and next to Lizards. If you like civiche, you will have a very good one here, a must for lunch. Ground floor rooms are also very convenient if you have children. Extremely safe resort, there were NO issues with personal safety at this place or in the area. We walked the beach everyday, not once were we hassled. If you walk left facing the water, past the pier about 10 minutes, there is a sand bar in front of the Princess Resort, great for swimming. Take a look at that resort and then be happy you are at Azul Fives. I must end with the pool and temparture of the water. I have read a lot of complaints about the water in the pools being cold. People, it is Mexico and it was hot every day. Dipping into a refreshing pool was amazing! Heating the pools would be a total waste of money and resources, especially when they are not cold! So for those who find it cold, where a wet suit or again, stay at the Four Seasons, they may warm it up for you. I must add that I read a lot of complaints about slow service at the bars. I never waited more than 2-4 minutes for a drink, but got served almost immediately when ever we went to the bar. We are good tippers that may have had something to do with it but for the most part, we were served quickly as were other guests. Unfortunately, I did not see many other tippers, which is sad. Ceasr is a bar keep at the main pool and Zky Bar, seek him out, he is a super nice guy and will tend to any of your needs. The staff here are what make it all come together. Pedro at Beach Grill, Roberto at Flavors, the front end staff at Azzaru, including Gabriella and her manager, house keeping, and all the other bar tenders working the swim up bars. If you don't want to get wet, just go to the side, they will serve you. Not for couples if you don't like children, but a great family resort overall.

Feb. 16-23. We don't have kids. We are early 30s and were looking for a contemporary, modern 5 star experience, with personal service which was met and exceeded by the staff and amenities at Azul Fives. This is a small but deluxe resort with just over 300 rooms. Rooms: - check in was easy & quick. We checked in at 5:00pm and our room was ready. We were offered welcome glasses of champagne. - we stayed in a one bedroom suite. Upon check in we asked if there were any that offered a roof top patio and there was one available. - The rooms are spacious, beautiful, clean. Look exactly how they appear on the website. The roof top patio was outstanding. Two lounge chairs, 1 day bed, BBQ, a washroom up there, bar area, table for 6, jacuzzi tub (cool water, but that was ok for us in the 30 degree weather). We used the roof top every single day as the resort beach area is east facing. So, shade sets in around 4:00 and the roof top patio is where we would catch the last cpl hrs of sun. I recommend using room service to your full advantage. It's included, accurate for the most part and quick. We would order wine and champagne, cheese platter and fruit platter and hang out on the patio everyday for happy hour. Grounds & Beach: - immaculate grounds. Zero garbage. Staff are everywhere - checking PH levels in the pools, mowing the lawn, cleaning everythings. Hardly a leaf could fall from a tree without someone there to sweep it up. - River pool was very nice, however we spent most time either by the infiniti pool or beach. We preferred the beach - it was beautiful. For the infiniti pool, we would reserve chairs around 7:30 am without problems. For the beach, just drag your chairs wherever you want to sit at anytime of the day. the pool/beach was full but never seemed too \"busy\" which was nice. - No food allowed by the pools or beach which was nice as it probably would wind up in the pools or causing a mess. There are 2 nearby restos for lunch. It was not an inconvenience. - We enjoyed walking on the beach and checking out the other resorts (but ours was better!) Restaurants: - Overall, food was great. We would do a morning workout, and then grab a shake at the Shake Bar, Shakes were tasty and I particularly liked the use of fresh fruit. We would have breakfast at Flavours which was delicious and had everything you could want. Yes, it's the same offerings everyday, but you just need to ask the kitchen for what you want and it's done. As well, there is an A La Carte menu at Flavours for breakfast if you prefer. Some of the best omlettes we have had! - Lunch: Sea Olive had a nice salmon fillet and good chicken breast dishes. Killer chicken ceasar salad. If you prefer junk food (hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza... head to the beach Grill) Get the icecream!!! - Dinner: Tsuki was our favourite with outstanding sushi rolls, the chicken/beef skewers and asian noodle dishes were great. Busiest restaurant. So, my advice is to put your name on the list and head up to Sky bar for drinks. They actually come up there to get you when your table is ready. - All restaurants were good. Yes, mistakes happened and orders were wrong sometimes. This was due to the language barrier. Good manners and treating your servers with a lot of respect and politeness goes a long way. Every single server we met on our trip would do anything and everything we asked - even custom orders of food that we often requested. Their mission is to make you happy and we noticed it. We were very impressed. - We didn't get sick once and ate everything you could imagine. Drinks/bars: - Sky bar was great. Nightly entertainment we watched every night from 9:30-10:30 ish. We were impressed by the Michael Jackson and Circus shows. The fire show on Fri night was great. It was very busy up there. Very well done. - Drinks are good. Be creative and ask for something different. I recommend the Medina Dacquiri, Mango Dacquiri, Cesars. (they have Clamato!) Spa: - Better than many top end spas here in Vancouver. Best Relaxation massage I have had) People/ Other guests: - We met a lot of great people. Many Canadians go here which is great, because we are from Vancouver. I would guess around 70% canadians here. - not a lot of smokers and smoking isn't heavily advertised. (no ash trays in your room or patio or by the pool.) We are non smokers and appreciated this. - This is a kid friendly resort which we were initially worried about there being so many kids because we don't have any. The kids were so well behaved and did not bug us at all. People / staff: - By far the highlight of Azul Fives was the endless wonderful people that work there. It has left a lasting impression on us. Smiles by everyone and you could find any staff there and they would try to help you with whatever you needed. Special thanks to a few. - We met Jose upon check in. Jose is at the Bell desk. Superior service as he gave us a \"VIP tour of the resort as he drove us to our room\" He is a special guy. - Nelly at the Omlette station. She would personally deliver our omlettes to our table. - Ana at Flavours in the morning and Sea Olive for lunch. I thought she was the manager there and realized it was only her third day! Very talented and exceptional service. - Oscar and Agustus ( aka: Danny DeVito!). Great servers. - Cesar at Sky bar and the main pool bar - Luis and Hilario - these guys are the activities makers and run all the programs (volleyball, water arobics) - We were approached by Walter the food manager for feedback on the food quality and everytime we ordered room service, we received a phone call asking if it was accurate. *** Like any interaction with people, it goes a long way when you try to get to know the people who are serving you. It's important to know their names and greet them by it. Asking questions about them and showing you care and enjoy hearing about their life too, results in better service than any tip you can give. However, we did tip everyday....a dollar or two at all each meal to show our appreciation for their hard work. It was probably the best money we spent there. We would recommend Azul Fives a hundred times over to anyone. A comment about Mexico in general: Overall I can say that Playa Del Carmen is a great, culturally diverse city, with many good bars and restos. We went into town to explore, had lunch, went out at night to Coco Bongo. We always felt safe and would return without hesitation to the city any time of day.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAn honest review\u201d", "Author": "Y H", "ReviewID": "UR125155458", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Azul Fives (Feb 16-23). I must preface this review by indicating that I have never felt inclined to write a review for tripadvisor in the past. Moreover, I have always had a health sceptism about negative reviews on this site. Surely, the people writing the reviews must be too picky. I have never viewed myself as such. I also know that the management will likely respond to this post with the standard response that seems typical when there are negative reviews of the hotel - i.e. that it is apologetic for our experience and that it is apologetic with respect to our concenrs. In anticipation of that response, I would like to point out that our concerns were brought to the attention of management while we were on our trip and our concerns were not addressed. In my view, that speaks for itself and an apology or explanation now is too little, too late. In the interests of fairness I would like to point out that there were issues that we encountered that are not attributable to management and I have done my best to point this out when that is the case. The first issue is the food. The food is mediocre, at best. it is not gourmet experience, as stipulated in the marketing materials. On many occasions our food was inedible. For example, the steak we ordered was so full of fat that we could barely take two bites out of it. It was often cold, bland and tasteless. Azzero was okay but not the five star experience it is made out to be. Breakfast at Flavours was fine, but just fine. Sea Olive too, was also just okay. This is unacceptable for a hotel that makes the gourmet inclusive a centre piece of its marketing. With these types of expectations, one will surely be disappointed. The next issue was the service. We were treated very badly by at least two staff members. We were lied to in an effort to get more money for the resort. I will not delineate particulars here but suffice it to say, this left a very bad taste in our mouth. I must add, that this was the case, notwithstanding the fact that Azul Fives has many hard working, lovely people who do their best. It was confirmed to us by management that the hotel is understaffed and this is reflected by the slow service in the restaurants and the spotty/inconsistent quality of the service. The rooms are one of the positive aspects of the resort. We had a large suite and it was very nice. That being said, I could not use the jacuzzi as every time I turned it on brown water would come out. This was reported to the management but nothing was done about it. So too were our concerns about the staff members set out above. NOTHING was done to rectify or discuss this situation with us. As we were checking out, we were asked if we received a basket from the management to apologize for the inconvenience. We were told we had not. All we head in response is \"that's too bad\". This is not quality service. Finally, I want to add that it was confirmed for us by a high ranking member of the Azul team that Azul Fives is at the very bottom of the Karisma chain and we were questioned as to why we did not go to El Dorado. This was very disheartening to hear having spent a good amount of money on the trip. In conclusion, this is a 3 star hotel at the moment. If you have a choice, go elsewhere. As I say, were it not for my concern that others would experience the same treatment we received, I would not be writing this.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest vacation ever\u201d", "Author": "Fripou1", "ReviewID": "UR125154535", "Content": "Went from feb 16 to 23rd.

We were close to lizards terrace and the swim up bar that our favorite bartender Sergio worked. He was great and was always very attentive. Rooms were awesome, very modern and very clean. We bathed our guys every night and my wife and I both showered never once having any issues with hot water. Our kids did not find the pullout bed comfy so we just put sheets on the sectional sofa and they were happy. Two tv's in the room was nice so we could watch a show if the kids wanted to watch something else during down time. Cleaning ladies were great, it is true they come at different times during the day but we just adjusted to this. They always gave us what we asked (extra water, beer, pop, etc). Restaurants were great, flavors buffet we had breakfast every day and they have everything you could possibly want. If you don't enjoy this breakfast I would hate to read any review you may write about any resort. We also went to a few of the theme dinners at flavors, the mexican and Mayan nights were both very good while the Italian night to us was not good at all. Italian restaurant was good, we had a reso for 6pm and had no wait. Good food but not our favorite. Japanese Reston was our favorite, we didn't bring the kids to this one. They stayed with my wife's parents and had room service. The tempura, soups, sushi all awesome along with service. We liked the beach grill for lunch, buffet with salads and pizza's some enchillada's and other tasty stuff. At night it turns into a beach side steakhouse with fresh red snapper and other great dishes. Sea olive was Mediterranean and quite tasty as well. The kids liked it as it had onion rings. Lizards restaurant near our room was probably our only bad experience for food as we had lunch one day and they messed up our order, forgot things and took forever. We just went back to the room and ordered room service. Room service was great, food was good, friendly service, and came in a timely fashion. We always ordered so fruit trays for the kids and put some in Tupperware we brought and put in fridge for the kids. Pools were great, infinity pool was pretty nice and definitely the busy area of resort. We preferred the pool near lizards near our room. Little quieter for the kids etc. lots of chairs and convenient to be close to our room. We wanted an ice relaxing week and that is exactly what we got.

Used two combined Groupons, but also purchased the Gourmet all-inclusive option. Worked out to be an incredible deal. Arranged transportation to and from Cancun through Lomas travel. They were great with very professional and clean service. We needed a van with 3 car seats and they met our need perfectly. We have twin 3 year old boys and a 2 year old girl, so our experience was based on just wanting to go someplace warm and spend time at the beach all together. Upon arrival one of our sons hurt his face pretty badly and the resort was very responsive to provide us with medical care and arrange for transportation to a local hospital. The rest of the trip was event free. We had an attached 1 bedroom suite and a deluxe room, on the first floor of building 6. Perfect location for our kids. Steps away from the Kids club and kiddie pool while closest to the main restaurants and beach. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. You need to ask on check in for pots, pans, and utensils, which were quickly brought to our room. The 1 bedroom suite has a good sized kitchen and dining area with a large dining table. There is a half bathroom along with a main room next to this, followed by the bedroom and good sized bathroom with Jacuzzi tub. We had no hot water issues at all, even after bathing all the kids and ourselves. The fridge was stocked with beverages daily, and you could order room service 24/7. Most of the time room service was timely, but at busier dinner times it sometimes took a bit longer. When ordering, you are given a wait time which was very accurate. The restaurants were very nice, with great menu options and hard working staff. We felt that the main buffet restaurant could have been a bit more kid friendly, utilizing less glassware and having cups with lids available. Overall the other restaurants were a bit more kid friendly. The Japanese and Italian restaurants were outstanding. The Italian restaurant was as good if not better than most fine Italian establishments in NYC. The grounds and pools were very well maintained. Never had a problem getting chairs or beach beds. The beach was nice, but getting into the water was hazardous because of large coral rock formations literally just off shore. Even getting in the water just to cool off was a challenge. In this sense it was perfect for smaller kids because they could just play at the water edge all day. There are several pools that work well for adults as well as kids. Two of the pools have zero entry. The kids club has lots of activities, some supervised, but most geared towards parents just spending time with their kids. It has a room for movies and video games, a lego play area, an activity area, and a gym area. The kids gym cost extra for an hour long class that was well worth it. Our kids loved it. There is a nice adult gym with fairly new equipment and weights. Next to this is a Smoothie/juice bar with lots of really healthy options. The kids loved this, too. Wifi cost $50 for a week, or $10 per day. Easily accessible in room or throughout the resort. All things considered an excellent resort with hard working, friendly service and great restaurants. The all-inclusive option is a must to really get the most out of it. Special thanks to front desk man Nathaniel. He was very helpful to us from start to finish.

After looking through her photos, I knew I wanted to do a destination wedding. The girl I worked with recommended DestinationWeddings.com, specifically Kathy Murray. After calling and talking with Kathy, she was able to recommend a few wedding venues for us in Mexico that would be within our budget. When I first got engaged I had put together a list of people and an estimated cost for our wedding. The list was around 350 people and our wedding was going to cost $60,000. This was way outside our budget. After talking with Kathy I was able to learn that a destination wedding typically costs anywhere from $3,000-$10,000. That struck my interest. Three weeks before our wedding in Riviera Maya, I was watching the news and saw that the resort that we were going to have our wedding at had a natural gas explosion. I immediately panicked, since it showed that the resort was going to be shut down. I called Kathy and she was able to transfer all of our guests over to a FIVE STAR hotel called Azul Fives. This is a family friendly resort that has an amazing kids venue right at the resort as well. I was upset and nervous at first since I had never been to that resort, but put my trust in Kathy's expertise. I am so glad we did because of the fact that the resort was an amazing experience. It was a much nicer resort than we had originally planned to get married at and the resort was able to transfer over the same rates as the first resort.

The pools and pool bars seemed to close pretty early (I know..this is a family resort, but I wanted to point that out..). Distance to town. We got a taxi a few days, but would be nice to actually be able to walk to a few things. But you are basically so far from the main road, that walking is out of the question.

The property is beautiful and well maintained. The food was very good in the restaurants that we ate at. We ate at Flavors for breakfast every day and a few nights, the Sea Olive 3 nights and at the Italian for Valentine's day. The beach, although small and a little crowded was still enjoyable. The service on the beach was very good and the wait between drinks was not as long as some reviews that we read had suggested. The staff throughout the entire resort was very professional and very friendly. We had excellent service from all but have to mention the exceptional service of Aricelli in the Palmas bar, Jose in the Sea Olive and Domingo on the beach. The entertainment staff was great as well. We have been to resorts where the entertainment staff was a little too pushy, but Baxter and Luis were very friendly and respected your quiet time. We saw them socializing with guests of all ages. They played volleyball everday, played jenga with the kids and soccer and bocce with whoever wished to play. The last few days of our visit, a new beach butler named Eric started his new job and was great. He introduced himself and was around a few times during the day to offer bottled water and fruit. Our room, a one bedroom suite in Villa 12 overlooking the pool, was lovely. Although we travelled without our children, this resort is very family friendly. I would guess that at least 75% of the guests were families with small children. We have 4 children between the ages of 20 and 24, and they would have loved the resort during the day, but the place was very quiet come 8 pm. We did hear a fair bit of complaining from some guests, but we honestly never encountered any issues during our stay. The longest wait for a table at either lunch, dinner and breakfast was no more than four minutes. We did eat breakfast after 9 am most mornings when most of the younger children had left, and dinner was always after 8 pm. The funniest complaint was from a very vocal woman who complained about not getting a taxi instantly at 6 pm on a Friday night to go into Playa Del Carmen for 6 people.

We returned earlier today. We had read all the negative reviews (along with the positive ones) about the food, the bars, etc. We went with an open mind. We are a family of three, a couple with a 19 month-old son. We had never been to an all-inclusive as a family before. We were looking for a place that could accommodate us with a one-bedroom suite set-up for our room and enough to do for our son to keep him excited and interested all day. The resort exceeded all of our expectations. The Fives is a small, relatively quiet, beautiful resort ideally suited for those with families. We have no idea what it is like for singles or for a night life, because our night ended each day after we put our son to sleep at 7:30 with a few (or more) drinks on our terrace enjoying the quiet and recapping our day. If that sounds appealing to you as a traveller, give the Fives a try. Our family enjoyed all the different pools, the beach (which is beautiful, and a bit rocky - but swimmable even for a family with a toddler son), the many location and menu options for meals, the kids club, the monkeys (seen three times) and iguanas (seen many many times), the other families with young children, the nightly performances for children at the Flavours restaurant and the easygoing atmosphere that we felt throughout the resort. On day 7 of our 8 days at the Fives, our son Jack fell off a couch and injured himself below his eye. He needed medical attention (3 stitches), and we were near the beach at the time (about a 5 minute walk from the front desk). The staff moved quickly and efficiently to get us to the front desk quickly (by golf cart), where an ambulance arrived shortly thereafter. We were at hospital within 35 minutes of the injury, and one of the front desk staff came with us to translate what needed translating, and to guide us back from Playa del Carmen. Our son was fine in the end (after the stitches), and we rate the hospital in Playa Del Carmen highly. But the attentiveness of the staff at the Fives in the immediate aftermath of the injury and in the 24 hours that followed was impressive. The staff (and all of the other guests at the Fives) without exception were concerned about Jack and how he was doing, and all of them offered any assistance we might require to make the rest of our stay more comfortable. Our experience at the Fives was excellent before the accident, and our experience afterward solidified for us that this resort and its staff were exceptional. The pools are not too cold as some reviewers mentioned (they were warm enough with the sun for our whole family, including our son). The food was varied and well-prepared. The staff were friendly and attentive (special thanks to Ariceli and Victor). The bars are not all swim-up bars as some on here have said. In fact, every one of the swim-up bars welcomes walk-ups to the corner of the bar or at a separate access point, so you can always get a drink. We discussed why some reviewers on here have been somewhat negative (or very negative) about their experience, and we tried to come up with an explanation after comparing what some have said to our own experience. We have not been able to explain it. All we can think of is that some of the negative reviewers did not do enough homework or were sold something else, and so they had expectations that did not match with what they got at the Fives. Our advice to you is to read the long and detailed reviews by those that seem to have similar families and interests to you. Once you have, if you are still thinking it might be the place for you, give it a try. We are glad we did, and we will be telling all of our friends. We would recommend the Fives to any family (we saw lots of extended families at the Fives enjoying their time); any group looking for a smaller, quieter resort; any smallish wedding; and anyone else to whom the above description appeals.

Upon reading many different reviews, we were quite worried about going there. I found it to be a very beautiful resort and very clean. It's very family oriented with lots to do for the kids. We were 2 couples travelling without kids, but I liked watching them play and have fun. My BF and I remarked how well behaved they were. Some people have said that they had long lineups when going to the restaurants but we didn't find that to be the case. I think it depends what time you go. We usually went to Flavours or the less crowded Beach Grill for breakfast and never had to wait. Lunch for us was usually around 1:30 or 2:00 and dinner at 7:00. All the food was very good, but my personal observation was they they had the tendancy to undercook the meat. I'm not someone who has to have it overdone, but pork and chicken do need to be cooked properly. A couple of times I had to send food back to be cooked more. The service was unbelievably good. If I could rate it a \"six\", I would. A person travelling with us had food allergies and the staff were very kind and accomodating. Yes, the beach is rocky, but a short walk to the left will bring you to a sandy area for swimming. The week we were there it was quite windy at times to be on the beach so we hung out at the pool by our room. It was nice to have a grill there for lunch and we had some very good burgers and salsa. The entertainment was fun and we all enjoyed it. It's too bad more people don't go up to the lounge...it's very beautiful, but on most nights quite empty. We all enjoyed it very much and I would rate it as a 41/2 star if I had the choice.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Kelowna, bC Canada", "Title": "\u201cIan Goodland\u201d", "Author": "Goodland I", "ReviewID": "UR124442091", "Content": "The staff at the Azul 5 is the best and most happy of any resort we have stayed at previoudly.

I think they use to much cleaning solutions and it's too consternated for the floor and bathroom and the smell just linger in the room. So in my 3rd room i kept the doors open for 2 days and I asked them to clean without chemicals, just with water and the smell was gone. My room service was horrible, late by 2 1/2 hours and the order was completely wrong. And room amenities as far as shampoo and conditioner, just bring your own. I was told they don't have it and later discovered that some other rooms had all and even a cotton swabs, but not for us for the whole 10 days. Another discovery that all the families from Canada got much bigger rooms for the same rate that I paid. Obviously its disappointing if considering the not so pleasant beginning and the fact that nobody even offer to us to \"upgrade\" or some how make us happy. The beach is really rocky, not for children. the pools are cold, but we didn't care we came to be by the sea and not in the pool. The whole place was really clean. The people who work there were really nice and some just made my day! I did enjoy, but i believe it's only because my personality so positive.

We received excellent service, from friendly and helpful staff every day, all day long. The food was great, with only a few exceptions, but I don't know of any restaurant anywhere that gets it right all the time. The portions are smaller, which we liked. It gave us an opportunity to try different flavours. There seems to be more staff there than guests, and so the grounds and rooms are impeccable. Everywhere people are gardening, cleaning, painting. This is a family resort, so expect children to be there. If you want something without children, Karisma as adult-oriented hotels as well. For those with children, it is so welcoming to your kids. Lots of booster chairs, there is a children's program that has planned events each day. The toys that you can bring to the room are limited, so do bring your own toys still, books and beach toys. The pools are cool when you first get into them, but are the perfect temperature once you're in and you can happily float about as long as you want. We had no problem waiting for the restaurants or our food, but we also came right at 5:30 when they open up. Best Day picked us up at the airport and shuttled us to the hotel.

I was very concerned about staying at this hotel after the run of horrible reviews from the week before our stay. First, we used USA Tours to get to the hotel from the airport. Definitely the most economical and very reliable and safe. I traveled with my husband and 10 month baby. It was very easy to book online and paid through paypal. Their directions were easy to follow and they had a carseat for my infant. After arriving at the hotel, we were greeted nicely. After having requested Villa 4 or 5 because they were closest to the main restaurants we were disappointed to be booked in Villa 11. Basically, this is a small resort. The good is that frankly nothing is further than a ten minute walk, but there is not much room for switching rooms or special requests. Having said that we were booked in Villa 11 in the one bedroom penthouse. No room will ever be ready before three pm... period. We went to lunch at Sea Olive and our room was ready by four. The staff is friendly nice and very helpful. The penthouse was a large (larger then my first apartment) suite with a full kitchen, dining room and bedroom. There is a separate shower and toilet with a whirlpool in the room. I have travelled quite bit and the space was amazing. We have a rooftop that was also stunning, with a large hot tub, eating space and lounge chairs. I was extremely happy and now get why housekeeping takes so long. The rooms were cleaned in the early afternoon. It didn't matter to us. Sea Olive is so so. I felt this restaurant had the worst service. My recommendation is to give your full order up front so that you don't have to wait for the waiters to check on you. The staff is very very new. I would guess most of the staff have been there less than 6 months, thus the service issues. We also ate at the BBQ which I enjoyed even being vegetarian. The bar restaurants are very basic. The food here is certainly not gourmet. In general the food is ok, not amazing. If they didn't constantly say the word gourmet then they would be ok. I wouldn't bother with room service for dinner. We had dinner in the room because of some rain our first night and the food was not really great. edible but that's about it. The Japanese restaurant again is so so. I had realistic expectations by this point about the food. Again we didn't have service issues, but the main reason people must is that this whole hotel is woefully understaffed and the staff that is there inexperienced but they really really want to please so it was ok for us. As for the Italian restaurant... the food here was def the best but again they are not equipped for the amount of people at the hotel. Initally they didn't take reservations, we always eat early because of the baby so we never had to wait. The on display kitchen is super small and again they don't have enough staff. Surprisingly, the last night we were told we couldnt be seated because we didn't have a reservation. Apparently no one thought to tell the guests. I was very irritated and asked for the manager. They sat us after ten minutes and I was super annoyed to see most of the tables were empty. The asparagus and saffron risotto is great. I also enjoyed the portobello soup. The only other thing with the Italian rest is that there is no elevator so be prepared to climb two sets of stairs. Normally not an issue, but with a carseat and diaper bag etc etc annoying. The pools are not heated. But none of the hotels I looked at had heated pools so this was no shocker. We didn't have a issue with the temperature of the water. The baby loved the pool. There are two pools.. an infiniti pool in the main area and a \"lazy river\" which is just a regular pool that winds in between the villas. We loved this pool area. It was quiet and relaxing. There are three pool bars and two eating places. The service was fine, I had no complaints. I would suggest picking up some extra beach towels before you pack up if you want to either reserve your pool chairs or use the pool early They don't put the towels out before nine or ten. We were again up early because of the baby and were happy to have saved some from the day before. We did see most people reserved their pool chairs as did we. It is what it is. If you don't care, there are plently of chairs. We are just fussy where we want to be. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. I had no issues with the room and cleanliness. A couple of things came up the first day. The sinks weren't draining. They fixed it right away. There was a leak from the roof top the brought water into the hallway. Also fixed. There was even a super loud truck on the main road which was keep us up and the management took care of it. They provided everything we needed for the baby including a stroller, a bottle warmer and sterilizer as well as a monitor. The kitchen was completely empty but I am sure you could request whatever you need. The only annoying this was that they didnot have high chairs in the rooms so feeding our baby was annoying but hopefully they could remedy this. Every restaurant had a million high chairs and they were very clean. We never had a problem. Overall, we had a great time. The food was so so but they really accomodated the baby and satisfied all of my requests. The room was amazing and the staff was ready to please even with their inexperience. I think if this resort hired a lot more staff and get a few years under their belt it will be a great property.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cOnce you leave the property they treat you terribly\u201d", "Author": "111patricia", "ReviewID": "UR124220428", "Content": "I left me jacket behind.

Azul Fives is a very modern high end resort, and quite sterile, with no real Mexican feel, none of the usual thatched buildings etc. Not much atmosphere, little nightlife, but very good food and great service. We were asked by the staff quite a few times to fill out customer comment cards, and we had the distinct impression that the management and staff were doing everything they could to make our stay as good as possible. We had no complaints, only a couple of minor issues, so this review is to help decide if this is the right place for you based on our experience. The resort is partly all inclusive, partly timeshare, partly full ownership. Maybe this explains the lack of nightlife, and the lack of bars open in the evening as in other all inclusive places we\u2019ve been to. There are more staff here per guest than we've ever seen at any other resort, and they are all excellent! We had great service everywhere, and all the staff are very friendly and very attentive. Some reviews said the service was slow, but we found the pace just fine, we were happy to sit and drink and chat with each other, and take our time over each meal. I guess if fast food is what you\u2019re used to, you might find it slow. The resort seems to cater to families with young children, and there were lots around. We were fine with it, but if it's not your thing...... And this is definitely not a party resort for young people! The pool bars all close at 6 pm, and after that the only place to get a drink apart from the restaurants is the Zky Bar, and a small bar temporarily set up outside the Convention Centre where the evening entertainment is held. The Zky bar has no atmosphere at all, and was pretty empty any time we were there. There was some entertainment there each night, but basically one guy with a guitar playing some songs. Room service was included in our package, we didn't use it, but judging by how few people were around in the evenings, maybe lots of people did. If you want exciting nightlife, discos etc, this is not the place for you. There was a show held each evening in the Convention Centre, but that\u2019s not our thing, so no comment. We found the restaurants excellent, and definitely on the gourmet side. The Italian restaurant overall was very good, the lamb exceptional. People we met said the\u00a0lasagna was cold, we didn't have it, so no comment. The Sea Olive restaurant was excellent, with very good steak. The Beach Club Grill had the best red snapper I have ever tasted. Pedro our waiter was great, so were Marco and Diana the maitre d\u2019s. The Tsuki Asian restaurant was very good with great sushi, great Thai curry, we had a few drinks and had a great evening. Flavours restaurant close to the front desk was good for breakfast, with a great selection. The Beach Club Grill was good for breakfast too, with less selection, but a great view of the ocean while you ate. This resort uses photo ID cards, not sure of the reason, but it\u2019s less convenient than the normal wristbands. When you want a drink, or go to a restaurant, they ask for your card, write down your details, and return your card. Not sure why they don't use wrist bands like everywhere else. The grounds are immaculate and beautifully kept. On the beach the staff come round with jugs of beer, platters of fruit skewers, and in general they can't do enough for you. Aracelli was the best! We had the typical resort activities during the day, yoga, aquacise, beach volleyball, water polo in the pool etc. The beach was sandy, but areas of the shallows were rock and coral, with only one small clear area to get in and out of the sea. The snorkelling was quite good right off the beach, with many varieties of fish, moray eels etc. Our room was excellent, very modern, spacious, clean, lots of hot water (previous reviews said they ran out, we never had that problem). The toilet tank ran continuously, we reported it, but it was never fixed. A very small point. One couple in our party didn't like being on the ground floor, but since the resort was full it took a couple of days to be moved to another room. The other couple had a flood in their ground floor room, but it was very quickly dealt with, and they were moved to another room. Wifi was available in your room, and cost $10 per day, and could only be accessed once you had created an account. For some reason you could access it for free with no account at the infinity pool and Beach Club Grill, not sure why, so why pay for it? The weather wasn't the best while we were there, cloudy some of the time, with rain most days, sometimes heavy at night. Quite windy most of the time which made the sea rough, so we couldn't go into the water some days. Beach volleyball suffered too! The \"canal\" type pools which wind through the villas are quite beautiful, although quite cool, and the layout of the resort made it easy to get lost, and difficult to find your own villa, especially if you were on the wrong side of the canal. Maybe the tequila had something to do with it! Was it perfect? No. Was it incredible value for money? Absolutely!

It was a perfect set up for us. We had a penthouse suite with three bedrooms and living area complete with a rooftop deck. Being on the plus side of 50, we found the resort offerred the perfect mix. We played some great golf at two of the nicest golf courses I have played in a long time (not part of the resort but in close proximity). Tennis clinics, yoga, swimming, spa etc. provided enough activity for the non-golfers. What surprised us the most was the standard of service and the dining experience. Over the years and in trying many different destinations, we didn't have high expecations of either but I can honestly say that all the staff were gracious, accommodating, pleasant and competent. \"No\" is just not in their vocabulary. It was a refreshing change from other places we have travelled. We also found that eating in the restaurants was more of a true dining experience and didn't feel like an \"all inclusive\". We did bring our own wine so I can't comment that aspect but the food in general is really very good. Ditto on the service. No line ups to make reservations,no hassles waiting for tables and the variety was ample to satisfy our five nights. I agree with a few of the other comments that the hotel is not as beautiful or as luxurious feeling as some of the other resorts I have visited and it is really not that well layed out. But the other aspects mentioned above make up for it. I never got the impression that better service came with better tips. In fact, you want to tip the staff as they go the extra mile to earn it. The only one flaw I found which is easy to correct is the lighting in the bathroom. Really inadequate. Not major but an fyi to management. All in all, a great stay and great value for money.

We were slightly worried before going as the number of negative reviews is fairly high for a five stars hotel. The 4/5 average rating on Trip Advisor and the fact that very large one-bedroom suites were available at a very reasonable price made us choosing this Hotel. The roughly 1000 ft2 suite was $1415 per person on a double occupancy including the flight ticket from Montreal-Cancun with Sunwing. The suites are very spacious and modern. Look at the pictures at the Azul Fives web site, they are very representative. We discussed our observations about this hotel with three other families and we were sharing pretty much the same comments. The main ones are: The Pros: - Large and modern suites at reasonable prices - Very well maintained property. There is a large number of staff maintaining the property - Good quality and variety of food. Unlimited usage of \u201cA la carte restaurants\u201d. No reservation needed. A reservation is needed only for the new Arezzo Italian restaurant (it was not needed at the beginning of our stay but they introduced the reservation system to reduce the waiting time). We never really had to wait for restaurants as we were going to restaurants at 18h00. - Well adapted for families with young children. The hotel provided a stroller and a crib at no charge. They can also provide organic baby food if needed - Most clients were really nice and it was easy to talk with other parents around the pools while the children were playing - Nice and clean kid zone - The staff is generally very nice and truly interested in providing us with a nice stay. They smile a lot and say hello whenever possible - There is an adequate compromise between activities around the beach and calm near the pools - The Senses restaurant no more exists. This restaurant was available a few months ago for an extra cost and created some frustrations. Be careful with reviews made before December 2011. It was replaced with an all-included steakhouse open to the sea. The tuna steak is particularly good. - The new Arezzo Italian restaurant is very good. Definitively the best restaurant on site. Great service, good food The Cons: - The beach is not very large but it is nice and very clean. The issue with the beach is the entrance to the water. It is difficult to enter in the water as the ocean floor is unequal with some rock. If you use sandals, you can walk about 12-15 feet in the ocean and the ocean floor becomes very nice. Alternatively, you can walk on the beach about 5 min towards Cancun and you will find a much nicer beach that can be more easily used by kids. This is what we were doing. - The only aspect that really irritated us was the door lock. The doors are noisy. This could be solved relatively easily by installing some rubber/foam to absorb the impacts of the door lock. - Housekeeping inside the room could be improved. The rooms are clean but we think that a more in-depth cleaning is required at the change of customer every week or so. - The free wines are not very good. If you are not picky with wines, this will be okay for you. If you like wines, you will likely find the wines deceptive. The \u201cA La Carte\u201d wines are quite expansive if you don\u2019t want to drink the included wines. My wife and mother-in-law liked the wine but I didn\u2019t - The main lobby is not large and prestigious like it is in some other 5-star Hotel. This didn\u2019t bother us at all, but I heard people saying that they would expect more from a 5-star hotel - The free internet Wi-Fi that is available near the beach is very slow. I don\u2019t think the issue came from my HTC Amaze smartphone as it is very quick on my home Wi-Fi. I didn\u2019t try the room internet access as it was 15$ per day or 70$ per week. - Pavilion 5 (more specifically the rooms with the view on the tennis court) can be noisier than the others as all clients must pass in front of these rooms to go to the restaurants and the beach. It was not that bad as most of the Azul Fives clients are very respectful. - The suites should be equipped with two phones, one in the room and one in the living room (there is only one in the bedroom). If someone sleeps in the bedroom, it is difficult to make a call (to room service for example) without awaking the person that is sleeping. This was not a big issue for us, but at one point I went out to get something to eat instead of using the room service for this reason. Overall, we were quite happy with our stay at the Azul Fives and most of the \u201cCons\u201d comments above were relatively minors and did not affect our stay. The staff is nice, the property is extremely well maintained and the food is good and diversified. We honestly don\u2019t understand how people can give 1/5 or 2/5 for this hotel. We recognize that everyone has different expectations about a resort and that the Azul Fives has its weaknesses. But unless something really bad happened to the people who gave very bad reviews, we simply don\u2019t understand these reviews. A final note, as in all Hotels, if you give some tips for housekeeping and waiters (plan for a total of 10-15$US a day), you will get a better service. Keep in mind that the staff salary is probably 5 or 10 times lower than yours. Treat the staff well and you will be rewarded. If the Azul Fives management solves a few of the \u201cCons\u201d points above, this hotel will become one of the five best hotel in the Playa Del Carmen area. This hotel is best suited for people looking for a relatively calm hotel. It is definitively not a hotel for single persons or couples looking for a lot of activities and parties. If you have a family looking for activities and calm at the same time, this is a great hotel for you. Overall, we would rate this hotel as a 4.5 stars and our overall satisfaction level would have been 4.5 if this was allowed by the Travel Advisor Web site. As it is not, we had to choose between 4 and 5 and we decided to put 5 as we had a great experience overall.

Several members of our group were nervous about the food before they got here and they were all raving about it when they left. We had a couple private dinners with our group and the food was exceptional. The a la cart dinner restaurants had lots to choose from and I didn't have anything I didn't like. Tsuki was my favorite. We did not eat dinner at Flavours while we were here so I can't rate that, but the breakfast buffet there was great, with something for everyone. The food at the swim up bar restaurants was ok. Nothing fancy, but a good mid day snack. We ordered room service a couple times (at all different times of day) and never had an issue there. There is a health bar by the spa and gym with smoothies and they were all very good. I just wish they could also have a smoothie bar by the beach. We booked a 1 bedroom suite and upon arrival found out they put us in a 1 bedroom suite with the rooftop terrace which was AMAZING. We were in building 6, and I think we must have had the best view there is. We visited the spa for a couples massage and had a great time. It was so relaxing and I felt completely comfortable the entire time. Make sure to pack everything you need because if you need to buy a necessity at the gift shop it will most likely cost you an arm and a leg. The ocean directly in front of the resort does have lots of corral and it is not necessarily good for swimming, but we just walked down a bit (1-2 minute walk) and the water was clear, and not crowded. The pools here are all very clean and the way they are spaced out makes it easy to find a place to lounge. The biggest thing I can say is whatever issues people have run into here, you can tell they are working VERY hard to correct them. There are constantly people working, and maintaining the property. And every staff member, from the front desk, to housekeeping, to maintenance workers outside is just SO NICE. Everyone you pass says hello and is smiling. I just don't know how anyone wouldn't enjoy their time here.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis place was awesome for our first Va-K\u201d", "Author": "Bradley155019", "ReviewID": "UR123979172", "Content": "We loved it here, I dont eat crazy foods but they had food for me :) It was very nice and small rooms and grounds r always clean, wi-fi for 50 usd works awesome on iphone I found the bed to be hard on my neck but I have a nice bed at home so it was a down grade but maybe an upgrade for most.

We were not disappointed. All the good things people speak of are true. The food, staff and accommodations are excellent. We had issues with room placement and the staff went above and beyond and upgraded all 5 of our rooms. Our room flooded one day and maintainence were there in minutes. The \"food displays\" (buffets) aren't as appealling and plentiful as other resorts I've been to but the restaurants make up for that. The Italian and Japanese were our favourite however wait times can be long so go and put your name in and go relax and have a drink. The day we left they finally listened to their guests and were allowing reservations to the Italian restaurant. Some things they should look at improving are; the ID card vs. bracelets, such a tedious system. You need to show this picture card entering a restaurant and then you have to show again to the wait staff. Around the pool this system is terrible. Much improvement is needed for the entertainment location. It is a small conference room without a stage, difficult for all to enjoy. Also, there is no outdoor seating area to enjoy a drink and conversation. It would be nice to have a plaza area where they could bring in vendors like other resorts. The bar at the show area packs up right after the show forcing you to go inside to Skybar or to your room. One thing they need to address immediately is putting a rail around the waterways beside the walkways in that area. Everynight we saw guests fall in the water. One guy took the whole bar out. Some excellent staff to mention, Pedro in the beach grill, Jonathan, Hilario, Enrique and Elizabeth at the pool and of course Mr. Buffalo, didnt remember your real name but your management and attention to guests was remarkable.

Check in: The check in was smooth.. lobby is small and underwhelming.. but i don't spend time there so i didn't care. Grounds: Gorgeous and clean Rooms: Villa 14 Room 1414-1 - I bedroom suite ... Nicest room i have ever had.. gorgeous modern decore, 2 bathrooms, great layout for couple or family. Kitchen had no cuterly or dishware but was nice to have large fridge and dining table for room service. Great view of pool ... central location.. 4-5 stroll to lobby... 4-5 minute stroll to beach Huge Balcony with lovely lounge chairs and sitting chairs. Beach: very nice beach for relaxing.. nice views.. not swimable.. if your a big beach swimmer don't come here... but very nice to look at.. we loved it. swing beds on beach that you can reserve with Hugo... Hugo was by far the best person at this resort.. he worked his but off and did everything possible to make everyone's stay enjoyable. I actually saw him spot a gentleman struggling with some baby stuff and ran from the far end of the beach up to the pool area to help him. Such a great guy. Food/Restaurants: HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. I love my food.. and one of the main reasons i came to this resort...Because the resort markets this as \"gormet\" i was expecting good food. Not the case in most instances. We tried to get into Japanase restaurant 2 times .. waiting time was an hour. We tried to get into the Italian 2 times.. waiting time over an hour. (comments on Italian later on) The grill and the American restaurant were pretty good. Do not expect to grab ANYTHING IN regards to food and bring to your lounger or room .. they will not ABSOLUTLY NOT let you. Room Service: 5 items for Lunch and Dinner in TOTAL. Very limited selection. Ordered room service 3 times.. 2 of the 3 times was not edible, and was not correct... and was an hour wait.. 3rd time on last day was delicious, correct and only took 15 min. Management here is non existant... at least for us.. and several other couples/families we spoke to. Staff: All very friendly. Managment.. non existant!!! Kid Friendly: Very... great for families with young children.. I don't have children.. but the babies and young kids were so cute to watch. The odd loud kid .. but that's to be expected. Bars: This was very strange.. only bars are swim up bars.. there is absoltuly no where to go to just sit and and have a drink.. or grab a drink and bring to your room or lounger... very strange.. only swim up bars.. and the pools were quite cold... sometimes i just want a drink and sit and relax ... odd! Problems: For the first 3 days we did not have air conditioning. Everyday we called .. they came .. said was fixed after an hour or so of waiting.. and not fixed. Next day we would call.. wait .. they would come .. they would fix .. not fixed.. this went on for 3 days... sleeping at 25 degrees is not easy when you are a women... 45.. if you know what i mean. After our air finally got fixed we had a very bad leak in our ceiling.. I noticed when i almost wiped right out from the flood in our kitchen... once again the maintenance crew was back. this time for a few hours ... said was fixed. Day 5 - another leak in the ceiling.. this time so bad the dry wall came apart and thought the ceiling was going to cave in over cupboards.. yet another maintenance call.. LOL and another visit from our new friends.. the maintenance crew.... and yet again .. not fixed.. LOL Throughout this chaos i had left 4 messages with the Managment.. NO CALL. 2 times i was asked to wait while they located someone in my room and i would get a call back .. no call.. Finally a gentleman by the name of Milton who worked at front desk..took my information.. and actually had the leak fixed.. got us reservations into the Italian for all our troubles.. (many of which i didn't even get into) and said we would be pampered. WELL.. far from that.. my food at the Italian was not edible.. my mothers was delicious.. we waited 15 minutes so i could get something else.. he never came back.. so i just shared my moms.. after 25 minutes.. we just left as we were tired of waiting.. unedible entre still on table.. not my idea of pampering.. LOL But at least Milton tried.. and he was the only one really. We did see all the bad reviews a few days before our departure date and tried to change resorts.. but could not. I do feel because of these previous bad reviews they were trying to make changes in the right direction... not during our stay. The day we were leaving i did see a change in the room service menue.. they added a lot of items. I did see food being served by the pool which was an absolute NO NO the first 6 days. so they are trying.. overall BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT ANY RESORT.. out of 15 visits to AI in mexico. We spoke to about 10 or so other couples / families and they all had there problems too and some were very very upset. No comparision to their sister resort .. El Dorado...

We had a group of 10 (5 adults and 5 children, ranging in age from 5 months old to 10 years old). There were some minor things that we didn't like but that is expected (at least to us) when you book at one of these resorts. The Good: The food was great and our service (with the exception of one miserable guy at the Seaside grill) at every restaurant was good. There have been complaints about the resort being understaffed. I didn't see that. In fact, I felt that they could have left us alone more at the buffet restaurant as a few times, they tried to clear our plates before we were finished eating off of them! The grounds are beautiful and while you do have to walk everywhere, you can do so in 10 minutes, max. People complain about the beach being rocky. We were on it a bunch of times in bare feet and had no problems. Apparently, \"rocky\" means little stones and shells in the sand. It was not a problem. I do agree with the comments about the swimming at the beach though, you would need to walk a few minutes away. On top of that, the water is too rough for little kids but that isn't Azul's fault. The rooms were awesome in my opinion, especially for privacy with the kids. We had a 2 bedroom suite and they upgraded us to the penthouse which gave us the rooftop terrace and hot tub on the roof. We enjoyed this feature especially since we were given it for free. It is true that you don't have hot water up there but I filled up a pail from the sink in the kitchen with hot water a few times and added it and it warmed the hot tub right up. It was a little bit of work but the kids loved it. . We never had the problem with hot water in our rooms or towels not being available but we did have go get the towels ourselves while at the pool. The kids club was great and they are good with the kids. We had 2, 3, 5 and 10 year olds go and they all had a lot of fun. The resort was busy but whenever had a hard time finding chairs or getting drinks at the swim up (or any other) bars. On one of the days, my wife's card wouldn't open the door to our room. They figured out that there was a problem when the cleaning woman couldn't get in either. They quickly came and removed the door and replaced it, knowing that we needed access to the room because of the small kids. There is some excellent shallow areas of the pool for small kids to play in. It is true that the pools weren't warm, but I didn't find them cold really. For people who grew up, with unheated pools in Canada, you won't have an issue with the temperature. The Infinity pool is the coldest though, due to the breeze off the water and beach. The Not so Good: We had to wait on our shuttle for 45 minutes for 2 idiots at the airport in Cancun because they thought the bus could wait while they talked to timeshare people in the airport. That isn't Azul Fives problem though, it was TripCentral.ca's. Yes, I am talking about the guy that looked like Larry David. Our room kept getting cleaned at times when our baby was asleep so we kept declining. It was not anybody's fault, just where our room fell in the order. We asked beforehand to be placed in a building with our family members as we were hoping to be able to put all of the kids to sleep and hang out together. They put us in different buildings. I think we ended up being placed in the worst two buildings for a group travelling together. This, I feel, could have been fixed before and our option was to try to move one of the families mid-week. People don't want to do that. The fans in the bathrooms are super loud and turn on whenever you turn on the light. Hopefully, your kids can sleep through it if you need to turn that light on in the middle of the night. All said, we loved the resort and would recommend it to others if they were going with children.

My family with 2 boys- 6 and 9- just wrapped up 2 weeks at Azul Fives. Lots of lenghty postive reviews that covers lots about the resort so I will try to add something new. I did a lot of research before I booked the trip and suggest everyone does the same. I found that \"complainers\" were lured to the resort by the price and forgot to research as all their complaints were items tjat tje reosrt tells you about or other reviewers tell you about. The resort is very upfront that they cater to family so don't be surprised to hear crying, noisy kids....kids of young ages = noise. Don't complain about kid noise. That was your lack of awareness nothing to the resorts fault. The beach does have very limited access for direct swimming but we had lots of fun playing in the surf as my boys were more interested in the pools. We ordered room service numerous times and it arrived as we ordered and if not sooner than they had told us. We were in villa 4 that was central to everything. Only once we needed to call for restock of the fridge and after that we had regular service. A postive laidback attitude goes a long way to enjoy the vacation and the staff are more than willing to help the \"happy\" travellers. We needed ice for our drinks and as we were beside the rainbow bar, it was quite simple to bring over our bucket and it was filled no questions asked. We never had to wait for a table at the restaurants as we arrived right when they opened for the popular Italian and Japenense to get a table or went elsewhere as we missed the \"first sitting\". The food is fabulous and perfection does take time. I had the impression by the time for food and the quality of the food, that they do not have an assembly line in the kitchens but prepare as much as they can fresh for you. Just reflect on how long takes for you at home to put a meal on the table. I would rather have fabulous tasting food that is hot and fresh vs food that was banged out in 15 mins to get the people in and out. Flavours does get busy with the young families right around 8 to 8:30 in the morning. I witnessed lots of staff working hard to make changes to make the experience better. It is a \"young\" resort and will continue to grow and get smoother as it continues to improve from realistic feedback. My only complaint for the whole trip is the other guests were witnessed picking up my camera that I dropped on the sand by the chairs and kept the camera for themselves. All that was on the memory card was photos of my 2 boys playing in the surf. Shame on you for keeping the camera!

Internet is impossible....but the staff will tell you it is fine. The information is inconsistent. Your map will say the beach grill is closed on Friday, but, alas, it is open. So some times the surprise is pleasant. The staff is very optomistic and their effort is great; but execution lacks. The rooms have the worst lighting I have ever had in a hotel room. You cannot put on make-up or contact lenses here! Bring a lighted mirror of your own.The basic rooms have two double beds, another problem for couples. So the good news: the pools are lovely. You'll get great pictures. The food was really good. Don't miss the \"Health Bar\" for fresh smoothies - it is hard to see. It is right next to Flavours Restaurant and The Spa. The Entertainment Staff is excellent. Just wondering why the children were dressed for dinner, but so many of the adults did not observe the dress code.

If you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to message me. We just returned from our 2nd visit to Azul Fives and I didn't think it was possible, but our trip exceeded our expectations AGAIN! We traveled with our 3 1/2 year old daughter and splurged for the one bedroom suite (highly recommend). The suites are so great for families because it allows privacy, yet closeness as a family often needs, and they are huge with a full kitchen, dining room and 1-2 balconies (depending on the layout of your room). Everything about the room is wonderful- I especially love the shower, it is heavenly! Never once did we have a problem with hot water. We also had a penthouse terrace, which was amazing and we would have put it to better use if we had been traveling in a group, but it was so lovely - the views were amazing! I already knew that the tubs on the terrace only have pool temperature water, so it is a private pool as opposed to a private hot tub :-). The housekeeping service was spotless. If we ever needed anything we just wrote a little note and it was taken care of. We also had our fridge restocked every day. The only maintenance issue we encountered was the fact that our elevator was not working for 4 of the 7 days during our vacation- not a huge deal as the exercise was necessary, but occasionally an inconvenience since we were on the third floor. Food- The best AI food I have ever had! We loved b-fast every morning at Flavours. A few mornings there was a line to be seated, but at most it took 15 minutes. The food section is great- they basically have anything you could ever want and the fruit selection was superb! I also loved having the option of authentic mexican b-fast items (plantains, beans, tamales, etc). Sol is a hostess at both b-fast and lunch and she is such a sweet woman that made the vacation extra special for our family, as she was so very sweet with our toddler. She really is a shining star at Azul Fives. Lunch is quite casual- the addition of the beach grill was a really great idea. The ribs there are to die for- seriously I could have eaten them everyday we were there! Nice salad bar and pizza bar. For a slightly more formal lunch, you could opt for Sea Olive. The Ceviche is amazing at Sea Olive! I ordered 2 of them one day! The dinner options have really improved since our trip last year to accommodate the resort being fuller. The Italian restaurant (Arrezo) is the BEST food I have ever had on any vacation. We ate there 3 nights because we were so impressed with the food and service, not to mention the view!!!! As you can imagine, this is a popular restaurant, so if you want an \"in and out\" experience, I would arrive as soon as the restaurant opens (5:30pm) to be seated first. One night we were in a hurry because we wanted to make it back to the room to watch the 49er game and we just told our server and he was very accommodating! We also enjoyed our dinner at the Beach Grill- I really liked my salmon and my husband had the filet, which was good. We went to flavors only one night for the buffet and it was good, but I felt the al carte restaurants were so good, we tried to make it to one of them each night. Oh, and we loved Tzuki! The sushi was great and the main dishes were also very tasty. The drinks at this resort are fantastic! They will really make you anything that you want and as strong as you want it. And they have top-shelf alcohol (kettle one vodka, Don Julio Tequila, etc). We used room service several times- it was very good. We did have to wait 30-40 minutes from order to delivery, but we just planned for that, so it wasn\u2019t a problem. The grounds are just stunning! Over the past year, the landscape has really matured and the grounds staff are doing such a great job. The beach is great! There were always lounge chairs to use, but the beach beds are in high demand, so if you want one you have to get up early to reserve, as it is first come first serve. We got one 2 days during our trip and really enjoyed it. We saw a few travelers fighting over beach beds and acting really ridiculous\u2026it was actually embarrassing to watch how some people were behaving. The water right out in front of the resort is not swimmable, but all you have to do is walk 3 minutes down the beach to the left and there is a coral free swimming area. The pools are wonderful and very refreshing! The pools are not heated, but completely comfortable with the Mexico climate. Our daughter really liked the zero-entry pool and the kiddie pool by the kids club- there were so many nice families there, so it was fun for the kids to play together and nice to make friends with other parents while on vacation. The Azulitos kids club is really one of the highlights of this resort. They really have it figured out! The My Gym room is so fantastic and used a lot more now than when we were here last year. All ages enjoyed the kids club area and the ladies that work there are super sweet with the kids. All day they have scheduled activities, such as: sand castle building, beach soccer, water balloon fight, tea time, cookie decorating, etc. At night they also had very fun activities: Face painting, pi\u00f1ata, talent show, etc. The only bummer is that they don\u2019t have the jog strollers any longer- we were able to borrow an umbrella stroller from housekeeping, but the jog strollers were greatly missed by our family. The spa is really very beautiful! One of the most amazing spa experiences I have ever had. I decided to splurge and enjoy a spa treatment with my daughter- it was truly a beautiful experience that I will forever remember. A couple of the other days I had a 30 minute massage on the beach by one of the venders down to the left of the resort. I paid $20 for 30 minutes and it was really great- you could hear the waves crashing and the massage therapists were very sweet and professional. The way I looked at it- the spa was an overall amazing experience and the massage on the beach was just a stress reliever. I highly recommend both options. Every morning of our vacation I went to tennis lessons with Pedro. He is a wonderful teacher with a true passion for tennis. We are so grateful that Azul Fives is a resort our family can return to year after year and experience a luxury experience that is completely family friendly. The staff at Azul Fives is really what make the resort extra special. The following staff made our trip extra special and we look forward to seeing them when we return!

That was a nice touch. We then found all the staff around the property remarkably courteous and engaged with their task of making us feel comfortable. Working in the service industry myself, I was struck at how every employee we met during the week took the opportunity to make eye contact with my family and offer a nice \u201cHola\u201d and a smile which sent the message \u2013 \u201cHappy to have you here and I am available to help if you need\u201d \u2013 very nice touch. The amenities were second to none in my experience with each detail aimed towards pampering and enhancing the experience. Our suite was amazing, the linens and atmosphere were chic and a delight to the senses. We found the beach staff amazing as well. Very accommodating and attentive the whole day \u2013 they never seemed to tire! Whether in finding us lounges or taking our drink order by the Sea, the beach staff were dialed in the whole time. The Restaurants were all so good. I kept looking for a dip in either Service or Quality but every restaurant was fabulous. We tried them all except the Seafood restaurant only because my wife and son do not like Seafood. The ability to truly recreate international flavours was very good. I expected all the food to have a similar taste seeing as we were in one region of the world but the chefs truly got each cuisine right in my mind. From Italian, American, French, Spanish and Mexican it was all so good. The food being so good really enhanced our week. My brother has been to other resorts in other countries and the food has been all very similar which makes the overall experience go down as the week goes on. Not so at Azul Fives \u2013 the food was always top level. The Service was very good too at the Restaurants. I found management\u2019s ability to adjust staff levels to peak times at different restaurants very well done and seamless. Over all we found the week to be a supreme experience worthy of the 5 star designation they have. Go to Azul Fives - it does not disappoint!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201c6 Stars for AZUL FIVES\u201d", "Author": "ChaChaPablo", "ReviewID": "UR123709178", "Content": "\u201c6 STARS for AZUL FIVES\u201d Pending review We are frequent sun resort travellers who just spent a fantastic week at AZUL FIVES Hotel Resort.

We stayed in building 2 near the main building. I read that it took someone 15 minutes to walk from building 1 to the restaurants which seemed ridiculous so I timed it. It took us 4 minutes! Seriously? This is a 360 room resort, everything is max 5 minutes away! We had a one bedroom suite which was huge and gorgeous. Tons of room for the 2 of us. Our room was cleaned very well everyday. Cristel our maid was wonderful! No issues at all at any time with hot water. We had enough water always for both of us to shower. We didn't spend much time at the beach as there is a lot of coral there. It is rocky but not the resorts fault. Blame mother nature. Walk a few minutes to the left and swimming is just fine. The pools are just fine. Not sure what people are whining about. It is hot out and the pools feel GREAT during the day. We didnt have any issues. And actually if you feel the jets going into the pool, they blow warm water. Pools were all great and pool bars were a blast! The infinity pool was our favorite! No issus ever with pool chairs, the odd time we had to move a chair to have 2 together but no big deal My only pool complaint was kids in the adults only pool. I needed a break from bratty kids and we couldn't get that. Was dissapointing. But we solved that and went to the spa. Their hydrotherapy system is fantastic and we took advantage of that almost every day! Restaurants: Flavors was not my thing but I have always hated buffets. Omelettes were good there though. The grill was also open for breakfast everyday we were there but was similar to the buffets. We usually ordered room service for breakfast or headed to the best kept secret, the smoothie bar. So good and they don;t tell you about it. Newar the main building next to the gym, there are two tables outside and the smoothie bar is in these doors! The Green Power and the Manilla were my go to breakfasts! Opene 8 till 4 and you must go! If you like Booster Juice, you will love it here! The Grill for dinner was average, not my style. They grill your meat and the rest is buffet. Sea Olive was decent for lunch and dinner. Nothing blew me away but was good. Better than most resorts and I have been to many 4.5 and 5 star resorts. Tsuki was pretty good for Japanese. Gret rolls, good dishes from what we had. The fried ice cream for dessert however was disgusting. I only tried it due to the rave review we heard but it was seriously a blob of fried dough around ice cream. Ick. my guy hated it and I only had a bite as I am not supposed to eat gluten. It wasnt worth being sick all night. We had dinner here only once. Arrezo.... where do I start? We ate here for 4 dinners during our stay! FANTASTIC! There are no reservations at this resrot so my advice is, decide when you want to eat and head out 45 minutes before that, put your name on the list and go to Zky and have a glass or 2 of wine upstairs. They had entertainment up there most nights. Not a big deal. 45 minutes is nothing and this place is worth the wait. Wine is like most resorts and goes from awful to not bad. Didn't mind the Pinot Noir or the Tempranillo. The whites were terrible. Service in the Italian was fabulous. We got handshakes and hugs every night. A $20 tip goes a LONG way there. And they earned that and more from us. the mushroom rissotto and asparagus and saffron rissottos were FAB! The beef carpacio was very good. As was the Caprese salad. The boy loved the lamb and the ossobucco. He also loved the chocolate mousse and it was tasty. The creme brule I was only able to resist 2 nights out of 4. Very good! They have a couple gluten free items on the menu and they were very accomodating to use that pasta with different sauces on the menu. Was very sweet of them. Food was from ok to awesome! Room service was decent. We ordered salads, breakfast and the boy loveed the crispy tacos. Anytime we asked for something we got it regardless of whether it was on the room service menu. Great service. We only had one room service issue one morning we ordered at 6am to eat before we left at 7:20 for a tour. It never came and we had to leave. No big deal, we grabbed some fruit from the buffet and went on our way. We saw some of the most embarassing and rude people at this resort. Treating the staff like garbage is not the way to get treated well. Saw a group of 3 Quebecers freaking out on a server because they couldnt take the dishes from the restaurant. He told them they could order room service when he said he wasnt allowed to transfer the food from that restaurant and they were disgusting to him. I apologized on behalf of Canadians. Another couple checking in was making such a fuss about room service dishes outside the room and how horrified they were. Um, do you expect the dish clearing fairy to take them away? Give these people a break. Dishes were alwasy gone by the morning from our door. Simmer people. This woman pulled the whole, I am trip advisor reviewer to the front desk and stormed out to \"take pictures\" You are an embarrasment lady and I hope you read my review, Don't be a cow and maybe things will get a little better! :-) The spa was great, we had moonlight massages on the beach! HEAVEN! Shows were small but its a small resort. The circus show was good, the fire show on the beach was great! Go see that one. We headed t Zky most nights and always had a blast with the same group. Usually around 50 people up there at night. Fun place and we always had great service up there. She remembered what we drank everytime. We never had to ask for a drink. They also made my guys birthday a really fun night! Thanks for that ! All in all this is a wonderful resort. People need to relax, chill the heck out and realize you are on resort. This is a small resort with not a lot of walking at all. 5 minutes max from end to end. So there really isnt a bad room anywhere. Some are close to the beach and the a la cartes the others are close to the front, the spa, the buffet and gym. But really not an issue, nothing is far. The staff are for the most part wonderful and welcoming. It is a boutique hotel so dont expect a grand waterfall entrance. It is a chic and cozt feeling place. If you hate the 1600 room resorts, give this one a try. This is a family friendly resort, so if you are getting away as a couple =, be prepared for this. Next time we may try the ElDorado properties because bratty kids made me nuts more times than I can handle.

We chose the Azul Fives because it advertised itself as so child and baby friendly. We did not find this to be the case. I'll start wih the good-- 1. The resort grounds are beautiful. The grounds are very well maintained, and the pools are beautiful. 2. The suites are beautiful. We had a one bedrom condo and it was very very nice. Huge soaking tub, nice modern kitchen, large couch to lounge on. Sadly, that's it for the good. And now the bad-- 1. The service was awful. The waits in the restaurants were ridiculous, I was so glad I did not do all-inclusive and spend my vacation waiting in lines and for service. After two meals in the hotel, we abandoned it and drove into Playa or cooked in our suite for our meals. 2. The food was awful. We tried almost all of the restaurants and I'm sorry to say the food was very subpar--bland and poor quality. Absolutely not worth the all-inclusive prices. Sorry, but using Cheez-whiz on nachos is just not acceptable at a 5 star resort in Mexico! I ordered tiramisu in the Mediterranean restaurant and it was absolutely not tiramisu. It was a tasteless gelatinous mess. Even though we paid for our meals at the restaurants (extortionate prices at that), we were not offered chips and salsa or bread with our meals. We saw waiters bringing these out for the all-inclusive people, but somehow we were second class citizens even though we were PAYING for our food. 3. The hotel overpromised and underdelivered. We chose it because we had read it was baby friendly. They advertise on their website that you don't need to travel with baby equipment -- they have everything. Well, they had nothing! We asked for a high chair for our room b/c we had a kitchen and planned to at least have breakfasts there. We were told no. We were never offered any other baby equipment for our room as advertised. The website said there have a welcome gift bag for kids on arrival. Our son was offered a bottle of water and no more. Everything was just slightly less than how they advertised it. 4. We had a full kitchen that was advertised as \"fully equipped\" yet had no silverware or utensils. We had cups, bowls, cutting board, pots and pans, but not a single spoon, fork, or knife. We asked if they could be provided, we were told no, though they did finally bring us spoons and forks, but no knives. We had to swipe one from the restaurant. 5. Finally, we were on the ground floor and had a pipe on our \"lawn\" that leaked sewage. We complained about this repeatedly yet never had anyone come and check it out. The first day we were there our 1 year old promptly stuck his finger in it and put it in his mouth. Despite repeatedly going to the front desk about this, no one ever did anything and we were unable to use the outside at all. 6. Oh and as others have said, the pools were cold. Pretty much not usable at all. The beach is rocky, and not nearly as nice as the beach in Playa. I would definitely not stay here again, and would not recommend others to go here.

Our experience was bad from arrival, the lobby area and front of the hotel are not welcoming at all. We arrived at noon and were told that our rooms were not ready and to come back at 3pm - we had no one greet us or give us orientation so we did not know where to go or what to do. Finally the room was ready we were told it was deluxe - far from it. The toilet did not work for 3 days, the mirror was off the wall, the safe did not work and the TV did not work. When they came to fix the toilet they left black sole marks on the floor which stayed there for two days. We did not have any contact from the hotel regarding the hotel or the services offered, there was nothing in our room about the restaurants, room service or anything about the hotel. Now comes the bad food....this was our first trip to Mexico but other guest told us the food was of Cuba standard. For a 4.5 star hotel that states \"Gourmet\" it was terrible - the buffet at Flavours was the worst buffet we have ever been too. There was no steak or seafood available. Our last night dinner we went to the Italian restaurant waited over one hour and then were told we were not on the waiting list - they had written our number on a sheet at the top of the stairs but the one they were working off was down stairs, we saw other guest going in that had come after us so we brought this to their attention and they added us to the bottom of the list, when we went to leave they said they had a table for us.When seated we saw that the restaurant had more empty tables than the number of waiting down stairs. We left before my husbands main course came, the delivered mine when they delivered his pasta course - even this service took a very long time. The only good thing we have to say about this resort is that the breakfast omellets were excellent and Oscar at the Palma pool bar was very nice.

Worst resort experience i have ever stayed at. I dont usually complain and take things in stride but after a few days it started to ware on me.. The showers only have hot water for maximum of id say 8 minutes so if you go as a couple best make it quick. Our toilet was at times running non stop and when told maintenance they said it was suppose to be like that. The first night getting their we sat out on our balcony and relaxed and when we went to bed we left the balcony door open to get the breeze in. Apparently you cant have the balcony door open and expect the front door to be closed... we woke up and our door was completely wide open after we had closed it. the breeze through the balcony door opens it, plus the front door didnt always close. we notified the staff but nothing was done. Our neighbours were extremely loud coming home every night at 4am and waking us up. i know this is not the hotel fault but we asked to be moved because after 4 nights of this happening we were very frustrated. they said they would look into and we never heard anything back. The pools are absolutely freezing and the beach in front of the hotel is un-swimable due to the rocks. only place other then restaurants, to get a drink were the pool bars which you had to be in to get a drink or reach around and ask for one. the restaurants had decent food but problem is it takes way to long to get it. typically you put your name on list for table and wait 45 minutes. once you sit down to time you leave it can take anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours if not more. i saw a family sitting at a table beside me in the asian restaurant where the 2 little kids where falling asleep cause they had been their so long. at night time their is nothing to do you are almost forced to hang out in your room. the entertainment is lacking and the Sky bar is pathetic. your lucky if their is more then 15 people in their and even still takes 15 minutes to get a drink. Out of the 7 days we were their, 3 days our room did not get clean. so no toilet paper, fresh clean towels, no stocking of fridge. the days we got frustrated with the restaurants we called for room service which is just as bad. took just as long and when it got their it was wrong. we asked for water we got beer, asked for cesar salad no chicken and got chicken. we had asked for a king bed and were told we are getting one but when we got to our room it was 2 individual double beds that we had to push together. the final straw was on the morning of check out when we were cleaning out our safe we realized our ipod had been STOLEN!! i know they will try and justify that they cant get into the locks but it bunch of B.S . What if we had locked it upon us leaving the place, how would they get into it then. the funny thing is tho they invite you to a meeting here they want you to buy into this place(timeshare, though they wont tell you thats what it is), not likely going to happen. the resort sucked and it not just my opinion, we talked to about 8 other couples from canada who were their at same time as us and they said all the same.

We returned from our 6 nights at the Azul Fives yesterday, January 19th. The purpose of our trip was for my wife and I to share a relaxing week before I started a new position that would require a lot of travel. Overall Resort - The grounds were outstanding. Beautifully manicured and we saw grounds crews working on it every day. The rooms are divided amongst 13 3-story villas, none having a view of the beach/ocean. Pools and beach areas are kept very clean and attractive as were the restaurants. Room - We had a 1 BR suite which was excellent. The pictures others have posted here do it justice. It was very roomy and the bed, while very firm, actually helped my back rather than hurt it (I was surprised, too). A couple of points about the room: the light by the sinks is limited so to put on make-up or to shave is more difficult than it needs to be. The kitchen is useless-ish due to the lack of any utensils or plates. I wasn't about to cook on vacation but there were a few times that I would have liked to have had a fork or knife around. A roll of paper towels would have been fabulous. It is great to have a full size refrigerator, though. We never experienced what we thought was a dirty room. One thing, though, I think they do a really complete disinfecting between guests and the first day there the smell of the cleaning solution was overpowering and irritating. We opened the windows and sliders then went to dinner and walked the property. By the time we got back the smell was all but gone. The next day it was and it never reappeared. Restaurants - We lunched the first day after we checked in at Lizzards Bar since it was near our room and we wanted to pick up something light. I had a pizza and my wife the nachos. I have to admit, this set off red flags for us: the pizza was like a Totinos frozen pizza and the nachos were ball park nachos, complete with velveta sauce. We thought if this is gourmet, then we're in BIG trouble this week. It did not get better that night when we ordered room service. I had the chicken cordon bleu and my wife had the filet with mustard sauce. What I ACTUALLY got was the kids chicken and fries. My wife's filet was tasteless and the \"mustard sauce\" was just brown gravy. Oh oh... We ate at Flavours each morning (mostly because it was the only place open for breakfast!) where there is a breakfast buffet. Yes, the buffet is indeed the same every morning, but it consisted of: omelet station, eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, french toast, mini-pancakes, pasteries, cereals, fruit, yogurt - you get the picture. For those that complain about lack of variety at breakfast each day - I'm not sure what else you need! Lunch at Sea Olives was, surprising. My tacos consisted of three tortilla wedges with chopped seasoned chicken laid across. The taste was tasteless and the portion size anemic. I don't mind smaller portions at all, especially when you walk away saying, \"wow, that was fabulous\" but Sea Olive underwhelmed. My wife had the chicken quesedilla which was fine but not fabulous. That night we tried room service again and, while they got the order correct this time, my Cordon Blue was laid over a bed of egg noodles with the obsequious velveta sauce. I don't care where in the world you are, liquid cheese never qualifies as gourmet. My wife had the spaghetti with butter sauce which was really egg noodles in butter. So much for room service. We were really a bit scared heading into the meat of the week but we discovered that Flavours had a theme buffet each night for dinner; the Seaside Grill had burgers and fries for a quick beachside lunch (not fabulous, but it worked) and Arezzo (Italian) was fabulous. The courses at Arezzo were really good - especially the variety of breads at the beginning of the meal. My lasagna was delicious and my wife enjoyed her cheese cannelloni. If you're even a bit hungry, though, make sure you get the grande portion. My lasagna piece was smaller than you would get at a Macaroni Grill or an Olive Garden and it was the \"grande\". This time, however, the taste certainly made up for lack of size (though it was certainly reasonable) and this is more of an observation rather than a complaint. The buffet nights were definitely above average with a lot of variety and the food quality was pretty good. Service at all the outlets was excellent as was the staff overall at the Azul Fives. Beach - Gorgeous. Soft, beautiful sand and a lot of lounge chairs that could be full at the peak of the day but usually not. This could have been because the week were were there (1/13 - 1/19) was slow but we never had a problem getting a couple of chairs together. There were a few signs of seats being saved but I didn't see many. We usually got to the beach from 8 - 9 AM. I can imagine that if the week was super busy it may be tough, but we never experienced an issue. We could not, however, go swimming. The red flag was up for our entire stay. Not a huge deal to us since we're mostly readers and not swimmers, but I do like to go in the water from time to time and was unable. To be fair, the surf was pretty rough the first few days but the last day it was pretty calm and the flag stayed flying. Down the beach toward Playa del Carmen folks were frolicking in the surf so that was a bit disappointing. To reiterate here, the lead into the water is filled with rocks - it is what it is and given the protected nature of the reef it probably can't be changed. Once past the rocks it looked nice, however. Spa: Tremendous. I'm an occasional spa goer while my wife is an avid spa goer. We've been to spas around the world and Vassa was perhaps the best spa experience we ever had. We got the Romantic Journey which was a hot stone message for 2 and relaxing facials. The design once you get behind the doors is like a Japanese garden. The locker rooms were spotless and we changed and went upstairs. We were first brought to a relaxation room where we laid down on very comfortable lounge chairs and treated to a warm compress on our shoulders and eyes. After 10 minutes were led by our therapists, Betty and Alejandro, to our treatment room. After some aroma therapy and a foot bath/message we laid on the tables and the hot stone message began. Excellente! After the facials we were led back to the relaxation room where we were again soothed by a warm shoulder compress, enjoyed a very flavorful hot tea and soft music before we headed back to the locker rooms to shower and change. The entire experience was nearly 2.5 hours and was worth every penny. A couple of minor issues that we learned to deal with: - housekeeping is erratic. A couple of days our room wasn't made up until after 5:30. This was tough because we kept waiting so we could take showers and head to dinner.Once we accepted it as the way they did things, no issue. We simply worked around it. Though there was a day that it was done by the time we got back from the beach around 3:30. Also, we found that different housekeeping personnel stocked our towels differently: once we had no hand towels at all! - mini-bar service is erratic. We we there 6-days and while the sign says that the minibar will be restocked every day, it was only restocked twice. We did keep getting extra waters from our maids which was fine, but once the two Sprites were gone, we would have liked some more! Not a deal breaker and we just drank water, but it you're going to really go through beer or soda, you'll need to stay on them to stock up. - bell service. We received a paper under our door the last evening that if we need bell service for checkout, please return this paper with the time and date and they would be there to get you with the oversized golf cart. We turned it in at the front desk and the front desk clerk looked at us like she never had seen it before. She said that she would get it to the bell folks asap. Needless to say we didn't get the warm fuzzies nor did we get a ride the next morning as requested - though another staffer driving by picked us up and brought us to the front desk. Overall we had a wonderful time. Once we figured out where to eat and deal with the maid service we managed. The staff was exceedingly friendly and pleasant. The one day we had a bit of a go 'round with folks (first day our room wasn't getting cleaned and we wanted to go to dinner), I think the issue stemmed more from a language barrier than an inability to please. My bad Spanish with the staffer's bad English mixed poorly! That said, problem was solved! We certainly were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. There is some walking but where we were situated, Villa 7, it was 5 minutes to the beach and 5 minutes to the front desk/Flavours/Spa which we didn't think was all that bad. Not everything was perfect but the imperfections were not enough to ruin our trip and were things we could live with. This was our experience. Obviously other folks have had other experiences. I'm not belittling the bad experiences, just trying to give you a taste of ours. I was a bit offended by the person who feels that anyone that gives this place a good review \"obviously\" doesn't know a five star resort. We have stayed in palaces in Italy (literally) and shacks in Micronesia so I think we can reasonably rate a place. Just because this was our experience doesn't mean it will be yours, though I do hope our review was useful to you.

The pictures on their web site are very accurate. This is my 5th time to the Riviera Maya and this place is as good as all the others. My wife likes the fives the best where as it is my 2nd favorite of the 5. They seem to cater heavily to young families so if you cannot deal with small children go somewhere else. With that said my two little girls really like it here and are having a blast with children's activities. The food is excellent, truly gourmet, the pools and rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. The service is friendly and for the most part fast. Some of the waitstaff faster than others. Hugo at the Sea Olive was a very good server. We had some minor issues with a TV and coffee maker not working but they were replaced quickly. My only issue to speak of is the beach itself. It is very rocky and covered with a lot of seaweed at the water's edge. I would return, however I prefer trying new resorts each time we visit.

The hotel staff is so friendly, everyone knew who we were and they made their best effort to help us with anything we needed. The Wedding event coordinators were on top of every detail and had answers to all of my questions. On the day of the wedding the entire hotel knew we were the highest priority so we got everything we needed and the event was amazing. As for the resort, the food is amazing. It's not your typical all-inclusive, here they make gourmet food and the restaurants have a lot of variety. I do have to say that the service can be a little slow, but we had no rush, after all we were in vacations. On the first day we arrived we got upgraded to a penthouse suite for free, I don't know if they do this for all wedding couples but it was AWESOME, we had our own rooftop patio with a jacuzzi and a dinning table to host guests, it was a great surprise! They also have 24 hour room service as part of the all-inclusive deal which is wonderful!!... specially for those people who arrive to the hotel late at night and the restaurants are closed. We had 32 guests to our wedding and they all stayed in the hotel with us, every single one of them said they were very satisfied with the hotel and thanked us for choosing such a great place. Some of them are considering going back for their vacations! As far as wedding options, there are plenty, we chose the balcony setting and the view towards the ocean was incredible! Our wedding pictures are amazing! One little issue is the beach, it is pretty rocky and hard to walk on, but if you walk along the beach towards the left side (facing towards the ocean from the hotel) there is an empty beach like a block away were there are no rocks and its pretty isolated. Great place to enjoy the sunset.

You will have to beg for hand towels, faceclothes and towels. The room never got cleaned twice and is usually done late in the day. The pools are ice cold but did warm up as the weather got warmer. The food is excellent and is the highlight of this esort. The problem is the service is super slow and can take over two and a half hours to eat a meal. The servers are not lazy but they can't keep up and they tend to only fill just over half the seats because of it, so you at times will wait over an hour just to get a table.

Negative, but honest.\u201d", "Author": "Joan L", "ReviewID": "UR123112009", "Content": "We stayed at Azul Fives from Jan 1-11th. My husband and I have traveled to Mexico a number of times and I have never written a bad review on any Resort\u2026except this one! We would NEVER NEVER return to this resort. We booked Azul Fives last minute and I also should have listened to the bad reviews. Any good reviews on this hotel are from travelers who have never stayed at an actual 5 star resort, or a 4 or maybe even a 3. Azul Fives can not be rated as a 5. So here we Go\u2026. Upon arrival we were immediately disappointed with the drive up to the resort. Nothing spectacular at all. No security into or out of resort and immediately beside the Lobby are trailers and barking dogs. The lobby itself is small and nothing grand at all. Looks like a travel lodge lobby of a hotel. Check in went smoothly. Instead of an arm bracelet they give you an i.d card with your pictures on it. We were traveling with our 3 year old and she thought that was pretty cool. Well it was not cool at all. EVERYTIME you order a drink or go to a restaurant you have to show them this stupid card. So ladies when you\u2019re in the pool ordering a drink, you better tuck that card somewhere in your bikini. Or, get out of the pool, get the card, get back in and show your stupid i.d. After check in they took us to our 1 bedroom suite. The room was nice and large, but the kitchen was useless because there are no cutlery, plates, and dishes of any kind. Also our kitchen looked like it had never been cleaned with greasy fingerprints all over the stainless steel door. We also had moldy food under the sink near the garbage can. Our room location was in Villa 1 right behind the check in desk. So we could hear dogs barking and the view outside our room was of the main road and parking lot. Also across from the gym and the main buffet Flavors. We were always woken early to workers bringing there carts through and also from other kids screaming on their way to the buffet. We found the food was good and the service was always great when we ate at all restaurants. We could always find something for our 3 year old to eat. We did not like the layout of the resort though. The buffet was on one end of the resort, and the other 3 restaurants were on the far far other side of the resort. And when I say far, I mean a good 10 min walk from our Villa. This resort is not an ocean front resort at all. None of the rooms can you even see the ocean. There are 3 pools in-between all the villas with 3 swim up bars. Plenty of chairs around those pools, but good luck getting any in the sun. Also, if you would like a drink on your long walk to the beach you will have to get into the pools and order your drink. ALL the bars in this resort are swim up bars. So if you stand on the very edge of the bar and yell across, you may get a drink, but don\u2019t forget your card! When you finally get to the \u201cmain\u201d pool, good luck trying to find a chair to sit on. This was the smallest pool in the resort. It is an infinity pool and the view from the pool is very nice, looking out to the ocean. We learned you had to get up super early to get a spot by the main pool. And even then good luck. One of the members that hands out the towels reserves all the chairs for guests that have tipped him. There are probably 60 chairs around that small pool. Oh and all the pools are NOT heated. Coldest pools I have ever experienced. Not fun with a 3 year old. They also have NO hot tubs at all on resort. Our daughter would have 2 hot baths a day. The beach was nice, but we could never find a chair. The ocean is not really swimmable. Lots of large rocks and Coral. That never bothered us because we never care to swim in the ocean. If you do like that though, good luck. The only place we found that you can stand and order a drink was off the beach behind the pool. However getting a drink took up to 10-15 min. All the pool and beach servers would line up to get all their orders and then the bartenders would take your order. Half way through our holiday we asked the front desk to move us to another AZUL resort but they would not accommodate us at all. They said to stick it out. Thanks. We contacted our travel agent and tried to switch to The Grand Palladium, (which is AMAZING) for the remainder of our holiday but we could not get a room for the full time. We then asked the Azul Fives to move us to another room location, they did. To Villa 12. This new room was a great location. We never once got our mini bar stocked our whole 9 days. I would stock up on water bottles from around the pool to reserve for the evening time. So my daughter would have water. When we did call to have our water and pop replenished, it took 2 hours for them to come. And they brought us beer\u2026 No thanks I asked for water. Another half hour and they brought our water. Now the one thing that we were so disappointed about. And that was that there was NO nightly entertainment. Nothing for the kids and NOTHING for the adults. All other resorts we have been to have these Grand outdoor theaters with great entertainment EACH night. Azul Fives had nothing. The sky bar is where we were told they would have entertainment was so small you could never hold the capacity of the resort, and it was DEAD every night. The other thing that drove us crazy was there was no bar to even sit around and have a drink. The only bar you could have a drink was sky bar. This was dark and empty. So we would sit by the beach, then my husband would go all the way up the stairs ( so stupid, terrible layout) get us a drink, bring them down by the beach and we would watch our daughter play on the beach. We did that for a couple of nights, but the stairs and carrying our drinks down just got too much. The resort was dead because people were forced to there rooms with nothing to do, not even an outside bar to gather around and mingle. So lame. The kids club was terrible. Our daughter never wanted to go in there. And the times we did bring her in she wanted to play in the gym area, but you have to pay $5.00 every time for an hour. She would only ever play for 15 min, so it was a waste. So we would have to just tell her no. How fun is denying your child an activity. Also, parents beware that when they say a toy lending library they only have 4 toys to choose from. A walkie-talkie set (that never worked) a book, phone and and a vacuum cleaner. When we did ask to lend these toys, they were never available. So bring your own toys. Also buckets and shovels from the play place were always gone as well. We did meet around 10 other couples on our 9 day trip and we had a blast hanging out with them. ALL the people we talked to did not care for this resort and would never return. They were all disappointed. One couple had a roof top terrace but the Jacuzzi up there is cold water. They don\u2019t even have a hot water valve in the plumbing. Another couple\u2019s room flooded. And we met this wonderful large family celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and they were so disappointed with the lack of buffet choices and how un accommodating the restaurants is with large groups. With just the 3 of us we had no problem getting tables at restaurants, but the wait could be up to 15 min. And the buffet would be empty. This review is mostly negative, I know. I have never been disappointed with a resort. Nor giving a bad review but I always appreciate and honest review so I can plan my holiday. I only hope this helps people, and that the resort changes things. They have lots of work to do to make this a 5 star.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cShould have listened more to the \"terrible\" reviews!!\u201d", "Author": "Leahsmurf", "ReviewID": "UR123079218", "Content": "We were there Jan 6/12 - Jan 13/12 Don't GO!! We just returned home from what we planned on being a 5 star holiday and it was the farthest thing from it!! We read many of the online reviews both negative and positive and thought they could all be justified. We definately should have realized that from the negative ones they are things to make your holiday not so enjoyable. On a positive note before I get into it, the grounds were in great shape to some extent and the staff was friendly and willing to listen and help where they could. Upon arriving at the resort we dropped another family off at the Valentin which has a beautiful long entry way that is all maintained and professional, arriving at the Fives, mayhave been a trailor park! There was no security checking vehicles and the front door was 50 feet from the main road in, you could see people walking by, random dogs and locals ... you also had to walk by this to get to the main buffett restaurant \"worlds cusine\" ... to start off we got to breakfast at 9:30 and there we waited in line for over 25 min complaining with the other outside who were no impressed. Upon finally being seated, the inside of the restaurant was not even half full, the buffett itself was mostly empty and the food we did get as often cold, stale or mushy (ie waffles, dont think we ever got a fresh one) breads that I did try were cold as if they had been frozen!! Lunch was a little better as you had some selection. Dinner, restaurants were okay but I don't believe that any of the quality was gormet, 5 star service nor quality. get there early as arriving at 8 may get you a table closer to 9!! Ocean: not really swimable, little to no walk in access (have to stumple over rocks). No rooms are really ocean front and have to walk quite a ways to get to the water!! Kind of a bad thing when you are there for the ocean etc. May as well stay somewhere cheaper not on the water! Bars: only swim up bars near the upper pools, had to stand at edge and yell over the side and pass drinks over the water. They should have foot access!! all swim up bars are on east side of pool too, no afternoon sun and therefore in unheated pools, sitting in the shade and drinking a cold drink in the cold water is often not the greatest. Had the occassional poolside service and often took tipping to get them to come back for repeat service. Rooms: we had a one bedroom suite with penthouse patio and enjoyed it. It was a lot of wasted space that could be better utilized. Kitchen had nothing in it, no plates, cups, anything so may as well not have been there. a/c made the room very damp to the point where bedding and clothes all felt wet. bathing suites would not dry in the room! we read a comment about the dining room light fixture being loud and blowing, thus sounding like someone was breaking in all the time ..... thought they were crazy but once there, that was exactly what it sounded like!!!! It interupted our sleep so much that we had to either turn a/c off or else shut bedroom doors which was just a nusance. There was no nightly entertainment so plan on being early to bed. Sky bar could of had so much potential with stuff going on but was dead from what we saw between 6-10 even 11!! No nightlife for adults and nothing in the common area for the kids... KIDS: so many of them, don't go if you prefer a adults only resort, screaming in restaurantings and whinning, splashing in pools and strollers everywhere!!! We liked kids but I think because they didn't have anything to do with the kids unless send them to the kids camp they were all bored!!! food would also be hard for them imagining feeding my kids from what I saw! Overall message is I would avoid this hotel and not recommend it. If you are not picky and want to pay a premium price without the amenities and conveniences, then this is for you!!! We stayed at the Azul Sensatori last year and I would go abck there in a second, we actually tried to switch to there!!

After the HORRIBLE time we had there we decided to look into something that would make up for it and this was THE place. I was a little worried travelling to Mexico but I can honestly say I will be back after this. The staff were amazing, we had no problems with communication. Everything was \"my pleasure\" lots of thank yous and hellos.. You could tell everyone worked hard to make sure everyone had a fabulous time and if you were not enjoying your stay they would make sure to fix it. I am a very picky eater, I ate more at this resort then I do at home.. the food was amazing! They had a little of everything, and I really like the idea of all the restaurants because a buffet can get old fast during a 7 day stay.. Those travelling with children should keep in mind that mexicans spend a lot of time at the dinner table, therefore you will too. The food isn't in front of you right away but the wait is worth it.. I recommend ordering a meal as an appetizer because it will come out quickly and that should hold you over. There is a wait to go to some of the popular restaurants at peak hours.. just like at home.. I got a little upset one night and was given a table within 15 mins.. the next day the manager found my boyfriend and I at the beach restaurant and apologized for the wait. He took the time to explain to us why there was a wait and that he was sorry. We went back the next night and he was so happy to see us again. We also went for sushi late one night and they manager said there was too long of a wait and she wouldn't be able to get us in.. she did the same the next day.. found us and made sure we got a great table that night. THE SERVICE AT THIS RESORT IS AMAZING. You cannot stay mad very long. In the morning, I believe her name was Elizabeth would always great you with a warm smile at flavours.. she was there everyday and we loved being seated by her.. it started our morning off amazing. The beach is not the greatest but if you walk down about 10 mins it gets better.. you have to keep in mind once you leave the resort the hotel is not longer responsible for your security. The pool was great, very clean and well kept. Everyday I seen about 5 workers cleaning it and taking care things nightly. Our room was great, modern and clean.. something that could be worked on is after guests are done with room service items it would be nice if someone came to collect a lot of the dishes.. I guess some familys didn't want to keep them in the rooms and so the often ended up in the hallway.. which wasn't nice to see.. The staff did however work hard to keep the resort clean and I often saw the sidewalks even being cleaned which is nice because I like to be barefoot. Something that should be kept in mind for couples, this is a family resort and there are a lot of kids. I don't mind kids but it would be nice if the hotel had some more pool activities for them.. a lot of the kids founds friends but the staff is so great I am sure they could motivate the kids to do some sort of water sport or aerobics.. get them out of there parents hair for a little while.

They run out of towels at Lizards and the main pool by 11am and sometimes they never replenished the towels until late afternoon. 6. The food quality and taste at Flavors was poor regardless of the theme. In fact there were a couple of nights during the Spanish and American theme night (both weeks) that food was so bad, we went to bed hungry. The theme does not reflect in any way, shape or form the food selection especially during the American and Spanish theme night. Dinner at Flavors for the most part during our stay was extremely disappointing. 7. Seafood selection was very limited and at times for most of our stay nonexistent. 8. 4. The food at the buffet restaurant is tiring specially breakfast if you are on holidays for more than a week, it is the same thing (same items) day in and day out. 9. The front desk is not much of a help, no matter what the issue. 10. The WI-Fi was down most of the time we were there. Even the wired internet connection at the lobby was down about 5x during our stay. 11. The shower in the deluxe rooms needs to be better designed. The seal between the shower door and the common area around the sinks and the toilet next door gets completely wet and extremely slippery and dangerous when somebody is taking a shower, my 1 year old and my husband both slipped and fell when my son was taking a shower. 12. Complaints are never addressed by management. They either don\u2019t get it or they don\u2019t care. I believe this is a work in progress. However, there is a lot work to be done by management in order for this resort to be at the same service level as resorts such as the RIU, Moon Palace, etc. especially when it comes to food selection and quality.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat! Beware of Mexican star rating though.\u201d", "Author": "JenniferAnne1987", "ReviewID": "UR122884839", "Content": "We Arrived at Azul fives Christmas Eve... First off, dont be put off by the road leading too Azul Fives. It is reflective of the typical Mexican town Play Del Carmen is. We stayed in the three bedroom penthouse with the roof top living space. Azul fives was a suprise, it has to be the cleanest resort I have ever stayed at - they regularily washed and swept all the walkways, bleached the handrailings and the resturants and rooms were spot less. Our maid was honest and very thorough, he found that our safe had not fully closed one day and left us a little note - nothing was ever stolen at this resort. The pool bars and resturant choices were plenty for 7 days, I think that two weeks may be too long at this resort. Playa Del Carmen lacks in culture in comparison to wandering the streets of Peurto Vallarta, it was very beat up and poor. There is really no unique goods to be purchased, just your typical tourist items from China. I found Playa Del Carmen a humbling experience as we walked about an hour in the town. Everyone was very friendly and we were not given any trouble from the locals. Downsides: Our roof top cold tub leaked through the roof and my parents wook up to an inch of water, luckily nothing was ruined of their possessions. One whole day was spent getting repacked and moving to another building, there was no offering from the resort for our troubles - this was disapointing. **We were a little concerned to notice they had filled the flooded room with the water damaged roof with guests a few days later (221 for your reference)** Resturants close by 10, this really didnt fare well with us as we have been known to enjoy dining well past 10. Note: The Italian restuarant still served us and were very welcoming- we stayed until at least 10:30 and they did not mind at all. Dress code was a moving target: It seems that the shirt pants and shoes dress code varied widley. I'm not sure how a resort in Mexio can expect to get away with a \"no sandal\" rule and after a little protest of sorts the resort seemed to make an exception for clean/expensive sandals. The sushi restuarant staff is a little overwhelmed: This didnt suprise me too much but we asked for a table for 6 and were told that they couldnt rearrange but if we waited there would be a large table leaving shortly. We said we would wait out front, then a group of six entered the restuarant and was seated immediately. Young boys in scrubby footy tees and all. The hostess proved to be slightly incompetent but did make an honest effort to make it up. We had a special meal made by the chef that was not on the menu. Bonus points for him! The main pool was very noisy and there were a lot of children around that area though it said Adults only, we hung out in the winding pools amougnst the buildings --- very peaceful! In all, this resort was very pleasant for being child-friendly...it seems they had alot of activities to keep them entertained and there is a daycare building. I was a little disappointed that there was limited adult entertainment nightly. One night there was a fire show with Reggae, we had an amazing night - it would have been nice to have more of that! The \"night club\" was very big and very empty with great lounge seating, the bartender was excellent and made us whatever she felt like for fun, it was great...she would just show up with a new creation once our others were done. Really impressed with Domingo and Carlos at the pool bars, they were alot of fun and \"fixed\" my husbands sore foot with the best tequila they had. The watched our things while we went swimming and nothing went missing. The beach server took a little monetary persuasion to get better service from, so be prepared for that. When I had read other travelers reviews, I have to admit I thought many of them were alittle whiney now I understand what the problem is. Overall, dont expect a 5 star experience, if you want that stick to a country other than Mexico. In all, our vacation was great and we got some much needed \"nothing time\". Wander down the beach to the right, at the second massage \"hut\" (its a little hidden) Carlos will give you the best massage you have ever had- for 35 American dollars! Also give \"Xplor\" a go it was an active Disney Land for adults, we really had fun. Please dont be afraid of all the Media about Mexico, I am a young caucasion woman and I have not yet had a problem in Mexico. Just make sure your safe stays closed and dont wander around Playa Del Carmen at night.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "Paradise0123", "ReviewID": "UR122854259", "Content": "Beautiful hotel, amazing spa, and great restaurants!

On their own they are not a big deal, but added up we realize that this resort has too many issued to overlook for another booking. We were happy to see that 2 new restaurants have opened as well as a juice/smoothy bar. However, we were told that none of the restaurants take reservations so when we went to the italian one, the first thing we were asked was whether we had a reservations and if not it would be an hour wait. Then, the beach grill was not open for dinner service most of the nights we were there. We did ask the concierge about the schedule, and were told they would be open, but when we went on a certain evening they were closed. They did not have scuba lessons at the pool or any sort of water craft that we could use as it states in the info. Towels ran out frequently at the pools. Although there was an activity calendar posted, most never happened. Also, there were no longer programs each night. Rather, only a few of the nights. We knew that service would be slow, but at times it was ridiculously slow. They need more wait staff or a quicker kitchen. Room service was a nice treat for late afternoon snacks and on one morning. But the order always had a few errors. The mini bar/fridge was not restocked daily, but a few times. When we called nothing happened. Also, we were told that there would be items for the kids that would be stocked in the fridge, but that did not happen. Only once did they come by for turn down service, but that was at 5pm and we were getting dressed and asked that they return in 2 hours. They never came back. Any time we had a question, or make a call, we were told that they would look into it/talk to a manager, etc and get back to us. They never did follow up and after a few days we decided to let it go rather then spend our vacation on the phone/talking to the front. The dinner variety was nice, but breakfast got old fast. Also, only having one tennis court available made it difficult to play. HOt water was no longer an issue in the rooms. and it was nice to have s uch a large base when traveling as a family. There is a ton of staff, but even so there were many gaps in service and delivery.

Upon arrival we were upgraded to a penthouse suite and were very happy with the extra large, luxurious accommodations. Our suite included a bedroom, living area, full kitchen, dining area, full bath, powder room, two balconies and a rooftop terrace that was HUGE!! The bedroom had a king bed w/ comfortable mattress and linens, a large flat screen and privacy doors separating it from the living area. The bedroom was connected to the main bath which featured two vessel sinks, a rain forest shower and a two person Jaccuzzi. There was another TV in the living room with lots of room to spread out and be comfortable. We had the all inclusive plan, but if you chose the European plan, the kitchen and dining area were quite ample, easily providing the equipment needed to prepare meals for your family. The rooftop terrace had enough room and seating to host quite a party. From there we were able to see the ocean and much of the surrounding area including Cozumel (I think) at night. The rooftop Jaccuzzi would be great in the warmer months. It didn't seem to have hot water, so we didn't use it. We borrowed a stroller which was convenient as our youngest usually fell asleep during the shows. The elevator was quite handy as we were on the third floor and it made getting her back to the room a breeze. The resort is a nice size - not too big. We were in Building 4 and it was probably a three to five minute walk to either the beach/ pool/ restaurant areas or the lobby. The Azulitos Club was bigger than at Azul Beach and had a gym ( extra cost?) and its own pool. Our girls liked it, but preferred AB because of the fun they had with Zoe, Pillar and Mariam during the week we were there. The beach looked fine, but the water looked too rough for my taste. It is very much like the beach at the Valentin. I prefer the very calm, shallow waters of AB. The pools were fabulous. Since some even meander through the complex, there was always one close by. The entertainment in the Zky bar was great. All of the restaurants were very good with professional service and delicious food. We always had excellent service at Azul Fives. There is a small on-site cenote just outside the windows of the main restaurant near the lobby. Monkeys come and hang out in the trees by that cenote. Since we were only there two days, we didn't get a chance to see them though. Although my first choice for a great family trip would be Azul Beach because of its smaller size and better beach, I would definitely consider a second trip to Azul Fives.

Restaurants vii. Pools ix. Beach x. Ocean xi. Conclusion & Notes (i.) Pre-Booking --- As with all vacations which we go on, it always begins with a long process of research and determination on which property to book. All of the major players in Canada (Air Canada Vacations, Transat Holidays, Signature Vacations, Sunwing Vacations etc.) had this hotel in their portfolio but there was an interesting observation; they all rated the property differently! This immediately made me skeptical. ACV (****1/2) TH (****1/2) SGV (*****) SWV (*****) While the ratings were relatively close together (only off by .5 of a star) it still makes me wonder \"why\". Of all the providers I always go with Air Canada Vacations rating on a property; in my experience it is always bang on. In this case it was no different. When we went to book our vacation, our travel agent spoke very highly of the property and stated that it was highly regarded in the agent community. That was all we needed to hear and with that we booked with Transat Holidays a one week stay at the Azul Fives. (ii.) Air Transat Flight --- For those who are not concerned with the flight or tour operator, please skip to the next section by typing (CTRL + F) and searching for \"iii.\" This is the first time that I have flown on Air Transat and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! I expected the flight to be packed full, everyone jammed in together to maximize revenue but that didn't seem to be the case. On the way down we upgraded to \"Club\" class (Business Class) for $99/person. The upgrade to the Club class seats were well worth the money! The services that are offered in the Club class section of the aircraft rival any other North American full service business class service. The large leather seats are arranged in a 2-3-2 formation compared to 2-4-2 in economy. There are no PTV's, it is still a shared TV system which is no big deal (you should have your own entertainment anyways). Services offered in Club include complimentary newspaper, amenity kit, and full meal with china plates. The service was excellent, once again, I have to highly recommend it to anyone who has the means to take it. (iii.) Arrival at Cancun Airport Note: This still pertains somewhat to the Transat Holidays package. Feel free to skip to section iv if you so choose. I've travelled to Mexico over half a dozen times and know the drill. Get off the plane, go through immigration (where the officer didn't even speak to us...), get your baggage, wait in line to have your luggage scanned on the way out, and wait for your transfer to your hotel. It's pretty simple, but after a long day of traveling this process can set you up for disaster in your first impressions of the country and hotel when you finally arrive. Upon deplaning, make sure you go DIRECTLY to Immigration/Migracion. I've witnessed the ground staff opening the door to the departures hall and asking people to make their way by themselves. Most of the time people are very confused/don't care and just walk around to see the shops and buy stuff they don't need. Don't be the persons who holds up the bus because you wanted to buy some trinket. Follow the signs on the ceiling that take you to Immigration and get the process started. Once Immigration is cleared and you have your bags you will walk the long hallway to make your way outside. Once outside, this is where you will meet your tour operator's representative, car rental companies, ground transportation, or family. This is where Transat made their first mistakes. Being one of the first from our flight to leave the arrivals hall we found the woman holding the \"Transat Holidays\" sign and clipboard. We verified that we were on her list, she motioned towards our bags and said \"let my friend help you with your bags\". Being a seasoned traveler, I can't believe we fell for it but we did. A man wearing a white shirt and black pants (along with his co-workers) were working with our representative to get tips from travellers by taking their bags and moving them a few meters down the concrete. I'm not saying a few meters to be dramatic. Literally, he wheeled our bags about 10 meters to a \"holding point\" nearby. This made me VERY upset. We watched other people as they fell for the same trap, if they didn't tip the person who carried their bags they would just stand there until they got the picture. Unbelievable that the agent would do this. She is representing Transat Holidays and probably made a little cash from her referral services. Bottom line, do not let go of your bags. The second problem was the ride itself. Where was our transportation? Nobody really knew. The Transat representative told us to talk to someone wearing a red shirt who would just keep saying \"yes, ok on the way\" and \"Azul Fives is only 5 minutes away!\". 1, no it was not on the way. 2, the Azul Fives was more like 45 minutes away.\u00a0People were starting to get 'upset', which is a PC way of putting it. After waiting for 45 minutes for our van to show up at the airport, they brought 12 people over to a 9 passenger van. Well, this wasn't going to work; which it didn't. The driver shooed 3 people away back to the curb to wait for another mode of transport. Luckily, it wasn't me or anyone else in my party. It's almost 10PM and all that people want to do is get to the hotel and get some sleep but before this happens the driver and man in the red coat needed to have a leisurely chat for 10 minutes. This entire ordeal took just over an hour to finish up. Unbelievable. iv. Arrival at Azul Fives The 45 minute ride to the Azul Fives was uneventful and safe enough. After driving down a secondary road to the hotel, we pulled in the drive and were there. One of the most notable differences that was noticed was that the hotel didn't have a guard shack or security before you were admitted to the property. A little bit strange as the other 2 hotels that we let people off at previously both had large shacks (as did all of the other hotels which we had visited in the past in numerous countries). But who cares, we're on vacation and it looks great! Right away you could see that the hotel is designed with modernity in mind. Large 2 story windows were present all around the front lobby as the van came to a stop at the front doors. As other reviewers have commented, the lobby is small by comparison to other resorts in Mexico. The only real reason you would be in the lobby during your entire vacation would be to check-in and out, talk to the tour operators, or arrange a ride to the City. So really, it serves it's purpose and looks good doing so. Greeted by the receptionist, we were invited to sit down while we checked in. A warm welcome was extended and welcome Champagne was offered along with a cool Aloe towel. Very nice touches! While nobody in our party opted for the Champagne everyone went for the cool towel. Very refreshing! Following the paperwork we were handed a booklet and given a brief overview of the hotel, key locations, and services provided. With that said and done it was time to get to the room! The property is very large and set away from the beach (more on the beach later) with accommodations spread out into 13 different villas numbered 1-14 (no unlucky 13). The hotel has large golf carts prepared to assist people traveling to their rooms with a quick and easy ride. Our accommodation was in villa 11 located right beside the lobby within a very quick walking distance. The bellman grabbed out bags and began walking us to our 1 bedroom suite. v. 1 Bedroom Suite It is now past 11PM and we're finally unlocking the door to our room. I'm so excited to get into bed after a long day. After climbing the dark staircase to the second floor we were at the doorway to our room. Like other hotels, the Fives set up it's rooms so that there was a first set of doors that had the room number 11XX and once inside that door there were two different doors that went into either suite 1 or 2 (both separate). The door opened to our room and we were greeted to the 1 bedroom suite... ...and a lizard on the wall. I looked at the other people in my party and pointed at the lizard that was now moving along the wall and made some pretty shocked exclamations. The bellman just goes \"no, no!\" and continues to wheel our bags in and show us the room. He never ended up looking for it, someone else had to while he watched from a safe distance. Turns out that \"IF\" there was one, it went into a hole at the \"L\" section between the cupboards. Huh. Back to the room. The room itself was very nicely appointed and was again, very modern. When you walk into the suite you are greeted by the large kitchen which featured what looked to be granite countertops, dark coloured cabinets, and stainless steel appliances. The kitchen also provided an island with the same counters and cabinetry. Very nice! To the left of the main doorway into the room was a bathroom. Inside the bathroom there was a modern looking sink, mirror and toilet. There was a problem with the plumbing in the toilet which forced it to continuously fill the bowl with water. It was very loud and annoying. It forced us to have the door closed to the bathroom anytime that we were in the room in order to muffle the sound. Moving into the room there was a dining room table with a very unique looking light fixture above it. On the table was a welcome bottle of Champagne in an ice bucket and some fruit. I say fruit because \"fresh fruit\" would be untrue. It had clearly been sitting there for a while and had some pretty serious bruises the Pear and Apple that were on the plate. No big deal, if I want fruit I'll get it at the restaurant. Past the dining room table was a large creme coloured L-shaped couch. In our tour of the room the bellman showed us that the second bed was a pull out couch within the sofa. Not surprisingly, when it was set up it showed that the mattress was max 5cm thick and very uncomfortable. The pull out couch remained out for the remainder of the stay as we needed both beds set up for sleeping. There was also a large-ish TV that the couch faced. To the right of the living room area were two sliding doors that revealed the master bedroom and bathroom. Directly facing the sliding doors was the king sized bed. I really, really, really hoped that the bed wasn't hard as a rock as all of the other beds in Mexico seemed to be. Unfortunately, it lived up to it's expectations of being hard as a rock even with an added layer of padding. Too bad. Inside the bedroom there was another TV facing the bed that initially didn't work but finally figuring out that there were heavily damaged cable wires on the back that had to be jostled in order for the TV to even turn on solved the problem. Another issue with the bedroom was the curtains. The windows that look out onto the balcony are wall-to-wall while the curtains stop short of the wall. You could see where other tenants used their own tape or fasters to fix the curtains to the wall so that people couldn't see in. The uncovered area is very small (around 1cm) which didn't bother me but to privacy conscious people it could be a problem. It did become an issue when using the shower as it is open to the bedroom. If someone were to have the means to, they could look in. This is something that they should really consider taking a look at. To the right of the bed (from the doorway perspective) was the bathroom which was completely open to the bedroom. The bathroom featured a large jacuzzi tub, separate standing shower, double sink vanity, and separate toilet. There were dozens of bathing related amenities set out for use by the guests which looked to be high end by the looks of the packaging but turned out to be lower quality product in the end. When you look at reports on TripAdvisor about the hotel there is a focus by many people that \"there is no hot water\". I take long showers which will drain from any resources that the facility provides most of the time lasting more then 20 minutes. From what I experienced, they realize that it is an issue and are working to fix the situation. Only once during the 14+ showers I took at the hotel was there a dip in the hot water to where it was warm. It wasn't an issue at all. The reason that I say that they are on top of the problem is that on one of the days they had a golf cart full of new water heaters that were being installed throughout the resort. If you experience an issue, I believe that they are working to correct it. vi. Restaurants We knew going in that the resort only had 3 restaurants at the time of arrival. The choices were Buffet (Flavours), Pan-Asian (Tsuki), and Mediterranean (Sea Olive). During out stay the staff were preparing the 4th restaurant, an Italian Restaurant, for opening during their first busy season. Breakfast is only available at Flavours buffet restaurant. Compared to other massive resorts such as Riu, Iberostar, and Dreams the experience was lacklustre. The buffet itself is smaller than the fruit display at a Riu buffet and had little choice that did not change throughout our entire stay. The food was good, but repetitive and lacked any change. Flavours One night we decided to try Flavours dinner buffet and see what it was like. We have never had such a bad meal at a resort since we were in Cuba over 10 years ago. The food was cold, there was no selection, and for an \"American Night\" there was no \"American\" food in sight. Very disappointing. We never returned to Flavours for any meal other than breakfast every morning. That experience leads me to the next restaurant. After not even finishing one plate of food we went down to the Sea Olive restaurant to look at the menu. At first we were very skeptical seeing dishes like \"Squid Ink Pasta\". The restaurant manager noticed our looks of dismay and heard about our experience at Flavours a little bit earlier. He pulled us aside and extended an offer to us to go upstairs to the currently closed Italian restaurant to take part in a private tasting. We accepted and headed up to the restaurant. Arezzo (Italian Restaurant) Nobody had ever been to a chef's tasting before and didn't know what to expect. The Maitre D (I don't know how to do the special spelling or symbols for the name, sorry) took our room card for verification and sat us at a table by the window. It was a very cool experience! We were the only people in the restaurant except for the staff who were in training and a table of 6 resort managers. The Corporate Chef came to our table to thank us for coming and told us how the process would work. Essentially, they make plates that are on the menu and kept bringing it to our table. Before the events started the local chef came by the table and introduced herself and re-iterated what was going to happen. It was AWESOME! At first we would eat the entire plate and wait for the next one but after 6 half-sized portions passed by our table we realized that that tactic wouldn't work. We switched to eating a little of everything. All of the food was amazing! It definitely made up for the awful experience at Flavours earlier. The Corporate Chef was all over the resort making sure that the food was up to his standards and would come over and personally great us whenever he had the chance. Very good customer-staff rapport. Sea Olive (Mediterranean) While on the first time we looked at the dinner menu and were worried that there would be nothing that anyone would like to eat it was time to give it a try. Once we sat down and took a closer look at the menu there were tons of different options to chose from that weren't swimming in squid ink. In the 3 times that we ate at Sea Olive for dinner I tried the steak, and variations of pasta. All of the food that came to the table was delicious, fresh, and just right. Sea Olive is one of the 2 restaurants that are open for lunch. The food that is served at lunch is also fantastic. Everyone in our party commented that the food in the sit down restaurants were by far some of the best that we ever had, no questions asked. Tsuki (Pan-Asian) The food at Tsuki looked way too crazy for us, we did not eat at this restaurant. Please consult another review for information. Burger Boutique For lunch the other option was something called the Burger Boutique. It was situated on the patio outside the Sea Olive and Tsuki restaurants. In the first few days we were at the resort it was only a gourmet burger and light snack bar which was really fantastic. The burgers were big, fresh, and cooked right. There were about 8 different burger variations on the menu that were cooked to order. Everything was phenomenal! However, halfway through our vacation we started noticing some professional corporate staff start to show up at the restaurants. It turned out that the Food & Beverage manager for the Karisma chain and another high-up from Corporate supervising the restaurants. he came by and introduced himself, very nice guy who would always check up to make sure all of the food we were eating was just right (which it always was). The high-ups were at the resort to supervise the opening of the new Italian restaurant and the change-over of the Burger Boutique to a buffet style BBQ styled restaurant. The change seemed to remove burgers from the menu and it moved towards a bbq meat and fish buffet restaurant. On the first day of the changeover the staff were kind of confused and didn't understand the new menu. This is where the F&B manager came by and told us what was going on and that they were working to make everything work. We didn't care that it took a little more time than usual, we're on vacation! It all turned out well in the end and they were good to go from there on out. Once again, the food at the BBQ and Burger Boutique were fantastic! The only complaint that we had was the dinner buffet which we only stayed at for less then 5 minutes. Everyone should enjoy the sit-down restaurants without a doubt. vii. Pools The resort has 3 pools. Two of the pools are massive and snake through the villas. Unfortunately, both of them were bitterly cold. While it isn't surprising that the pools weren't heated it made it difficult for myself to justify going in past my ankles. Lap swimmers were in heaven when they could swim for probably 250m from end to end of the snaking pools. For kids though, it didn't seem to stop them. Down by the beach there is an infinity pool that was also quite cold that I didn't go into. Numerous different activities took place in the infinity pool throughout the day. Both pools are very nice and cleaned on a daily basis. The infinity pool unfortunately had a pounding speaker that would be on from 10 in the morning until after we left the beach for the day at 3. Kind of annoying. If you are a pool person you should enjoy any of the 3 options which you have at the Fives. The snaking pools had lots of chairs available and nobody who was using them while at the infinity pool there were not too many chairs that were mostly filled by families viii. Bars Our party does not consist of any drinkers which meant that we didn't try out many of the bars on the resort. The only one which we went to regularly was the beach/infinity pool bar to get Pina Colodas. All of the drinks that they made were fantastic. No complaints whatsoever! For the beach bar there was a waitress that would regularly come around and take drink orders and pick up used cups. Great service, always got the order right and in made sure they came in a timely manner. ix. Beach We spent all of the time outside of the room on the beach. The beach was somewhat small compared to other mega resorts but had an appropriate amount of space for all of the guests to enjoy. One of the coolest things that the resort had were \"Beach Beds\". They were mattresses that were so much more comfortable than the mattresses in the rooms that would swing back and forth in the wind. On the first day we went over and sat on one of them but were greeted by the beach butler who said that that particular one was reserved. I had to move to a different one which he said was unreserved. It was so comfortable and relaxing! The only problem was that there seemed to be a reservation system that revolved around tips. As the resort got busier it was less and less likely you would be able to \"reserve\" a bed. With the politics of the beach beds behind us, the rest of the week was spent on the lounge chairs on the beach. There are tons of different options at the beach: under the palm trees, under a shader, or in the direct sun. Anywhere you choose to sit will have fine beach sand with just a few rocks buried under the top layer. x. Ocean As with other reviews, I can confirm that the ocean is very rocky and nearly impossible to go into right in front of the resort. For the 7 days that we were at the resort there was a red flag stating that you were not to go into the ocean. If you travel down the beach to the hotel next door you will be able to find some less rocky conditions and easier access conditions. xi. Conclusion & Notes One thing that was very interesting was the load factor of the hotel. When we checked in, we curiously asked the receptionist how full the hotel was, to which she answered 50%. Everyone at the resort told us on numerous occasions that the resort was at 50% capacity. it was simply untrue. The first few days the resort was a ghost town with no more then 50 people out on the property at any given time. We ran into the same few groups of people numerous times during the day. In reality when we spoke to the corporate staff later that week they corrected the staff's earlier statements by saying that the first 2 days that we were at the resort it was only at 20% capacity. Service at 20% was amazing! The corporate staff also told us that this was the first holiday/high season that the resort has seen as it is under 1 year old and that they were ensuring that everything was going to run well. They were going to be at 93% capacity on the day that we departed. Service throughout the week remained consistent with a few slowdowns but otherwise had no issues. With Transat Holidays, I was very happy with their air product but not pleased with their ground transportation arrangements. I would however recommend a holiday with Transat as for the most part everything went well. In conclusion, everyone enjoyed their time at the Azul Fives. At the end of the trip we were keen on returning to the Fives or any of the other hotels in the Azul portfolio. I hope the information that I have provided in this review is helpful. If you have any further questions please send me a direct message and I will try to get back to you with an answer on what I experienced.

If we knew ahead of time we were going to another Azul, we probably would have cancelled, due to the experience at \"beach\". From the time we entered the lobby and given sparkling wine and a cold cloth, we knew we were in for a treat. To our surprise they upgraded us to the penthouse suite, which was absolutely breathtaking. The staff were so friendly & eager to please. What can I say about the food...AMAZING!!!! It was so fantastic...the new Italian restaurant Azzuro opened the first night we arrived, so we had to try it....it was unbelievable. The head chef made sure to visit our table, including ours, and we made sure to let her know how happy we were to be at such a wonderful place...we did tell her we had a bad experience at the \"beach\" and she was sure to pass on the info to the executive chef who was on the premises that evening.... All the food we had during our stay was fantastic, no complaints. The sky bar, which became adults only after 10 was a nice treat after dinner. The resort does cater to families, but I never felt it was overrun with children. The pool by the Iguana bar seemed to be a nice escape for adults.

This resort is smaller in size (300ish) rooms, which was nice as was not a sprawling mega resort where all you did was walk everywhere. Ive detailed some items below. Baby Friendly: Resort provided crib, stroller, baby monitor, and toy lending program. All restaurants have booster/high chairs. The kids club is fantastic, as is the babysitting. The sitters are excellent with children, and we had no issue leaving our little for for a few hours. The kids club did have a nice nice gym area, but it is a pay for use area. You can also get baby food in the restaurant, plus an extensive kids menu. Rooms: We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which included a full kitchen, dining and living room area. The room was modern, and provided ample space for everyone. The kitchen proved to be very useful with our little one, as there was a fridge we could put milk etc in, an a sink where we could wash bottles etc. The bedroom was nice to have separated as we could put our daughter down, in one area, and we could watch TV etc in the bedroom. The bed is very FIRM, I found it to be extremely uncomfortable, but I do enjoy a more plush bed. We did have a problem with tiny ants coming in through a window near the soaker tub, I did complain about this as this is where we wanted to give our daughter a bath, but was told due to it being a tropical environment, and people having food in the room it is difficult to keep them out. I was not entirely impressed with this answer. They offered to fumigate, but I declined due to our daughter. A full size crib was provided for our daughter, although I heard others comment they received a half size crib. Either way its nice to have a real crib. Restaurants/Food/Drink - Overall the food quality was quite good. The buffet restaurant had a changing theme each night. During lunch only Sea Olive and Boutique Burger were open, which was a bit of a limited selection. You do not need to make reservations at all, which is nice. Each restaurant also provided high chairs and booster chairs for the children. We had some of our best meals at Sea Olive. Others have commented the room service menu is sparse, which is true, but anything we asked for was delivered, so you may just need to ask. Drinks were always very good, with no shortage of booze..I must comment that service in the a la cartes is painfully slow at times, especially with a baby. Not quite sure why, they seemed to be staffed well. I should mention there is a great smoothie/juice bar in the same building as the Vassa Spa. We were there each day for a delicious smoothie, but it did not seem to be very busy, and I do not think many people know about it. Do yourself a favor and find it. Pool/Beach/Ocean: 3 pools, 2 winding which snake around all the buildings (Try and get a poolside room) and 1 infinity pool at the Beach Club. All are beautiful, none are heated so in December its a bit chilly, even for this Canadian. The beach is very nice with lots of chairs, and beach beds. The ocean is not swim able, due to extensive rock/coral. For us it was not an issue as we were not going into the ocean anyway, but if your an ocean lover, it will be difficult for you, or a 10 min walk to a point where you can get in. They have beach drink service as well. Entertainment:During the day an extensive array of programs exists around the resort, and there seemed to be no shortage of things to do. During the evening,there are shows at 9:30pm each night which we never took advantage of due to our daughter needing to sleep early. The main lounge is called the Zky bar, which overlooks the Ocean, it looked very cool, although we also did not partake. Overall, to me the resort seemed quiet at night, which was absolutely perfect for us, but in fairness there could have been more action around the beach club/Zky Bar which we never saw. In any case, no yelling drunks at 3am was a very big plus with a baby. Service: Overall service was great. Room was cleaned each day without issue. In fact one day even with a privacy please sign out, someone tried to come in. This was a bit of an annoyance as the baby was sleeping. The restaurant servers and hostesses were great, you can tell they take pride in what they do. They only negative is the slower service at the a la cartes, I did lose my camera on our last day there, and left my email, to date I have not heard anything, but hope they contact me. Spa: We did an 80min massage at Vassa, which was beautiful. My wife and I have been to spas around the world, and this one of the better ones. If you book a 50min or greater treatment, a free hydrotherapy session is given, which is a 6 step process. Cool shower, Steam Room, Dry Sauna, Cold water plunge, and hottub. It was great and definite plus.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, almost, but not quite yet.....\u201d", "Author": "KatrinaStamp", "ReviewID": "UR121725928", "Content": "It's new, it's modern and contemporary and has the most beautiful pools and suites.

One bartender took my girlfriends room key and wouldn't give it back insisting that she had an earlier drink that was not paid for and then that he wanted to leave it open. They actually charged me extra for drinks at one dinner using a vodka they don't even stock at the resort at all.

We got to the front desk and even though we let them know we have all of our receipts they still presented us with a phoney bill. The front desk acutally went through their copy of the signed receipts and pretended to check them off of their list of bills to charge us. I almost fell for it .. they simply checked a couple that they themselves didn't have a bill for at all (niether did we in our copies co-incidentally). Then when we left they accidentaly printed us a copy of the bill with inflated prices on every item on the original bill bringing the total to $150 more than we spent.

Some times things are better than you expected, other times not so much. At first arrival we were a little disappointed, of course comparing the resort to the one we usually go to. BUT, we spent 10 days at Azul Fives, and for the most part it was great. One must remember to not be narrow minded, and be positive. We found the food for the most part 5 star. The portions are smaller, thus giving us a chance to try more courses, there is a great menu choice. The service in one of the resturants was only fair, however it wasn't like we had anyplace we had to be, so time shouldn't be a factor. The only two complains we had, one being our safe need to be decoded, and lack of water one day, these were dealt with immediately. The bartender DOMINGO- at the Lizard lounge made our vaction, he was fun, and he totally enjoys his job, we just can't say enough good things about him. Also the butler at the main pool- HUGO was gracious, always a smile with warm greeting. Telling us he is getting married in May to a Canadian girl, how great is that? We were a little diappointed with the two double beds in the room, but having our own beds turned out fine. The fact there were a lot of families with very young children concerned us in the beginning, however we ended up finding a area by the Lizard Lounge where there was just couples,this ended up in a little party evey afternoon. Yes, there were some parents that seemed to think it was OK to make there little 3 yr olds wait until 8PM to eat dinner, and yes they were crying, but that can go on in Calgary also. Like one guest reminded me, you may have crying children during the day, but they don't stay up all night and party until 3AM. Once again you can't have it both ways. Over all we had a great vacation, met some great people, and are a little sad that our vaction is over.

We requested a crib but we received it 3 days after we arrived. Also, the resort have missed the baby food and we were really upset with the situation. But we have to thank all the staff for their patience, everyone was so nice. We went to the timeshare presentation because we had a interest but without pressure. The kid's club is super and the food was also a big + for us.

The room was fantastic except for the firmness of the beds. We were travelling with our 24 yr old and 4.5 yr old. It was great for the kids to have their own room yet be with us. The penthouse was nice but we truly did not use it as much as I thought we might. Armando and Dario at Flavors were our favourite staff. Armando took great care of us and dinner and Dario at breakfast. Hugo by the pool is great as well, all the staff seem to work very hard and be happy to be there. The pool by the beach was very nice and we loved the beach beds as well. We booked this hotel mainly for the room and the kids club and we didn't end up using the kids club at all, we had too much fun with our 4 yr old at the pool and beach. We were in Villa 11 which was a little too far from the beach for our liking and when we asked at check in if we could be closer to the beach, we were told the only villas with penthouse suites were in 1 or 11, once we were up on the penthouse this is not true so I'm not sure what the story is there. I liked that the music at the pool seemed to stay fairly mellow and that I was only approached in person once about the \"travel club\". We were left some notes in our room about it but there was no pressure. The resort is pretty laid back, if you are looking for wild night life and pool life this is not the place.

CONS: Cab-ride to airport is either $50 USD or 500 pesos (equal to $38 USD... so keep some pesos 'til your last day, or change the equivalent at the front desk), Staffing deficiency at Green Olive restaurant makes service slow, minibar and shampoo/soap was not replenished, rocky beach, ID cards given back to another couple, lack of room service menu and resort amenities binder in-room. I stayed at Azul Fives with my fiance; we booked it on hotwire, and after realizing it was a kid-friendly resort, approached it with trepidation, but quickly realized that the kids are all well taken care of, and having children around kept things lively. ROOM: Very clean, in-room safe, comfortable beds, tastefully furnished open-concept design. Nearing the end of our trip, we made friends with another couple, and it came out that they had a binder detailing the resort's classes, amenities, and room service menu. Since this was our first all-inclusive visit, we did not know to ask for this, and realized that we missed out on the smoothie bar, bingo, cooking lessons... Also, the housekeeper did not restock the mini-bar, nor soap/shampoo for the entire duration of our stay (5 days). FOOD: Food is GREAT, albeit SLOW at Green Olive. One evening, after sitting at our table for 20 minutes, we had to ask the hostess if we had been allocated a waiter. During the same meal, it took 1 hr and 20 minutes to receive our entrees. I have to lament that the STAFF IS AMAZING, but there is clearly a serious staffing deficiency. That same night, an entire table of guests left after not being served for 20 minutes; the same table made a heated complaint to the hostess in the presence of other guests, which was deserved, although uncomfortable and awkward for everybody else. I noticed 3 other parties inquiring when they would receive service. It is important that I state that the staff is working its but off, but it's easy to see that they are stressed, which when perceived by the guest, makes things unpleasant. I have concerns regarding Azul Fives staffing issues. The bartenders are generous with the booze - in fact, I had to ask for half alcohol hat times!! Buy, hey - can't complain! The morning buffet is wonderful, with anything you can imagine. Ask for the green juice - super healthy! I experienced the room service menu on one occasion - it was ok... however, I noticed some deficiencies during my trip in food presentation, ex: I ordered beef fajitas, but they did not give any tortillas. At Tzuki, I ordered bacon-covered scallops, but only received scallops. Upon ordering green-tea tiramisu, received regular chocolate tiramisu. All-in-all, the food was great, and I was pleased with my experience. I absolutely love the ceviche at Lizard's. KEY-CARDS: Although they are a great concept, the picture taken by the front desk is very dark. Basically, it is easy to mix one couple up for another. This happened to us - unbeknownst to us, we were given back another couples card. We didn't know this, and when we presented our card at a restaurant, the other couple happened to be in front of us, and asked, 'why do you have our card?' This was embarrassing, but quickly remedied by the front desk, although it was never discovered where that original card went. BEACH/POOL: We got a beach bed facing the ocean each day. We got there around 1100, and it was no issue. Hugo is fantastic and welcoming. The beach in front of Azul Fives is very rocky. Despite having water shoes on, my fiance received some cuts. This is easily avoided by walking down the beach, and swimming further down. The beach is very clean, and the view is SPECTACULAR! GYM/ACTIVITIES: I attended yoga/stretch each morning at 9 AM. It was basic yoga, and when overlooking the beach, was unforgettable. Lorena provides a class with a great workout. The gym is well-stocked with Lifestyle machines: 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 1 stepper, and 4 strengthening machines. Free weights increase by increments of 5 lbs. I made a vase at the ceramics stand next to the bar, and they detailed it and put it in the kiln, and it looks amazing. At first, I was skeptical, but it was money well spent! I am a little upset that I did not realize that there are so many activities throughout the day!! There is a sign near the pool - although it says Fisher Price on it, do not be fooled! It has adult activities on it like Spanish Lessons, Salsa dancing etc.. SHOWS: I really enjoyed the shows; they are for guys and girls alike. The Michael Jackson show was packed, so get there early, if you are inclined. The Karisma dancers were fantastic. SERVICE: Everybody here works very hard, and are always quick to greet guests with an 'Ola.' I cannot commend the workers enough. They made my experience unforgettable. I sure hope that the management shapes up, so the poor waiters aren't always run off their feet. TAXI: I left with a bad taste in my mouth, when the hotel taxi charged $50 USD or 500 pesos. Unless, you're a chump, you would know that 500 pesos is equivalent to $38. So, save yourself $12 and change your cash at the desk before you leave.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHad a good time\u201d", "Author": "barthols2", "ReviewID": "UR121039486", "Content": "Pretty good, except the bed was no kidding, like a ROCK!!!

There are TVs and DVD players in every room. When we arrived the toy rental program allowed toys in our room for our youngest. She was thrilled. Every restarant has an abundance of high chairs, and kids toys for entertainment while you wait for your meal. There were kids meals at every restaurant. Staff were very friendly. At times there were service delays. We recommend the buffet as we were able to get in and out faster with this kids. I am Celiac and follow a gluten free diet. They offered cooking on a separate grill often. What was amazing was the gluten free muffin / cake for breakfast. They had 3 kinds! Banana, Carrot and Orange. The orange was fabulous. This was above and beyond all my expectations. The spa was the highlight of our trip. I have never taken my boys but they were so excited to come I relented. They are high energy kids and I was sceptical. They set all 3 of us up in one room. There were small robes for the kids upon check in. They served tea and chocolate milk in a relaxation room before the service. The kids never said a word through the entire treatment. My 7 year old raved about it. I loved it. The kids club is very well set up. It has a gymnastics area from 9-10, hopefully they will extend the hours. It has a lego area, a small childrens area, a video game area with 3 different game systems. The staff were amazing. My 2 year old never leaves my side and was comfortable playing on her own for short times. The beach had a very small sand area where my 2 year old played. There is a beach restoration in the plans I understand. My 10 year old loved the coral and caught small fish with a net (bring one!), snails, hermit crabs, and other treasures! Everyone loved the pools. There are winding pools everywhere. Our favorite spot was in front of building 5 and 6 which had a pool where our 2 year old can walk in. It has a very gradual incline. The old kids could play further back and swim. She loved the shallow area. I loved that she cold play alone. I understand the infinity pool will be heated shortly. My kids would swim into the evening but I find it cool. This will be a great feature. There was an abundance of beach chairs at the beach and pools. We never had to \"save\" one which is often a problem. There are many canopy beach beds which was great for a tired 2 year old when the boys wanted to keep swimming. The hotel hardly mentions the cenote. It was very cool. We saw iguanas, geckos, turtles, and MONKEYS! They were so beautiful. The buffet restaurant surrounds a cenote and you can watch the beautifully lit trees in the evening, wildlife in the morning. There is a cenote in front of building 5.

The d\u00e9cor is modern and very nice, lots of wood and nice lamps, chandeliers, art etc. Because we were there October 17-21(Off peak) the resort was not at capacity, so the pools loungers were ours for the taking. Service at the pool bar and at the outdoor grill was outstanding, as was service everywhere at the resort. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept, it takes your mind off the short walk to the beach. Once there - its kinda small which was not a downer for us because you can also continue walking in either direction for endless beach. Oh yeah - even toured the penthouse suites - of which the rooftop setup appeared to be prime for partying! Snuggling too. And the monkies came out while we were in there so that was a nice treat as we gazed out the windows at mom and baby. The food at all restaurants on the resort is excellent, along with the 24 hour room service meals. Being as though it was a milestone anniversary for us Johanna & the Executive Chef Danton set up a food tasting as our anniversary dinner because the weather the next day was more appropriate for our candlelight dinner on the beach - so we geared up for both. Our chef for both the tasting & the dinner was Chef Guillermo, he was nothing less then stellar in his explanation of ingredients, the presentation of each dish, & more importantly the tastes. He prepared a variety of dishes that were well liked (no, loved!) & appreciated by us both. We couldn't have asked for anything more at the anniversary dinner, the Chef was great, the food creations were AMAZING, & the service was top notch! They say this is GI (Gourmet Inclusive) and it truly was for us. A la carte meals & drinks whether at the pool, restaurants, or in the room. The food & people make this place heavenly. The only thing that could have made this trip better was more sun to heat the pools, but why let that stop you either. Just come, enjoy it all rain or shine good times. And if you are not having a good time - order a Sakerita. lol That drink will make anyone smile. Overall we had a great stay at Azul Fives with a superb room, top notch service, great pools, bars, and restaurants. Nothing but good experiences at 3 Karisma Resorts so far, a return is very likely. Special Shout out to Lilly & Marisol in Activities. I beat them in Blackjack AND pool basketball, but a nice tradeoff was them teaching ME the sexy moves of Salsa baby!

The breakfast buffet (at flavours) had a very wide spread in terms of variety and the quality was very good too. There was a lot to choose from at the a la carte menus for lunch and dinner at sea olives (which had a great view). The resort had a smoothie bar which served fresh smoothies most times of the day. Do go for the all-inclusive plan as its worth every dollar. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful yet unintrusive. They also had a kids club in which my niece and nephew had a great time.

Just a gorgeous resort. I chose this hotel for it's family atmosphere, large suites and abundance of pools. I traveled with several friends and 2 five year olds. So we needed to make sure there were plenty of things to do for the kids. They have a wonderful kids club with Xbox, Wii and plenty of activities going on. Beautiful pools throughout the resort, including the infinity pool near the beach, kept everyone happy. We thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations in the 3 bedroom penthouse suite. Very clean, chic and spacious. The food was delicious and they offered a nice variety. The one thing I look for most in a resort is service. You can have the most wonderful accommodations, restaurants and pools, but if you don't have great service, forget it. Well, the staff here are exceptional. They truly enjoy their jobs and have a passion for making the guests feel welcome. Of course we had our favorites including Fabian, Reyna, Domingo, Santiago, Nashielli, Marisol, Lily and Hildago. They truly made our vacation wonderful. Anything you might need, just ask. My son's 5th birthday was while we were there and the staff threw him a fantastic party in the kids club. We had a full lunch with cake and drinks, the kids had a pinata and face painting. And everything was decorated in my son's favorite spiderman theme. It was a wonderful day to say the least.

We didnt feel like we were at some huge resort where the drinks were watered down and the food was overly abbundant and tasteless. Everything here was classy and very good.

We stayed on the so called european plan which means that we were not staying all inclusive. We did eat breakfasts and one dinner at the resort. The food quality was good - better than the average all-inclusive resort. The prices were average compared to other restaurants in Playa del Carmen. They have themed restaurants which span the world for foods. My only complaint would be that Mexican food was not well represented. While Mexican food is generally known as tacos and burritos curious eaters know that there are many gourmet quality Mexican dishes such as Mole sauces that I think should be part of any high end Mexican resort. The pools and grounds were spotless, the staff very friendly. The only caution with regard to the grounds is, as mentioned in other reviews, the ocean is rocky here. For us that was not an issue at all but it is something to consider if you are planning to swim in the ocean a lot. Another point is that the resort is away from town.

We stayed at Azul 5s near Playa del Carmen and had a great time. Our trip started with us being whisked away from the airport in a stretch limo courtesy of our friends at Lomas Travel. A quick 30 minute ride and a smooth check-in with a glass of bubbly and we were off to our 2 Bedroom Penthouse Suite 1222. None of the rooms are beachfront at Azul 5s\u2026they\u2019re a short walk to the ocean and have various pools and connecting \u201drivers\u201d undulating in the middle of the units. The Penthouse is on the 3rd floor and you walk in a doorway that separates into two other doors\u2026one leading to a bedroom with 2 double beds and a bathroom with shower plus a TV and a mini fridge and the other leading to the main rooms with a complete kitchen featuring a stove/microwave and full-size fridge\u2026plus a dining area\u2026a living room with couch and TV with DVD player and sliding glass doors that lead to one of three balconies. Because of the vegetation\u2026the view on the balconies isn\u2019t much but the rooftop area makes up for this. Continuing through the room there is a small bathroom with a full wooden door (Yay!!!) and then on through sliding wooden doors that lead into the main bedroom and washroom area. A Queen size bed\u2026a closet with safe and iron\u2026and a Jacuzzi tub for two greet you as you enter. The bathroom is open to the bedroom and also has a shower. Yes\u2026the toilet has the annoying frosted glass \u201cno-privacy-for-you\u201d feature but seeing as the Penthouse has four bathrooms total (there\u2019s one on the rooftop patio too) at least you can find privacy somewhere when you need it. There is another TV and DVD player in the room\u2026an iPod Clock radio plus another glass door entrance to another balcony. (the other bedroom has a balcony too) The style of d\u00e9cor is modern and very nice\u2026lots of wood and neat lamps\u2026chandeliers, art etc. Internet WiFi is $15 a day or $70 for a week and worked fine\u2026once you got through the cumbersome online sign-up. Climbing the indoor staircase near the entranceway leads to the rooftop\u2026a huge, wonderful area to overlook the complex\u2026relax on one of the loungers or on the padded bed or take a dip in the Jacuzzi. (cold water only but fill it in the morning and it\u2019ll warm up for you from the sun) I used the rooftop every day to lay in the sun\u2026listen to music\u2026and just enjoy the beautiful weather we had. There is also a table and chairs under a slatted roof ..a storage room with a propane BBQ (more on that later) and another bathroom. All in all, having stayed in many Presidential Suites and top rooms all over the world, this was one of my favorite rooms. Because we were there Sept. 8 to 11th the resort was quite empty so the pools\u2026loungers etc. were ours for the taking. Service at the pool bar and at the outdoor grill beside it was outstanding, as was service everywhere at the resort. From a consistency point of view, Azul 5s had the best service across the board of any place I\u2019ve been to. The grounds are beautiful and well kept and it\u2019s a short walk to the beach\u2026passing a giant chess board\u2026giant checkers board\u2026a tennis court...a shuffleboard area and a ping pong table along the way, for those so inclined. At the beach there is a bar and a swimming pool with some loungers around the pool and on the sand. Many complain about the beach but to me\u2026the beach is the SAND area of which there was lots of. The sand is white and fine on the feet. The WATER part is pretty bad right in front of the resort. Not bad as in unclean but rocky for the first few feet trying to get out into the ocean. If you walk down the beach a little bit there is a patch of clear sand that leads into the water and once past the rough patch the sand is smooth and rock/coral free. There seemed to be beach service\u2026I spotted one waiter once\u2026but it didn\u2019t look like it was all that reliable. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and the Mediterranean one and the food and service was excellent at both. Room service was good and always delivered quickly but Azul 5s has the most limited Room Service menu I\u2019ve ever seen. This is unfortunate because everywhere we ate (the pool by our room had an outdoor grill and the food was excellent there too) the food was wonderful so it would have been nice to have a better selection to order to the room...especially late at night. One other complaint...hot water. For some reason our room didn\u2019t have hot water and although they came up to check things\u2026it never did reach the levels of warmth needed. The strange thing is, the connecting bedroom the boys were in had plenty of hot water\u2026go figure. After a fun day of deep-sea fishing and snorkelling booked through Lomas Travel, we arranged a rooftop BBQ for our last night. They offer 4 menus to choose from\u2026ranging in price from $40 to $90 per person\u2026and we chose the Texas BBQ along with a bottle of bubbly. Juan was our amazing chef and Orlando our wonderful waiter for the evening. Both get the highest marks for their efficiency\u2026humor\u2026cooking/serving skills and being just overall great guys. They set up a marble top table that holds all the scrumptious ingredients in front of the BBQ and set up the rooftop table for us to dine at. With music playing on our iPod\u2026a glass of champagne in hand\u2026we were ready for the magic to begin. There was potato salad\u2026green salad\u2026wings\u2026sausages\u2026turkey\u2026brisket\u2026veggies\u2026the food kept coming and coming and all of it was delicious. The wings were to die for\u2026the best I\u2018ve ever had\u2026and Juan was gracious enough to give me a bowl of the sauce to put in the fridge in case I wanted to add it to something later. If my Spanish had\u2019ve been better I would\u2019ve asked him for the recipe. If you get the Penthouse with 4 people or more, I highly recommend the rooftop BBQ. Overall we had a great stay at Azul 5s with a superb room\u2026top notch service\u2026great pools, bars and restaurants with only half a star being deducted for the small Room Service menu, rocky beach water and the hot water problems in our room.

We didn't use any of the other space except for the dining rm to eat rm service breakfast every morning. Overall the rm was clean and nice. There was a slight musty smell, but that is very common in tropical areas, but nothing overwhelming. The pools were really nice and the water was always the perfect temperature. I didn't love the layout of the resort as it was set back away from the beach front. It was a short walk from our rm to get to the main pool, and main restaurant area. If you can't easily walk then I would not recommend this. Overall I would actually come back. This resort is very family friendly and I have a toddler son that would have enjoyed it. Having access to the large suites is a perfect option for families. Also, I want to make a specific comment about the staff. I think that this was the most professional, courteous staff that I've ever come across in Mexico. Also, I've never seen so much management at a resort.

I visited over labor day weekend as guests of some friends who were renting a penthouse for a wedding party. The problems started as soon as we walked in the door. Despite being notified by our friends who were staying there, the desk staff seemed slow to understand that we were visiting and initially would not let us in on the property. They made us stand around for 20 mins while we were explaining that our friends were at a reception and were not reachable at their room. Finally after considerable amounts of pleading, someone tracked down a manager who knew we were coming and we were cleared. If only it were that easy. We basically had to sign three pages of waivers and turn over our driver's license before they let us in the property. What. The. Heck.The worst part was that there were three people in the front. Two girls who were mostly inoffensive, but deferential to the male who worked at the desk. His name was Angel. More about him later. Once we entered, it took us 20 mins before they managed to flag down a golf cart to drive us to the reception site. This wouldn't be so terrible if the golf cart station wasn't right next to the lobby with plenty of empty carts and staff hanging around the front. Once in the property it was great. Beautifully laid out, brand new, great rooms, great views. We returned to my friend's penthouse to chat and grab some food. Our friends were on the all inclusive plan and we were all hungry so I called the operator to connect us to room service. Angel picked up. I politely asked for room service and he gruffly responded \"When are you leaving?\" I was stunned. I have visited hotels and resorts all over the world. I have NEVER been addressed in such a rude and inhospitable manner. I responded, \"Excuse me?\" and he went on to rant that he knew I wasn't a guest there and how I couldn't order food, yadda...yadda..yadda. I hung up the phone and told my friends what had happened. They were FURIOUS. Our friends are professional travel agents and booked over 150 people for the wedding on the property. They could not believe I was treated so rudely, especially considering that we were all Americans without distinctive accents so he had no idea that he was talking to me instead of the actual guest of his hotel. Eventually we were able to order food, after calling the front desk several times and talking to the night manager about the horrific treatment we received. It didn't even end there. When we were trying to leave the property we STILL had problems getting a cart to take us to the lobby. We called no fewer than four times and it took us almost 45 minutes before one lazily drove by and picked us up. What's worse, multiple staff members walked by and asked us how we were doing (after all, we're two women standing in the middle of the road). However, when we inquired about the status of our cart they just mumbled an apology and wandered off without attempting to help us resolve our issue. Once we FINALLY got a cart to take us to the lobby, we got our licenses back and asked to speak to the manager. We complained about the service to the manager but she gave us a blank look, not even a halfhearted apology. I got so mad that I simply walked out and waited for a cab. I could not stand to deal with these people any more. Such a shame.

We had a 3 bedroom suite (villa 6) which was beautiful. The rooms were spacious, clean, well decorated and all connected by a common living area and kitchen. It felt like a very large condo with daily maid service; not a hotel. The grounds and facilities are very nice and well kept. I have to agree that the construction was a little annoying but not terribly so; they did a good job trying to mask the construction noises with music and kept the workers and projects hidden behind temporary walls and boards so they it wasn't all \"in your face.\" The waiters and staff everywhere were very kind, friendly and helpful. Domingo at the infinity pool bar works his tail off and deserves lots of tips. Aldair at the pool was always trying to help us with towels and getting enough seating together. The maids were very friendly and kept making creatures out of towels for us which delighted my kids. The barbecue for lunch was always good and the staff there are so helpful. There are a few monkeys on the site which would pay us a visit near our villa. They were comfortable enough to let us see them and photograph them, but were not aggessive and another source of delight for my kids. My kids did not participate in any kids club activities, (their choice) but I can say the staff was very friendly and would try to include them in sandcastle building and pool games whenever we were around. I was disappointed in the lack of water sports as other reviewers have said. I wanted my older kids to try a few things, and walking 10 minutes down the beach was not really an option for us. They should change their clamis to have such activity on their website. The food is good; but interesting. Everything was very tasty; small portions so order a lot if you are hungry! The sushi is NOT your standard sushi; it is all maki and was tasty and seemed fresh but don't be deceived into thinking that you have options for toro, unagi, and salmon sashimi ; this is \"sushi lite.\" There is good fish and other dishes at the Sea Olive ; very tasty; but small portions. That is fine as long as you are prepared to order an appetizer, and a salad and count on dessert too! There is a duo of brothers who are on site with various ceramics the visitors can paint. At first, they seemed a little pricey (don't be fooled into thinking that it is a kids club activity; it is not!) but essentially, your kids can paint everything in the colors they wish, and then the brothers \"touch them up\" and decorate them to look like authentic Mexican art pieces before they kiln them and bring them back for you to pick up the next day. They turn out beautiful. They really did make great souvieniers that my kids are proudly displaying in their rooms at home! Okay, the last word of warning. I did have a bit of gastrointestinal distress after eating at the Flavours breakfast buffet (as did someone else judging from the noises in the restroom.....sorry). This happened to me twice during the week and did not linger, but be aware of the possiblity. I did note the staff changing the food at the buffet frequently, but there are no \"thermometers\" or monitoring of the temperature of anything, so I can imagine that the potential for staph and e-coli are real. The rest of my family was fine so it may be my sensitive stomach! The beach is indeed a disappointment; they should consider dredging a small section; I don't think it was active coral as much as rocks, but it is maneuverable if you bring some ocean shoes to protect your feet from the urchins and slippery rocks. Again, too far to walk with small children to get to the soft, sandy beach that others had mentioned. You should not expect a grand lobby. Driving down the hotel strip in Riviera Maya, there are so many huge resorts with outrageous entrances and I imagine fabulous lobbies. This resort is located down a somewhat dreary road off of the main drag, is not well labelled and although clean and bright, is really a tiny little no frills lobby. Even our tour driver (we took a trip to Xel ha) asked me \"This is the lobby? I've never been here. This is it???\" They save their impressiveness for the suites; which are really great.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parma, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fabulous!\u201d", "Author": "Kdisy", "ReviewID": "UR116868686", "Content": "Like many others, I was a little worried about staying at Azul Fives from reading the reviews. BUT, I cannot say enough positive things about this resort. It was by far the most beautiful place we've stayed in. I've been to Mexico several times, and at high-end resorts, but we just had a wonderful experience here. Travelled with my husband and three children - ages 24, 20 and 12, and my 20 yrs. old's friend, who is 25. While my 12 year old wanted nothing to do with the Kids area, she was happy to spend the entire time with us. From the moment we arrived, we had a friendly greeting and offered \"azul/blue\" colored champagne as a welcome. My 12 year old daughter was given a nice cool bottle of water, which was very refreshing for her! While they did have the cool refresher towels there also, we were not offered them - not sure why, and we didn't ask. After we took a family photo for our room keys, we arrived before our 2 bedroom suite was ready. I took the advice of several travellers who left reviews, and asked for a suite in Villa 14 - and they accomodated us. Yes, Villa 14 is the place to be! It is in the center of everything - from the restaurants to the infinity pool and the beach. We left our luggage with them, as they said it would be taken to our suite when ready, and because we arrived almost 2 hours prior to check-in, we were able to get some lunch. As we were all driven by golf cart to the walkway to the beach, (which we really could have walked), we had lunch at the bbq area, which was delicious. The guys that prepare lunch here are so friendly, and everyone just about knows very good English. However, it was fun for my kids to brush up on their Spanish with many of the staff! After lunch, we walked around the resort and to the beautiful turquoise ocean. They had afternoon volleyball everyday as well as soccer and bocce ball. We really enjoyed the Salsa lessons too right by the pool. After we were driven to our room, and walked into our suite, we were in absolute awe. The suites are beautiful! With our two bedroom suite, there were separate entrances for both bedrooms, but connected through the main entrance. The kitchen, dining and living rooms were connected to the master room, with french doors for privacy. Each bedroom had its own patio with sliding doors, and right outside your bedroom was the sparkling pool - like a lazy river that went all throughout the resort. Several pool swim-up bars were all around as well. The restaurants were very good, and Sea Olive was our absolute favorite. Roberto, our favorite waiter really took good care of us! We actually ate there for lunch and dinner on the same day! While tipping is not necessary, we tipped everyone, as they all gave us such wonderful service. Domingo always took care of us at the pool bars, and if you want top shelf liquor, it's your's for the asking. The capacity the week we were there was about half full, which was nice to not have to wait for seating in any of the restaurants. Breakfast at Flavours was your typical breakfast buffet, but enough of a variety where you can something different every day. The sushi that everyone raved about on other reviews was just OK, it was your typical sushi -- but again, the wonderful service made it very enjoyable. The beach, as told by others, is not one to swim in, however, is wonderful for beach volleyball, and soccer. We did not mind at all walking down to the other resorts to their beach. One day we ventured to the right of our beach, which was about a five minute walk, and that was pleasant. The next day we went to our left, about a ten minute walk, and that's where they had wave-runners and parasailing if you wanted, and the beach there was magnificent. The sand is so soft under your feet, and the beautiful, crystal clear ocean was remarkable. At this beach, you can walk about a mile into the ocean and still only be up to your waist in the water! Our family really enjoyed ourselves at this resort, and would definitely come back again. We didn't want to leave! We had beautiful weather, with just a slight sprinkle for about ten minutes in the early morning just enough to give the landscaping a drink. I would definitely recommend this resort for anyone who is looking for something a little different, expecting great service and memories that will last a lifetime!", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cvery nice place\u201d", "Author": "2011worldtraveller20", "ReviewID": "UR116832824", "Content": "I am a world traveler, been going to Cancun/ Playa area every 3-4 weeks within 12 month. 1 bd suit is very nice!!!

( All-Inclusive Package) It is a resort that it is good and compared with what we saw walking at the beach one of the best that were around ( Sandos, Tides, Princess). If you can stay in the Grand Vela Playa del Carmen I think it is worth it ( I think it is more expensive, but from what we saw from the beach and from the infinity pools that one looked much better that this one). On the plus side: Rooms: Great Rooms, we stayed in a 1 bedroom suite it is basically an apartment, one of our friends stayed in a normal bedroom and it is very good as well. Something that might be useful the 1 bedroom suites and the regular rooms are usualy next to each other if you are travelling with relatives or a big family ask them to put them next to each other. Pools: All the pools are beautiful 3 in total ( 2 unwinding pools in the interior of the resort that circle all the building and are usually empty... + 1 infinity pool facing the beach with an amazing view.) Service: The staff is willing to serve and to help you, no attitude no laziness extremely helpful. Kids Club: It is good if your kids are between 4 and 9 ( below 4 you have to be with them over 9 they will get bored ). Activities all day long from 9 - 5 pm including lunch so that is very good. Night Shows: They have night shows every night the kids love it , Michale Jackson Show and the Magic show were great, The Circus and the Fire Show were good, the rest so-so. Neutral: Restaurants: There are 2,5 restaurants and 2 pool grills. Flavours: It is where you have breakfast and one of the options for dinner ( every night they give you a special cuisine: French, Mexican, etc... it is a buffet restaurant) Breakfasts are good and dinner for a Buffet are good as well. Sea Olive: Mediterranean Food, it is regular to good, mild flavor and some time foods comes not properly cooked. Zuki (or something like that): it is the 0.5 restaurant that I mentioned because basically is a rectangular area at the end of the Sea Olive Restaurant. Sushi is OK, the duck and the curry chicken are good. On the Sea Olive and the Zuki service is below par regarding the pace of the food coming out of the kitchen, several times the entr\u00e9e arrive before the appetizer. Portions are Gourmet-like so you will have to order more than usual. Waiters are friendly, no attitude and doing their best to compensate any negative issue. Pool Bars: The drinks are extremely soft on the alcohol content, but that is easily fixed you just ask the barman for a double, if you want international liquoor you have to ask for it ( Grey Goose and Tonic, Bacardi and Diet, otherwise they will give you off the rail liquor) Negative: Beach: No beach, at least for swimming, there are rocks, corrals, in front of the beach it is extremely difficult to get in, a guest stepped into a sea urchin and had to get medical assistance, trust me if you are going for the beach experience it is not there, you have to walk 5 minuted to the right to sneak into the Sandos Hotel Beach or 5 minutes to the left to get into a beach front that is not too appealing. People Sneaking in: We met 3 couples that they just walked into the resort from the beach, there is not bracelet only your room key that it is asked on a random basis and if you do not speack spanish and you look the part of a tourist you just say that you left it in your purse and problem solve, I think they should improve that. Internet Connection: Spotty but it work at the end $ 15 per day $ 70 per week. Punctual Negative Issues that I hope will get fix when you go: Aquatic sports activities: Zippy, nada, zero: They claimed that they had a conflict with the company that managed this activities so we ended up with no scuba diving, kayak, snorkeling, that would have mitigate the entry to the beach at least. Sky Bar: This was a big issue for us they are doing a major remodeling on this bar that it is on top of the Sea Olive Restaurant and just in from of the infinity pool so it was closed. This was a pain the neck because 1st the noise was far away from the relaxing experience you are looking for. 2nd there is no place to chill or to have a drink at the end of the day/night, the management cleverly kept on mentioning the Sky Bar as open, but what they did was that they relocated to a ballroom that is just that a small ballroom that makes you feel like you are having a drink in a prom night! Sun Umbrellas at the Infinity Pool: This is a quick fix, but they do not want to fix it, they have like 10 sun umbrellas and like 20 sun umbrellas basis. Basically what happens is that early in the morning all the lounges/chairs with shadow or a sun umbrella get taken the rest remain empty the whole day, I told the staff that we needed more sun umbrellas but he told me that when the wind gets strong they fly away so they decided to remove them I think it will be better if they have the closed on site and open them if a hotel guest ask for one. I hope this will help you, call ahead and ask if they have finished the remodel/construction and asked them if they have the water sports shop open, I did call and they never mention any of this.

We booked the 3-bedroom rooftop patio suite, and it was gorgeous. It was so nice to have a living area for us to congregate, relax, and socialize in. Since it was so hot we didn't spend much time on the rooftop patio except our last night. And all of us having our own private bedroom was totally ideal for our family situation. Unfortunately we didn't have the best of weather, but we made the most of it anyway. I won't go on about the suite, the photos on here and the hotel website are true to form. The hotel itself is beautiful and really well maintained. The infinity pool area is specatular, and although I didn't spend any time on the beach, it was of a decent size with tons of loungers available. Where this hotel excels is in the service department. I don't think I've ever had as exceptional service anywhere, and I have travelled globally including many many 5-star hotels throughout the Caribbean. The staff here really take pride in their work and always seem to go the extra mile for you, and it really is genuine. I can't say thanks enough to everyone at this hotel for the fantastic vacation my family & I had, if it hadn't been for them, the experience could have been much different. The restaurants were wonderful too. Besides a little hiccup on our first night, we had so many good meals, I unfortunately wasn't able to get back to try all the different options during our 7-night stay that looked so good. We also had dinner one evening at Senses, which isn't included in the all-inclusive package, but I wanted to treat my family to something special. It was worth the splurge, we all really enjoyed it, including my dad who is more of a 'meat & potatoes' kind of guy. On our last night the hotel had arranged a Mexican BBQ for my family on the rooftop patio of our suite. This was the highlight of the week for me. It was so amazing...they had music, served us apple martinis on arrival, had a whole bar set up and the dining table all set for us, and mmmm did it smell good! Just as were being served the BBQ, it started to downpour. No roof over our heads! We all laughed, grabbed our drinks & plates and trudged downstairs to the dining room in our suite. The guys worked tirelessly to bring the BBQ back down to us, and despite the change of locales, we had a really fun time. The service again was impeccable.

My wife and enjoyed our time here even through having a flooded room the second night of our stay with a blown hot water heater putting 2\" of water in our room in Villa 4. I now know why some rooms smell musty when you go to resorts in Mexico. They swept the water out the door and installed new water heater and had the room occupied the next day by someone else.

The suite wad great, no maintenance problems, very clean. We opted to cook all our own food (we like to cook) or get takeout and really enjoyed that - we were glad we didn't rely on the restaurants here. For very little cash you can get lovely fresh fish, great ingredients, and wonderful top-shelf booze and prepare it in your own granite and stainless steel fully equipped kitchen. Staff are eager to help you to your room with groceries and we did not feel judged in any way for cooking our own food. Pools are wonderful and are through the whole resort. We had a car and drove into Playa for supplies, shopping etc. at least once a day. We would not have liked this place so much if we were stuck there without a car. As others have said, the beach is rocky and tiny - it's not even good for snorkelling. We were mistakenly showed to a \"one bedroom suite\" without a kitchen and told this was our room. We then had to wait two hours in the lobby, without use of any facilities, to get the room we'd reserved. Apparently this was because there was nobody present senior enough to give us the room we'd actually reserved. The non-kitchen suite we were shown by mistake was a bit small and pokey, and we would not recommend those if you're going to spend time in your room. Others have indicated problems with incorrect reservations here and we experienced this too. The rooftop suites looked very good. However, there are not any true ocean-front rooms here. It did not look like any ocean views were worth having either. The staff were overall very friendly and helpful, but as well as the reservations we had long waits and other issues with valet parking (our car was recovered one time by a young staff member who did not appear to know how to drive).

We have three boys: 5, 7 and 12. For the money we spent on this all-inclusive resort, it was a colossal mistake. From facilities to service to food it was sub-par. There is no way this is a five-star resort. Please read the write-up below before you make your arrangements. ARRIVAL You enter the resort through a public access road, which is lined with some shacks, a local pool area, a mini-mart (Oxxo) and an above-ground water purification site (purifying yet to happen.) It is not a site that puts you in a vacation mood. The hotel entrance resembles a Springhill Suites or Comfort Inn. It is not ugly, but not impressive either. The check-in process was, again, comparable to a business budget hotel. It was satisfactory, but not impressive and certainly did not make you feel like an honored guest. We received a book summarizing the resort (almost all of the data in the book was incorrect...restaurants not open, times were incorrect, age limits for programs were wrong. We received a ride to our room in a golf cart and a \"tour\" of the property, consisting of pointing in the general direction of buildings. ROOMS We picked the resort for a number of reasons (as filtered through our travel agent.) One of the reasons was that we wanted a suite so that we had a room connected to our childrens' room. As it turns out, there are no true suites or connected rooms. There is a shared vestibule with an outside door and two separate rooms with their own doors. This made us uncomfortable as the kids feel very far away from you. One of us slept in the kids room on most nights. Our first room had a remarkable view of a partially constructed concrete wall and the same public access road described above in the arrival section. The next morning the view was \"enhanced\" with a dozen construction workers right beside our balcony, building the wall. The second \"suite,\" and you can see the experience is going great so far, was the same set-up, but smaller than the first. It was on the ground floor and our patio looked out on the \"beautiful\" kitchen next to a pool which we could not see...Fantastic for sitting out on the patio and feeling like you were at home, looking at your neighbor's house...not exactly five-star views. As a note and contrary to what is intimated, there are no beach-front rooms. You will have, at best, a view of the jungle or a pool. BEACH - POOLS One of the other reasons we selected this resort was that they promised a beach. We even took the step of calling and having our agent call to the resort and ask if there was a nice beach and that there were no rocks there. There is a beach, meaning sand and chaise lounges. However, if beach means walking into the water, forget about it. The water is all rock; pitted limestone with ankle-breaking holes and shells. We tried to get to deeper water the first day and almost made it, but not without a little bloodshed. We found a walk out area at different resorts about 3/4 of a mile down the beach and another one about 3/4 of a mile up the beach. Of course, because they weren't part of our beach, we couldn't get chairs or towels, but at least we could swim. We ended up going to a public beach at Playa del Carmen one of the days. We did enjoy the water, but it was crowded and cost about 9 bucks to rent chairs and about 40 dollars for lunch and drinks. By the way, the resort is bordered on both sides by public access walkways so there will be local families and fisherman who will be right beside you as you are on the beach. It made us a bit uncomfortable with our kids the first day or two. We also saw pictures of the pools when we were researching and they looked very nice. They were nice enough, but the main pool was shut down in the evening; closed completely twice and, as is detailed below, did not have drinks available all the time and certainly not after 5:30pm. You also could not swim after 11pm or before 6am. This was not an issue for us, but you should know about it before you go. Bring your own goggles, snorkels, etc. There was nothing there and there was also no buckets or any other items for kids to use for fun. SERVICE AND BARS The service was horrid! The staff did say \"Hola\" everytime they walked by, but little else. Getting answers to questions like, \"Is there an ATM?\" or \"What fun stuff is there to do?\" or \"Can I get something to eat?\" seemed near impossible. On the three occasions my wife and I wanted a beer at the swim-up pool, they were out of beer. Twice, they were out of ice for daquaries. The swim-up bars closed, theoretically at 6 pm, which is already bad enough, but but they started closing as early as 5. The staff didn't even look at you when you went to the bar for a drink, but instead kept cleaning. When you asked for a drink, they just mumbled, \"closing.\" This happened every day at the main bar. Our youngest two were ignored unless our oldest or my wife and I were with them. Even after monetary tips to the bartenders and servers, drinks were hard to come by. CLEANLINESS The rooms were clean enough when we arrived, but the service to them was spotty. One day the coffee mugs were not replaced and only one room had its bed made. The floors were not cleaned all week and the showers were not cleaned the last three days. The outside was fairly clean and the restaurants and public areas seemed clean enough. The grounds were very well manicured. There was a ton of construction. There was a restaurant shut down; two areas were barricaded by large sections of plywood; walls were being constructed. It was like living inside a renovation for a week...not exactly relaxing. We are in Mexico, so you have to expect some insect life. There were mosquitos, spiders, ants and a very large (2-inch) bug which looked a little like a locust. We were ok with mosquitos. The \"locust\" was our guest for the week, but he mostly kept to dark areas. The spiders we killed. There was also a bug that was not quite distinguishable after my wife squished it. None of this was overwhelming, but you should be prepared for it. SPA My wife and I did a couples massage. It was one of the highlights of the resort experience. The staff was nice. It was a relaxing area and the cold/hot tubs, sauna and steam rooms were great. RESTAURANTS There are really only two restaurants. One is near the check-in area and is more family-oriented with a buffet-style selection and different types of food each night. The other restaurant pretends to be three with one under construction. However, all of these restaurants share one kitchen. We are not sure if this is what caused slow services or not, but the service was VERY slow. The selection of meals for kids at Tsuki (Asian) was not great and they didn't seem to want to accomodate requests. We ended up taking the kids to the buffet at Flavours for dinners, even if we (mom and dad) ate at one of the other locations. The portions are incredibly small. The duck entree, which tasted great, included three, 2-inch by 1/2 inch strips of duck and a tablespoon of carrots and greens. My 12 year old needed to go to the buffet afterward to get more food. The sushi was good as well. The desserts were portion-size challenged, too. The cheesecake was a one-inch diameter cupcake on a plate. It was less than a bite and that was all you received. We were only on site for lunch twice (see beach and pool section.) Only one restaurant was open for lunch. The kids pizzas and hamburgers were ok and the \"barbeque area\" which served chicken and sausages was, likewise alright, but was far away from the pool areas and had little selection (not even cheese for the hamburgers!) Service at the lunch areas was also very slow. It took 45 minutes to get a meal of a warmed up pizza for each of my sons and a hamburger. Also, beware of some extra charges for room service ($6 Delivery charge) and for top-level wines. We waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for a room service delivery the one time we used it. ENTERTAINMENT and KIDS CLUB The nighttime entertainment was another bright spot. It was a little hokey (think Dirty Dancing) but good. The fire show was good and the carribean dancing show was also very good. The daytime entertainment, was a little less than we expected, but they tried. Our young kids liked the one day that they were at Kids Club. There were games, a gymboree kind of area and a small pool. The staff seemed nice. There was a bit of a language barrier. It was good for kids under age 8. There was nothing for our 12 year old to do at all (he did not stay there.) According to the booklet, there was supposed to be a teen kids club, but, as it turned out, there was not. It was a tough resort for him as the adults ruled the pool and the young kids were in kids club. The Tweeners and teenagers all looked bored.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harmony", "Title": "\u201csaved by a nightmare at dreams tulum\u201d", "Author": "JoanieBaker", "ReviewID": "UR116040579", "Content": "we booked our trip at dreams tulum which was a nightmare after 3 hrs we ran away as fast as we could azul fives was wonderful the staff was very friendly and could not do enough for you the room were wonderful we had a 2 bedroom suite my only complaint was the beach it was very rocky and made it hard to get into the water but that was the only problem that we can say we will be back for sure", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, relaxing week\u201d", "Author": "TammyandMike", "ReviewID": "UR115905132", "Content": "We arrived on 7/16 in the evening. The Cancun airport is crazy. You are verbally assaulted by time share people. If you aren't warned you would never know. They tell you that you have to stop and answer their questions or fill out forms. At the hotel we were the only people checking in and it went quickly and smoothly. A cart driver took us to our room after giving us a tour of the grounds. The rooms were beautiful and spacious. We had a one bedroom suite. The bedroom is separated by a sliding door that does not lock. The weather was beautiful the entire week. Hot, humid with only one short storm on Friday evening. The temperature wasn't a problem since we stayed at the pool all day. We went into town one afternoon but it was too hot to enjoy it. Go in the evening when it is cooler! The food was very good. Breakfast was buffet style in Flavours. Variety was fine for the week. The eggs are so buttery and delicious. There was an omelette bar each day. The orange juice is so sweet and made great Mimosas. Lunch was either Sea Olive or a grill out in the garden area. The staff grilled hamburgers, steak, chicken and fish. There were side dishes and their FANTASTIC Guacamole!!! Sea Olive had wonderful, freshly prepared cuisine. The food is a mix of all nationalities with highlights of the local Yucatan food. Not what you typically see in the States. No salsa, no tacos! Dinner was Sea Olive, Tsiki or Flavours. Sea Olive is mediteranean, Tsiki is Asian and Flavours has a different theme each night. Food was always good. A couple of the pool bars also served snack food and light meals. The Zky bar is open each night and is all ages until 10:30. They show music videos, there is a movie on the schedule but we never saw one, and they have a nightly performance at 9:30. The Michael Jackson show was Great! The guys who directed the activities were so friendly and energetic. There is an activity schedule posted by the pool and on the TV. There is also a newsletter that is in the lobby of each restaurant listing daily information. Beware - information is not always accurate. The posted theme for Flavours dinner wasn't always what you got when you arrived. We showed up on Mediteranean night and they were serving Oriental food. There was also listings for wine tastings and tequila samples. We never saw either of them and the staff we asked had no idea what we were talking about. The activity shed, where you can get kayaks and snorkeling gear was sometimes closed for the day with no explanation. The hotel is in the process of adding some new restaurants and improving the grounds. A big thank you to Sergio in the smoothie bar. My son visited him multiple times each day. Sergio even took the time to give him smoothie making lessons. Yadira at the Infinity pool gave us such great service. She was always there ready to get us whatever we needed. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Everywhere you went you were greeted by staff members. The only problem came when we made a business call using a local Mexico number. It was a toll free number but the hotel charged us $4 per minute anyway. I am not sure that they understood that they would not be charged for the call. We make these types of business calls all around the world multiple times per year and this is the only time that we have been charged for them. The infinity pool has the most refreshing water. The other pools have very warm water. We felt very much at home here.

The hotel is rated four (4) stars) - I would give it a 3 star rating. Playa del Carmen is well okay they had one street to go shopping on and nothing is inexpensive. This was a very expensive vacation. Any of the day trips are outrageous in price. Oh before I sign off all four of us went to the spa. VERY EXPENSIVE, but it was really nice and relaxing.

We spent five days with our 8 year old son and loved every minute. The hotel is about 25 minutes south of cancun. Delta travel handled our transport to the hotel, which was fast and efficient. The rooms are very clean and well appointed, our son loved the in-suite jacuzzi and there was a full kitchen that we didn't need (because we selected the all inclusive option). We were in the first set of rooms, near the front of the resort, close to the Flavors restaurant and a 20 yard hop into the pool. Three of the pools run the interior of the resort and act as sort of a lazy river to move between rooms and the pool bars. There is also an infinity pool that overlooks a beautiful white sand beach. This pool is close to three restaurants and has a pool bar as well. The beach itself was clean and the water warm and inviting, but there are a lot of rocks about 10 yards out, which made playing in the surf difficult. If you're a snorkeler, you can swim past the rocks, we saw many doing this, but it wasn't our thing. For those interested in the all inclusive, here's the run down. Pool bars are open from around noon until 5:00ish. After 5, you can get drinks at the main bar (by the infinity pool, open late) and at Flavors restaurant (until 10). Rooms service can bring cans of beer to your room, but don't deliver anything stronger. The restaurants were excellent, service was generally quick and efficient. Flavors had a great breakfast buffet that ran from 6:30am til noon, lunch was available at the Sea Olive (sit down) the Lizard (part of the pool bar) and a bbq setup from noon until 3. All of the food has to be eaten in specified areas, which was a big deal, but made pulling my son away from the pool more difficult. There also weren't any snacky foods (chips, cookies, etc..) available as part of the AI package. Not a huge deal, but sometime you want just a snack, not a full meal... There are three restaurants open at dinner, the Sea Olive has outdoor seating and an assorted menu, Tsuki, has a pacific-asian theme with sushi and other asian-fusion dishes. Flavors offers a similar menu to the Sea Olive, but seems more formal. There is also a fourth restaurant, but it was not part of the AI package, so we didn't experience it. There are no dress requirements at any of the restaurants, tee-shirts and baseball hats mix with island casual. The Sky bar offers drinks and dancing each night and have a family friendly show each night (magic, mexican dancers, circus acts and a Michael Jackson impersonator). Our son is a pool rat and very happy to swim 24/7, there was some water sports available (boogie boards, kayaks) and a game area with an oversized chess/checkers set, a pingpong table and shuffleboard set up. The paddles and pucks are only available when the kids club is open (usually until 5) which was a challenge since the area is not in the shade and an early afternoon game under the mexican sun can sap your energy... We did a package tour to Chechen Itza, which was incredible, but a very long bus ride (2.5 hours both ways). We also decided to walk from our resort to Playa Del Carmen, which took about 2 hours and picked up a cab back to the resort. We didn't take advantage of the in room Internet, it required an ethernet connection. You could also get a password for their wifi, which seemed to be well distributed near the pools, I was able to get a wifi (open) connection at the infinity pool on my iphone.

Rooms: The one bedroom suite is very spacious and comfortable,the 1&1/2 bathrooms are great. The lighting in the vanity area definately needs upgrading. Closet and storage area are plentiful. AC was fine but it did make the chandelier clank all the time. Housekeeping did a fine job everyday. Pools: The pools are terrific and do wind around most of the property. We mostly swam at the Lizards pool which had the snack bar directly behind it making for quick nachos, burgers ,etc.The bartenders,Ali, Cheddar(Ivanhoe) and Domingo did a fine job keeping the drinks flowing. The Infinity pool near the beach is very nice also but has more guest and not as peaceful. Beach: The beach area has plenty of loungers and looks good but the coral, rocky entry make for a difficult swim. A 5-10 minute walk south(to the right) will bring you to a nice area for entering the water with no problem but the water is shallow,probably a sandbar. Restaurants/Food:Flavours is the International restauraunt that was open for Breakfast featuring a buffet with an omlette station.All items were served hot and were good. The pastries could be better, the coffee and tea were very good.Dinner items were quite good here. Sea Olive was open for lunch and dinner. Lunch at the Sea Olive was excellent and all items on the menu were great (Highly recommended for lunch). Dinner items were good but service seems a little slow at dinner, we ate there twice for dinner at had the same experience. Tsuki is the Asian restaurant that is open for dinner only and was our favorite, all the items on the menu are very tasty and you can't go wrong sampling them all. Staff: everyone we encountered was openly friendly and polite, we had great service from the following Hostesses Sol, Bernice Waiters Jose, Esteban, Ammondo,Flavio,Manuel,Mayo and their captain Christopher. A special thanks to Yadira Carrion for taking care of my request. Final thought: overall we had a great time at Azul Fives' there are a couple items that will get better as the resort matures, we were told the two additional restaurant will be added in the near future( a Mexican and an Italian) and that will help out with more variety, an expansion is also in the future adding more room and an additional two restaurants bring the total to seven. The property is on it's way to a five star in the not to distant future.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe Good & The Bad\u201d", "Author": "csumn", "ReviewID": "UR115370614", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Azul Fives (AF) resort in early July. There were a lot of good things about the resort and then some bad things. There are a variety of reviews on here about AF and I hope I can help others in deciding where to stay in the Maya Riviera. First of all, bring insect repellant. Put it on before you arrive at the resort. The mosquitos are everywhere. We sprayed it on in the morning and reapplied it as needed after going in the pool, etc. After being bitten in the night, the spray went one before bedtime as well. The front desk was a bit chaotic when we first arrived, but very soon were made to feel welcome by the staff. All of the golf cart drivers that take you to your room and around AF were fantastic and super nice. We booked a 1-bedroom suite and were put in Villa 1. Unfortunately, this is one of the \"condo\" rooms which meant most of the kitchen cabinets were locked and the \"extra bathroom\" in the living room area was a locked storage closet. Not what you want with a family of 4 with 2 little kids always needing to go to the bathroom in the night. Villa 1 is also right next to the entrance of the resort and the buffet restaurant, gym and spa, but the furthest away from the beach, kids club and other restaurants. We asked to be moved because of this and didn't get any resolution until the next day at check-in time. We could have downgraded to a smaller room that night, but chose to wait to get the room we booked and paid for. We were moved to Villa 5 which was great. Right next to the kid's club and a short distance to the beach and the infinity pool which were the places to be. Room issues with the new room was that the ceiling fans operated via remote control. The one in our main bedroom did not work including the light staying on. We had to get someone in to fix this. Everyone on staff was fast at helping whenever needed. The lighting in the bathroom is not good as it has been reported. I always went into the living area and used the huge mirror to do my hair and makeup. So much easier. For those planning on using the sofa bed for the kids in the 1-bedroom suite. It may or may not have any bedding already on it. Check this before you get ready to go to sleep or you'll have to wait for housekeeping to bring you anything. Make sure to ask for sheets, blanket and pillows because there are no extras in the closet. It's a sectional and you take the larger side for the bed. We used the \"extra\" part to make a 2nd bed for our other child, just needed extra bedding for that as well. Housekeeping was very hit and miss. There was no toilet paper in the \"extra\" bathroom that we had to request. The kleenex dispenser was empty. They took the \"do not disturb\" sign for the door after the first night so we were woken up by housekeeping a couple of mornings. Bath mat was taken away after the first day and returned 2 days later. Didn't get any face towels after the 2nd day. Had to request those. Lots of calls to housekeeping and leaving notes in the best Spanish language I could muster. The chandelier does make a clunking noise, but was worse in Villa 1 than 5 for some reason. It appeared that you needed to put your room service plates, etc. outside the main door to your room (there's a foyer first), which led to ants near the room. There were some inside as well (on the 2nd floor). We had a trash bag liner in the kitchen can (located under the sink in the cabinet) and also in the bathrooms for just 1 day. Never to return. Made it difficult to throw out any uneaten food, etc. from room service. As far as the resort itself, you have to go down a bumpy side road to get to it. Some of the other resorts along the highway had gigantic stone entryways right off the highway, so it seemed a bit odd when we took the \"scenic route\" to AF. The kid's club was fantastic. Our kids loved it (ages 4 and 6), but I'd be hesitant with teenagers, it's not really something for them. Watch out for face painting night. The paint was not easy to get off their faces and ended up all over their clothes and the room. They take the kids to the main pool and the beach as well. Didn't see them go in the kiddie pool at the kids club. Infinity pool was great. Only goes to about 4 feet, so no deep end really. Great for people watching and the beach view. Great service here as well at the pool bar. The beach has nice sand, nearer the water, there's bits of shells that make it a bit crunchy underfoot. There are rocks (coral?) at the front and even with treaded water shoes, I would watch your step if a wave hits you then you could easily slip and fall in the water and possibly hurt yourself. You can walk down the beach if you want to go right in without the rocks. Watch out for ants near the lounge chairs that move to where someone may have spilled a drink. Only saw one night of the shows. A fire show on the beach. It was a bit late for the kids (9:30), but we really enjoyed it. I would suggest you book enough days there to account for weather/rain issues. It rained everyday and we had only 2 days where we had enough sun to go to the pool for more than 20 minutes. There's not much to do there if it rains. I didn't see too many people tipping, but we tipped $5 at each meal, $2-3 for room service and $2-3 for housekeeping each day. Would I go here agin? Probably. When the sun was out, it was great to go to the beach or the pool. I've never been to this area before so I have nothing to compare it to as far as other resorts. The room was great except for all the little nit-picky things. I just wished the rain had stayed away. Please message me if you have any questions. I did so with other reviewers before we went and they were immensely helpful in answering random questions about AF.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to relax and forget your stress\u201d", "Author": "krntxn", "ReviewID": "UR115174149", "Content": "My husband and I recently were married at the Azul Fives in early June. We spent 5 nights there. I had an incredible amount of anxiety about this location from all the poor reviews I read and my husband disliking sand, hot weather and Mexico (he compromised on the location to make me happy). From the moment we arrived, we had an incredible vacation. We were immediately upgraded to a 2 bedroom penthouse suite complete with a rooftop deck without making the request. Ernesto drove us around the property to our suite and gave us our incredible introduction to our rooms. Our deck was spacious enough for many guests and included a cold water jacuzzi, barbeque grill and bathroom so people didn't have to walk downstairs. My husband was in complete awe. The rooms are incredibly nice and roomy. It's above what I've seen at other resorts. And the bed was comfortable to sleep in. Room services is just room service. It was just average. I can't complain since I never had an upset stomach my entire stay which is uncommon for me even at home. There are 3 restaurants that rotated lunch and dinner service due to the low occupation on the resort. We loved that it wasn't crowded since we could enjoy the atmosphere and service. When our guests arrived they experienced the same type of experience. Sol, Berniece, Jesus, Armando, Manual and Jorge are among the few that provided excellent service. They went above and beyond what I personally consider good service. And as we learned their names and some of their backgrounds, they also learned ours. When our wedding day approached, they all seemed to know that we were the couple getting married that Saturday and gave their well wishes and sentiments. On our wedding day, Estefania from the resort and Itzy from Lomas Travel eased all my anxiety about having a destination wedding. These girls are professionals and have an eye for detail. I can't say enough good things about how well things went. They arranged so our ceremony could be in the Zky Bar so my husband wouldn't sweat his suit off. My hair is especially curly and typically I straighten it. There was no amount of work I could do alone to make it manageable. Estefania and Itzy made an appointment for my hair to be done. I was extremely pleased with the outcome. It stayed up until I washed it out. We arranged for our dinner after our ceremony and it too was wonderful. The staff took great care of everything and even teased the both of us at certain times since we had already gotten to know them. The next morning our breakfast in bed was late and I had to run to eat make it for my scuba dive trip. I ran over to the restaurant and the head waiter recognized me immediately and asked why wasn't I in my room. I explained I have to eat before I go on my dive but my husband is in the room so it's ok. He went out of his way to have everything on our breakfast in bed menu served to me there in the restaurant while my husband had an identical one served in the room. We chose Caribe Photography for our wedding photographer and coincidentally they are among the list of photographers that Azul allows on site without an extra charge. Marco, our photographer is extremely talented. He took some beautiful pictures that have many of our friends in family stunned at our gorgeous pictures. I will add there was a miscommunication about when our pictures would arrive stateside but everyone at Lomas Travel did their best to take care my questions. We did go on several excursions on our trip that were handled by Lomas Travel. My husband and my brother went to Coba. They were informed it was to be a 4-5 hour trip which ended up being gone 10 1/2 hours instead. They came back hungry, sweaty and irritable. Two vans broke down that were to return them back to the resort. My brother actually got under the hood to reconnect a battery cable to get it started. The very next day we went to discuss the trip with Gerry who is with Lomas Travel. He knew what happened before we even got to tell him. He was so apologetic about their experience. He arranged for my husband and my brother to take another excursion to snorkel and sky ride (similar to para-sailing). Those 2 came back with gigantic smiles and some incredible pictures. I ended up scuba diving with a friend and had an incredible dive and saw a lot of wildlife. The beach is beautiful there. It's only a small strip at the end of the hotel However there is coral right in front of the Azul's beach and inexperienced swimmers should walk down the beach where it's clearer. It did not detract from my experience whatsoever. The nighttime entertainment would have to be the one place it was lacking. We went up to the Zky Bar in the evening expecting music and possible dancing. Instead people were playing bingo and poker. When one of my guests went to inquire about music, they were told that it would start at 1030p. At 1030p they switched from bingo to Mexican bingo which was funny to me. The evening of our wedding, it was an equal let down. I didn't want to go out into Playa but stay at the resort and enjoy the amenities but the entertainment was sorely lacking. I will admit that since the resort was not heavily populated, that could be among the reasons why the entertainment and activities were not stellar. There were very few things I could complain about. The lighting in the bathroom is definitely dim to put on makeup. I had to turn on all the lights (there are a ton of light switches to figure out) so I could have more light to do my hair and makeup. Internet is not a free amenity here. I was incredibly surprised to learn that it was $15/day or $75/week. I feel like I should have opted for their plan after I accessed my email on my phone for a mere 15 min. That 15 min cost me triple their weekly rate. The room service menu could include a few more items. Most of the deserts were strangely shaped like flan but flan was not on the menu. Even the tiramisu was shaped like flan, lacked lady fingers and just tasted like coffee. My wedding cake was absolutely horrible. Not one of my guests ate more than a single bite. The flowers and trim were supposed to be a light pink and instead were a hot pink. (For those that know me well, it was incredibly funny). That was such a waste of money to spend on a cake I hated. For me to mention these few things even seems petty. That's how great everything else was on our stay. I think that our entire experience was wonderful. The best compliment I could give is that my husband wants to return. That's huge for someone that hates sand, heat and thought he hated Mexico. In fact he's mentioned it many many times since we've returned. It is an incredibly beautiful place. I have wonderful pictures of our wedding and great memories of our stay. I would love to go back again.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cA Beautiful Resort.

The property was just beautiful and the grounds were very well maintained. The pictures don't do it justice. If there were ever issues with the staff, management has taken care of them. We had a champagne reception at check in and everyone we encountered was friendly, helpful and accommodating. Nothing was stolen from our rooms and the refrigerator in both rooms was stocked everyday. Based on other reviews I even brought my own instant coffee fearing the coffee bar in the room wouldn't be restocked but it was never an issue. Many staff made a point to remember our names and even what we liked to drink. When it started to rain one afternoon the bartender at the Lizards pool bar ran to put our things under the umbrella so they wouldn't get wet - how thoughtful was that. Shout out to Santiago and Christian - they made my daughter feel special and even helped her with her Spanish. She learned how to Salsa too. Never having been to an all inclusive, we thought the food was very good for the most part but by the end of the week we were ready for something else. Flavours was open for Breakfast where you order from the menu or the buffet and it was good. The Smoothie Bar was tucked in between the spa and the gym. Lunch was Sea Olive or Lizards. We usually ate at the pool bar unless it was raining (which it did for 3 days straight) as Sea Olive seemed a little formal for our swimsuits. Sea Olive has a nice outside dining area but when it rained it would get wet. I loved the ceviche, guacamole and nachos at Lizards but wished the resort offered more Mexican dishes. Sea Olive and Tsuki were open for dinner. Sea Olive was OK but could have used a few more choices on the dinner menu (they should consider opening up their lunch menu for dinner too); the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We really enjoyed Tsuki. One night at Sea Olive we asked if we could have sushi appetizers from Tsuki and they arrived with no fuss. We found the wine, both red and white, to be very good. We went to the entertainment every night and thought it was just great. We took advantage of the Spa and it ranks right up there as one of the best I've experienced. The prices were comparable to any nice spa in a large resort so people that complained about the prices must not go to many resort spas. They were offering a 2 for 1 treatment special which sealed the deal for me and the personal attention we received was worth the price. I also used the gym most days and it had everything I needed. I had to ask someone to make the room cooler 2 of the days which they did with no issue. We had a 2 BR penthouse and it was perfect since we had our teenage daughter with us so it afforded everyone plenty of privacy. She was thrilled with her room, it was really large and had it's own balcony. Unfortunately we had to be moved in the middle of our stay because her room started leaking from all of the rain. Our 1 BR suite was very spacious and comfortable. We never had any issues with cleanliness that others have complained about and always had fresh towels (some shaped like swans and rabbits too, a very nice touch). The lighting in the bathroom vanity is terrible though- even my husband commented on that. I was able to swing the makeup mirror into the water closet where there was plenty of light to see to put on my makeup! There were some other design issues like the light fixture over the dining room table that rattled non stop from the air vents blowing on it and it was just loud enough to become very annoying after a while. We couldn't figure out how to get the shower to work after we were moved but called maintenance and they were there in just a few minutes to take care of it. About the view, the first half of the week our view was of the woods and a dirt road separated by a fence (villa 7). We were on the 3rd floor so it afforded plenty of privacy and we could see a little of the ocean - it was peaceful as there was no noise coming from the pool area. If I had been on the first floor I would not have wanted to look out at a fence. When we were moved (villa 8), we overlooked the pool with a pretty view of the property but it obviously didn't have the same privacy. That wasn't as much of an issue since the resort was no where near capacity but if there were lots of people at the pool all day long I would not have liked overlooking all of that noise and activity. It just depends on what your family prefers. Not sure I would do the penthouse again for my small family since we really didn't need the space. It was a very cool concept but it was too hot to use during the day since there was no shade and no cover when it rained. The Jacuzzi only had cold water so we never used it either. I can see if you had a large group it would be a nice place to have a cookout catered or to hang out in the evening but we did not get our money's worth from that. There isn't much to do when it rains or places to go other than your room but I think they realize this and are working on some rain activities. I am a beach person more than a pool person so not having access to the ocean was a let down for me - yeah, you only have to walk a few minutes down the beach but if I'm spending that much money I want to be able to get out of my lounge chair and swim in the ocean. My husband and daughter prefer the pool area so they were very happy. The infinity pool at the beach and the beach itself was awesome with lots of lounge chairs, palm trees and nice service. I didn't find it to be tiny and crowded whatsoever. It was really beautiful and the view was just what I had hoped for. Don't be put off by some of the bad reviews. They are very unrealistic and certainly don't outweigh all of the good things Azul Fives has going for it.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconson", "Title": "\u201cA great vacation for everyone\u201d", "Author": "Coolhandluke13", "ReviewID": "UR114937740", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Azul Fives with family and friends and felt the need to write a short review for those that might be considering a stay. I must say beforehand that I read many reviews before we left in hopes to find any useful information. Well, there was enough negative talk to raise some concerns. However, in light that we all have individual experiences, our stay was without hesitation, fantastic! It would be unfair to this resort to discredit their endeavors by not acknowledging the amount of effort the staff ignites to meet the needs for a mass variety. Thank you staff. We began our stay by a very smooth friendly front desk visit and was escorted via golf cart to our room. Our room was spacious and clean with a modern motif. We had a beautiful jungle like view that was frequently visited by a family of Spider Monkeys. It was hot outside and decided to hang out by the main pool area. The pool was well taken care of and offers a swim up bar. The bartenders were always willing to quench your thirst with your drink of choice and even upon request, concoct something on their own. Oh, I liked the Mango Margarita. The ocean provided a special canvas for that special feel. The beach in front of the resort is rocky but didn't bother us because we enjoyed our ocean walks and found spots to dip in. The food provided by the restaurants was on point. They offer a nice variety and more importantly...they aim to please! So if your order isn't satisfying, say something. The staff works hard to please your needs. Also, room service is available.

Given that we are having over 40 guest coming to the property, we wanted to see the different room types. From the deluxe room with two double beds all the way to the two or three bedroom penthouse condo, the rooms are quite spacious and truly feels like a nice contemporary condo. Other areas are quite impressive including several pools w/swim-up bars, first-class/excellent spa and Fisher Price klids club. I am a gym finatic and was worried that they would not have adequate facilities, that was proven wrong. Their gym is very nice, modern with a selection of freeweight dumbells, cardio and lifting stations. Equally impressive is the sky bar which overlooks the pool and beach area.

This resort shines in certain areas, and still has work to do in others, but overall is a very high quality resort. The Skinny: The Rooms - Probably the nicest, largest rooms for families in Riviera Maya. We stayed in a 2 bedroom penthouse suite with 2.5 bathrooms. Master bedroom was good size, good design, and large comfortable bed. Somewhat short on closet space but due to large size, more than enough space for suitcases to act as additional storage. Children's room was also excellent size with nicely designed bathroom. Family room was amazing with comfortable sofa, powder room, and kitchen. We didn't use this extra space often, but was nice to be able to spread out. Showers were great with no hot water issues even at peak times. Pools - there must be 10 pools on property....some around the rooms and then the larger pool by the beach. All were spotless and modern. Temperature was fine even for the kids, and the rumor is that they will soon all be heated. Service - we found service in all areas to be top notch (restaurants, housekeeping, bartending, beach, spa, etc.). Everyone had a smile and was very friendly. Employees seemed happy to serve and some totally went out of their way, especially with the kids, to ensure that everything was going well. Food - although I enjoyed the food more at El Dorado properties and Azul Beach - they are all the same owner, so although the food surpassed most other family resorts, it didn't meet the really high expectations I had going in. I found the breakfast buffet ok, but lacking variety (and enough fresh vegetables like tomatoes/cucumbers/etc.). Lunch had lots of options both by the pool, the BBQ, or the grills around the pools around the property. No wait for tables as a result. Dinner was somewhat limited and the biggest disappointment....japanese was good but otherwise found the food lacking some variety. They really need 1 or 2 more dinner options to keep things interesting for a week stay. Beach - Yes, the beach here is nice. The ocean isn't (with rocks as others have mentioned). Sand on the beach was clean, with plenty of lounge chairs and great sand. Yes - it is a pain to walk the 4-6 minutes north or south on the beach to swim....but for families where ocean swimming isn't a primary need - the beach and numerous pools more than make up for it. Entertainment - I was pleasantly surprised with the evening entertainment. It's not Iberostar quality but much better than other similar family resorts (Riu, Barcelo, etc.) I did feel that the daytime entertainment was rather lacking for adults, and although the kids club provided some entertainment - I expected more for teens/pre-teens. Perhaps we didn't look for it also. Spa - The spa on property exceeded my expectations. Great waiting area upstairs and relaxing sauna/pool area downstairs. Room Service \u2013 Usually one of my biggest pet peeves on property \u2013 small menus of pre-prepared food. Not here. Menu was good size with plenty of options for the kids on the meals they didn\u2019t want to go to the restaurant. We even ordered off the menu a couple of times with requests \u2013 that the resort had no issue fulfilling Roof deck \u2013 Although, I don\u2019t believe most of the people in penthouse rooms even use their deck\u2026..we actually had a private BBQ on the deck one night. It wasn\u2019t very expensive and allowed our group to have an amazing meal to our specifications , excellent food, and top notch service. It would be a great idea for a special birthday, anniversary, or other dinner. Really a great concept that doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in Riviera Maya. So, all in all, we had a very good stay.

It is smaller and more intimate, which is terrific if you\u2019re looking for a more relaxed, low key atmosphere, away from the frenetic pace of some resorts. But, when occupancy is low, it almost feels like a ghost town \u2013 it was eerie walking to dinner several nights without seeing another person. And swim up bars at a couple of pools were closed because there weren\u2019t enough guests to justify opening them. If you tire of the slow pace, excursions abound and Playa del Carmen is a $15 cab ride away. The grounds are well kept and manicured and the winding river pool is cool and unlike anything I\u2019ve encountered before. There are three restaurants as opposed to the five or six choices at larger resorts. Our penthouse suite was as well appointed as any I\u2019ve stayed in and the Salvatore Ferragamo bath and beauty products are among my favorites from any resort. And in a region of adult only resorts, Azul Fives is family friendly, complete with its own Kid\u2019s Club. Restaurants require no reservations, you simply show up and are seated, a pleasant change from the circus of standing in line at an appointed hour to reserve your restaurant of choice that night. Breakfast is the typical wide-ranging buffet, including an omelet station and bloody mary/mimosa bar. Lunch offerings were a little common, and while adequate, don\u2019t live up to the gourmet-inclusive concept \u2013 skimpy ingredients on the pizza and a thin, pre-frozen hamburger patty that got lost on a huge bun. One shock was requesting ketchup and receiving little packets like you get at McDonald\u2019s, definitely not in keeping with the gourmet concept. The restaurants really shine at dinner with superb entrees \u2013 Coq Au Vin and Lamb Shank were among my favorites. And if you\u2019re not on the all-inclusive plan, called gourmet-inclusive here, the ala carte menu pricing is very reasonable. Service at the restaurants is not bad but was noticeably slower than what I\u2019ve encountered at other resorts. Except at breakfast, we lingered too long at the hostess stand before someone noticed and came to seat us and it often took too long before anyone approached our table. Chris, the manager at Sea Olive and Tzuki, came to our rescue one night and became our favorite employee. Pluses include a great housekeeping staff, constantly replenishing towels even at turn down. Requests from housekeeping and maintenance were dealt with immediately and satisfactorily. And the evening entertainment (think fire shows and a Caribbean revue) was fun, professional and engaging. Drawbacks include a rocky beach not very suitable for swimming. And we encountered the same issues with hot water from the shower noted in other reviews. We felt foolish after calling maintenance and steaming hot water came pouring out when they turned it on. Something about the design of the handle requires working it just a certain way to get hot water. And the grid over the bathroom sinks causes lighting to be shadowy and uneven, not good for putting on makeup, shaving, or even brushing one\u2019s hair and teeth. The differences between Azul Fives and other resorts is really a matter of degree, a reflection of each resort\u2019s personality. We left happy and satisfied and would return again.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat trip!

The service was the best I have had anywhere! I have traveled all over the world and have never had such consistently pleasant interactions with the hotel staff. Five star hotels like the Ritz Carlton have nice service, but it often feels forced and with an expectation of a tip. Without exception, EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE at Azul Fives was extremely nice and attentive. We could not walk 50 feet without someone saying \"Hola.\" If we looked slightly lost, we were offered help. We were known by name after the first day. We had a 1 bedroom suite, about 1100 square feet and it was beautiful. The first night we had a room looking towards the outside of the resort (some trees and barbed wire included), but we asked for and were moved the next day to a ground floor pool-front suite. The value of having such a huge room was awesome. I can't see going back to a regular hotel room with 2 kids. We could walk onto the patio and jump straight in the pool, but the resort was fairly deserted the first few days and it felt a little lonely. The patio had to be 40 feet long with 2 arm chairs and 2 loungers. We were about 50 feet from a swim-up bar, but it was closed, which was disappointing, presumably because of the low (30%) occupancy. The beach infinity pool and bar were great. My wife commented that the view looked like a Corona commercial. Beach was very nice, but as others have mentioned you need to walk down the beach a little to walk casually into the water due to rocks and coral. The upside is that the kids loved looking at the sea life in the little tide pools between the rocks. We spent all almost our time at the pools anyway so it was not really an issue. The kids loved the kids club, but the first couple of days there were not very many kids. The staff was great and really tried to keep the kids entertained. My 8 year old daughter made a good friend and they were inseparable after the first day. The food was very good, but as others have mentioned the restaurant choices were limited because it is a smaller resort. Fine for 5 days, but if we strayed much longer I think we would have tired of the choices. The service was great. My daughter dropped her fork one time and the waiter SPRINTED over to pick it up and get her a new one. We went to lunch early one day and the restaurant was almost empty. Instead of having one server, with the others just hanging out because their tables were empty, we got two servers at once. All of the wait staff were great. I just saw a review from June 9th giving the resort a 1 star and complaining about the service-- which I think is insane. It is simply not possible that someone was there the same week as we were (or close to it) and had bad service, unless he/she is a complete a##hole--which I think is the more likely explanation. The downside is that the rooms do not have ocean view and restaurant and bar choices are limited. Service and rooms are excellent however, which go a long way.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved It--Top-Notch Service!\u201d", "Author": "travelpro1098", "ReviewID": "UR113482018", "Content": "I travelled with my husband, two grown daughters and their boyfriends for a 3-day getaway, and we were all very impressed! I am in the travel industry, and have travelled all over the world with my family. We have stayed in dozens of five-star (+) all-inclusives (an average of 3-4 per year), and the Azul Fives was definitely one of our favourite resorts. We have mainly stayed at large resorts, and much preferred the quieter vibe of the Azul Fives. The service was absolutely phenomenal---this might be because it was only 25 percent capacity, but regardless, it was great! The staff was extremely friendly and anticipated everything before we had to ask. I am shocked to read about others receiving poor service--have never received such friendly and professional service, anywhere. We stayed in a one and a two-bedroom suite which were lovely. The housekeeping was excellent, as was room service, and maintenance (daughter had problem with sliding door and they responded and repaired immediately). The spa facilities were top notch as well. We stayed for only 3 nights, but might have gotten tired of eating at two restaurants if we were staying for a week. The only two complaints I have are the wine (always horrible at all-inclusive, but I was expecting something decent as it is a \"gourment all-inclusive\") and we didn't have hot water one night (as we were leaving, I noticed them installing hot water tanks, so I believe they are addressiing this issue). For us, it was also the small things that made our stay so enjoyable: Comfortable pool loungers, no towel cards, no reservations required for restaurants, warm pool, sunscreen provided, and so on. It is difficult to find a resort that can accommodate many people in a suite---I recommend this for large families (a 2-bedroom can accommodate 6 or 8 people). My next vacation will definitely be at a Karisma resort---will try adults only the next time.

Having 24 hours room service was the best. In the morning we would order fresh juice and fruit for the kids until we were ready to for breakfast. They have a great health bar where we had smoothies everyday made with fresh ingredients. Not having to make reservations at the restaurants was great.. What ever we felt like having that night we had. If we wanted something different they made it for us... The rooms are amazing. Spacious, modern and very accommodating for young families. The Azulitos was truly a blessing.. it rained one afternoon and we took the children to the kids club. They have absolutely everything a child could imagine. A great Gym, Legos, videos games, arts and crafts, all types of toys for all different ages. At one point the kids simply didn't want to leave the kids club.

Steam room, sauna and jacuzzis to wind down before the massage and aromatherapy and peaceful music in the background. The food is awesome and apart from most of the all inclusive places, the food comes freshly served, except in the larger dining, it is display (which they still can serve you if preferred). For those who don't have patience, or big families to feed, and want lots of food choices, this may not be the place for you. I thoroughly enjoyed every meal and even room service was excellent quality. I've been to several resort where something looks good yet may be cold or stale from sitting too long. 5's all is made on demand and 5 star quality. Another highlight for me...my daughter had a blast in the kid's club (of course we had to accompany her being she is still young) as there are so many games and activities, she didn't want to leave!! She (and we) also had a tremendous time in the pools. They are big and are great for those looking to get excercise too with long rivers winding through the condos. We had a unit that faced the pool and enjoyed the large balcony spaces to sit and relax too. There are snack and swim up bars that are with in easy access throughout the resort. Of course there is no perfect resort stay and I have read a few previous posts stating some things we experienced too. For example,, the chandler clanging noises in the dining room because the A/C vent blowing on it is annoying. The staff were great and once we needed sheets for the pull out couch.

We at lunch at Sea olive twice and enjoyed the break from the sun as it was in the high 90F during our stay. The rest of or luches was easily located at lizards grill.

We loved the place, our one bedroom suite was fantastic, we have never been to a 5 star so we cant really say if 5 star for sure but we were treated like kings for the week we were there. The beach is a little rocky but the wind was up quite a bit so never ventured into the ocean, stayed by the pools all day. The resort was not full so some days we had our own section of pool and that made it much more relaxing for us. We loved having room service, so did our son, we did not drink them out of booze this trip, our son ate them out of food, that was the best part I think. I loved their coffee and there is nothing better than ordering coffee for 2 and having it brought to your room so you can sit our on your balcony and have coffee in the robes they provide for your use! The food was good, we ate all the restaurants, the only complaint is that there were 2 italian nights in the buffet and we had hoped for a different buffett each night as there is only so much you can order from at the ala cartes. It was also nice not to have to reserve in advance. There is a couple of things that bothered us while we were there, one was the doors, they slam quite freely, when we realized this we tried to shut our doors quietly but unfortunately not everyone there was that considerate, we would be almost asleep and the neighbours would come in and slam both doors so we got woke up a few times, the other is the security, there are rules to the pools 8:00 pm close, and am quite sure there are rules for quiet time, we had a couple of bad nights, our 3rd night there was a wedding so when the party started and continued on I just took a sleeping pill, I did not complain cause I thought it was a wedding and not a big deal. The next night the same group started up again and they were in the pool about 9:30 PM and hootin and hollering for an hour before I decided to call down as our son was not feeling well and could not get to sleep, I had hoped that security would quiet them down but it took them about 1.5 hours to finally quiet the place, I spoke with other families there and they said the same thing, I had to call down 3 times before it seemed to be taken care of. The 3rd night it started again, always around 9:30 but it seemed security was on it right away cause it quieted down right away. That may seem petty to some but we go to relax and the place was full of families with small children, so it would be common courtesy to realize that you are not the only people there, especially since they could have gone to the beautiful roof top bar by the beach and no one in the resort would have heard them! Other than that, we had a wonderful time, would highly recommend this place, the grounds are beautiful, the pools are great, the staff was fantastic, polite, fun, friendly, the drinks are great, (too great, lost a night after sitting at the pool bar for a couple of hours !) Any questions, feel free to contact me! We did Xcarat, it was cool, ate lunch watching the black jaguar pacing and sitting in the pool of water, that was great! We went to Playa del Carmen, dont like getting accosted all morning so went back to the resort, went again at nigth to see it lite up, beautiful at night and not so bothersome! We also hired a taxi for a day for 100.00 and he took us into Cancun to the shopping malls, markets, beaches, hotels zones, it was worth it, he was very friendly and informative, I have his number if anyone heading that way, we are going to call him next year when we return!", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Wedding\u201d", "Author": "AllyAdrianDowning", "ReviewID": "UR110780591", "Content": "We changed resorts from the Grand Riviera Princess to Azul Fives after the Princess had a gas explosion in Nov 2010.

I was VERY worried about visiting this hotel given the reviews. I spent the first 2 days going through all of the reviews I had read in my head and wondered what hotel people had stayed at. It's no where near as bad as they say so I'm guessing you can't please everyone. The hotel is great. It's not 5 star but it's great. The staff asked us every single day if everything was ok, if the food was ok, if the rooms were ok. They went out of their way to make sure we were happy. We traveled with friends who have two small children under the age of 3 and the hotel staff were wonderful with the kids. The restaurants all had high chairs and booster seats and all the staff were eager to keep the kids happy. They were even able to get baby food via room service and the kids club has babysitters for the night times (for a small fee) The grounds are fantastic and well maintained. The rooms: great, spacious and clean. Beds are comfortable. Only downside was that we booked a 3 bedroom suite thinking the living space was in the middle of the 3 rooms. Because this is actually a condo complex the suite was really 3 separate rooms with 3 separate entrances so it was a little awkard having the living space be in someone's bedroom. Nevertheless it was fine for what we needed and we had more than enough space for 4 adults and 2 kids. The food at the hotel is great. It's not out of this world but there's nothing wrong with it either. The staff are happy to get you whatever you want and went out of the their way to accomodate you if needed. Many times we were able to get 'take out' from some restaurants for the kids rather than just ordering room service which was a nice touch. There are 3 restaurants so if you are there for a long stay be sure to go into Playa for a few meals to get a change of menu. All 3 restaurants had great food and we enjoyed all of our meals. Not many Mexican items which is what I would change but there was enough variety to eat at all 3 for 7 days which was nice. The breakfast buffet is great - it even has sparkling wine and mixers for bloody marys etc. There's a separate smoothie bar attached to the gym which I thought was a great touch and much needed after a few days of over indulgence. The pool area and swim up bars were nice. Downside is that we were there during 'off season' which we weren't aware of so two of the swim up bars were closed. Not the biggest deal really as we were able to hang out by the infinity pool all day. The beach does have rocks close to the shore but if you swim past them it's fine. My tips for improvements for the hotel are thus: 1) Fix the showers. We had cold water ever day in our shower. The hot water seemed to last 20 seconds. It wasn't freezing but it wasnt' warm either. The friends we travelled with didn't have this problem in their room so perhaps it's not widespread BUT I have read other reviews that noted this. 3) Add more mexican food to your menus. We were in Mexico and wouldn't have known it by the menu options. The options you did have were delicious so add more!!! 4) Keep the pool bars open later than 6pm. They should close at sunset. 5) have better wine on the all inclusive package!

Watch out not to fall in the water when you get out of the cart in front of the convention facility. I bet a few folks have taken a spill there. At check-in we were given a glass of sparkling wine a splash of Curacao in the bottom to make it blue...\u201dazul\u201d. The sparkling was good, local, 11.5% alcohol called Dubois. It was also served at the buffet even for breakfast. Our picture was taken to identify us on the room key, a nice touch and a great little souvenir. The map of the resort was unfortunately a poor quality black and white print out, hard to read and not at all detailed. I asked for two so we could each have one but was told they had no more. Rooms Adequate with a rain shower but unfortunately none give out on the ocean which is separated by an ugly chain link fence with green plastic and foliage. We were driven to our room in an electric cart. Unfortunately the balcony was right in front of the playground to Azulitos, the children's play area. This room might have been more suitable for a family with small children. The sound of that basket ball pounding the ground and of the little ones screaming prompted us to request another room. There are double entry ways for added security. The second room was by the pool and more quiet with a nice rain shower but no tub. The safe didn't work but was quickly fixed when we called. There are no ice machines; ice is available through room service only. The bar is stocked with four beers, four soft drinks and four bottles of water, no snacks. The coffee pot has two more water bottles, some coffee and tea bags...these were full of stains so I didn't use them. One day, we were not given any water. I called for some four times and nobody delivered any. The next morning, I called again. The maid told me later that they had none until late that previous afternoon. They just didn\u2019t want to be bothered with delivering us any that evening. That was unacceptable to us. Food Many guests were on the European Plan (EP). We went on the all inclusive plan (AI). The food is very costly on the a la carte menu at Sea Olives, an excellent restaurant. I was a bit confused at first, when the waiter told me they took all major credit cards until we clarified that we were on the AI plan. A hamburger is 135 pesos at lunch. Tzukis is an Asian restaurant and rather mediocre. The green tea was undrinkable, the salmon overcooked, the tempura shrimp oily (old oil) the rice noodles tasteless and the vegetarian dish my friend had also totally tasteless. The sushi was good. We didn\u2019t care for the waiter here and his \u2026friendly banter. There is also an area where they serve barbecue by the tennis court at lunch, on certain days. This is worth it. I enjoyed the chorizo salchichon there as an appetizer. Right across from here there is a table where you can purchase a piece of ceramic and paint it. They make bracelets with your name and your choice of three colors of thread for $8USD. We went to the buffet for breakfast and once for dinner. One morning, there was a long line of folks outside the door waiting to be seated. The breakfast buffet had the usual array of boring dishes with the exception of some rot on the papaya. Empty dishes were not refilled promptly. The dinner buffet was mediocre. Some of the plants are neglected here. Service is more attentive but evidently, waiters provide more attentive service to those who are on the EP than to those who are on the AI due to the tipping practices. The hostess was so excited at breakfast one morning; she didn\u2019t watch where she was going and clobbered a woman and her plate full of fruit. If you want to have lunch but would like to avoid a two hour sit down meal, bring a sandwich from the breakfast buffet. There is no snack bar close to the beach. Sea Olives is it and it takes a while to get served here. We requested a cart to go to the snack bar and bring our food back to the pool with us. That is just not done here, I guess, because the waiter at the snack bar frowned at putting saran wrap on the salad and on the pizza. We were there for the beach and the sun and didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of time in a restaurant at lunch. This was one of two disappointments. The beach is beautiful and the peddlers no longer bother you since the police monitor the beach and impose heavy fines on those who sell without permits. The infinity pool is great and where we spent most of our time since the beach was very windy. There are no restrictions on the amount of towels you can have and they have a small library of books for you to borrow and free sunscreen. The other disappointment was that there are no iced coffee drinks available at the swim up bar at the infinity pool. My friend does not drink alcohol but enjoys hot or cold coffee all day. This was not available. The waiters at Breezes are extremely knowledgeable and very nice though. Another poor reflection on the place is some of the activities. One day, we waited for someone to give word that the water aerobics class was about to start but it never happened. I guess the staff preferred to go play volleyball on the beach. Incidentally, the volleyball game later turned into a soccer game where goals were set up close to those of us who were in lounge chairs; the ball was flying around us, into us and there was no motion from the staff to stop this. The next day, finally we were asked if we\u2019d partake in the water aerobics activity. Every single movement for the arms was completed out of the water. When the time came to work the legs, no movement was done while standing in the water. Instead, the teacher had us move over to the side of the pool, remove our upper body out of the pool and while lying on the stomach with the butt out of the water, and flap our feet. This was a poor excuse to see a row of women\u2019s butts lined up at that pool and that is when my friend and I slipped away from that class. There is a boutique with a few items with the Azul Fives logo. The cost is astronomical, however. A coffee mug is 170 pesos; an ashtray or a spoon holder for the kitchen cost 66 pesos. A Mr. Perez owns this boutique and the staff says that if anything comes up missing, the person on duty in the store has to pay for it. They sell food here since many of the rooms are actually suites with kitchens at this hotel\u2026bring your own mustard, their Dijon is 100 pesos.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LaSalle, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFeels like you're in paradise!\u201d", "Author": "AandG11", "ReviewID": "UR108145798", "Content": "We had the pleasure of staying at Azul Fives in the month of February.

The first day was great and the hotel seemed to be perfect. On the second day, however, I began to see the flaws. Something happened that today I find quite funny but messed up my hole day. I was stuck in the bathroom for 40 minutes. The old lock broke and crashed. It took a while for my girlfriend to call the customer service and even more for them to come get me out of the bathroom.

In fact, we came very close to cancelling as some of the reviews were so bad. We are glad we did not cancel and had a great stay at Azul Fives. I think one of the biggest problems this resort has is over-marketing themselves. Their website really promotes exceptional service and five star food. They try to promote themselves as a very high end resort and they fall short of this. It is a very good, solid family-oriented resort....but not a super premium five star resort. And...you are not paying super premium, five-star rates, so one should probably not have that expecation! We have previously stayed at the Fairmont Mayakoba down the road. By the end of the stay, my husband said he preferred the Fairmont as it was more professionally managed and service was more consistent. However, I probably preferred Azul Fives as for about the same approximate cost (estimating value of food), we had a suite at Azul Fives for about what we would pay for a single, garden view room at the Fairmont. Personally, I valued the space, but I agree with my husband that the Fairmont is much more professionally manged. Here's a summary of our experience: ROOM: We had a one-bedroom suite. The room was great for a family of four. The sofa sleeping accomodations were very good...they pulled out into two single beds which worked well for our kids. The room was also very large and nicely decorated. We were definitely comfortable in our room. We found it unnecesary to have a full kitchen & dining room as we were on the all-inclusive package. However, it did add space to the room. Most of the rooms have nice views of the pool. However, some of them look on to a dirt road. You do not want those rooms!!! We had one fo the very few rooms that had a partial ocean view. Our room looked at the tennis court and beach club. We would recommend that view. Overall, the rooms are one of the biggest selling points of the resort. POOL: The pools were very pretty. We preferred the infinity pool next to the beach as we liked looking out to the ocean. This pool was quite beautiful. We also enjoyed the other pools that meandered through the property. My kids liked swimming from pool bar to pool bar for smoothies. There were a lot of reviews about cold water in the pools. This was definitely not the case during our stay. I will NOT go in cold water and I found myself enjoying the pool temperature. We are early birds so we did not have a problem getting a chair directly on the pool edge which we wanted to keep an eye on our kids. However, these chairs usually filled up by about 10:00. Even when these poolside chairs filled, there were always other chairs in the second row or on the beach or at other pools that were available. So, there was no huge hassle over beach chairs. BEACH: As mentioned in many other reviews, the beach directly in front of the resort is not swimmable due to rocks. You could walk about 5 minutes down the beach to a beautiful sandy area to swim. This was a bit of a bummer as you would have to carry any sort of equipment down with you and then sit on the sand. It was fine for short swims, but it certainly would have been nicer to have a swimmable beach by your beach chairs and bar service! If you want to spend lots of time swimming in the ocean, do not stay here! FOOD: I would give the food 3 stars. We had some very good meals and some average ones. The breakfast buffet was fine, but nothing special. We went to the buffet only one night for dinner and found it to be disappointing. Our favorite restaurant was Tsuki. We loved several of the dishes there and our kids enjoyed the beef skewers and the chicken with noodles (our kids are age 7 and 9). We liked Sea Olive for lunch but did not like it for dinner. As such, we ate at Tsuki quite often at dinner which got a little old after a week. We were also very disappointed that there was no good Mexican food on the menu! One of the reasons we go to Mexico is to enjoy the food so this was very disappointing. I would revamp Sea Olive to make it a nice Mexican and seafood resaurant. We were also disappointed that you could not order food around the infinity pool. It would have been great to eat by the pool or order a snack or ice cream there. You had to walk to Lizards in the other pool area to do this. The only other all-inclusive we have stayed at is Club Med. Contrasting Azul Fives to Club Med, the quality of the food was better at Club Med. However Azul Fives had more flexibility around when you could eat and the decor and atmosphere of the restaurants was nicer. SERVICE: Service is just okay. It seemed staff was working really hard, but they don't seem to have staffing managed quite right and perhaps staff has not been trained as professionally as some of the large chains. However, they really did seem to be doing their best. At the pool, there was only one waitor working the pool area for drinks. We were there during Spring Break and it was crowded. He did his best to get around, but it could be slow. Tipping certainly helped! At the restaurants, we tended to get there on the early end. We found that we were always seated quickly and orders were taken quickly, however sometimes it seemed the kitchen got backlogged and it would take a long time for food to come out. We had 3 or 4 meals where the wait stretched to frustratingly slow. However, it was fine for most of our meals. Our minibar was never automatically restocked. I had to call every time I wanted it to be restocked. It would usually be done the same day. We never ordered room service. The menu is limited and we heard many complaints from other guests about slow service. GROUNDS AND FACILITIES: The resort is relatively small which we liked. The grounds were well kept and pretty. The beach club complex with the Sky Bar and two restaurants was very nice. It has a Miami vibe which is kind of fun. The lobby is a disappointment. It comes off more as a sales center for time shares vs. a lobby. (With that said, while we received a couple of \"invites\" for marketing pitches, we ignored them and never felt hounded). Having to pay for wifi is a rip-off! KIDS CLUB: There was a problem with English with the Kids Club staff. A couple of the staff members spoke English, but many of them seemed to have limited English. My kids participated in about one activity a day. They also had a couple of evening events that seemed like good ideas, but did not seem to get executed completely. For example they had a very cute beach movie night with smores. However, they set the movie on some odd option with commentary so the kids found it not worth watching. The staff seemed to try hard. I would say improving the English language skills and perhaps having activities for older kids would be great. My kids are only 7 and 9 and they found most of the activities to be too young for them. A separate note on pottery painting on the property. The guy that runs this concession does an amazing job with the pottery. I would totally recommend doing this as it makes great souvenirs for the kids. However, he tells you the paint is washable and it is NOT!!! Do not wear any clothes that you care about! GUESTS: Overall, this resort seemed to be full of families. There seemed to be quite a few groups of families travelling together, for example siblings getting together with their families for vacation. There were also a lot of wedding parties. I thought it had a nice vibe of families trying to spend time together. It was not a party resort (Sky bar tended to be empty) and it was not a resort where someone was hounding you to do an actvity every minute. It was a nice, family-oriented atmosphere. TRAVEL EXCURSIONS: We took trips to both Xel-Ha and Xplor. Both were fantastic and I highly recommend. We booked both through Lomas Travel in the lobby. I would NOT recommend using Lomas for these trips. Xplor is only 30 minutes away. We were the first stop that the bus stopped at. Eight guests from our hotel boarded our bus. Instead of taking this almost full bus to the park, they proceeded to stop at 3 more stops where they picked up parties of only 1 or 2 people. It ended up taking 1 1/2 hours on the bus to get to the park! We missed time at the park and our kids were totally frustrated. It is as easy and probably cheaper to just book a taxi to and from these resorts. Rates at both ends seem to be fixed and both parks had nicely organized taxi booking services where you could get in a certified taxi with a predetermined fixed rate. In the end, we had a really nice vacation and enjoyed the resort. If we were to return to the area, I would consider staying at Azul Fives again, but only after exploring other options. The primary thing I would look for in a different resort would be a better beach. I also would like better food quality and service. However, the value for what you get at Azul Fives is solid so it would remain a strong contender as a place we would consider returning to in the future.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Vacation Experience - Great Resort for Families\u201d", "Author": "TravelTrip555", "ReviewID": "UR107282970", "Content": "My family recently returned from a vacation at Azul Fives and it was incredible. We had a 2-bedroom suite and it was truly over the top --- full kitchen, dining area, master bedroom suite, living room area, and a full seperate room for our 3 kids (which they LOVED). This suite was absolutely huge and was more than enough room for our family. I had read some of the reviews prior to our trip and saw some comments on the slow restaurant service. We went over spring break and aside from a couple meals during peak times, we didn't experience slow service. In fact, the service was fabulous. The waiters were huge hits with our kids -- they made the kids special desserts that weren't even on the menu, and a few times even carried the kid's plates from the buffet to our table...they felt like royalty). The food was very good. My wife and I had wonderful meals at Sea Olive and the Asian restaurant (our kids were happy to hear they had macaroni and cheese, chicken nuggets, etc.). The buffet was a great option for breakfast and they changed the themes up each night. The chicken wrap was a favorite for lunch at the Sea Olive. At night, we attended two family-friendly evening shows - a magic show and a fire show. Both were hits. The Azulito kids club had some special events on Easter Sunday which our youngest participated in and had fun (face painting, playing with a bunny, etc.). The pools were uncrowded. The first couple of mornings we put towels out on chairs by the pool to \"save\" them for when we were ready to hit the pool....until we realized we didn't even need to do this. Our kids still miss being able to swim up to the pool bar and order a special frozen drink. The staff was friendly and very helpful (even upon arrival when they provide a ride to your room in a golf cart --- also a big hit with the kids).

First let me say i was very worried about this resort with all of the mixed reviews. i am very picky when it comes to resorts. We visit Sandals resorts quite frequently and wanted something along those lines of an all inclusive resort. Azul Fives delivers that type of resort. We have a wonderful time her and would defiantly go back !!! here is a lil information on the positives of this resort. I will say if you are looking for a party type resort this is not it, its a very chic classy family orientated relaxing resort ROOMS: we had a one bedroom suite, it was very spacious and very clean and modern. My children slept on the sofa bed and part of the sofa is like a single bed, they were comfortable. There is a separate 1/2 bath , toilet and sink for them to use which was convenient. FOOD: we did the Gourmet all inclusive, i feel it was well worth it, better than most all inclusive food. Flavors had an excellent breakfast selections, our favorite restaurant was Tsuki , its the sushi/Japanese restaurant, Excellent service and food!!!! Joel was always took care of our every need at dinner there. We also spent extra on the private dining at Senses, food and service was incredible here but its an extra charge but well worth it. Sea Olive was nice , my son didn't like anything on the menu here but the were very accommodating in making him whatever he wanted. This goes for all of the restaurants, Flavors have the most variety of food for kids, but the other restaurants will accommodate their needs even if its not on the menu. our favorite place for lunch was Lizards restaurant and pool bar. Great lunch food. DRINKS/BARs: the drinks were good, they will make you whatever you want at the swim up bars, i had a drink i like that made with fresh banana, they didn't have any but i did, so i brought them the banana gave them the recipe and i had my drink! I didn't find they were watered down either. BEACH: great sandy beach, water was beautiful, can't swim right in front of the resort, just walk down the beach a lil ways and you can enter with no rocks. this didn't bother us at all. It was very windy the entire time we were there so all water sports were canceled. BEACH STAFF: I have to say these guys at the beach made sure my son had something to do all the time, they went out of their way to make sure everyone was having a good time, they organized volleyball, soccer, all sort of thing to do on the beach. GAMA made my sons trip, he went out of his way to make sure he was having fun all the time. My son didn't want to leave and was sad the day we left. The beach butlers were very accommodating as well, Christian made sure we had everything we needed and even made spa reservations for me on day. The salsa lessons were alot of fun too RESORT GROUNDS/POOLS: Beautiful, the resort is laid out perfect. Winding pools through the middle of the resorts. Infinity pool view is amazing. NEGATIVES: this is a new resort and i feel they do have a few things to work out, and it would not take much to improve. Service desk after hours, they are slow at taking care of your needs, we need sheets for the pull out sofa, Suggestion, they should give you sheets when they take you to your room if they see you are going to be needing them, took over an hour to bring us sheets. There is a language issue, with housekeeping staff, and after hours front desk staff. The bathroom lighting was dark, they can improve this with higher wattage bulbs or lighted makeup mirrors. WiFi, i was able to get wifi on my iphone after i paid for the week, but only one person at a time could be on it. I think if you pay for it, you should be able to get it on all phones in your family. I was lucky that i had access to the wifi because i was close to Lizards thats where the router was located. Beach wifi was excellent, but i think they were upgrading this while we were there. Overall we loved this resort and can't understand why some of the negative reviews are so bad. I met our standards and i have to say i feel i have very high standards to meet when staying at a resort.

Generally the drinks were a little pricey but not over the top. The private beach was nice but rocky meaning you couldn't really swim. The rooms didn't have a wifi available (although there was a wifi showing, we believe this is for timeshare owners only), and the wired connection was not free (not even in the lobby area) and useless for our iPhones anyway. Another point to consider is that when paying for things such as drinks and food, prices were in Pesos and USD but when we settled our bill at the end of the week we had to pay in USD (we only had Pesos and the hotel's exchange rate wasn't very good which meant we paid slightly more than we should have done).

We loved the omelet's, mexican side dishes like refried beans, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, fresh fruit, pastries and make your own Bloody Mary's! We enjoyed the pool by the beach and spent the afternoons at the lazy pool swimming to the bars for an array of delicious drinks. The beach was nice and never too crowded. My son enjoyed the volleyball and soccer. The ocean was too rough to swim in so we walked down the beach to see the other resorts. We are more pool people so we were happy to swim in the different pools. The staff at the beach and pool were very helpful with bringing drinks and answering questions.

There's always plus and minuses at any resort, so I think the simplest way to review this one is to list the pros & cons: Pros: - Very modern and beautiful rooms - close proximity to Playa del Carmen (10 minute cab ride) - you don't have to make reservations to any of the A La Carte restaurants - Food was good (I would not consider it \"gourmet\" but it was on par with other resorts I've been to) Cons: - The resort is very SMALL... I wasn't expecting how small it really was.. so as long as you're not expecting nice walk paths and lots of lush greenery/gardens, then this might be to your liking. - There is no lobby to speak of, so no communal space where a group can gather to relax and unwind... there is the Sky Bar but there was almost never anyone there and only open at night. - The buffet is tiny also - not a lot of food choices... - Service across the resort was very inconsistent: sometimes there would be a waiter around the pool/beach area to take drink orders, then other days you wouldn't see him at all... some people had their mini-fridges filled everyday, some didn't have it filled once the entire week, even after leaving a big tip! - The beach: like all previous reviews, it is true, you can't swim in front of this resort.. you need to walk 2 resorts down in order to go in the ocean... not a huge deal, but a little disappointing. Overall, this place was originally built to be a condo-village before being bought by Karisma and turned into a resort... It really wasn't built to be a resort and it shows.. they certainly have a lot of kinks to work out and are far from being a 5* \"gourmet\" resort, in my opinion. Since we were a big group, we made our own fun and still had a great week, being in the sun and doing some excursions outside the resort. But I would never return to this place and don't think a week's stay here is worth the top dollar that we paid.

We were a family of 6 including two kids(3 and 6). We absolutely loved every aspect of the resort. The room, one word: Perfect! The two bedroom suite we lived in is as big as my entire house back home. It's very well decorated, modern and elegant. It really felt like home. I've never been so relaxed in a hotel room. The food is good. My two kids are EXTREMELY picky eaters, they never loved any restaurant, but they loved the food here. That meant a lot to me. I never had to worry about feeding the kids during our vacation, they always finish their plate quickly. Their coffee is worth mentioning. It's the BEST coffee I ever tasted. The side effect is: I can never drink coffee again. The coffee back home tastes horrible in comparison. The beach and the swimming pools are beautiful. The ocean is not swimmable because of the reef, but I didn't mind because the infinite pool is so great I never wanted to come out of it. And the best thing is, the beach is never crowded. You'd never be stressed over grabbing a good beach chair. Everybody is warm and friendly. The hot water in my room was not very hot when I arrived. I called the front desk, someone came and replaced the hot water tank right away. I was impressed. I never had any other problem since. The nightly show was so so though. Wasn't crazy about it. The only thing I concerned was the security at the kids club. I once picked up my kids from the kids club, nobody asked my to sign out or anything, no question asked.

Everyone at the hotel was VERY welcoming and really aiming to please you during your stay. Once I got to my room, it was beautiful. Everything was clean, well decorated and up to date. I stayed in a room with 2 double beds and there was plenty of space. I've traveled a lot and I can honestly say that this is the best all inclusive hotel i've ever seen. Usually all inclusive hotels get a bad reputation for not being very up to date or nice, but this hotel experience totally changed my mind. Walking around the hotel grounds were beautiful because they are nicely spaced out with tons of trees and greenery around. In the morning, people were relaxing on the balcony, sipping coffee and everything was quiet and peaceful which is the point of vacationing!! Of course my friends and I had to do a little spa day and it was a wonderful experience for all of us. I've had several massages and this wasn't your typical massage. They have you change into robes, offer you time to meditate in a calming room with warm neck beads and once you are relaxed for about 15 minutes, you are taken into the massage room which is a large, zen-like room with a shower if you choose to shower before or after the massage. After the massage, you are given hot tea, time to relax in the meditation room and brought to the sauna, steam room and hot and cold baths. The spa itself is very big and very well decorated. Our experience at the Vassa Spa was sensational!! As for the food, we ate at Flavours for lunch and dinner and the food is delicious. The breakfast display included everything from belgium waffles, bagels, mimosas, bacon and omlettes made to order. My favorite restaurant for lunch was Sea Olive, mostly because its a beautiful place to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air in the shade. The food was absolutely fantastic...my friends and i ended up ordering tons of things for everyone to share so we could really taste everything!! The pasta, steak, salad were all incredible...the flavors really made your mouth water! The beach was pretty, but im not crazy about swimming in the ocean so i didnt go in the water, but the beach beds were a great place to take a nap in the sun. I really came back and had great things to say abou this property.

Lets start with the bads (its easier on this one, there are only a couple) The buffet, completely overshadowed by how great the a la cartes are - not good at all. The Beach of course is amazing, but if you are looking for somewhere where you can just run out and swim, this isn't it. Its corral and rock, but there are some great spots if you are willing to walk a little bit down the beach. Thats it thats all for the cons - Lets start at the beginning, the concierge, check in, welcome etc amazing from the first walk through the door. I can't even begin to describe how well were treated. Nora looked after us in a huge way. She put us in by far the best spot in the resort, and we could not have asked for anything more. Checked in, went and had a beer and an awesome lunch, they came and picked us up and brought us to our room, perfect. Pool bar - lizard was a ton of fun if you are looking for a late day fiesta thats the spot to do it, if you are looking for sun. The main pool is great but the pool bar is shady later in the day. Lizard food was exceptional, the chicken panini fantastic and all of the guys there are so great, I can't say enough. The service is way over the top. Breakfast, order a la carte or grab a fresh smoothie from the juice bar next to the gym, they make them fresh and they are a must (especially after a long night/day/night ...whatever you get the drift) Tequila tasting was fun they do it a couple of times a week The sushi restaurant was suprisingly good, we go out for sush a lot, and they do a really great job. The Sea Olive...hmmmmmm... (I'm missing the Bocancini and Pruchutto, grilled shrimp ok pretty much everything) already going through withdrawl. Oh by the way that was lunch, I would be remiss in not mentioning the Lamb, Tenderloin or the Chik Chik (dont no how to say it, but its the spicy fish) for dinner. Or pretty much order whatever you like, they will get it done. again the service, outstanding all of the guys there especially Santiago, and Hugo - look after you like gold. The wine - good, passable - I drink red and the Tempranillo was a pretty good table wine. Room service awesome just tell them what you want, they will get it done. Whoever trained/trains the staff should be commended, ever single employee knew exactly what was going on in the entire resort at any given time. Pretty amazing, I'm going to fire off an email to them (yes they were that good) what more can I say, you get the idea. wifi is free gym is good, it gets it done playa del carm is a must - hit the tequila factory if you are looking to purchase some awesome tequila, I ended up with Casa De Oro and a Manana for 100- everything in. its a steal, that Casa is a 400 dollar bottle on its own if you could ever find it, its like cognac had it a while ago and was never able to get it again, but there you go. one thing, if you are looking to hang, drink and get down until all hours. unfortunately this is not the place. Go to the El Dorado or one of the other Karisma and definitely go for the adult only thing. This one worked for us, because we wanted to completely decompress and have some quiet time. 98% of the people here are with weddings and/or children (nothing wrong with that) and I hung with some pretty cool people when there kids were looked after etc. But you get the idea - all and all I would return in a heartbeat if I were ever looking for this type of holiday again.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cDONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME\u201d", "Author": "STEVEN_BALA", "ReviewID": "UR104249716", "Content": "These issues have all been discussed with and acknowledged by hotel management. -No hot water in suite, due to the fact that a tank has to be replaced which obviously cannot be done during our stay.

We had to pay an employee to purchase liquor for us. Incidentally, we asked for a certain brand of alcohol that we know well, they brought us something totally different under the pretense that it was the requested liquor. -no mini bar/alcohol in room as advertised -prior to our arrival, we were reassured that the bedrooms in the 2 bedroom penthouse suite would be comparable to each other. As a matter of fact, we called several times just to make sure. When we arrived, we saw that was not true. We were told that the 2 beds in the 2nd bedroom would be able to be put together as one (as if it was one bed with no space between it). In reality, they just pushed the 2 beds together, with separate linens with a big space between it. It took 3 nights before the bed was put together in an acceptable way.

Overall, I think the strong negative reviews are ill-founded. Our experience was that our stay was terrific. There are some items that were minor issues, but overall, AZUL fives is a resort I definitely would recommend to others. Some specific points: 1. Accommodations. (Excellent) The rooms (suites) were large, clean, well-furnished and very well maintained (e.g. sheets were changed every day even though we really didn\u2019t feel that was necessary). The refrigerator was stocked with soda, beer and water- and they always very responsive anytime we asked for extras. 2. Food/ restaurants. (Very Good) There are 4 restaurants on site and we ate at 3 of them. The buffet had average selections and the food was what one typically expects at an open buffet. Buffet is very kid friendly and service was excellent. The other 2 restaurants had specialty foods (Asian and Mediterranean) and that food was excellent. The foods were well prepared, tasty and well presented. You are able to order anything on the menu and even ask for multiple items on the menu. There is an added wine list where you can order specialty wines at additional cost. Wines on the list are quite average and a bit pricey for this type of environment. Breakfast buffet was excellent (for a buffet) and had most anything one would want for breakfast. My primary suggestion for this to be a 5 star resort would be to significantly upgrade the buffet to stock with prime selections (specialty fish, meats, hors d\u2019oeuvres, etc.). The buffet is OK but not a 5 star buffet. , 3. Service: (Excellent) both of our groups felt the overall service3 was excellent. We did not encounter any of the issues reported on some of the earlier reviews from March, 2011. Meal servers were always prompt, courteous, and responsive to all requests. Bar tenders were always very accommodating and friendly and there absolutely no issues with slowness or unfriendly staff. The overall service was excellent. 4. Bars: (Excellent) there are multiple swim-up bars and there was never a wait for any drinks. Most bars were stocked with excellent brands and bartenders were happy to serve requested specialty brands (Chevis (scotch), Beefeater or Tanqueray (Gins), Jack Daniels (bourbon), Baileys Irish Cream, Kettle One or Stolie (Vodkas), Specialty Tequila etc.). They sky bar is a wonderful relaxing spot, but was rarely busy- so we often had the entire place to ourselves. This is probably due to the fact that most guests had children and the late night bar was not the place for them. 5. Entertainment; (Fair) There was entertainments each evening (mostly in the sky bar) and these shows were fun (mostly for both adults and young adults). It would have been fun to have some more \u2018Mexican\u2019 type of entertainment such as a Mariachi group or Mexican dancers. Sporting and adult activities were also quite good (such as water aerobics, tennis, and the spa). 6. Beaches; (Very good) Here some of the complaints may be well founded in that the beach area which is part of the resort is quite rocky and full of coral. The sandy beaches were excellent and were very well furnished with beach chairs and towels. For those who wanted to swim and enjoy the surf, you had to walk about 5 minutes up the beach (or down) to areas that were rock free. We did not see this as a big issue, but some guests may not like this. 7. Equipment/ facilities: (Excellent). In some other resorts, there is always contention for beach chairs, lounges, towels, etc.; but at Azul Fives, there are tons of equipment (chairs, etc.) and plenty of towels are always available at every pool. None of us ever had to search for adequate numbers of beach chairs or pool-side chairs. 8. Kids activities; (very good) Staff was very attentive to the kids and there were activities that interested most of the youngsters (such as small crafts, and games). This is a very family friendly resort and there is added attention given to the young guests- they feel part of the fun.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWould Return in a Heartbeat!\u201d", "Author": "jettsfamily", "ReviewID": "UR103406913", "Content": "We absolutely loved Azul Fives for so many reasons: Resort--We LOVED how spread out and quiet the place is. If we wanted action and activities to do, we went to the beach/infinity pool and restaurant area. If we wanted to be left alone and have quiet time, we stayed by the pool which was always near our room because of the lazy river. Some may lament that there are no beachfront views (unless you have a penthouse deck facing the ocean) but we liked that fact that we could be away from the action when we wanted to be. The grounds are so beautiful, I didn't miss the ocean view. Our favorite spot was in the pool near the Rainbow swim up bar. It was always quiet and relaxing. Santiago was amazingly friendly, helpful and we enjoyed his company. We were there from March 22-29, which was a very busy time because of Spring Break. The hotel was at 100% capacity but you would never have known it. I chose Azul Fives because I wanted a five-star resort for my husband and I with things for our kids to do. I couldn't have chosen better. The hotel is often quiet and relaxing because the guests are often families with young children. We never were kept awake by noisy guests and loud parties. Rooms--As many other reviews have stated, the rooms are spacious, clean and beautiful. I loved the fancy lighting in the living room, but like other guests, I hope they can solve the issue of lighting in the bathroom. I had no idea how tanned I was until we hit the airport! :) Some reviews have stated that the beds are overly firm (which I was worried about because I love a soft bed) but I found they were just fine. We didn't make use of the kitchenette since the restaurants were so good. Our housekeeping service was kind and accommodating, and went so far as to make animal shapes out of towels. Our kids loved it! Food--The food was excellent in every restaurant and we were always amazed at the quality of the food that came out of the Lizard's Lounge. My boys are in \"Angus Burger\" withdrawal! We loved the gourmet dishes and the waiters and hostess ladies were always really friendly and personable. Ivan, Pamela, Erika, Irma and the two waiters at the Lizard's Lounge were amazing! We found that the Sea Olive and Tsuki restaurants were busiest around 7:30, so if you want to ensure you get a table at Tsuki or a table outside at Sea Olive, try to go around 6:30 or 9 pm. Just a note that sunscreen and aloe lotion were expensive in the resort store but it can be bought in Playa del Carmen for half the price. We were pleased at the selection at the store since it meant we didn't have to leave the resort for things if we didn't want to. I think any gliches this resort may have had in the beginning from just opening in Nov. have well been ironed out. I wouldn't mind to see next time if they could let people know more about the things they offer (like I didn't know about the smoothie bar near the spa), especially the events for kids. The Spa is really superb. I thought $70 for a 25 min. massage was expensive but it was well worth it. I went an hour early and went through the \"Water Journey\" and then was given tea in a quiet room after. The whole thing took almost 2 hours. My only regret is not going back for a 50 min. massage. I want to book another week at Azul next year based on that fact alone. Trips: We went on the Mayan Aventure which was snorkling at three sites: a cenote, an underground cave and the ocean. It was nice--I liked it because I'm a bit afraid of water and I mostly felt safe. My husband felt it was a little bland. Head's up on the photos they take of you and sell to you--$15 for the first photo, $25 for the second, $30 for the third or $40 to buy the whole CD. Overall, Azul Fives is an excellent resort. I was worried about choosing one for my family, since we sought a quiet family vacation, but the resort was more than I had hoped for. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone and I hope to go back next year.

The Azul Fives is a brand new resort and it was growing on us every day. The longer we stayed the more we liked it. One FORTE is the amount of personal service and attention we got from almost entire staff. It was exceptional. Enrico the general manager, Alberto Food and Beverage manager, Federico the Chef, Vanessa manager at main lobby and all the wonderful people from Exotic Travellers: Murray, Marleen, Emiliano and Elizabeth as well as many others, contributed to our happiest vacation ever. We have never before experienced the quality and amount of personal attention like at Azul Fives and we have very significant travel portfolio in our background, so we can clearly compare and conclude that. Amazing!! The resort buildings and rooms are absolutely first class providing the comfort that would be difficult to match by any other resorts. The resort layout provides opportunity to isolate yourself with alone or small groups or be at the heart of it at the main infinity pool. Jorge would take care of your refined needs from the pool bar. It was the first in many years family resort for us and we actually enjoyed being part of that experience. The little ones playing and horsing around provided so much fun and joy to watch. It seems that resort is very well equipped to look after all ages. The beach is beautiful as the whole stretch of PLAYA DEL CARMEN is. There are challenges on that beach all along and you can easily swim in some places and you can't in others. That 's the beauty of Mayan Riviera and the rocky inserts on the beach makes it really majestic. Some of the rocks are so beautiful that we ended up sitting on the shore watching small fish, crabs and other small creatures playing in the tune of the waves splashing into the rocky mini caves and pools. It was a pure paradise like observation and very tranquil. Really there is more to the beach than sand and swim as long as you are interested in finding it. The food was good and got even better by days. Something about it was interesting that we did not have tendencies to overeat like in other resorts, so we were always feeling right. Perhaps the presentation, gourmet selection and the a la carte service contributed to the just right amount consumed. The variety and number of places serving food was more than sufficient. The barbeque stand with Latin music playing was our favourite lunch place. Shows were very good and just right in length and presentation time. The Mayan show was the highlight as were the many Latin theme shows. Not much more to wish for except maybe for more Latin rhythms at the main pool. Go there, be positive and enjoy the resort. Every resort has challenges but they are usually solved quickly and they certainly contribute to your travel experience.

It was our first trip to Mexico and we had a very good experience with both the Azul Fives, and with the activities available in the Rivera Maya. Prior to the trip, I spent a lot of time on Trip Advisor and appreciated the reviews which were posted, so I want to add my perspective and hope it helps others plan their trips to the area. The Hotel The Azul Fives is one of the newest properties in the area, and the facilities were excellent. We stayed in a two room suite with a roof deck. The pictures on the web site do a good job of describing the accommodations - they are clean, modern, and very attractive. In addition, the restaurant locations were very well designed and beautifully appointed - the facilities are a great strength of the hotel. The hotel is comprised of a number of identical three story buildings, with a long winding pool weaving between the buildings. As a result,guests have access to a pool right by their room, in addition to the larger pool located near the beach. This is very helpful for families with younger children who want to stay closer to their rooms and are looking for less activity than takes place at the beach. Some reviewers have commented on the pool temperature, but we found the pools to be just fine and spent many hours in the water. There are three \"swim up bars\" spread out across the winding pool near the buildings, and many guests seem to enjoy the access to the friendly staff ready to serve a cold beverage. The buildings are set back from the beach, so there are no real ocean views from the rooms. The walk to the beach from the rooms varies by location, but is no more than 5 minutes from any of the buildings. At the beach, there is a larger \"infinity edge\" pool that looks out on the ocean and also includes a swim up bar. This area is more active and high energy, and hotel staff organizes activities like beach volleyball, soccer, and dancing. This was all done in a fun and lighthearted manner and did not take away from guests who just wanted to enjoy the sun. The Staff One of the highlights of the trip was the very pleasant and professional staff at the hotel. We were very impressed by the desire of the staff to help us enjoy our stay. This was our first trip to Mexico, and we came away thoroughly impressed with the friendliness of the many people we met both inside and outside the hotel - it is a real benefit to travel in this region. I can honestly say that our interactions with everyone we met at the Azul Fives was a pleasure and enhanced our trip. The Restaurants We particpated in the Gourmet All Inclusive program and thought the food was good, not great and there was some uneven service levels. There are three main restaurants, complemented by smaller \"cafe\" styles options near the guest rooms. Flavours is the main breakfast area, and the breakfast options were terrriifc - custom omelettes, fresh waffles, pancakes, fruit juices, and some mexican specialties all in a beautiful setting that felt like a high-end restaurant.. Our family was excited for breakfast every morning. Sea Olives is more of a Meditarranean style restaurant, and we only ate their one time. We found the food to be average and service was a little slow. We did enjoy Tsuki's, which offers Japanese/Asian food and was quite good. The restaurant is small so it fills up on busier nights. It is worth noting that every restaurant offers a kids menu, and the staff does their best to accommodate requests to help younger guests enjoy their meals. We always felt welcome as a family in all of the venues. Special note regarding the smoothie bar - connected to the gym/spa is a place that makes fresh fruit smoothies which are fantastic. You can get drinks made with mixes at the bars, but this venue offers the real deal and they are terrific. Kids Club/Azulitos The property has a very nice kids club staffed by some terrific ladies who are friendly and energetic. Most families with young kids seemed to have their kids there for some portion of the day. Activities include Lego, video games (always an attraction), water games at one of the pools, and some crafts. The ladies in the center were always positive and happy to welcome another visitor, and our kids looked forward to spending some time there each day. Spa/Gym Very nice facility with a couple of treadmills, ellipticals, weights and stretching. Clean, modern, nice. Spa was expensive, but services were very good and they have options focused on kids. Beachfront As other reviews have cited, you cannot swim directly in front of the hotel because there are rocks/coral in the water. However, a walk of a few minutes up the beach gets you to a sandy bottom where you can play in the waves. The water is warm, clean, and beautiful. We spent some time in the water every day. Lots of beach chairs and cabanas for those who want to hang out closer to the water. Attractions: Playa Del Carmen - bustling town 15 minutes away worth a trip for shopping and dining Tulum - must see Mayan ruins on the coast XCaret - an \"eco park\" that is somewhat like \"animal kingdom\" and has a great show in the evening that is worth seeing Akumal - terrific snorkeling in a protected bay Dolphinaris - swim with dolphins - beautiful new facility and a great experience Best of luck in planning your trip", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonner Springs, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Short Vacation!!!

But for three days I had not a care in the world. Reception; we were greeted by a very pleasant front lobby staff. She processed our arrival quickly, answered our questions and sent us on our way with Champaign on a golf cart to our room that included a tour of the facility. A very nice touch, it took the \"were the hell is the food\" out of our vocabularies. The one issue with reception was our room was supposed to have been a two room suite, ( I was traveling with my sixteen year old daughter who needs hours of mirror time) the room we got was a one room with two double beds. I ask about this when we received our keys. I was told that is what the travel agency booked for us, and after comparing documents she was correct. So, the resort did exactly was what asked of them. Why do I tell you this? They said if the resort would not have been full, Azul would have placed us in the room we thought we had. ( A review of the travel company will be coming shortly.) Our First Meal. After dropping our bags off at the room, we took a short walk to the Palmas pool bar. We were met by Jose, who is your server at that bar. We became close to Jose throughout our stay. He made our trip fun from the word go. Every time he saw us he would shake my hand and ask how we were doing. Now if you go here give Jose a shout out. The Room; The room was clean and comfortable. Tile floors throughout. A large sliding glass door to the patio which was large too. The entry to the rooms are through a locked door into a small vestibule then you use your card again to enter your room. Ours was 811-2. I felt safe for me and my daughter at all times. The Food; The restaurants were all very good. The menu at the dining locations other than the buffet were the same everyday we were there. The Buffet changed every night. An example is, one night might be american night, the next seafood night so on and so forth.. But, it was all very well prepared, fresh, hot, tasty. I spoke with Frenado the executive chef on afternoon as he was overseeing the evening meals. He explained the detail he expects from his staff, in the restaurants as well as the pool cafe's. His expectations are very high, and the quality of the food shows. The Beach; I had read a few reviews of the beach. It was a little rocky along the edges of the property.

It was an absolute dream vacation. We arrived around 2 pm and the friendly, attentive staff looked after our luggage while we were transported in golf carts to our private group check-in. It was quite a remarkable experience. We were provided warm towels to clean our hands, followed by a glass of champagne. The hotel staff gave us a group briefing about upcoming meetings and pertinent information to get us settled in. We were also offered complimentary massages at the check-in. This private group check-in was quick, easy and a wonderful way to begin our experience at the Azul Fives. The food at the Azul Fives was one of the first things we discovered and it was delicious. The Tsuki restaurant, Japanese cuisine, was a hit among our group. We also really enjoyed the variety at the Sea Olive restaurant. Every day, the chefs prepared a delicious lunchtime barbeque buffet with burgers, hot dogs, Spanish rice, tortillas and guacamole, and salads. We found the size of the resort perfect for vacationing with a large group. Everyone had privacy, yet the small size allowed for us to easily meet up during the day or in the evening. The grounds and facilities were immaculate. I was amazed by the friendliness of all hotel staff; they were always smiling and greeting you. The wedding services at the Azul Fives were exceptional. We met with the wedding coordinators on Monday prior to our wedding on Thursday. Estefania and Brenda, the Azul Fives wedding coordinators, and Elena, of Lomas Travel, offered professional and friendly services. Estefania and Elena offered their expertise to customize and perfect the details of our wedding. Every detail was done to perfection. Our wedding package included a group dinner. However, since we were purchasing the private barbeque buffet dinner on the beach for our group, we were able to use the group dinner the night before our wedding. The staff and wedding coordinators really personalized this dinner for us. We were thrilled with the set-up in Flavours restaurant. We had our own private room; each table setting had our group dinner menu printed specially with the bride and groom\u2019s names and the date. It was a nice touch and definitely a keepsake. The dinner and service were outstanding. I had a relaxing and memorable wedding day. Estefania and Brenda were available to assist me throughout the day. The ceremony on the beach was beautiful, just like a dream wedding. I cannot say enough about the beautiful beach reception set-up that was prepared by Elena, Estefania, Brenda and the hotel staff. Our guests raved about the barbeque buffet dinner. Again, the service was exceptional. We ended the day dancing on the beach under a full moon. It was the most perfect wedding day. We also had a group brunch included in our wedding package, which was held at Flavours the day after our wedding. The chef had prepared a few special items in the buffet for the occasion. Again, it was delicious. The Azul Fives was outstanding in all areas, food, facilities, accommodations, entertainment and service.

It is a very pretty, immaculate resort with a nice infinity pool near the beach. It has a nice tennis court and offer golf cart rides to different parts of the resort (its not too big so we walked and never rode except when we arrived with our luggage. We were not sure what to think initially as the admitting procedure was choppy and we did not get the family suite that we were told we would have; instead we had two separate hotel-style rooms next to eachother. We also were tired from getting up at 3 am to get there so NOT getting what we expected seemed worse than it probably was. Our rooms were nice and clean but there is a damp smell that doesn't go away. We vacationed at the Azul Sensatori las spring and really liked it because we were all inclusive and did not have to worry about tipping. This is NOT the way it is at the FIVES. The first day we were there, we ate at the Sea Olive. The waiter stopped us to ask for a tip after we finished our lunch. My husband said \"we are on the all-inclusive plan and thought tipping was already included.\" The waiter said that it was still somewhat expected that we tip. Of course we did tip but checked up front to make sure we didn't misunderstand. The lady at the fron desk told us that we did not have to tip unless we received outstanding service and WANTED to tip. HMMMM....needless to say, the employees work so hard and we appreciated it but we ended up spending several hundred dollars more on tips than what we had planned. They also offer the a-la-carte plan (European) so you have to be sure to be ready to prove you are on the all-iclusive by bringing your ID card along. We didn't like this part because at other all inclusive resorts, we didn't have to bring our wallets, etc. along. Here we did have to bring ID and money and it was a pain at times! The food was very good; we loved the pool side restaurant \"the LIZARD\". My 67 year old parents came with us, also and enjoyed the food, walking on the beach and the pool areas. We did not get into the entertainment too much but it seemed good. Most of the time we walked on the beach, etc. The beach outside the hotel was very rocky but walk north a ways to the PRINCESS for inexpensive beach massages, good waves, a cool sand bar that you can go out quite a ways on, jet ski rentals, etc. We loved that area and snorkeled around a bit and saw a few fish. Our oldest daughter loved the volleyball on the beach and met some teen friends there. The gourmet food was good but in all honesty, we loved the hamburgers, guacamole, and smoothies as well as anything.

We stayed in a 2-bedroom suite and that was the perfect accommodation for my family - two teenage daughters in one room and my 8 year old son, along with my husband and me, in the giant suite overlooking the winding pools. There are no ocean view rooms but as it turned out, that wasn't a drawback because the grounds were beautiful. There was a lovely deck where we would sip wine and play games in the evenings before dinner. The house wine was decent, too (it came from a bottle!), especially compared to what we have experienced in the past. After fighting a growing trend of obnoxious high school seniors and college students the past few years, it was such a relief to find a relaxing resort where there was plenty of action for the entire family but it never felt crowded or rowdy. All of the service people were very friendly and helpful - and surprisingly quick to respond to our requests. I was very relieved to feel safe there with my family, too. The restaurants were very nice and had some great offerings, including a children's menu. The Asian restaurant Tsuki was our favorite. The breakfast buffet was great and even offered a bloody mary bar and mimosas.One additional restaurant would have been nice for variety. The two food-rlated recommendations I would make would be to have coffee accessible in the early mornings without going into the Flavours dining room. We ended up ordering room service every morning which was okay but some days we would have preferred to get it ourselves if it was easily available. The other would be to have ice cream available to the kids in the afternoon without having to sit down to order in one of the formal dining areas. We didn't get to much of the evening entertainment but my teenage daughters went to most of the shows - they were typical of what you's expect - a little cheesy but still kind of fun. They took place in the Zky club which had nice ambiance.There was a great kids club, Azulitos, where my son would go each day to play Wii or Xbox to get out of the son for a little bit. When he wasn't there, he'd play volleyball or soccer on the beach with the other children. You could also check out boogie boards or snorkeling gear. The pool staff was great. We always bring a bunch of $1 bills for tips because they work hard to keep your glasses full. The beach right in front is beautiful but a little rocky. But you can walk down the beach a few minutes where it is clear and sandy. We walked for miles each day up and down the shore. Azul Fives is perfect proximity to Playa del Carmen. We took a $12 cab ride (about 10 minutes) into town twice for souvenir shopping and dinner. There was a nice workout room for those that want to exercise. There is also a tennis court. As with any resort, particularly in Mexico, some things are a little quirky. They operate a little differently there. For example, we extended our trip an extra day and it took no less than 10 phone calls and a dozen people to figure out how to settle our billing and room keys. Our departure shuttle arrived an our early after clearly establishing our pick up time with the concierge. Little things, not deal breakers.

I was a little apprehensive after reading the negative reviews, and I must admit that when we entered the lobby at 4 a.m. we were a little underwhelmed....there is no wow factor that I usually associate with 5 star properties. Secondly, on check-in they make you pose for a group photo and give you an ID card....I just wanted to go to sleep and requested that this procedure wait. We had booked 3 deluxe rooms, but upgraded to the one bedroom suite the following morning (highly recommended if you can afford it). Speak to Vanessa at the front desk and she will help. Also got late checkout for the 1Bdrm suite for free, plus free wi-fi internet for a week. The open concept washroom was very inconvenient with 4 children hanging around. Need to build for some better privacy, and we adults never used the tub. But was fabulous to bathe 4 excited children at the same time. Word of advice - there is no ATM on site and neither do they let you draw against your credit card, so carry some extra cash. The nearest ATM is an OXXO which a \"slow 15 min\" walk from the hotel. The food is very good, but there are exceptions. Flavours and Tsuki were good at all times. Whereas, Sea Olives dinner menu was dismal, ended up ordering room service.

We were greeted at the front desk by a man that had no idea how to communicate in English to direct us to where we could go to grab lunch while we waited for our room to be ready. He obviously was not well trained. 2. We ate at multiple restaurants that sometimes took 2 hours with a small child just to be served lunch. Also at quite a few meals one of our dishes would come out and the rest of the tables food came a long time after. 3. Experienced a blackout in our room and nobody could explain to us what happened. 4. Maid service was inconsistent. When we called for things like water and extra towels we sometimes had to call 5times to get it! 5. We paid for the all-inclusive meal plan and the room service menu had a VERY limited menu 6.

At that time of night they should never enter someones room. 7. We were upset the first two days with a lot of this stuff and went to the front desk to speak to the hotel Manager and instead they told us to fill out a comment card and that the manager was in a meeting and would contact us as soon as he was out. We waited and waited and NEVER heard from him! We went back to the front desk the day before we left and they told us to fill out another comment card And we Sid we already had and we asked what ever happened with the manager contacting us.....and the man told us he could try and have him contact us before we leave but he was in Miami so he couldn't promise anything. That to me was outrageously POOR customer service. 8. Forty dollars was stolen from my husband. 9. Pools were cold 10. No direct access into the ocean....you need to walk down another beach to get in. 11. We had a couples massage at the spa that was supposed to be a daily special/promotion and the hotel charged us the day the service occured and then added on more charges at the end of the trip to account for the exchange rate. We should have been charged the rate on the day the service occurred. We spoke to a woman or manager of the front desk \"Vanessa\" and she lied to us about the extra charge and when we looked at all the math she had pulled a fast one on us and actually charged us more than we were promised.

All other resorts we've been able to get free upgrades or paid a nominal amount if the resort wasn't completely full. We had to pay about $500 USD to upgrade to the 1 bedroom. The bedroom is spacious, modern and clean however it has one large king bed and a uncomfortable pull out couch for the kids. In terms of privacy, it has a somewhat transparent shoji screen type doors. Therefore if you want private adult time the one bedroom will not give you this. The lighting is definately low especially near the vanity area. They have a retractable makeup mirror but you can hardly see anything due to the poor lighting. There is NO ocean view. The hotel is well set back. The main pool and two restaurants face the ocean. I don't think this is mentioned on their website or I missed it. I was a little perplexed as to the 5 star rating and not having an ocean view. I was told this resort was originally intended to be condos but there wasn't enough sales therefore converted to a condo/resort. There is nowhere to hang clothes to dry. We just put our wet swimming suits on the balcony chairs to dry. Our clothes always felt damp in our room for some reason. The air conditioning was on but it still felt clammy inside. The chandelier about the dining table makes this weird rustling noise all night long from the airconditioning unit and often times my husband and I have woken up thinking someone had broken into our room. Lastly, the cleaning is not has meticulous as other resorts we've visited. The beds were made the the bathroom cleaned but there the coffee and dining table was rarily touched. One night we arrived in our room at 6:00pm to find it hadn't been cleaned at all. They started cleaning it at 7pm after we complained. BEACH: Small sandy area before you enter the water. It is very rocky. We didn't really mind. We stayed in the pool area most of the time. I agree with other reviewers, the service and energy level near the main pool was lacking. Most resorts around the main pool there is ample entertainment and constant service staff to bring drinks and food. The sea olive restaurant will not let you take food out to the pool area and there is no other outdoor food options around the main pool. There is a bar for drinks though. We never had any problems with getting chaise lounge however we went when the resorts was relatively quiet. FOOD/RESTAURANTS: Food was decent. Sea Olive during lunch is a tad slow, they ran out of certain items on the menu often. The TSUKI restaurant was good. The service at the restaurants were good and they accomodated special orders. We did get tired of the resort food and went to Playa Del Carmen a few days to get authentic mexican food. I would have preferred wrist bands to identify that we had the all inclusive. I found carrying a card all the time for food and drinks was cumbersome, especially when you are at the swim up bar and are asked for your card. SPA: The spa was excellent. The prices are quite high however they do have specials. I took advantage of the special twice. They had a $117 USD for 50 minute massage and 30 minute facial. Included is access to the spa facility which had a great wet and dry sauna. They also have a hot jacuzzi and cold jacuzzi. The attendant stays with you and offers you towels, drinks and snacks. The massage was excellent. Overall, the experience was fantastic. I would highly recommend this. TENNIS: We took advantage of the tennis lesson offered at 8am every morning except Sunday. Pedro was excellent. This really made our vacation. Pedro was very accomodating and let our son play with us most days when it wasn't busy. Often there was only 3 of us in the group. You can get private lessons for $45/.hr. ENTERTAINMENT: We caught a few shows however as others have mentioned on tripadvisor the shows start at 9:30pm. If you have small children it's hard to get to. I think they should have it at 8:30pm since most families eat early. KIDS CLUB: For young children under 8 they are good but for older children 9-12 not suitable. There are alot of rooms locked during the day and evening which limits the activities. OVERALL: I thought the resort was good but not great. We think they need to work out the kinks in terms of consistency and service. Internet access was not free. They charge you $70 USD for the week or $14USD daily rate. The business centre has internet access on a minute or hourly basis. There is no general indoor lounging area. This would be nice when it rains. Your only option is to wait out the storm in your room. The last comment I will leave is for people who are on the all inclusive plan. Please leave a tip for good service. We generally leave a few bucks for breakfast , lunch, room service and housekeeping and $5 to $10 for dinner.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "menzelm78", "ReviewID": "UR99595915", "Content": "Great stay at Azul Fives.....I think the best thing about this resort is the employees that work here.

We were there during the last week of February when the weather was nearly perfect every day. Even though the hotel was supposedly sold out, it never felt crowded, probably due to the fact that this is a hotel+condo resort. ROOM: The 1-bedroom suite was clean, nicely furnished, and comfortable. We like hard beds so that wasn't a problem for us compared to other reviewers. We appreciated being off the ground (1st floor) so that our curious daughter wasn't able to go wandering off to the pool. We also liked having balconies overlooking the pool. FOOD: When we go to Mexico, we go to eat Mexican food. We went to Sea Olive for dinner on our first night since it was already dark and we were surprised to find that there were no Mexican options. No ceviche, no tacos. Flavours Restaurant had an international theme night and I think the theme was \"American.\" !! I would have been very unhappy to pay for the \"Gourmet Inclusive\" package and be stuck eating what we would eat at home. We rented a car so we ventured out to Playa del Carmen every day and ate very well (La Pesca, La Cueva del Chango, Asaderia de Pollo, La Bamba de Jarocha, Origenes to mention a few) . We walked over to Coco's Cabanas down the beach a couple of times which was fun too. ACTIVITIES: We had a couple of tennis lessons with Pedro and that was fantastic! He's a super guy who gave us solid tips and drills to improve the game. We had a decent yoga class and a terrible salsa lesson. The salsa instructors didn't really want to be there and just went through the motions. Since we were the only ones there, they gave us about 15 minutes of lessons. Why bother even putting this on the social calendar? In fact, if there is a wedding on, they cancel the lesson. So after showing up two days in a row to find that the class was cancelled, we were more than disappointed on our third attempt to get 15 minutes of heartless, halfass salsa lesson. SERVICE: The room service people were very nice. They gave us 4 bottles of water every day (although we bought our own water/juice/soft drinks/cerveza to supplement what they gave us.) I left my wedding ring in the room a couple of times with no problems (I didn't take the diamond ring with me on the trip) . In fact, one day we returned to the room while they were cleaning and one of the cleaners told us that our safe was left open. Everything was in place. RESORT: We enjoyed the pools. The shallow areas were great for my daughter. Because we read how cold the pools were, we took a little shorty wetsuit for my daughter so she was very comfortable. I didn't find the pool to be that cold myself. We didn't get a chance to swim in the ocean. We're scuba divers so we took a little snorkel mask for our daughter along with all our gear but I guess 2 years of age is a bit too young...! and we thought the waves would have been a little too much for her to handle. We also really wanted to see the monkeys that other reviewers talked about but we never got to see them. But our daughter came home talking about the iguanas sunning themselves. KID'S CLUB was nice but they told us that we have to pay $30/day usage fee since we're not doing the all-inclusive. On top of that, there's the $15/hour for a babysitter at the club. When I called the hotel before the trip, they told me it was $10/hour at the kid's club ($15/hr in the room) and they mentioned nothing of the $30/day. $60 for two hours of adult time is quite different from the $20 that we expected to pay...but when we paid for the two hours, they only charged $30 for the babysitting, my guess is due to inefficiency rather than wanting to comp us for it. OVERALL: I 'd go back in a heartbeat, especially now that we know where to go for good food and how to structure our days better for everyone's enjoyment.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cVacation of a Lifetime\u201d", "Author": "dramz3", "ReviewID": "UR99175354", "Content": "We just returned from a wonderful 6 night vacation at Azul Fives. We traveled with our 2 year old and two other couples with toddlers. We have traveled to many all inclusives in the past (Sandels, couples, el cid) and this was by far the best family friendly all inclusive we have ever been to....this was the first Karisma resort we have stayed at. There are some negative reviews on Trip advisor and I have to say, I was a bit nervous the week before we left, but our experience left us wanting to return ASAP. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which was amazing! I would definitely suggest the upgrade. The room is huge and beautifully appointed with modern furniture. I wasn't bothered at all by the lighting as some other reviewers mentioned. The separate shower and tub were very nice. We had a large deck, but no view to brag about. We spent minimal time in our room, so the lack of a nice view wasn't a bother. Housekeeping did a wonderful job everyday! We used the safe for our valuables, which we always do when traveling, and we had no problems at all. I always felt perfectly safe at the resort. We didn't venture out of the resort, but the other couples we traveled with did go into Playa del Carmen and loved it. The property is beautiful, just stunning! There is a bit of walking required, but it was nice to get the excersize. The beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen....there is coral out in front of the resort, but all you have to do is walk 5 min down the beach to enter the water. Really no big deal! The pools are a bit on the cool side, but really just felt refreshing- definitely didn't keep any of us out of the pool because it was too cold, however, it would be nice if they were a little warmer. The swinging beach beds are awesome! You do have to reserve them, so think ahead when you arrive. The service is amazing! We met so many nice people that work at this resort and really take pride in making your experience special: From the waiters to the smoothie maker to the beach butlers. Of course there are always exceptions, but by and large we encountered excellent service. Two occasions we waited an excessive amount of time to receive our food at Sea Olive....so we opted to do the buffet for dinner to avoid long wait times with the kids...the fajita station was delicous! The food overall was excellent! We liked Tsuki the best and probably Sea Olive the least. Flavors is great for b-fast and Lizards was handy for snacks. The drinks are so good! If you think the drinks are weak, just ask for a double and that should take care of you just perfect. We also ordered a fair amount of room service and it was tasty and speedy...often arrived much sooner than quoted. The room service waiters were so nice and often times room service would call after it was delivered to make sure everything was right. The most impressive aspect of this resort is the family friendly amenities. The staff and resort as a whole goes out of thier way to ensure that families enjoy thier vacation. The kids club is so cute and even has toddler size toilets! Tons of fun toys and activities to keep the kids happy. Probably the only disappointment during the whole trip was the lack of access to the \"My Gym\" facilities. They have this beautiful room with tons of tumbling equipment, but it is locked all day except for one hour in the morning for specific age group classes...we only had access to it once during our stay. It is such a wonderful space, that it is a shame that they don't allow more access to it. The yoga class was amazing! The teacher was really well trained. ..so fun! I also did the tennis classes every morning- Pedro was great! Night time entertainment was a little on the cheesy side, but the kids liked it. The only downside is that the night shows don't start till 9:30pm, which was too late for our little ones most nights. The gym facilities are perfectly appointed. None of us did any spa treatments, although I really wished I would have! I felt the prices too high, otherwise I would have been ther in a second. We did bring one dollar bills to tip, but we never felt obligated to do so. Although when we did encounter excellent service (which was often), we rewarded for it and the staff was very appreciative. All in all, a wonderful trip- go with an open and positive mindset and you will be pleased.

On the positive side the suite was spacious and comfortable. We liked the idea of having a kitchen but it wasn't very well appointed, lacking essentials such as a corkscrew. When we requested one from room service they said they didn't think they had any and it never showed up. I had to borrow one from the bar staff. The mini bar wasn't stocked unless several complaints were made, by our last day we were running out of water. Even if the mini bar was stocked it only had poor quality beer. The hotel grounds are lovely and we liked the layout of the pools. There was never any difficulty finding chaises by the pool or beach. Our terrace faced directly on a pool so it was equivalent to a swim-up room. Now for the downside. We were told that the resort was at 98% occupancy, and I believe this was a first for this new resort and it showed. Service in the restaurants was often slow. Special requests were usually not met. Breakfast at Flavours ( a buffet) is good but dinner isn't very good. The food at Sea olive and Tsuki is much better but inconsistent and overcooked. Lizards is a good choice for lunch. Only one bar remains open after six pm and it gets very crowded making getting a drink difficult. Now for the worst part, we had a theft from the room. We left the resort for the day and on our return we found that my son's I pod touch and expensive ear buds had been stolen. I know he should have put it in the safe but he hadn't left it out in the open meaning someone rifled through his backpack .Security investigated and they determined that the only people who had keyed in and out of the room were housekeeping and mini bar staff but nothing was resolved during our stay. My son has a form of autism and this upset him greatly making the last two days of our stay very miserable.Thank god for...

We had 1 king size bed in our side of the suite with a roof top hot tub, bed, couch and lots of sitting room. The other side of our suite held 2 queen size beds for our children to sleep on as well as their own washroom. The beach was really nice but you definitely notice the coral as you start navigating the ocean.

Let me start by saying that I am one of those people who are extremely picky about hotels. Whereas it takes most people a couple of days to decide on a resort, I will take weeks and read every review out there. I travel down south (Mexico, Cuba or Dominican Republic) once a year and have been to perhaps 10 different resorts. I search for resorts that are luxurious but at a good value (I refuse to pay more than 1600-1700$CAD for a week). I will say that I did have some reservations about the hotel after reading some of the reviews, but all of my worries flew away the moment I arrived at the resort. First of all, the place is absolutely GORGEOUS. The decor is outstanding, and we were treated so well when we first arrived to the hotel. Eduardo, our bellman was so sweet and helpful making sure we felt comfortable when we arrived in the room. If you can afford it, I really recommend taking the one bedroom suite; when I travel, I usually go for the most economical room, but I paid about 13$ extra per person, per day and i found it to be really worthwhile. The bed was really comfortable, and the room was always really clean. The only thing that is a bit confusing all the light switches! There are so many them, and even on the last day, we still didnt fully comprehend which ones opened which! The first time we arrived at the pool and beach area, our mouths dropped. The place is stunningly beautiful and I absolutely loved the infinity pool. Chris (Rock) and his brother Alfonso are the pool butlers and they are absolutely amazing. They really go out of their way to make you comfortable, putting your towels down for you, and asking if you need anything. At the pool, they have towels, sunscreen, magazines, cool face towels, all you might need. Also, I wasnt aware of this before leaving but they have approximately 8 day beds on the beach. You have to reserve them ahead of time, so speak with the butlers a day or two ahead. The man who delivers the drinks at the pool was also incredible, passing by often (unfortunately his name escapes me at the moment). One thing I will mention is that I would characterize Azul Fives as almost like an upscale family resort. My friend and I are in our mid-20s and prefer quieter resorts for rest + relaxation. There were not many people our own age, besides a few couples. This did not bother us. Most people at the resort are either traveling with their spouse, or with their spouse and young children. I did not see many kids over the age of 4 (this is a good sign considering we went during the school year). There were alot of babies around one or two years old. Would I have known this before coming, I still would have gone to the resort however, for others it might be something to consider. I really dont know how anyone can fault the service at this hotel. Its obvious that the management puts a very high emphasis on providing top-notch service and the employees do. Everywhere. The nicest thing on top of it, is that during a conversation with one of the waiters, they told us that are also treated really well which makes it easy for them to do a good job. This was really nice to hear. At all the restaurants, the service was wonderful. I cannot remember everyones name, but Gregorio and Joel were two that really stood out. At the Tsukis, all the waiters were really nice. Although the waiters always passed by and were really attentive, one issue we had was how slowly the food was served at the two pool side restaurants. Dont get me wrong, I dont want them compromising the quality for lighting fast service, but it often took 20-30 minutes to receive our meals, even simple things. Also, one night we went to Tsukis (where the food is amazing) but the restaurant was full and we were told to return. We did return an hour later and had to wait so long, that we decided to leave. However, Joel and a couple of other servers were kind enough to run after us and bring us to the Mediterranean restaurant right next door, and tried really hard to please us and make up for it. In terms of activities and excursions, all we did was travel to the town, and play tennis. I have an important note to write about traveling to Playa - REMEMBER that it should cost 12$ US to get there, not a penny more. Our driver tried to convince us that it was 15$ and we ended up paying it. Dont make our mistake. Tennis: Pedro who worked at the tennis court may have been the highlight of our trip. He is so kind, and such a good teacher. A private lesson is alittle steep (45$) but at 8am every morning there are free group classes. When I went one morning, there was only one other person, so its more like a semi-private class. Be sure to bring tennis shoes, its slippery. But honestly, this guy deserves a raise. The entertainment staff is also amazing - so thank you Alex, Gam, Hilarios and others were making our week special! Another thing is: the sun is extremely strong, so wear lots of sunscreen and apply often. My friend got an extremely bad sunburn. But, another testament to the service - one of the managers found out, went to the store to buy her cream and tried to locate us at the resort to give it to us. Thank you Mr. Nunez!! Now the spa: we both went for a 1 hour massage. It was a really great experience, but extremeeeellly expensive. They had a promotion so we got 80 minutes for around 130$ (CAN). My massage wasnt the best, but my friend really liked hers. However, they make the whole experience wonderful so we were actually there for like 3 hours. You have access to the spa area (with waterfall pools - but the hot one was actually cold) and saunas. They bring you to a room before and after your massage were they put heating pads on your back while you drink tea in a tranquil environment. Its terms of the WHOLE experience, it was the nicest spa ive ever been to. Ok - last thing: the front desk service was generally good, but I hate to say this it could have been a bit better. I dont want to get anyone fired, but here were some of the things that happened at the front desk: - I had a question about TV channels, and whether they had ABC, and the guy told me to \"go to the pool area and ask the guy with shorts on.\" Normally, I would think they would find out for the guest. - The day before we were leaving, we went to the front desk and asked what time our bus would be coming to pick us up the next morning. Our flight was at about 11am so we figured someone would come at around 8am or so. The person said that they didnt know and that we should contact our travel company. I mentioned that normally there are binders with the information left in the lobby and the person said there wasnt. We got really nervous and figured we should be at the lobby at 7am to make sure we wouldnt miss our bus. We were talking with other guests and found out that there ARE binders at the front desk with the information in it. Thank goodness we found this out, because the bus passed really early. I also asked this person to schedule a wake up call for the next morning at 6am, but it never happened. We were lucky that we had a back up alarm. Overall, I would really recommend this hotel! Please feel free to contact me with any questions! And a big THANK YOU to everyone at the hotel for an amazing trip!!! Side note of things that I recommend could be changed to improve the service: -i really appreciate that this hotel has tried to be at least slightly \"environmentally friendly.\" it mentions in the room that if we want our towels changed, to put them on the floor. However, as much as I tried to save our towels for a couple of days by placing them back on the rack, they were always changed. Most people probably appreciate this, but its really not necessary. Also, I have never been to a resort that recycles but I really encourage the management to start putting designated areas in the room for water bottles. I would always leave my recyclables in a corner but I am sure they got tossed in the can. The waste that goes on in these places is really unbelievable and the Azul Fives could really be setting a precedent. -i know most people dont travel to watch tv, but most of the american channels were missing (ABC, FOX, NBC). the reception wasnt great either. -Bathroom lighting could be improved slightly (using higher wattage lightbulbs), like other reviews remarked it was alittle challenging to apply makeup -time of delivering food in the restaurants", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust perfect\u201d", "Author": "Bits5", "ReviewID": "UR98148534", "Content": "Wonderful family vacation.

We rented a one bedroom suite and then a double room for my dad, which was essentially attached. After quite some time in negotiating with the front desk why I didn't like the first room (keys didn't work 3 different times in same day, water heater and building elevator were broken), they finally agreed to move us. BTW - no one at the resort with the exception of the managers can make a decision...everything had to wait until I could talk to a manager, so if they are busy or not there, you sit and wait. The room they moved us to was on the ground floor, with a \"view\". I would recommend anyone with young kids to request a ground floor. The \"view\" was rather odd - essentially when you stepped out to the patio, you were directly staring across the walkway into the kitchen of a pool bar, Lizzards (grill, computers, stacks of plates, food, etc.) as opposed to one of the resort pools, but it was better than the first room they gave us, so I shut up. Other pool kitchens were enclosed, so I am not sure why this one wasn't. The main things I would have liked to know about this place before I booked that I didn't know at that time are as follows; Rooms. The one bdrm suite isn't as ideal as I thought it would be with small kids. We wanted a suite as opposed to a regular hotel room, which is why we came to this property in the first place. The intention was that the adults would be able to stay up later than the kids (8:00), but the suite only has one bed in the bedroom - no other options (like 2 queen or double beds), only one king size bed. The other \"bed\" is a sleeper sofa - which is obviously where folks would put the kids, but it is smack in the middle of the living room. So essentially, the whole point of getting a suite was lost. The room is big, very modernly decorated, the furniture isn't very comfortable - stiff \"pleather\" like material on the couch as well as benches and chairs at dining table. The lighting in the bathroom is terrible. We had other issues (no cable connecting the tv to the cable, no batteries in the ceiling fan remote, circuit breaker to hot water tank hadn't been turned on, called concierge multiple times about seeing if there was anything that the toddlers could stand on to reach the sink to wash hands, brush teeth, etc, but never received a returned call, etc.), but I really don't think anyone had ever stayed in these rooms before - so after a few days I just chalked it up to new property \"stuff\"). Several other people we met had 2 or 3 bdrm suites and were happy with the accommodations, but if you get a roof top deck with a hot tub, just know there is no way to actually be able to fill it with hot water. Beach - the other reviews talk about \"rocks\" or \"stones\". All I can say is that the beach has significant boulders and coral in the ocean making it un-swimable directly in front of the resort. You can't really even go in up to your waste without navigating the coral. Most people walked down to the Princess or the Sandals resorts to swim in front of their properties (about a 10 minute walk either direction). Kind of a bummer when you have little kids. Kids club - they ladies there are great although their are only a few that can speak more than a few sentences of English. A few items to note...the My Gym equipment can only be used at certain class times each day (one hour each day usually in the am), and there is a fee for My Gym. No where did I ever read this, even in the room brochure it doesn't say this - but the fee is $10/hour/kid. There is also a 24 or 48 hour notice and addtl. fee if you want them to watch an infant. I am not sure of the exact details on this, but another mom was telling me this was news to her that she had to give notice AND pay a fee as well. They do a really nice job of trying to do different activities and definitely a plus when it rains. Pools. They are not heated. When I read this fact in other reviews I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but believe me, it is COLD! Most people at the resort won't even go in above their waist b/c it is freezing. We had a few days of rain and cooler temps, which really effected the water. If it is sunny every day, it helps, but a definite shock. There are \"lagoon\" pools throughout the property which are nice (also not heated). If you have little ones that need to nap, ask for a ground floor room along one of the pools, then you can sit in the sun or swim while they are sleeping. The music at the pool bars is just awful. We asked to change it or at least turn it off, but yet again, they had to ask a manager, this is a very unusual request, this is the CD that we play at all our properties, etc. It sounds like a dying whale - the wait staff are ready to blow their heads off - they really need to do something about it. Restaurants. While we got bored with the food (only 3 main restaurants on the property), part of that was b/c we were there for 10 days. The other item to note is that the kitchens are sooooo slow. My kids didn't want to go back to the Olives restaurant b/c every time it was at least a 2 hour event - regardless of lunch or dinner. The \"manager\" of the Japanese restaurant Pablo was really rude and unhelpful - I won't go into details, but he really has an attitude and isn't very helpful - he was more concerned abut how he wanted to run the restaurant as opposed to making sure the guests were happy - an unusual attitude at this property. Most of the wait staff very much wanted to make your dining experience wonderful, but they are at the mercy of the kitchen - some meals the food would be uncooked in the middle, other nights the \"molten\" chocolate dessert was cold as ice, salads would be delivered 60 minutes after ordering, etc. I think they just need to work through some of the new resort issues and this will improve in time. Also, while there is room service, the menu has all of 5 or 6 items on it - we got it one night and it was terrible, so not really a decent option if you just want to relax. Bars. There are plenty of pool bars to enjoy during the day (all close by 6) - but the one thing we really missed was there is no lobby bar or anything like that to congregate at. There is a \"nightclub\" that opens at 6, but it never had anyone in it before dinner and if you went there after dinner, there were green strobe lights playing, and again, nothing really happening until their nightly shows - which started at 9:30 or 10....so we were disappointed there was no family activities for the early evening or anything before 9:30 at all. This was a really big void for us and many of the other guests there as well. There were some very special people that went out of their way to make our stay a pleasure - they were Elenka at the pool...my son adores her....Alex at the pool...Alfonso the pool butler and Marcheleno at the Lizzards bar...they all gave excellent service and should be rewarded for it. Sol and Alena (sp?) at the restaurants did their best too to make us happy. All in all, it was a nice resort, pretty, modern property (not typical Mexican feeling property), but probably best served to those looking for a quiet vacation.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cReally Struggling\u201d", "Author": "Sonny_Mos", "ReviewID": "UR97738261", "Content": "We booked to stay at Azul Fives based on the 1bdrm set up due to our 2 young kids, 2yrs & 3yrs.

This seemed to be missing from the reviews and photos. When we checked in, we were told they were overbooked and could only accommodate us in a standard room for 4 nights, then 3 in the room we booked. They offered some additional compensation but it was resort credits (all inclusive package + resort credits = who cares) . As it turns out, another couple from Canada were also downgraded on the same day. A few days later I overheard another family checking in and given the same story, overbooked. The 1+ bedroom configuration is why people book and they are clearly overbooking the resort. Because of this approach, I can not recommend staying here and will not be going back either. For us, this downgrade really added needless frustration and cramped space to a much needed vacation. Stay away unless you are happy with a down grade. On a final note, there's is so much potential for this place. I would say in our experience, almost all past reviews are fairly accurate.

I think the two things that stand out the most are 1) excellent customer service and 2) a beautiful resort yet very family friendly. There are 3 restaurants, one is buffet, one mediterranean and one sushi/asian. Plus two or there small outside restaurants. The restaurants had great food and felt like dining in a fine dining establishment AS well as being very kid friendly - they are attentive to parents and children, have food for all, have boosters and highchairs and kid toys at all the restaurants. The service in the restaurants was fantastic. Fernando at breakfast was a very kind and helpful man! This allowed my husband and I to enjoy the food and ambiance a bit more as dining with two children can be a bit hectic. The rooms are nice, very stylish and clean. It would be better if they were designed a bit more kid/family friendly, i.e. better places for kids to sleep. We were in a one bedroom, my husband and I slept in the \"bedroom\" and our kids in the living room just behind a sliding door from us. So when one person woke we all did. Otherwise this room was definitely big enough for us and we enjoyed it. The pools are nice, some with gradual entry so great for kids to sit and play in shallow water. They are not heated but we didn't' think they were too cold. The beach is nice, it is rocky/coral right infront of the resort so if you want to swim and play in the ocean you have to walk about 5 min. to a sandy spot. No big deal for us. The kids club is really nice - clean with nice toys, it rained one full day we were there so this was a great resource. We also popped in various times throughout our stay, you can play inside or at a small park outside or a small kids pool. All the resources for families was great for us (strollers, highchairs, crib). My husband and I did a couples massage at the spa - it was fantastic as well. A beautiful spa and again great service. Although they do not tell you until after that they add a 10% service charge to the services at the spa. Drinks are bountiful so you can always have a pina colada in hand but it is not a huge party resort. All in all we had a great time and hope to go back!

Before leaving on this trip, and after reading all of the glowing reviews, I was pretty confident that I was going to a top-notch resort. Boy was I mislead! This resort is completely awful on more levels than I can mention: a) the food is awful, b) the beach is awful, c) the hotel lay-out is awful, d) the service is awful, and e) the pool is awful. The awful service is what killed it for me. When I go to an all-inclusive resort I expect excellent food and drinks. The food, in particular, was horrible, and anytime we'd go to one of the restaurants something that should take 10 minutes would take an hour - it would be at least a 3 hour ordeal for any meal. For such a \"highly rated\", \"exclusive\", resort this is unacceptable. And I must note, this wasn't just an issue for my boyfriend in me... I was there for a wedding, and EVERYONE experienced crappy service, food, and drinks. In April I stayed at a MUCH cheaper all-inclusive resort in Mexico... it blew this resort away. The only good thing going for Azul Fives are the rooms, which are very nice, however, I'm only sleeping there... so who cares?! In general, Azul Fives has a nice website with nice photos... but trust me, in reality, this place is not that sweet. My advice is to stay at an all-inclusive that doesn't have condo owners and requires everyone to have the all-inclusive package.

The resort didn't disappoint - very large and well appointed rooms. We were surprised to find an entire apartment to ourselves complete with kitchen, dining room and living room. The entire resort is extremely clean and well maintained. Being a smaller boutique resort, you don't find the crazed mobs of people with their itineraries that are often found at family resorts, so it was generally quiet and relaxing for a couple traveling without kids. The food was good, not mind blowing by any means. I'm not a food snob but I think the food is overpriced and not on par with many U.S. chains, let alone gourmet resorts. Weather in February was a gamble and we ended up with 2 days of rain and clouds. I would plan for late Feb or March next time. Luckily there are still some things to do in Playa and Cancun on a rainy day. Unfortunately this resort didn't have much to do when the weather was poor so most guests stayed inside their rooms. Finally, we enjoyed the beach due to the many tide pools and beautiful view. We did have to take a short walk on the beach to another resort to swim in the ocean due to all the rocks and broken shells right along Azul's beach. You can walk openly between resort beaches as there are no barricades, so we just walked 4 or 5 resorts down to find a nice open area. Service was excellent in most cases, although slow in some cases, which didn't bother us since we had nowhere to be and wanted to unwind. Although I live in the States, I am originally from South Africa and not fluent in Spanish, and this did present a bit of a challenge as the staff mostly speak very broken English. This shouldn't be a deterrent for anyone, just something to keep in mind when prepping to go. I've been to other resorts in Playa and did not encounter this large of a language barrier.

Looked nice in pics and good location about a five min drive to town. When we arrived i was pleased at the welcome, glass of champagne and beyond the most gracious welcome i have ever recieved in any hotel. We had a small miscommunication about our room category, but that was Instantly resolved with not even a minute of stress. The one-bedroom condo was FANTASTIC so beautiful, spotless (im a neat freak) and comfortable beyond expectations! The service by all staff is flawless, friendly, helpful. Now i would like to dispell some myths i have read about the hotel, first and most important, the restaruants in the hotel are your BEST best in playa! We had dinner twice and lunch twice in playa del carmen, downtown found the food sub par at best and ridiculously over priced!!! Not to mention the waiters in town have a very nasty habit of adding thier own gratuity usually 20 to 40 dollars extra for the service for one watered down margarita and cold seafood. The Azul Fives restaruants are very beautifully appointed, very comfortable and the food and drinks are half the price of town restaurants!!! The six meals we ate thier were simply , fresh delicious food! The beach in front of the hotel is typical of most beaches in the area,,,swimming directly in front is tricky ( short coral abundant there) but a very short walk will take you directly to ocean access. The swimming pools at the hotel are from a dream, endless, warm, swim up bars abundant and very unpopulated in front of the rooms, which was perfect for nite time quite swims. The main pool by the beach is a little more popular with great music, bar very handy and staff that will address every whim. Now if you think this hotel might be too far to playa del carmen to suit your needs ( we did rent a car) we found the hotel so perfectly catered our needs that we only went to town a couple of nites...you can take a quick taxi for cheap and not worry about driving.

Pools & Pool Bars - There were 3 pools here; two that were winding throughout the villas and one that was an infinity pool facing the carribean sea. They were always clean and rarely busy! We've seen alot of people complain that they were cold, and yes, they were cool but it was nice and refreshing when you are sitting in such heat. Pool bars were awesome too. The bartenders were so fun and had so many fun suggestions for drinks, shots, etc. Restaurants - There were 4 restaraunts: - Tsuki - amazing sushi - Sea Olive - loved it here, wide variety of food on menu - Flavours - buffet & menu available, breakfast was only available here (very yummy) - Senses - this restaurant isnt included in all inclusive packages. Here you have your meal in a cabana surrounded by water and candelit. This was our FAVOURITE meal on the whole trip, the food was unreal. Rooms - we were in the one bedroom suite with a king size bed, livingroom, kitchen, dinig area etc. The room was awesome. We only used the kitchen (fridge) to put our wedding cake in but it was nice to have the kitchen island to sit at and eat, etc. The deluxe suites are alot great smaller but really nice too. Room Service - The room service menu was great, and once you know what food you can order at some of the restaurants around the pool, you can order that via room service too. The food was fast and fresh. They always called a few hours later too asking how to food and service was which was really nice too! Wedding - Our wedding couldnt have been more perfect.

The resort was only about 20 minutes from the airport, which was nice after a long day of travelling. When we arrived at the resort they had us checked in quickly and offered us refreshing champaign and wet towels. Our luggage was brought to our rooms immediately and we were shown where everything was located on the grounds and how to use everything in our room (,air, TV, phone , safe). Check in couldn't have been any better. We had a great central location in Villa #14. We were on the ground floor which was nice cause our patio was only steps from the pool. The only complaint about our room is that the beds were too HARD!!! There was a bit of a walk from the villas to the beach, but it was kind of a nice stroll, after a great meal! It just sucked when you needed something from your room, but no big deal! ...I just sent my husband! LOL! The grounds and pools were kept very clean. There were a few areas between buildings and such that got a bit wet and muddy from water run offs, but it was really not a big deal! The pools were on the cool side, but again not a big deal, when it's hot outside it is a welcomed refresher. All of the restaurants were great, the food was AMAZING! Everything that we ate was excellent, and there was a nice variety. The hotel also offered 24 hour room service, which was great for late night snacks or for having breakfast on our poolside patio. The Sea Olive was our favourite place to eat...The Risotto, Greek Salad and Pork Tenterloin were always big hits! My Husband hasn't stopped talking about the Tomato Rissoto! The house wine, both red and white were great! Not to mention all the great cocktails and shooters (mmmm....lemon drops!) we had all week! Although the beach was not the best I've seen, the staff at the beach hut were fantastic and there was always lots to do! My husband actually got PADI certified through the hotel it cost $400 and included 4 dives. They were very accomodating to do the training when HE was able, which was nice because we did have lots of other things planned. He is very happy that he did it there! Although some people in our group complained that they had money stolen from their safe.....we had NO PROBLEM...we left valuables around our room and on our patio and never had anything go missing. As for CASH we NEVER keep much cash on us on vacation...we bring a couple hundred $$ for tips and small souveneers ect. and use our credit card for everything else! There are bank machines in town that give american cash, the service charge is about $7.00.CND Playa Del Carmen was great to see....but pretty expensive, as far as drinks and food goes! It was only a $13 cab ride, and took about 10 minutes. We did go to Coco Bongos one night...Wow! What a great show! Highly reccomend it to any adults, except the show doesn't start till 11p.m. and goes till 3:30 a.m. ...We lasted till about 1:30, but it really was entertaining! We went on several group excursions planned through the resort. I feel that they were a bit over priced, but were easy to book and never had any problems! We had left our 3 year old at home for this trip, but he would have LOVED the kids club!! There seemed to be lots of families at the resort, but never saw too many people take advantage of this club....not sure why, it was clean, staff were friendly, and it had EVERYTHING that kids LOVE! Most of the group that we were with were couples or families, however there were a couple young single guys with us, and I think that they were hoping for a little more \"action\" around the resort...it is not a great place for singles or people that are looking for a PARTY!~ Having said that, they simply took a $13 cab ride into town for a little extra excitement. The nightly entertainment was not the best I've seen, but entertaining none the less! We watched the show every night, but it didn't start till 9:30 or so, which I was surprised with all the families that they didn't do an earlier \"Family Friendly\" show, like many of the resorts I've been to. Also the shows were is the Sky bar, which doesn't have the best layout for live shows, but they did pretty good considering! The resort never seemed busy...There were always chairs available by the pools and beach, never a reservation needed for meals and rarely a lineup at the bar! It was a nice and relaxing atmosphere! All In all a GREAT RESORT! I don't like to go to the same place twice, but this is definately one I would consider! I would be happy to answer any questions that anyone might have!

We left change on the dresser one day and it was all there when we returned and we felt comfortable with putting our belongings in the safe. The resort was always clean including the beach. Beach butlers were attentive and continually were straitening up the beds and asking what they could do for you. We only had one time when we could not find a beach bed, but we did find lounges under the shade so it was not a problem. The way this resort was set up you had to walk a ways for the Ala Carte restaurants, but that was probably a good thing as I usually ate to much because the food was great. The food was so good. We particularily liked Sea Olives. Loved the fact that we did not need reservations and could eat in the Ala Carte as many times as we wanted to. So sad to leave, can't wait to go back. For two people the taxi was $10.00 US to get to Playa.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hinsdale, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent 5 star resort - made my daughter cry upon leaving\u201d", "Author": "NDArkie", "ReviewID": "UR95423808", "Content": "We had a three-night/four day stay at Azul Fives for my wife's 50 birthday with my 16 year old son and 8 year old daughter. We all loved the resort. My wife doesn't like huge resorts and we wanted to be pampered. We found that in Azul Fives. The resort is secluded but close to town and about a 30 minute ride from the Cancun airport. When we saw some of the mega-resorts on our ride from the airport, I was excited to see Azul Fives is much smaller and more initimate and peaceful. We just wanted to relax, swim, lay in the sun, and make my wife happy. We accomplished all that. We were greated with champagne and smiling faces at check-in and immediately love the clean, modern, contemporary design. I'm an architect, and I loved the quality of the design and construction. Check-in was fast and easy and Abraham was very helpful throughout our stay. My daughter was excited to get a cold chocolate milk. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite in Villa 9 with a king size bed in the bedroom with a pull-out sofa in the living room. The suite included a nice kitchen, dining area, living area, whirlpool tub, glass-enclosed rain shower, private toilet room, and double sink. The furniture, appliances, and furnishings were clean and worked fine. The suite has a powder room off the entry/kitchen and that's a nice feature with a group of four. We were on the ground floor and had windows on two sides and a patio with lounge chairs. The room was quiet and we slept very well each night. There is one flat-screen TV in the living area with a collection of Spanish and English channels. There is also a DVD player. We brought DVD's but never played them because we were constantly out of our room swimming, sunning, eating, and drinking. We were not online much during our stay because we were trying to relax, but the pool bars had wifi and we could connect to it with our iPhones and laptops when we wanted. The maid did an excellent job (Guadalupe) and our room was clean and fully stocked each day. One of two \"winding river\" pools and pool bar/grille (the Lizard) was about 25 feet from our patio. There are two winding river pools that weave through the resort with three swim-up bars, and two grilles that open from 10-6. The rivers are 4 feet deep and have shallow sunbathing and swimming areas with lounge chairs in the water and sunbathing areas around the edges. My son and daughter loved swimming the length of each pool and getting drinks from the friendly staff. Domingo and Marcelano at the Palmas Bar were extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone is very friendly at the resort and call you by name if you take the time to say hello. They're not pushy, but are there to help with anything you want. We would typically spend the mornings at the winding river pools and then move to the Infiniti Pool and Beach mid-day and in the afternoons. The pools are not heated, but that didn't seem to be a problem with 80F weather. The Gulf of Mexico was warm. The Infiniti Pool has plenty of seating, is located next to the Sea Olive & Tsuki restaurants. There is a large swim up bar that serves the pool and beach area. You can get your own drinks at the bar or a waiter will get them for you at the beach or pool. The selection of drinks were excellent for both adults and children. The beach has nice sand and has a wonderful small coral reef along the shore. I saw a review where someone described this as rocks, but coral in Riviera Maya is excellent and a lot of fun. There is a beach activities hut where they're loan you kayaks, snorkeling gear, etc. There are activities scheduled about every hour for kids and adults. We went on a snorkeling tour the first day (right in front of the hotel) and then went snorkeling each day once or twice. Just off shore you'll find clown fish (Nemo), sea urchins, etc. We loved it so much my son and I took a one-day scuba lesson and dive to a reef off of Playa del Carmen arranged by the hotel staff. I would highly recommend that. Gama works the beach hut and is very nice and helpful. Victor was our dive instructor and was excellent for newbies. Alfonzo is the beach concierge and is very nice and helpful. On the beach are lots of lounge chairs and about a dozen \"beds\" with pillows that swing gently on four ropes. We used one most days. There was never an issue with reserving or find a chair and no reservations are required at any restaurants. It's just not too crowded of a place. We saw crowded when we went to town. Wow! It made us really happen to be at Azul Fives. We ate in each restaurant and at each winding river pool bar/grilles. Flavours is the largest and is located near the lobby, hotel store, and spa. They served a different menu each night and had an excellent breakfast each day. You can order for the menu or go to an excellent buffet. My wife and I enjoyed the food and drinks and our children were happy with the food (which is saying something). They also setup tables and grille food on the lawn between the beach and the hotel each day. On our first day, they setup a Tequila tasting table. We also had room service a couple days for breakfast and the food was delicious and arrived quickly. I used the free exercise gym each day and thought it was fine. It was never crowded. The equipment was all new and mostly LifeFitness. My wife and daughter spent an afternoon at the spa getting massages and manicures/pedicures and loved it. My wife thought it compared well with any spa in the US. Very clean, nice staff, and a beautiful design. We went to downtown Playa del Carmen (5th Avenue) one night. It cost $15US each way and took about 15 minutes. The town is full of tourists and has a collection of Mexican gift stores and chain stores. There are plenty of restaurants, but not that many Mexican food restaurants (at least not on 5th Ave - odd). We ultimately found a nice place to eat Mexican food outside and bought some gifts. There is a nice kids club/separate building (Azulitos). We went there one night to get my daughter's face painted and it looked very clean and nice. The children were watched over and cared by three young nannies that my son thought must be the nicest young women on the planet. The were very friendly and the children seemed totally at ease and enjoyed being there. They have small pool, playground, gym, and other play rooms filled with toys. Kids were watching movies together, playing Wii, playing XBox or just playing with toys. A young couple we met said their two young children didn't want to leave Azulitos each day. Nearby, there is a tennis court (ran out of time to play), ping-pong, shuffle board, and a large chess board. We played ping-pong and chess on a warm evening. It was interesting to note the mix of people at the resort - couples (we saw one beach wedding), families with all ages of children (like us), young couples with babies, extended families, pairs of couples, etc. They only thing we didn't see were large or rowdy groups. I figure they must go for the larger AI resorts with more of a party/spring break atmosphere. We had a drink on the second floor outside patio at the Zky Bar, but we didn't see any of the nightly shows. The family we dove with went each night and said it was great. We were out of energy from our days in the water and sun so we opted for our beds instead. The bar looked nice and it was a great place to grab a drink under the stars. There is a small stage for shows and a large dance floor. You can drink at the bar, at small tables, or on small sofas and chairs in informal seating groups. In the end, I would highly recommend this resort. I was hoping it was as good as the good reviews noted and it was. I'm not sure where the negative reviews stayed. It didn't seem like this resort. My children loved it so much that when the van arrived to take us to the airport, my daughter started crying. That's a pretty good endorsement by her and we all agree with her. Five stars!

You'll love it! Be warned though that the hotel in not \"in' Playa Del Carmen, as advertised, but a 10 - 15 minute drive from town. Longer if you hit rush hour. I had counted on walking to the many restaurants available on 5th ave in Playa. Due to the location, this isn't possible. If you don't have a rental car, count on a 15 - 20 dollar taxi ride, each way, to get to town. I only tried two of the 5 or 6 restaurants, but the meals were so over priced that I couldn't enjoy them. Paying about $60 bucks for a buffet that would be a great meal if it was $20, makes it hard to walk away satisfied. Fortunately, the waiter was kind, and only charged us for 3, meals instead of the 5 of us, or it would have been much worse. This wouldn't be an issue I had opted for the all inclusive plan. While the property is ocean front, the rooms are not. There is a nice view of the pools, but the ocean is 500 meters through the jungle away from the closest room. The beach is not the soft sand that Playa Del Carmen is known for. You must be in town for this. At The Azul Fives, it's coarser, with lots of rocks and shell fragments. It is still better than Mexican west coast sand though. The water is too rocky to be considered safe for swimming right in front of the hotel. You'll have to walk 5-10 minutes up the beach if you want to swim. The programming staff did a great job of keeping people involved, with beach volleyball, soccer, and night shows. They were the high lite of the resort. The housekeeping staff did a pretty good, but not great job. Asking for anything above and beyond the usual was a challenge. Asked for extra towels, got extra blankets instead. After two weeks the TV still hadn't been fixed. We had a two bedroom with full kitchen, advertised to sleep 6. Great for 4, but the other two had to sleep on a terrible pull out couch. We asked for a cot instead, but that was something the hotel wasn't able to accommodate. the room was \"surface Clean', but after a few weeks there you really noticed the areas that were missed.

Biggest drawbacks: - I can sleep just about anywhere, but the beds (and couch) were SO UNCONFORTABLE. There was no give in the mattress at all - crazy! It was like sleeping on the floor. We were at AF for a week, and neither or us slept well that entire time. Disappointing since the reason for the vacation was to catch up on much needed rest. The couch - which looked fancy - was equally as uncomfortable. It felt like it was ejecting me when I sat down. - No hot tub. I guess there's oneside at the VERY overpriced spa (an hour massage was over $200) if you are doing a spa day, but not for soaking at the end of the day. The pool water is also unheated. So, we were there when it was about 80 all week, and didn't get in the water until the last hour of the trip when I made myself get into the pool. Soooo disappointing. (BTW, it wasn't just us, nobody - not even the little kiddos staying at the hotel - went in the pools.) The pools looked amazing, but were just too cold to use. The ocean was warmer. - The food was just okay. Nothing we ate there was good at the hotel, either - nothing bad, but wouldn't recommend the all inclusive. The drinks are also really weak (and I'm a light weight). We ended up eating over half of our meals in town, and I was still really tired of the food at Azul Fives. (Side note: we ate at Seasons in PDC and it was fantastic!) - Far from town. It is a $10-11 cab ride each way to town. This adds over a week. There isn't really another way to get around because the hotel sits over a mile off of the main road. If you are ambitious and feel like trekking in the heat, then you can walk the mile to the main road and catch the collectivo to either PDC or Cancun. - There's nothing to do after 5:00. Everything is dead. We got bored and tried the entertainment in the main bar. Some acts were good others were just weird. They tried, though. - And, you can hear through the walls, so if you are a light sleeper, you may not want to be near anyone. The good stuff: - Everything looked very nice. Everything was clean. It seemed very safe. The staff tried hard to please, even if they weren't the most adept at doing the job. - The rooms were really big. Although somewhat unusable because the furniture was so uncomfortable. - Rates were really reasonable. - The beach is right next to the pool, so you can choose to sit in the sand or by pool. Plus, there's shade on beach for when you need a break from the sun. (Note on the beach: It's pretty nice for walking around, but you have to walk a little ways to get to small swimming areas). - We don't have kids, but the kids center (which had staff to watch the kids), looked really fun - had its own pool and looked like gymnastics place. Overall, we didn't have a bad stay here, but would not recommend it or go back beause: 1) the beds, 2) the food, and 3) the distance to town and lack of things to do at the hotel after the pool-time ends.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBad Management\u201d", "Author": "swardrop", "ReviewID": "UR92950618", "Content": "After reading all of the great reviews on the hotel I am very confused. I was there as part of a family reunion of 19 people and none of us were happy with the hotel. The best part was that it was quiet and you could always get seating at the pools or the beach. However, the food was not good, particularly at the buffet and it was very inconsistent. An example would be the chocolate lava cake at the Sea Olive restaurant. One day it came at room temperature, the next day it came with no chocolate in the center and the next day it came literally still frozen so hard that you could knock it against the table. And it was the same thing with everything we ordered. It began to be our little game each night to see what new way the meal would be different. Iceberg lettuce instead of romaine in a ceasar salad, tenderloin steak when striploin was ordered, fajita's with spicy sauce, fajita's with no spicy sauce. Seriously, every time we went the meals were presented differently, and I'm even talking about the same dish, the same night for two different people at the same table. For a resort that bills itself as a \"Gourmet Inclusive\" the food was not good. Also because we had 8 rooms booked we knew how the service was different between the rooms. Some would get their mini fridges refilled, while others had to call three and four times to get it done. Some got turn down service with chocolates and fruit baskets and towel animals and others got nothing. I know what you are thinking, they probably didn't tip. Wrong, in a one week stay we tipped over $300 for just my husband daugher and I, and I know the others were tipping well also. As for the rooms, they looked good on the surface as they were large and do look like the photos on the website, however they weren't very clean. I wrote the date in the dust on the shelves above the bed. The room smelled like sewage, (six of the seven rooms had that problem). We never had towels or soap in the half bath off of the kitchen until the last day, we didn't get a bath mat until the last day, and everthing needed a really good wipe down. Three of the rooms had flooding from the toilet tank (no sewage, just water), but if we hadn't been in our room when it happened and quickly turned off the water, it would have flooded. Speaking of flooding, the last two days that we were there, water was flowing under the doors into the outdoor hallway area and down to the ground from the third floor of villas 10 and 11. One of the things that really bothered us was that we were told that this hotel was great for family reunions and would cater to large groups. Not true, they wouldn't even give us one night where they would put tables together so that we could have a family dinner. And they could have, because they did it for a wedding while we were there. Their website says that they do bonfires at the beach, which they did not. They were supposed to have butler service at the beach, but they don't. And whatever activities they have are not posted anywhere, so you really don't know what is available. There is no ATM on site and they couldn't make change at the front desk. In fact one day we asked for change so that we could continue to tip the staff and we were told that the staff was paid a wage and it wasn't necessary to tip them. The beach was nice if you just wanted to lay in the sun or play volley ball, but if you wanted to go in the water then you needed to walk down to another resort and use their beach, as the area in front of Azul Fives had too much coral. The one shining spot for us was the swim up bar on the pool side of villa 11. The food there was good and the service could not have been better. The only down side is that it closed by 6. Basically, because it was billed as a five star \"Gourmet Inclusive\" we had certain expectations. If we had paid less and been told to expect a three star, with so so food and service, we would have been happy. I had a nice vacation because I was there with great people and the weather was wonderful, which made up for the shortcomings of the resort, but I am still confused as to how other people are writing such different reviews based on their experience.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "americlad", "ReviewID": "UR92708074", "Content": "My wife and I decided to take my two daughters who are 21 and 23 along with two of their friends to a Playa Destination.

The \"buffet\" area which is really way more gourmet and fresh to be called a buffet was fantastic. they kind of display small quantities of food for you to select and then they top it up fresh all the time so no stale yesterdays sausages here. They even had a pizza oven, cooked fresh meats and fish at all meals and for those needing a hangover cure there was even Absolute Vodka at breakfast for your Bloody Mary. Lunch was either at one of the pool side restaurants which stretches all the way through this stunning resort, at the garden barbecue where they cooked fresh paella daily which was amazing, or at my favorite restaurant Sea Olive. The menu is great but if you don't find something you like then you only have to ask. At this resort you can choose all inclusive or not- EP which means that those on EP are paying for their food and so it is so important that the quality is absolutely top notch or people would not eat there...and I am really fussy! If I had to make one comment I would like to see just one more restaurant I think. There are two more restaurants, also amazing, Tsuki which is Asian and Senses which is a fine dining experience. All great, nothing negative to say at all! The kids....well as my son Oscar has his own website where he reviews kids resorts I think we should know when a kids club is really great or not. A kids club can look great but if the staff is not interactive with the kids then they don't want to go. Plus as a parent I don't want them to sit and play video games all day too. This one, in Oscars opinion is the best! It is great for all ages although I feel it would be even better if there was a teens zone. go to Oscars site around the world with Oscar and you will see his latest video and reviews of the kids clubs. The rooms and suites are superb. We had a one bedroom suite which had a full kitchen, dining area and pull out sofabed. More than enough space for our family. Then my parents had a deluxe room with their own balcony and bathroom right beside us. Service is exemplary. If I had staff working for me for just one month and are that good I would be delighted.

The pools are spectacular and plentiful - there is no need to get up at 6am to secure a lounger poolside- there are plenty to go around. The restaurants are stunning, serving exquisite food - likely the best all-inclusive around. The spa is the best I have been to, bar none. The gym, although on the small side, is well-equipped with top of the line equipment, and it is spotlessly clean. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Daily maid-service ensured that towels were refreshed and beds were changed. Small plumbing issues were immediately addressed and rectified by a highly professional maintenance team. Anything we needed was a phone call away and the response was immediate. I would highly recommend the Azul Fives for anyone looking for a destination in the Riviera Maya. We plan to return for 2 weeks at spring break and really look forward to reconnecting with staff and friends! I would like to acknowledge the following staff members at the Fives who went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure our stay was a memorable one: Lester, Hilario, Juan, Christian, Jacob,and Annie - thanks to all of you!!!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing, great service and perfect for families with young kids\u201d", "Author": "Travelfarnwide8", "ReviewID": "UR91907389", "Content": "Being a mom and traveling to Cancun with a 2 year old, I had my doubts and uncertainties.

The Kids Club was a a favorite, great toys, good activities and friendly staff who had patience with kids.

We have zero tolerance for kitschy decor and the place delivered with understated but luxurious indoor and outdoor spaces. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and the kids (5 and 1) had ample room to run around. They loved the in room jacuzzi which did have warm water. The pools were right next to the rooms so changes and bathroom breaks were incredibly convenient. Building 5 is well situated - close to the kids club and beach. We were first in a building closer to the entrance and after the first day decided we'd like to be closer to the beach on the second floor and the staff very willingly relocated us. Azulitos, the free kids club was heaven sent. Our older one would look forward to it every morning. They had free tennis lessons, salsa classes, gym time, swim time and lots of other activities. The staff were very kind and the club was open from 9am to 9pm. The best part is that you could pay the staff extra to baby sit kids in your room (my 1 year old could not be left in Azulitos) if you want a quiet dinner in a restaurant with the spouse. If you decided you had enough of the restaurant scene you could order in and have a nice meal in your own dining room. The beach was a short walk away and was very nice. Long morning walks were our favorite activity. The second was lounging on the swing beds that swayed gently in the ocean breeze. The wait staff at the beach kept everyone well stocked with free cocktails and busy with activities like beach volleyball, bocce ball, etc. While at the staff, it was very clear that they all had a lot of pride in working for the place. They were all very warm and attentive. My one spa visit was phenomenal. I would highly recommend getting a massage here. The buffet breakfast and dinner were good. I would rate lunches as very average. They were bland - perhaps to cater to the mix of international crowd. I expected more local flavors. We had some really good mexican food in Playa Del Carmen and can't say why the same experience could not be replicated in the resort. There was entertainment every night in the Skybar. We saw a Michael Jackson tribute show with some awesome dancers. Other entertainment was sitting in the pool and watching weddings on the beach - so much fun!

The property (the rooms and pools) are very nice in appearance. We asked for a room with a good view, but apparently the only view is of the pools that meander through the middle of the villas. We were in the villa closest to the beach and our room overlooks what would be the ocean at any other \"beachfront\" property we've stayed at, but there are trees blocking the view of the ocean. I would estimate the beach is about a thousand feet from our villa, so there is basically no appreciable view of the ocean. Oh, and if you're looking for a nice beach, keep looking. The beach itself is rocky with crushed shells making up a good percentage of it. It isn't comfortable to walk on. It isn't like the beach at Playa del Carmen at all. The width of the property's beachfront area is pretty narrow; I'd estimate it to be about 250 feet. We kept running out of hot water on our first two days and contacted the concierge and maintenance was dispatched. The next morning they replaced the hot water heater to our room. After that, we smelled a kerosene odor every time we turned on the water. There was also a putrid odor emanating from the drains in the sinks, tub and shower. We finally plugged up all the drains and put a wet washcloth over the drain in the shower. That helped a little, but not completely. Again, the room is very nice to look at, but there was a light fixture over the dining table that was made up of dangly plastic pieces surrounding the lightbulb. Every time the A/C unit came on the fixture clanked together. Whoever decided that was a good idea should be forced to sleep in the room with it making noise all night. It appears the property must have sat for quite some time before the opening this past fall because the paint on the rails on the balcony is flecking off in multiple locations. The place was pretty dead, but the service was pretty lame. For the amount of people staying at the property we were expecting more. My wife and I stayed at El Dorado Maroma this past July to celebrate her 40th birthday and were so looking forward to this trip, but it has been quite disappointing. My recommendation to the owners is to bring the Maroma staff down here to train this group. Also, after having experienced the Gourmet Inclusive experience at Maroma, we were looking forward to a repeat of the culinary delights we had there. That would not be the case here. If they could duplicate the food offerings found at Maroma it would have made the experience a little better, but we found our best meals were in Playa del Carmen on Fifth Avenue. We'll go back to El Dorado Maroma, we won't be back to Azul Fives.

The resort is on the small side as far as the all inclusive for that area go- which was exactly what we were looking for. Even though there are about 200 rooms/units, and it was considered pretty full during our stay, we never had a problem getting a beach or pool chair, nor did we have wait for a table in one of the restaurants. In fact, at the start of our vacation 2 of the 3 swim up bars weren't even open. (the one near the infinity pool was always open, but the 2 located near the snack bars were not until closer to the weekend) The rooms were cleaned well each day and then towels refreshed/tidied up in the evening during turn down service. (one day our room was skipped for turn down, however). The kids club which says it is for up to 12 years old is really geared more towards the 9 and under set. . Also, the fridge in your room is replenished daily with some bottles of water, a few cans of beer and sprite and coke. We were told that we would also be given juice and some light snacks (pretzels, etc), but only received this once even though we did make several calls. Hot water also runs out fast so if you have more than 2 people staying in a room take fast showers or do it in shifts. Was not enough to fully fill the jacuzzi tub either. We enjoyed the restaurants and made our rounds. Room service was also fun for a late night snack of cheese or fruit and we called up for breakfast a few days as well (the buffet was loosing its luster for us after a few days so we thought we would take a break and then return). The staff were all very friendly and professional. They had activities going on at certain hours as well as a yoga or stretching class in the morining pool side.

I would definately recommend this to anyone wanting to have a time of their life.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "hutsone", "ReviewID": "UR87941816", "Content": "The Azul Fives was an absolutely gorgeous hotel. The rooms were huge; a deluxe room had two bathrooms, king/double bed, couch, full kitchen, dinning table, two balconies, and good size bathroom. You could not ask for better workers, they were very kind and always willing to help even when you did not ask. The food is delicious, they have several types of restraunts to pick from. The beach was nice, there were rocks along the shore but after you past the rocks, it was good water to swim in. This hotel satisfies the needs of families with daycare and couples with romantic settings.

Food/Drink Service: \u2022 Food was amazing \u2022 4 restaurants: Flavours (all day), Mediterranean, Japanese and Senses (pay additional for Senses) \u2022 Breakfast at Flavours was amazing, ate off the menu and also had a \u201cfood display\u201d (they don\u2019t use the word buffet) but it was awesome and they would make you anything you want \u2022 Ate lunch at Sea Olives (Mediterranean) everyday because the resort is new Flavours was not open for lunch yet. It was amazing and served bread (whole wheat or white) which lunch and dinner \u2022 Asian restaurant called Tsuki was amazing and would make whatever you wanted especially in terms of sushi \u2022 Also have 2 \u201cgourmet corners\u201d (snack bars) at 2 of the pool bars...had amazing thin crust pizza! Also served things like nachos, burgers, salad, etc Take Note: \u2022 This is not a \u201cparty resort\u201d \u2022 It was very empty when I was there because it just opened, but it\u2019s not going to be a loud and rowdy resort-it is very upscale and refined chic \u2022 The kids club is amazing. It has an outdoor jungle gym, small kids pool and lounge chairs, arts and crafts room, nap room, fisher price room, my gym (amazing!) video game room with WII, Play Station 3 and X Box, etc! \u2022 The beach right in front has a lot of coral-you can go walk in snorkelling. This is great for clients who want that...if you walk a few minutes either way you can swim without a problem \u2022 I would suggest water shoes as I cut my foot swimming out in the middle ocean (a few hotels down, and was quite deep!) \u2022 About a 40 minute walk along the beach right into Playa Del Carmen Things I liked: \u2022 The infinity pool overlooking the ocean was the best part and focal point of the resort-it is picture perfect!! \u2022 The resort is built a little back from the beach but all the rooms even at the front of the resort have access to a pool almost right outside their door. There are no swim up suites but there are pools snaking throughout the resort \u2022 Comfy modern wicker chairs with cushions by the pool and double bed cabanas by the pool and beach \u2022 They come around with cold scented towels, evian spritzer and gourmet \u201ctreats\u201d like fruit/frozen fruit on a stick at the pool \u2022 Safe is electronic-no need to carry around a key \u2022 Ferrero roche chocolates at turndown! \u2022 Zky Bar is amazing, great ambiance, large plush outdoor \u201cbeds\u201d \u2022 Music playing at the pool \u2022 Beach volleyball!! Things I didn\u2019t like: \u2022 No peepholes on the doors \u2022 All the rooms are set up in suite like situations...either a 2 bedroom or 3 bedroom so you have one door to get into the suite and then 2 or 3 doors once you are in. If you have a deluxe room, or one bedroom suite you will just have access to one of the rooms. If you have a 2 or 3 bedroom suite, you will have access to all the doors. Because of the main door being locked as well, it\u2019s difficult to hear someone knocking for room service or the maid, etc This resort sets the standard very high...it combines everything you find at high end resorts/hotels with an all inclusive concept.

Very beautiful resort, lots of landscaping. The pool serpentines through the whole property. My teenagers absolutely loved it. Great security, close to downtown Playa Del Carmen, about 10 minute cab ride. Good restaurants, spa, and nice beach. There are some rocks in the water , but you can walk about 100 yrds. down the beach and there is an area that is rock free for those who like to swim out in the gulf. The beach infinity pool is my favorite place to hang out, and the swim up bar is nice as well. You have a beautiful view of the Island of Cozumel and arriving and departing cruise ships. There are plenty of beach activities as well, such as para sailing, jet skies, fishing, snorkeling, diving, henna tattoos for the kids, hair braiding, ect. There are other nice hotels and restaurants close by within walking distance. The Tides is right next door, and is a little pricey, but has great food. There is also a small boutique hotel / restaurant next to the Tides called Cocos, A man and his wife run it, it sets back in the jungle a ways, but well worth the trip. You may have to ask how the get there, but is safe to walk to from the beach at night. They have great food at a great price. I recommend their pizza, it is cooked in a brick oven, over wood fire. On down a few 100 yrds. is another small boutique hotel called Petite La Fete, They have a nice beach bar and restaurant, with free wifi, and the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. Great casual place to walk to and have a cold cerveza and some lunch. It is my understanding that the Azul Fives tried to open way before it was completed, hence some of the earlier negative reviews. But it is completed now, and is truly a first class resort.

One was the hostess at LeChic who was a B the other was a guy working up front where we were checking out. Our plane was departing at 6pm that night, but check out is noon. We checked out of our room at noon but did not go to the front desk and let them know. They charged us $30 dollars for a late checkout and he was a D. Almost forgot we wanted to play volleyball and they had 6 workers who took care of the volleyball arrangements. They gave us hell about us just playing with each other and they called one of the ladies in our party Fing B little did they realize she is fluent in Spanish.
