The location of the hotel isn't that nice itself, as the area is quite dark and empty at night and might feel unsafe.

The rooms were all very clean - not massive, but really had everything you could want or need. Nice double bed, TV (quite a few stations but not many in English - CNN was ok for news though). There were bedside tables, wardrobe and plenty of room for all my bits and pieces. The bathroom was smallish but with a nice sink and shower (no bath) and everywhere was clean and tidy. There is a dispenser by the sink and in the shower with hand/body/hair shampoo which is quite mild and adequate. There is also a nice small powerful hairdryer in the bathroom too which came in handy. Only problem I did find was that the bathroom did tend to get a bit flooded after a shower, but I soon mopped it up and it was fine. Room service is available and there are menus - but I didn't try these. I did have the breakfast which I found very good - you just go down and help yourself to whatever you want. There is a choice of various cold meats, cheeses, salad stuff, etc and plenty of cereals, yoghurts etc. A really nice selection of fresh - and still warm - rolls and bread with jams, honey etc. Plenty of hot tea, coffee etc. All in all - just what you need in the morning. The reception staff and bar staff were all very friendly and helpful and, thankfully, all spoke very good English.

I can understand why previous posters on here have stated that it can be a little hard to find in the dark. Basically you just walk straight out of the main entrance of the Ostabahnhof railway station over two lanes of traffic and turn right on the other side, the Ibis is then 2 minutes walk. The hotel is ideal as a base particularly if you are flying in/out of Shonefeld, as after your stay you can leave your luggage in lockers at the railway station go explore more of Berlin and then call off at Ostbahnhof on the way back to pick your bags up, then continue onwards to the airport. Another plus on staying here is the nearby East side gallery at 1 mile longest remaining section of the Berlin wall which is 5 minutes from the Ibis straight down the dual carriageway past the station.

The Alexanderplatz is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel and the Reichstag is about 25 minutes on the S-bahn. However, if you do choose this hotel I would make sure that you familiarise yourself with the transport system and learn a little basic german so that you get on/off at the right stations! I am lucky that my boyfriend lives in Germany and is a fluent language speaker so that may have made it easier for us to do all the siteseeing.

The bar is also a nice area to chill in the evenings and there is a small menu of barsnacks if you get peckish (e.g. chicken wings etc.) The staff seemed nice enough and we had no problems.
