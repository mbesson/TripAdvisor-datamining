It was so much bigger and better then I thought it would be. You do have to do a check list which I think is great because it covers everyones butt. I like making sure everything is there and if there is something missing you get it asap. We were missing a towel set and when I went down to the office they brought one right up. The lay out was fabulous and although there was only one TV set it was wonderful that way. When you are on vacation you don't go to watch TV anyway. We were about 15 minutes from each of the parks (Disney and Universal). Honestly it was the best vacation we have had. This was our first experience with a villa and I can honestly say that we will be booking them again next year.", "Date": "February 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairmont, NC", "Title": "\u201cDistinctively different and we loved it!\u201d", "Author": "Allen1944", "ReviewID": "UR6157061", "Content": "We always spend vacations in a hotel room and, when I saw a 3Bedroom/2Bath on the internet for about the same as we would spend for one moderately priced hotel room, I booked it but reluctantly because it seemed to good to be true and we know hhow that goes. Three days before we were scheduled to depart, I got a phone call from the resort and thought to myself, here it comes - it is too good to be true. However, I was pleasantly suprised when they said they were calling to see if we needed directions to find the resort, gave me the gate code and wished us a safe journey. After 8 hours in the van we were weary when we arrived, so it was very rewarding that they were waiting for us and greeted us with a warm welcome. I must say the villa was huge and the open floorplan was great as the kitchen opens out into the family room. Overall, it has changed the way I will attempt to vacation again because it was so much better for a family than a hotel room. It's a small resort, so the staff were very accommodating and courteous.

We are not in the room much, so why pay extra money. When I saw the advertisement for $49.00 a night I flipped. I was paying that for a cheesy closet room. Here I was getting a 1700 square ft house. Can't beat that. I felt it had to be better than a 1 room motel. When I arrived I was very impressed. Service desk was polite. We were escorted to the room. There was a checklist that we had to go over of all suppllies and furnishing that were in the villa. Everything was there. The villa had 3 bedrooms, big kitchen, living room, sky light, so there was plenty of light coming in. Did I mention the master bedroom bathroom. It was to die for. The bathroom had what seemed to be a mini swimming pool and there was also a stall shower. There was also a smaller bathroom between the other 2 bedrooms. There was a 25 inch TV with cable. If you want another TV in the bedroom, request it. There should be no problem getting it. There is a laundry room next to the office. Its opened 24 hours. It has 2 washers and 2 dryers and its totally free, but bring your own detergent. We actually stayed in for 2 days and relaxed. Never did that before. We felt so at home. I wish I had this house back home. I will definitely check this place out again when I return to Florida in the next several months.

We also noticed a couple of ants on the dresser but did not think anything of it (just ants right!). Should have suspected something then. The first morning I woke up to find my 7 month old baby covered in fire ants. She was sucking her thumb trying to comfort herself while ants were crawling all over her face, head, neck and arms. See photos. (I did not include a picture of her face on the internet for obvious reasons). Her eye was swollen shut, & she even had bites on her lips. The week was miserable because once those bites burst they cause an itching/burning feeling (thus the name fire ants). I approached a staff member immediately (visibly upset) & she advised me that this had never happened before, (check out some other reviews). She seemed irritated that she now had to find us another villa. The whole day was wasted repacking & moving to the other villa. We had to shake out all of our clothing & luggage as our suitcases were infested. Just talking to a nurse took a couple of hours. We were advised that we would get that night for free and a tour of the resort (wow), instead my visa shows me that they charged me for 2 extra nights I did not stay (charged to my visa without my signature/authorization). In the second villa they turned off the a/c on us one day - remember it is summer in Florida. We had to get our key cards reactivated several times as they would not work. That was our week - not too fun & now my daughter has pot mark scars on her face and arms. What bothers me the most is that the staff that we dealt with did not seem to really care. Please think twice before attending as I know that even the company that we booked it through no longer deals with this resort due to the large amount of complaints etc. Best of luck!!!", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bartlett, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPlease don't ruin your family vacation!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "MommaGin", "ReviewID": "UR5623569", "Content": "Stayed at Universal Resort Kissammee.

They count everything even the number of forks and spoons, and make you sign for them. The US prison system isn't that strict. We spent one day without air conditioning, our townhouse was 98 degrees. As the sun went down the temperature cool off to 94 degrees. My children were in one room under a ceiling fan. Of course there was no maintenance man available because it was his off day. The swimming pool water was cloudy like milk and had bugs floating in it and there was no jacuzzi avail.

We read most of the reviews before we booked and weren't sure about what to expect so we kept our expectations low. We reserved our villa (3 bedroom, 2bath, full kitchen) through Bookit. This was a site I never used before so I was wary but booked anyway because of the price (335 for five days (07/10-07/15) There was about 75$ of charges we didn't know about until after we booked (notified via email), but still an excellent price. The resort sends you an entire checklist within 48 hours of booking and asks that you fax it back within 7 days to reserve your reservation. On the listing they tell you about no maid service, bring extra linens if you want, leave the place clean, etc. Since we were in town to visit Universal Studios and simply looking for a place to lay our head we weren't looking for a five star resort. We checked in on a Monday so the resort was really quiet until Friday evening when other families checked in. After other folks checked in we realized how thin the walls were. As far as the villa, it was clean and worked well for us. There are three boys in our family with the youngest being 9 and the oldest 13 so it was great having three bedrooms. There was a master, and two smaller bedrooms - one with twin beds, the other with a full size bed. We saved quite a bit of money using the kitchen for breakfast and most of our dinners. The place was probably about 1200 sq ft, smaller than home but more than enough roon for vacation. We also made most of our lunches. (Hint: if going to Universal place your electronics on top and the food and drink on bottom of a bag). As far as linens , we washed clothes and towels on Wednesday and Friday so it wasn't a big deal. We brought our (We camped out for a week earlier this summer so it was a luxury having a washer/dryer) Most days we left by 8:30/9:00 am and returned around 9:00 pm but on Friday we hung out at the resort. The kids and my wife hung out at the pool and I did some work. There are also tennis/basketball courts at the resort. As far as internet access there is a wireless access point at the main office or you can pay for dailup. I did an upload/download every morning at the main office since it was free. We didn't have too much interaction with the staff. Everyone smiled. Our vacuum roller thingy was busted and we asked for a broom and they delivered it. There is only one television in the villa but we only have one television at home so that wasn't a big deal. It looks like basic cable - ESPN, CNN, etc, no HBO, Showtime, etc. The master bath had a large tub and a shower stall. The other bath room was a basic bath. Everything was clean enough but not spectacularly clean. A little better than a very clean public bathroom would describe the cleanliness. The air conditioning is set at 75 and locked in a box. For us it was too cold because we keep our home set at 77. If you know what you're doing I guess you could pop the lock and change it. The hotwater is at the lowest setting but if you have a swiss army knife and know how the heater works you can change it. There is a washer/dryer, stove, full size refrigerator, and a counter top microwave. We brought a few kitchen things (large cast iron skillet and a large pot) and we were good to go. There is a Publix right down the street and gas is cheaper on that side of town. All in all the stay was what I expected. There were no suprises or problems. It was quiet because we were there during the week. It got busy on Friday and you will hear your neighbors. If you're interested in more than basic facilities don't stay here; this is a 2 star resort with just the basics. It was worth the price I paid but definently not more than that.

When we pulled in the outside of the buildings and the landscaping was beautiful, but when we walked into our villa it was another story, our room was dirty and we had a serious ant problem. Our kitchen counters were full of ants if we left food out, and on two occasions my daughter left her pjs on the bathroom counter and they were covered in ants. To top it off I have a baby who crawls and his hands and knees were so dirty from crawling on the floor. On the up side of things we got a very good deal after complaing and ended up paying about $50.00 a night, it was very spacious because we were upgraded to a 5 bedroom due to overbooking, and my kids had a great time in the pool and at the tennis courts.

However, after reading reviews from some of the other guests I decided to put in my two cents. My family and I had a great time! The staff was very friendly. I could not tell a lot from the online pictures. I made my reservation through Bookit. There was a lot of information to read and sign. We normally vacation in Daytona Beach. The hotels there are very small and cost a fortune. For the price of the villa I really wasn't expecting much. I know that from time to time I can be a bit of a snob. I was very happy with our villa. It had three bedrooms and two bathrooms. A large living / dining room and a huge kitchen. It was beautiful. The master bathroom was great. I read some of the other comments about the towels. To be honest, most hotels (with the exception of Marriott, Hilton, similiar, etc.) will ask that for short stays you use the towel more than once to conserve energy. We had a blast. All I can say is that you need to read anything you sign. The internet is just like any other contract. We knew going in that there was s security deposit, that there was a cleaning fee (which is normal for villas, condos and other home rentals), we knew what time the office closed, we knew that there was a master key for after hours use (we also knew that if you used your deadbolt lock no one else could get in - that should take care of the security issue), we knew that each villa was independently owned. It only took us 15 minutes to get to Universal Studios. We stayed for four days and we are planning to go back soon. Our villas was number 1074. The condo we stayed in last month was close to Sea World. It cost twice as much and was half the size. All I can say is we had a blast, my picky son loved it.

The foyer walls/ceiling were covered in cobwebs, spiders, and several other bugs. The stairs were flithy, it looked like they hadn't been vaccumed in months. There was a ridiculous checklist that needed to be filled out as soon as we got there. It litterally contained every single thing in the villa... beds, specific amounts of clothes hangers, even fake plants. Keep note: you're held liable for any missing items at the end of your stay. One of the bedroom windows was pretty cracked. One of the showers refused to drain, and the other took twice as long as any normal shower should. There was a smell of \"stinky feet\" throughout the whole place. We found out our last night that it was coming from the couch cushions. You can't change the temperature inside the villa, as the thermostat is locked in a plastic case. Sure, it's hot in Florida, but 60 degrees gets cold after a while. There's nothing more enjoyable than going back to your hotel room at 10:30 pm to find a cockroach in your dining room. Trust me on this. And finally, a minor inconvenience (but annoying nonetheless)... the pool closed at 6:00 pm. Unless you spend your whole day at the resort, there is virtually no time to use the pool.

The kitchen was well equipped and the grocery store only a block away, so we soon had dinner on the stove.
