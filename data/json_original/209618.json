Pools is very nice, specially for kids. Beach is just OK but there are other public beaches in Dorado that you can go to. Hotel has a new Casino which is very nice, golf course is very nice and the new oriental restaurant is awesome. Self parking is $10.00 per day if you have a rental car. Around there are a lot of places you can go for dining, shopping and entertainment. Went to Made in Puerto Rico which is about 5 minutes from the hotel and food was very nice puertorican style plates. Attendants were also very funny.

This was my first trip to Puerto Rico and I booked in Dorado to be near to my husband's family (he's from the Dorado area). We were bowled over by the warmth and helpfulness of the entire staff. Everyone spoke perfect English (which was a concern for me, not my husband!). The valet staff (even though we didn't use the service) were super friendly and very helpful with places to go, etc. We didn't meet one staffer of the hotel who wasn't very warm and friendly. It elevated the luxuriousness of our stay tremendously. The room was big, clean and comfortable. My daughter even said the sofa bed was very comfy. The breakfast was fantastic and the Manager's reception every evening was a nice way to end your day and begin your night out! The pool and beach areas were phenomenal. The breakers made the private beach your own private lagoon. The waves (when there were waves) were very small, which made it the perfect beach for kayaking and paddle boating. The only negative I can think of, and it was minor, was the hotel restaurant. We ate there the first night as we arrived sort of late. The food was pricey, the selection was small and everything was extremely over-salted. Service was great, and the drinks were mighty fine! Lunch at the outdoor bar and grill was a different story....reasonably priced and very good food. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.

This was our second trip to Puerto Rico and I have to say that I was very disappointed with the Embassy Suites. My in-laws are Marriott Timeshare owners and they decided to stay at the Embassy Suites because we would have kitchen areas to prepare our meals in. The first issue is the location of the Embassy. Because it is on a large property it is almost a mile walk to get to the main street. A car is necessary to get around everywhere. We really enjoyed taking walks at night and walking to the local restaurants during our first stay. This was not possible at the Embassy. The beach at the resort is absolutely awful. I am from Florida so maybe I have higher beach standards than others do? The beach itself is small and there are not many spots to lay down a towel. It is nearly impossible to swim in the ocean unless you are a skilled swimmer. During rough currents you are smashed onto rocks. Because the beach is terrible everyone goes to the pool and the seats are all taken by lunch. Go to the pool early or be prepared to not get a lawn chair. During our trip I got a rash all over my body. I don't know if I had an allergic reaction with jacuzzi outside or the fabric detergent on our sheets, but needless to say I spent the majority of my trip taking benadryl and misserable.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "rvbolorin", "ReviewID": "UR127471463", "Content": "Just arriving back from 3 nights stay with husband and 2 teenagers.

Although the hotel is not exactly new, everything was very clean. The staff were friendly as well as helpful. The rooms are spacious and clean. I enjoyed the manager's reception that is held every night for the guests. The outside area is set up nicely. There was plenty of seating availble both in the sun and in the shade. The complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning can't be beat. There is a chef ready and waiting to prepare any type of omelet for you. There were plenty of choices besides omelets including pancakes, bacon, fruit and more. The food was very good. There were only two things that kept this hotel from being excellent, the long drive to get to the hotel and the parking garage. After going through the security gate off the main road, it seems like there are about 20 speedbumps before actually getting to the hotel. It made me think twice about leaving the hotel once I got there each time. The parking garage is not attached to the hotel itself. The garage itself is nice and valet parking is an option from the front of the hotel. I chose to do the self parking, and it took a couple of minutes to get from the garage to the hotel, not the end of the world in nice weather, but in the rain it was not as nice. There is a small casino between the garage and the hotel which looked nice from the outside, but I did not go in during this visit-maybe next time.

All the rooms in Embassy Suites face the lobby. The music in the lobby is so ridiculously loud you can't hear your companions speech in your own room. This goes on until 11 p.m. and then the pool bar takes over into the wee hours. Additionally we reserved a partial ocean view and confirmed this with 3 separate phone calls. We wanted to assure the two reservations were linked - one with points, one paid. We didn't want to move. On 3 separate occasions we were told all was well. When we arrived lo and behold we were given a room right smack in the middle of the noise because of a \"conference.\" We had to move the next day. The front desk was rude, as if this was our fault, and we were demanding mainland tourists. We asked to be refunded that first night. After 5 nights and no call from the manager, though that was promised on 2 occasions, they agreed. We are still waiting for the credit to appear on the card. Jury is out. Outside at the pool we were sitting at the edge watching the little one swim when we (and others) were asked to move so a guy with a high powered hose could clean the area. It had rained the night before, it was already washed clean by fresh water. And why the high powered hose? What an incredible waste of fresh water. At any rate, shouldn't you do this before the guests come out for a swim? The hotel is poorly managed.

We had 5 in our party (including 2 small children and a grandma). The hotel's pool is nice and has a lot of features that are good for kids; kiddie pool, wade-in pool section, and playground. Compared to the other resorts that we have stayed at in PR (Rio Mar & Grande Melia) this resort has a serious lack of the WOW factor. Mainly the hotel itself needs updating. The hotel opens into a grand atrium so that you can here the 'karyoke' from the bar singer throughout our entire room. When we booked this trip it was listed as the same place as the Rio Mar. . . comparing apples to apples we would definitely go to the Rio Mar instead. What we liked: Having a suite so that we could close the door to the bedroom was helpful with small kids napping. The rooms also have a mini-bar with frig, sink, and microwave. Our room came with the daily breakfast buffet and evening managers reception. The hotel was very close to downtown Dorado and convenient to the highway. Free parking. Even though the hotel was near full capacity, it was easy to get a chair by the pool. What we didn't like: Other than the breakfast buffet the only place at the hotel to get food is at the poolside bar. The service was okay but VERY slow. . . and we are regular island travelers. Traveling with kids the restaurant situation was too slow. Even if our kids weren't in tow, the restaurant would get old after a couple of days. More choices are warranted. The hotel did not have the overall vacation feel. The hotel is more suited for a business meeting than a real vacation, in our opinion. Having carpets in a beach hotel rooms are less than ideal. Feels grose. We requested adjoining rooms and were told that they would be available for us (b/c can't leave small kids in a room by themselves). At check-in we were told that adjoining rooms were not ready but would be available to us the next day. The rooms became available but d/t 'high occupancy' they would then decided to not let us change rooms. The house keeping services were the worst that we have ever experienced. Our room was not 'cleaned' until 5pm. I use the term loosely b/c my husband and I keep a VERY clean room, even so housekeeping did not even wipe down tables, empty the trash, or vacuum. They only seemed to fold the towels. Overall, I would receommend this hotel only if it came at a significant cost savings compared to the other two hotels (Rio Mar & Grande Melia). If you do stay here, we strongly recommend a rental car. The hotel store has VERY little and the restaurant will get old quickly.

Being Hilton Gold members, we were entitled to a room upgrade so we were told not to unpack because we could move the next day.

However, it's pretty good for a free breakfast, but would have been nicer if there were Puerto Rican foods. The pool area was spacious and beautiful. Kid had a blast. We were there 2 weeks ago, and even though the weather was in the 80s, still felt too cold to go into the pool or beach, which felt frigid. We never went in past our waist in the pools or beaches of PR. Water felt too cold. The beach area at the resort is very small. Good for little kids since shallow and calm, but no where to walk, stroll, or explore. Sand here is dark gold so the water is not crystal clear like in some parts of PR like Luquillo Beach where we went to [far end of public beach]. I was paranoid about having our stuff stolen from the silly stories written by other reviewers. I did not see any hill where another reviewer said she saw hoodlums running up the hill with a back-pack. I felt perfectly safe lying on the beach alone on a weekday while my husband and child were at the pool. There were maybe a total of 6 people on the beach that morning. I had a $1200 camcorder and a $1200 digital camera, but I kept it within arms length. I didn't really go into the water b/c so frigid, but as long as I kept it within my vision 10 feet away on the sand even if I did go into the water, there's no way I felt like anyone would have stolen it. The other reviewer must have literally walked away from her stuff for a good 30 minutes or more not within her vision. Who in this day and age would not keep expensive camera paraphernalia within at least 10 to 15 feet away without watching it. I did the same thing in Luquillo Beach, where there were more people and no one fishy came even close to my bag. You have to be vigilant. This city is a good 35 minutes from San Juan, but it was fun driving back and forth to the Plazas America Mall or to Pinones [Loaiza] where we always eat the acapurrias. It's also located in an area where there's a CVS and Walgreen's across the resort. There is also a supermarket and fast food so you don't have to eat at the hotel. We have been to Puerto Rico 5 years now, and we always rent a car otherwise we would be bored stiff just staying in a resort with no access to come and go as we please. I am not a resort person who can lay around the pool all day or stay in a dark suites so 2 days here would have been good enough. Not likely to stay in Dorado again since the beach and water are pretty to look at from your room, but the actual beach is not that great. The parking garage was a close walk and affordable at $10. The hotel is not stupendous or new, but it's above average so I gave it 4 stars. Another great thing is the laundromat in the basement. That allowed our family of 3 to bring 2 carry-on's for 6 days in Puerto Rico. Not bad doing laundry since it only kills 2 hours of your evening. A bad thing is that there is no prime cable like HBO or Showtime so it got boring at night. I found myself going to bed at 8 or 9 pm, and waking up at 5 am it was so sleepy and boring in this part of Puerto Rico.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable Stay\u201d", "Author": "Matt L", "ReviewID": "UR124839416", "Content": "I was here with my family and the room was perfect.

Also, a clean suite, plenty of room for 3 women in their 40s, it even had a balcony with 2 chairs...it had a refrigerator(empty, I have no idea why another reviewer thought it would be stocked, that is called a mini-bar). The atrium is airy & nice, and glass doors open to a meandering patio with a few steps and ramps, shaded by palm trees, to the pool and the beach, reminiscent of a very fancy hotel in Miami Beach. The beach was very pleasant, the cove was built so the water was calm & shallow, towel service was great, there was no lack of lounge chairs that could be pulled over to the shade, used on the grass, or in the full sun. We ate lunch nearly everyday at the shady pool bar, the waiter even took our drink orders on the beach one day-this did not seem to be a regular thing, which was fine, I would rather eat lunch at a table than on a lounge chair. Parking was $10 per day in the most roomy parking garage in PR it seemed-the one in Old San Juan had steep turns! It is about 35 minutes from the airport or Old San Juan, w light traffic. We did the drive 3 times, with mixed results, but it was worth it to be away from the city and have a private beach. Spa & Exercise room: Massages and other services are done on the lower level by an outside vendor, with whom there was some scheduling confusion with the front desk. Services were very good, tho, and prices comparable to what we were used to. Gym is great, but it would be nice if it had a view. Dining: all food was good, nothing spectacular, but no need to go anywhere else if you don't want to. In the town of Dorado, 5 min away, there is a tiny, but fabulous, Italian restaurant called Grappa. Across from the entrance to the hotel, we had great sushi at a place above the golf club. There is a casino, but we had no interest in that. Lots of people there, all the time. The pool got busy on the weekend, lots of families, but not too crowded. There are 2 infinity pools, a child-friendly sloped entry area and separate wading pool with fountain. Also, a shower area as you came off the beach, and bathrooms convenient to the beach.

The beach is small but great for wading - it would be a great beach for young kids. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. But, there are a few negatives: You have to pay $10 a day for parking, but the parking is in a deck that is a short walk from the hotel - it's a pretty inconvenient situation, especially since they are charging you for the parking. Also, the furniture in our room was a little worn-out, not bad, but it should be replaced. And the lighting in the rooms is dim and they have put the bright-white flourescent bulbs in the fixtures, which make the rooms look cold and sterile. The hotel is surrounded by the golf course and several villa communities, but each of the villa areas have their own gates and are typically surrounded by fences - so there aren't any decent routes for walking around, especially at night. The weekend crowd was large, but the pool and beach had plenty of room for everyone, and the crowd was never too loud or out-of-line, very family-friendly. We had wrist bands to identify us as hotel guests around the pool, but I'm not sure if the staff was paying any attention to them - but, like I said everything was very pleasant, even with a large crowd. The beach could have been cleaned a little more thoroughly - but it wasn't bad. The hot tub was great a few of the nights, but towards the end of our stay, the water was only warm, not hot. I would highly recommend renting a car - while Durado is a great town with convenient drug stores, grocery stores, and restaurants, most of the tourist activities are in San Juan or farther east.

We were very pleased with our decision! The item we liked most about this hotel was the service. Each and every employee we encountered gave the impression that they really cared about helping you. You never felt that one more question was too much. The other reasons we wanted to stay at the Embassy Suites were because it is an Embassy Suites. This hotel has great benefits: two room suites, free full breakfast, free manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception, and free Wi-Fi. How can you go wrong? As other folks have mentioned, the pools were great and the beach area was also very nice. Some people mentioned that the beach needed to be cleaned. We found it to be in great shape each and every morning. By the end of the day there was a bit of debris but nothing to complain about. The beach is protected for the ocean because of two large barriers so it was very calm and fun to swim in. We also rented a paddle boat one day and had some fun with that. A couple of reviews said that this hotel is out of the way and difficult to find. We found exactly the opposite. Yes, it is outside of San Juan and that is why we chose to go here. Our GPS with just its US maps had no problems getting us to the hotel (or anywhere in Puerto Rico). The hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport and most of the trip was on a freeway. The location for us was great and we used it as our hub to sight see on the Northern half of the island. We went east to El Yunque rain forest and hiked - awesome. We went west to the Arecibo Observatory and learned about an incredible telescope - amazing. There was also shopping nearby and many beaches. We also hit the casino one night at the hotel and actually broke even!! We really enjoyed the food at the hotel as it was very reasonably priced. Our first day we had sandwiches at the pool, one night we had room service deliver a pizza and club sandwiches, and then there is the breakfast. We also enjoyed other food while we were in Dorado. We went to a small restaurant in Dorado called Antojitos del Kitrinche. The food was excellent and very reflective of Puerto Rican Culture. Kitrinche is reviewed on Trip Advisor and people said the service was slow. And it was on \"Island Time\", but you are on vacation.... The food was well worth the wait.

The beach was public use and dirty/littered and the chairs were all over the place- the pictures on their website are not accurate AT ALL...it is full of rocks, NOT white sand, full of seaweed, and VERY small- be sure to take water shoes because after 5 minutes of standing in the water and on the beach the bottom of my feet were hurting! As guests of the hotel you had to wear wristbands - children included- to use the pool..however, there were TONS of people not wearing them and who were not guests of the hotel and no hotel staff were making them leave. The pool towel rental was ridiculous- towels had to be turned back in by 10:30 or a charge of $20 was added to your bill. Water coupons were given at check in but you only got 2 bottles of water per day! The managers reception was nice but the \"bouncer\" that monitored who went in to get drinks yelled at hotel guests to wait behind an invisisble line and if you crossed it you were told very nastily to step back. You could take food back up to your room from breakfast but variety was not as it usually is at other Embassy Suites- and cold- and there were signs all over the hotel that you need to be down to breakfast by 7am if you wanted a great breakfast- that if you came at 9am you would get a \"busy\" breakfast- for paying so much the entire time should be a great breakfast! Most hotel staff were ok, I heasitate to say friendly, but ONLY if you tipped them every time and for every thing. We found out the hard way, we when called down for extra towels and sheets and it took an hour for them to be sent up! Additionally,15% gratuity was added to EVERY bill we received from the hotel, regardless of what we ordered! We ordered an appetizer at the bar and after waiting an hour it finally came out, cold, and with the 15% gratuity all ready in the bill!! The resort fee is a JOKE! $17 extra dollars every day for things that at any other Embassy Suites would be included as part of your stay. Plus we asked for a partial ocean view room and were slapped with an extra $15 per day room fee for the \"view\" which overlooked apartments and if you were out on the balcony had the hotel's gererator running so loudly below you couldn't hold a conversation!! Dorado was convenient to San Juan but defintiely not a nice part of town!! Safety wise we made sure we were back in the resort before sun down. We regret our decision to stay in Dorado..if you want a GREAT family vacation (we took our 3 young children) go East from San Juan towards Farjardo- you'll get beautful beaches, great snorkeling, and the El Conquistator or Gran Melia resort slooked gorgeous and offered all inclusive deals- MUCH nicer and we wish we had stayed there, especially after spending SOOO much $$ on 4 nights!

The property is actually about a 45 minute drive from the airport (by taxi) and add an additional 15-20 minutes to the port. The staff is very friendly and the landscaping of the property is beautiful. The suites were a nice size (pleasantly surprised) but smelled moldy and the bathrooms/linens were not clean. The staff neglected to inform us that the oceanview rooms were almost impossible to get as members that have timeshares get first dibs, so although I requested the oceanview suite and/or pool view, I received a garden view room instead. Don't get me wrong...the view of the garden was OK, but it wasn't what I wanted. The rooms are exceptionally cold and there is \"no heat\". The receptions staff's only advice was to turn off the AC that was obviously left running all day and open the balcony door to warm the room up a bit. BTW, that didn't work out as well as I had hoped. We requested additional blankets and learned they did not have any additional blankets and when we ordered additional sheets instead, they were never delivered...only to learn that the reception staff had gone for the night leaving a security guard to try to assist us the best he could. Oh, and did I mention that as some of my party did not arrive at the hotel until past midnight, they arrived to no check in assistance either...and they had a confirmed reservation. The linens on the pull out sofa bed were filthy...we had to obtain additional sheets from the security guard to make up the bed for our children to sleep on. My teen boys were still not overly comfortable with the lack of cleanliness and they were cold. The food was so-so (and this was the consensus of all members in my party...me, my mother, father, husband, 2 sons, my brother and his wife), but we all agreed that we did love the grounds. Overall, I would say if you don't mind the cleanliness issue or the cold, distance from the airport/port, and somewhat moldy smelly rooms/hallways, this is a perfect place (for short stays). Although, the price was reasonable, I cannot say that I would ever stay at this resort again.

We stayed 12/12-18/11. The hotel was very nice and the staff so friendly, patient, and helpful. Everyone spoke English and was more than willing to offer suggestions, directions, etc. The lobby is very attactive and was decorated nicely for Christmas. It was kind of quiet and not too crowded until mid week. The pool/garden area is beautiful. The beach is a small private beach, but beautiful except for the debris along the rock walls. There are plenty of lounge chairs and towels are provided. The free breakfast provides a good variety of hot and cold selections; however, the food wasn't always very hot, and the meats were always over cooked/almost burnt and dry. The Manager's reception of free drinks and snacks was nice, but the same snacks (popcorn, pretzels, a prtezel/cracker mix, and chips and salsa) were served every night. We never used the fitness center, but it looked well equipped. The spa was never open, but we never inquired about it either. The garage was a little walk from the hotel entrance and got very busy/crowded in the evening from the Casino goers. The Casino was fair, but very cold and very lound when a band was playing. The golf course was overpriced, even with the hotel guest discount, as the greens are not well kept. It was fun to see all the iguana running around - they are as plentyful as squirrels in the states. We couldn't have asked for a better view from our room! We enjoyed the balcony; however, a small table would have been nice. The A/C never went below 70 no matter what it was set on. It would have been nice to have a ceiling fan in the bedroom, but the suite was very nice with lots of storage space, a wet bar, mini refrig and microwave. The refrig really kept our drinks cold, not like most hotel refrigerators. The bathroom was spacious with plenty of counter space and good lighting. The shower control was reversed, so when it was all the way on H for hot and cold, it worried me at first. Once we figured out it was reversed, it wasn't a problem for us. The suite was clean and comfortable with 2 flat screen TVs. The restaurant had a fair selection of foods, but would have liked a few less expensive choices. It would have also been nice if there were a food pantry in the gift shop, although the gift shop had plenty of toiletries, souveniers, junk food snacks (chips, candy, etc.) and drinks. The location is about 45 min west of San Juan and from the airport on the north side of the island. Most the tourist activities are on the east side of the island. It takes at least 4 hours to get from one end of the island to the other - lots of traffic. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and our room.

My family and I recently spent a week at the Aquarius Vacation Club, a time share resort located at the Embassy Suites in Dorado Puerto Rico. After having been a time share owner for over twenty years, I must admit I was initially disappointed with our choice. Upon our arrival, we upgraded from the studio efficiency we had booked to a larger room. Unfortunately, it was far from what we hoped for. The stove wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, furniture appeared worn, and matteresses needed to be replaced. Suffice it to say, there were quite a few descrepancies. I quickly contacted ther front desk and asked to speak to the resort manager. Mr. Nazario was very pleasant during our conversation, and listened intently to what I had to say. He immediately made arrangements to have us moved from the sub par accomodation to a more comfortable dwelling - no questions asked. Apparently, he was more concerned that we have a great vacation. Mr. Nazario's professionalism and ability to resolve situation quickly exceeded my expectations. Not only did he upgrade my room that same day but was attentively to anything else my family and I might need. Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended. You can be sure that I will continue to do business with the Aquarius Vacation Club in the coming years. Mr. Nazario is truly a 5 star manager and an asset to the resort!

To my amazement, I found the Embassy Suites Dorado online through Travelocity. This was a last minute trip. I was celebrating my 20th anniversary and needed to get away. Upon arrival the staff at the front desk was cordial and professional at their duties. The positives were; + Great price for what you get. + Excellent service and friendly staff. + Great adult drink service at the nightly manager's reception. + Clean rooms and common areas. + Clean pool area. + Friday and Saturday live entertainment + Local artisans on ground selling Puerto Rican souvenirs and candy. + Excellent breakfast with many food options. + Casino on site. + Close proximity to beach. + Beautiful grounds, especially in the evenings while listening to the Coqui frog. + Shallow pool for the kids to play in. Some negatives... - Loud outdoor cooling fans - Parking at the local garage frustrating at the beginning as it was not explained properly. - Local beach could use some TLC Recommendations... * Add local foods to the breakfast options such as platanos, tajadas and empanadillas * Provide guest with tourist information of what Puerto Rico has to offer. I didn't see any brochures. * Offer better snack selection at the manager's reception instead of eating popcorn, pretzels and gold fish every night. Overall.... The place was great but could certainly be better. There are many short trips guest can take to visit great places like El Morro in Old San Juan, Bacardi Factory, Arecibo Observatory, Arecibo caverns, Utuado Taino Indian Ceremonial grounds and many others. These are all less than 2 hours away. I will certainly be back in a few months to enjoy the Embassy Suites again with my family. One more thing.... I grew up as a poor kid not far away from the resort area. Having returned after 30 years and seeing my old neighborhood was emotional for me and pleasing at the same time.

They provided great service as far as room maintainence and in the restaurants. The only place we has any disappointments from a service perspective was at the outdoor bar.

The pool has a lot of space around it to relax and there's a nice-sized beach area. But, it you're looking for waves, you won't get them, as the beach is in a man-made cove. The only real downside we had at the hotel was something that I really can't blame them for. We checked in on a Friday in early May and, it turns out, that is Junior High Prom time. Friday and Saturday nights there were kids running everywhere and tying up the elevators. But, once we got passed breakfast on Sunday, they were gone and things couldn't have been nicer. Don't let the looks of the in-house restaurant fool you. It doesn't have a traditional look as it's housed in the breakfast area. The food we had for dinners was as good as any we had on the trip. We especially enjoyed trying some of the native dishes. Dorado is a great place to get away from the huslte and bustle of a big city...we were about a 35-45 minute drive from downtown San Juan.

We are a family of 5, with kids aged 20,18 and 16. Most hotels won't allow 5 in a room - the suites do and also offer a free breakfast, so financially this made the most sense for us. Rooms: Very clean, soft, comfy beds. Our room was on the 6th floor and was upgraded to partial ocean view - gorgeous view from balcony. Living area had TV, pullout coach, eating tables/chairs and kitchen area.The pullout coach was okay for comfort -not as comfortable as 2 doubles. Mini-fridge, microwave, sink, tea bags, hot chocolate and coffee provided. Bedroom had TV, 2 dbl beds. A/C good in both areas. Bathroom clean and good size. In-room safe and enough storage for luggage. 5 adult sized people fit well. Housekeeping was timely for regular cleaning, however we had to request twice the first night for the sheets etc to make up the pullout coach before they delivered them around 11:30 and I left notes for extra towels each day and were never given any. Lobby: check in was quick. Good English skills at the front desk. Beautiful lobby with 3 glass elevators, water features, plants - lovely. No specific concierge at own desk - had to use front desk employees instead - directions to places were somewhat sketchy (bring GPS!! bring maps!) Business room had 2 computers with printers/fax/- all free. Used it to print boarding passes and info on tours - very helpful, no one else in there. Resort fee for us was $20 daily. Breakfast: On weekend, it was extremely crowded in the hotel and they set up extra food stations to cut down on lines. On weekdays, it was much quieter and they had the one made-to-order food station, one dry cereal station, one drink station (juices, water, milk, coffee, hot water), one bakery (toast, bagels,danishes). On the slow moving made-to-order station, you could get made to order eggs, and already in warmers - scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon,yogurt, cantaloupe, apples, grapefruits, & hot oatmeal. Food was plentiful and tasty. Would have liked more variety of local fresh fruits. Hard to get our kids up by 9:30 on the weekdays to get down to breakfast. Are requested to eat in dining area and not to bring food up to rooms. At check-in, each room is given tickets for 2 water bottles per day - great for outings - get them outside at the Sea Horse so they will be cold. Pool/Beach - The pool area had lots of chairs, a nice snack/bar-SeaHorse. Was a lovely free-form pool with different sections separated by small waterfalls. A small kids area and climbing structure on the side for little ones. Towels could be signed out for the day easily. We were not as happy with the beach.The water was not raked for seaweed, so after going into the water a short distance you were walking amid seaweed. This was not the clear aqua waters you expect in the Caribbean. But Water was delightfully warm and we did use the beach, but it wasn't beautiful expansive sand/water like in Isla Verde. There were 2 stone jetties keeping the area nearly enclosed and waves to a minimum (we like big waves). Beach lounge chairs are set up & free on the sand (big plus) and you could rent paddle boats or kayaks. Golf course and casino- we did not use either, But walked about the golf course because it is full of iguanas & ducks and I got lots of photos of iguanas sunning themselves - very cool! Parking: Self park is $10+tax a day in a garage a short walk away. Easy to access though. The driveway into Embassy Suites & several villa/condos is long and gated like many places in PR. Location: This was the only real negative of the Embassy Suite Dorado. We spent 2 days in the Fajardo/ El Yunque area - minimum 1 1/2 hour drive each way to this area. We ALWAYS got lost - even with our GPS - easy to miss exits. So, we did not get to do/see as much as we wanted because our travel time was so great. We did drive to Isla Verde one afternoon to swim on their gorgeous beaches, but we couldn't find any public rooms to change in, so had to use hotel's bathroom... at busier times this might be difficult. The Bacardi tour is only about 15 minutes though from the hotel and there is convenient ferry to Old San Juan from there - so that is a plus. Can' imagine staying in Puerto Rico without a rental car. In the immediate area, there are many fast food chains and several PR dining places - but would be along walk.

I have never stayed at an Embassy Suites which I didn't enjoy. First if you are looking for a good beach area, Dorado in general is not it! These realy arent swimming type beaches, go a bit further south. The young man that greeted us for our car was very friendly. The man at the desk, Israel C. was very warm and attentive, our room was not ready when we arrived, so we left our bags and went to tour the Bacardi Rum DIstillery which is about 20 minutes away! We were called on our cell phone about an hour later to tell us our room was ready. When we returned we went up to our room, the door didn't work properly, but was fixed in about 20 minutes, all very quickly and personably. The beach is nice for sitting, listening to, and day dreaming. The pool is a large area, and the children's area of the pool was very busy. The wine/drink hour was very nice, usual type fare for the Embassy. I was happy with everything I experienced and saw. I loved the beds at this property!! There is a casino which recently opened just outside the Embassy and that was fun! The morning breakfast was the usual fare, omelets, cereals, juices, etc. All very well maintained, and good service. There was nothing to complain about. We did valet parking, the young man got our car, and we were on our way about 10 minutes after we checked out!

I've always had extremely positive experiences at Embassy Suites hotels, but this one failed. It was beyond capacity and totally understaffed. We had to wait to check-in, wait for the manager's reception, wait for breakfast and then listen to kids running through the halls all hours of the night. We found that the only time to go to the pool was about 9am. We actually cut our stay short, when packs of youth baseball leagues invaded the hotel for the weekend - unbelievable. Here's one of my son's impressions: One word. CROWDED! I guess it was just a bad first impression, but I checked in, had to wait an hour for my room to be cleaned, then, once I got outside, the place was PACKED! If you wanted go into the pool and get sunburned, you couldn't. It appeared that you couldn't even make it down the steps of the pool, because the kids were just chilling there, despite the fact that the whole thing was pretty shallow. Anyways, I sat in the lobby until 5:30 when the Manger's Reception occurred. At that point I went and got some popcorn, which there was no line for. There was however, a line for the free drinks. A big line. If you've ever been in an Embassy Suites lobby, you'll know that it's huge. And the line stretched the whole way through. That night, I did manage to make it into the pool, when it was less crowded. I slept well, I guess. The only problem was that there were some people down in the lobby who probably had one too many drinks. The room quality was good, and the bathrooms were quality. Anyways, the next day, I had a delicious breakfast of pancakes and bacon and what was possibly mango juice. I never really found out, since I'm not exactly fluent in Spanish. I quickly jumped in the pool, which wasn't crowded yet. I made a day trip out to the Arecibo Observatory to get away from the crowds. I came back and enjoyed the popcorn at the Manager's Reception again, and only then did I realize the reason the facilities were so crowded! The pools and beach( which I did not use) were also shared with the Aquarius Timeshares! My family and I made a snap decision and decided to leave the next day. And I'm glad we did. Because right then 4 baseball teams showed up, and made more noise. I was able to go in the pool and relax a bit again that night, but it was still a bit crowded. I left the next morning after another pool visit, and I was kind of glad I left.

We had a great time. We were very satisfied with this hotel. I chose it because it had a seperate bedroom since we were traveling with two teen sons. They slept on the couch. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were very soft. We had oceanfront and the view was amazing. It was great to sit out on the balcony with a pina colada. I wish the rail was a little higher cause it blocked my water view but can't control that. The staff was extremely helpful and polite. The front desk staff seem to have everything you might need. If you need directions to any of the attractions, they pull out this little box and give you a small card with printed directions. I asked for those a couple of times to Fajardo and also to the rainforest. I even forgot my razor and they gave me one. The breakfast buffet was also nice. Get there early or the omelette line gets long. Otherwise you can just get the regular buffet. The beach is nice and clean. The water is green and clear. However there is alot of seaweed so you are limited at how far you can go in. If you want a really nice beach nearby go west to Cerro Gordo. You can even snorkel there. It was perfect. The pool was very nice but a little shallow. It's only 3'6\" at the deepest so my sons were a little bored. It is very big and is usually full but if you just like to sit and relax then it's perfect. I didn't use the golf course but it looked very beautiful and you can actually see iguanas when you drive by. It was so cool! The casino was nice. Small but just big enough to take all my money. :) The parking garage is behind the casino so you have to walk a little to get to the hotel unless you want to pay $18 for valet.

My wife and I have just returned from Puerto Rico staying April 6-15. The staff at this resort is by far their best feature. I can go on and on with the names of staff that made our vacation so wonderful that I know I would leave someone out ,but the following personnel need to be commended : I have been told that the first 6 seconds you meet someone it has a lasting impression that takes a long time to overcome if it is a negative one. This definitely not the case at the Embassy Suites Dorado. When we rode down the lane to the resort and were met and greeted by Juan Carlos Ramos; he made you feel like you were relatives coming home to visit! His help and positive attitude all week were beyond any bell captain I have seen. There were other visitors staying there that expressed these same feelings to me as well. Other staff that stood out and deserve accolades are Garry Rodriquez, Lisa Negron, those at the golf course, those serving in Paradise Restaurant, Happy Hour workers, and like I said ,many more at the resort! So, as you can tell, I think the quality , helpfulness, and friendliness of the staff, in which they all work multiple dutie ,ranks the highest in my opinion!! Next, the grounds are immaculate! I can walk out the front door and play golf on one of the most beautiful and challenging golf courses in Puerto Rico. I could walk out the back entrance and lounge on a beautiful beach or the infinity swimming pool which is perfectly landscaped! Also on the property, there is a new casino for those gaming types that wish to put down a wager. The Blue Seahorse Grill is by the swimming pool and you can get any type drink or food you desire. It is like you really do not have to leave the property if you do not want to ; it is all right here. The large rooms are very clean and are taken care of daily! I can go on forever about the service, but the staff here are worker bees and so friendly to go with it. 2 Plasma tvs in the suites, mini bar, closet space, great beds and tremendous view on the 6th floor!!

There are lots of restaurants and shops right out side the hotel.

We were going to be in Puerto Rico for only 5 days, and just HAD to stay at the Embassy Suites in Dorado, again! Our prior stay was short and sweet, and we vowed to come back again. The drive from San Juan airport to Dorado is about 30 - 45 minutes depending on traffic conditions. There is a $1.00 toll if you take route 22 west to Dorado. The resort is located in the beautiful town of Dorado, within a gated community. Once you approach the security gate, they verify your purpose in entering the private community. Once passed the security gate, you drive through the beautiful golf course. You have the option to choose valet ($18 daily) or self parking ($10daily). The parking garage is located just steps from the hotel main entrance. There's a casino located between the hotel and parking garage. Our check in was a little slow due to the fact that the phones were constantly ringing and only one person working the front desk. They validate your parking ticket on the first day for your entire stay, so that you can come and go as you please for the one $10 per day parking fee. The Resort is very clean, and well maintained. Our room was on the second floor, and even though we were just above ground level, we had a great partial view of the ocean. Our room was very clean and well lit. We had only one king size bed, and a pull out sofa bed for the kids. There are two flat screen TVs in the suite, one mini refrigerator, coffee maker, and microwave. On our first night, we drove to a town called Aguadilla which is located on the west end of the island, and its about a 2 hour drive with a handful of tolls, none being more than about $1.00 On our second day, we enjoyed the amenities of the resort, which included the 3 pools, kids play area and water sports. The pool was very clean, and well maintained. It is a heated pool which made it even better!!! The resort gives all there guest tickets for two free water bottles per day for the entire stay. You also get a daily bracelet that you must wear to identify you as a guest of the hotel while using the pool. My husband rented a small padel boat for $15 (30 minutes) which is enough time. The beach is very clean, and with no waves (safe for kids) Every night the 5:30pm - 7:30pm, the resort holds a managers reception in which you can get free drinks and snacks for everyone. Drinks include a variety of liquor and beer. The snacks include popcorn and tortilla chips with salsa. Drinks are unlimited during this two hour reception. We always tipped the bartender as a nice gesture. During our stay we had a terrible rainstorm sweep over Dorado, causing a lot of flooding which affected the resort pool and laundry facilty in the lower level. As a result, the pool was shut down from Tuesday night til about Friday afternoon. The Resort arranged FREE trolley tours of Dorado for those guest that were inconvenienced. We dined at the hotel restaurant on the night of the heavy rainstorm, because of the severe local flooding conditons. I have to admit, that I a little disappointed with our waiter because of the poor service we received and the over priced food. There's a local restaurant within walking or driving distance of the resort which sells PuertoRican cuisine that is very delicious, and very inexpensive. We dined there on our last trip to Dorado and so we had to go again during this trip. Breakfast was excellent throughout our stay, a wide selection of choices and omelletes made to order.

The traffic into San Juan is crazy and we didn't want to deal with it. Now if you are interested in scuba diving this isn't the hotel to stay at. I did not realize this at the time but it is a real trek to go. It took 2 1/2 hours each way to get to the dive boat. The hotel is wonderful for a relaxing stay at the beach but not well located for other options.

We had a great time and really enjoyed the hotel. It is in a gated community, and seemed very secure. They have a casino that we walked past, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. Some reviews complained about parking, but they now have a very nice garage with plenty of spaces. The 3 things we like best about Embassy Suites are the Suites, the breakfast, and the evening cocktails. All 3 delivered. The suite was big enough for the 4 of us (couple and 2 teenage sons). The hotel was very clean and in good shape. The balcony was great. Only had 2 chairs, but there was plenty of room for 4 when we brought out 2 of the dinette chairs. The maid service was a little slow, but thet eventually cleaned our room and brought fresh towels every day. The breakfast was very busy over the Presidents Day weekend. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the comments about 45 min waits. The longest we waited for omelets was 20 min and that was only once. After the holiday weekend, the wait was 5-10 min. The breakfast was good (your typical Embassy Suites breakfast). They could have a better selection of fresh fruit. In a tropical location, it was a little disappointing. The evening reception was fine. Again the lines were long on the holiday weekend (10-15 min). The rest of the week it was 0-5 min. The drinks were good (beer, wine, and medium level liquor). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect Dom Perignon or single malt scotch. The also have soda and juice. The food was very basic (chips & Salsa and popcorn) The pool area was great. It has a large general pool and smaller kiddie pool. The main pool is actually 3 sections. It was a little chilly, but refreshing in the 80 deg weather. On the holiday weekend, people stacked out chairs with towels early. After that we made sure to stake out our chairs after breakfast, but is wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a problem anymore. There were always plenty of towels available. The beach was a little disappointing. It is a small man made cove. The water is not good for swimming (corral, seaweed, and urchins), but great for snorkeling. We saw many tropical fish. I played golf one day. The course is nice, but not world class. It never seemed crowded. I played at 3:00 and played 18 holes with cart for $50. I was lucky to get paired with a local doctor who guided me through the challenging course (lots of water and other hazards). For the most part the staff was very friendly, and helpful. A few seemed a little grouchy (especially the older man working the towel station at the pool). We would definitely recommend it for a relaxing family vacation. Not much wild nightlife.

Not your average continental breakfast, the only thing I didn't like is that you can't take the food up to your room. I understand they run the risk of getting plates etc stolen and it creates more work for the employees, but it just ends too early for a late riser, and it would have been nice if my husband could have brought up my food so that when I woke up I could have re-heated it. Oh well! Happy hour was AWESOME! The drinks were amazing, the staff was friendly, popcorn was great. Only complaint on this is that the first night we had nachos there and it had cheese, and then the rest of the week it was salsa or chili or something.

Did not eat out there, just had drinks. The pool was BEAUTIFUL and always seemed to be a good temperature. It was nice to have different levels of the pool, because we were able to have our own \"space\". Never got in the hot tub as there always seemed to be people in it. The towel guys could have been a little more friendly but you cant expect everyone to be perfect. The staff were very helpful! We had to get directions/recommendations at the front desk AT least once a day. They provided printed directions and menus, and wonderful restaurant recommendations. Even housekeeping, when we were given a not so nice looking sheet, came up and changed it immediately. The women who changed it was very angry at the staff who had put the stained sheet on the bed in the first place.

This hotel, staff and manager here were exceptional; the manager's reception staff provides speedy service on the drinks and the cooked-to-order breakfasts were delicious. We were greeted by Marisol Colon, the hotel manager and had a personalized greeting and treats in our room when we checked in. The staff and service througout our stay was exceptional, helpful and courteous including helping us get our car jump-started when we left the lights on. We came in the middle of the week and the hotel was not very full, but even over the weekends when there were numerous weddings and a very full hotel, we found the staff able to handle things well with no decline in service or attention. The lobby, atrium and reception areas, like most Embassy Suites, was inviting and nicely-maintained. The pool area is excellent with a very interesting layout and many areas to enjoy the sun. The beach area is also very nice for this side of the island because of the breakwater that has been constructed to settle down the breakers and form a very nice sandy-bottomed beach area. The temperature of the ocean and pool were nearly equal and comfortable. We had a tropical storm in the Caribbean to deal with which gave us many cloudy and some rainy days, but most days there was enough sun peaking through that we were able to get plenty of sunshine. Have seen some complaints about the cost to take a taxi. We rented a car in San Juan and monitored the prices as our trip approached and were able to rent a compact car for about $120 for a week which we would recommend for anyone staying in Dorado since it is about a half hour from San Juan. Avoid driving in or near San Juan and other sizeable towns during the normal rush hours of 7-10 am and 4-7 pm and you will be fine driving around. All in all, we had a very relaxing time and would recommend to anyone looking to find a quieter resort a bit out of the bustle of San Juan to look at this hotel.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roxbury, New York", "Title": "\u201cGolf Paradise at great Hotel was 5 star\u201d", "Author": "PenOfDen", "ReviewID": "UR87612202", "Content": "Four friends were there to play golf and the course in Nov was wide open.

The only issue I had with the timeshare people was that on two separate occasions my wife and I got solicited to come over to their information session. The hotel was a little crowded and noisy the first day because of some guests and their parents (a bus load) from a little league baseball tournament but by 12 noon the next day it calmed down considerably. Had a small issue in the bathroom but maintenance and housekeeping responded quickly and professionally. Noted that I was charged 11% tax online in advance when it is actually was 9%. I was excepting a 3% credit adjustment but the front desk went further and reversed my 12% hotel resort fee for the whole stay. They are building a casino on the property not directly in the hotel (Thank God). I am a little worry that the hotel will lose its great family atmosphere but only time will tell.

I can't say enough about how nice and welcoming each staff member was to us; Spanish and English is spoken. During our stay we went to a Bio Bay (really amazing), golfing at the resort (excellent course with sunning iguanas), explored old San Juan (my girls LOVED that area for the shopping), and hit several beaches on the North and East shores.

Special kudos to whomever was handling the front desk on Thursday 8 Jul at 0620hrs, when I called to inquire about an error in my bill regarding parking charges. The gentleman who answered the phone did a quick review of my bill, noticed the error, apologized and offered complementary parking becuase of the error made by the accounting department. I did not ask for it, but he said it was the right thing to do....this to me shows treating the CUSTOMER right is the best way to go. The breakfast spread is standard Embassy Suites, which means a good breakfast that will hold you through most of the day. Although the hotel was extremely packed during out stay, I say the staff did a great job flowing people through the breakfast line as quickly as possible and ensuring tables were cleaned relatively quickly. Same for the manager's reception cocktail hr (2hrs). Quick flow-through allowed my wife and I to enjoy a few drinks and relax prior to dinner. Although the hotel now charges a resort fee of 12%/day, If you get a room in the $120.00 range, the 12% is pretty much made back with the breakfast and cocktailsyou recieve (based on two individuals in a party). Pool was extremely busy, but for the most part we got there early enough in the morning to have a lounge chair. Exercise room was decent, although two of the three treadmills were non-operational. Overall noise from the construction going on with the casino being built in the property was minimal and even with us staying in a front facing room near the construction area. Now the negatives/cons: The hotel, specially the room we stayed in (I assume this is across the board) is showing wear. This is our second visit to this property in 5 years and the furnishings inside the room were identical to what was there in 2004-05 time-frame. Our room sofa had stains and slight tearing along the seams were beginning to show. Bathroom needs re-caulking along tub and toilet areas as those become extremely \"gritty\" with dirt and begin to look nasty if you don't do so, specially in a sandy/beach environment. Also walls int the room, specially where the small table with three chairs are in the living/eating area need painting due to large scuff marks which take away from the cleanliness of the room. Recommendation for manager -- do a cursory walk through rooms and see if what I am detailing is across the board of just one isolated room so that it can be addressed in a planned manner. Places to eat: There is a great Reposteria (Bakery) just 1 mile from the main gate of the resort (make right at the traffic light and look for the Popeyes chicken and it is in the complex right next to Popeyes) -- do not be fooled by thinking this is just a Bakery...in a reality it is a full service restuarant which had some incredible dinner offerings at a much lower price than I expected. They have a full compliment of wines, beer, and liquor along with some of the best desserts I've had on the island. Dinner for two (with 2 local beers, and 1 dessert) came out to $39.00 with tax. Overall: Would likely stay again, but only with proof that rooms have been \"updated\".

Although there did seem to be \"security\" people, they did not regulate who was and was not a guest at the resort.

The guests at the Time Share portion had on wrist bands to be able to eat the breakfast at the Embassy Suites, so there was no \"Wonderful\" breakfast at anytime in this facility, it was always crowded and the food was cold because of the large quantity they had to prepare.

Here are some comments regarding our trip: 1) We rented a car. I would recommend this because there are lots of restaurants in Dorado including low cost places like McDonalds, KFC, and Subway. There is also a grocery store, so we stocked our fridge in the room with drinks and snacks. 2) We drove to the rain forest and visited the bioluminescent bay. It was a long day for the kids (ages 4 and 5), but they had a blast. It was well worth the drive. 3) The hotel pools (I think there were five in all) were great! None of the water was over the kids' head, so that made me feel better, but I did stay very close and keep an eye on them. If they were a bit older, say 8 or 9, I would have felt comfortable relaxing in a lounge chair because none of the water is over 4 ft. My kids absolutely loved the pool area and would have stayed there the whole time we were on vacation if we had let them. The pool was open 24 hours a day. Try to get out there by 10 am or so to get a spot under the cabana. 4) The beach area is okay. It was clean, and they had paddleboats, which looked really fun. 5) The food in the restaurant was good, and the free made-to-order breakfast was great! It was well worth getting up a little early to beat the crowd. 6) It was a short drive to the ferry over to Old San Juan. My kids really liked visiting the town. Overall, we loved this hotel. We are Hilton Diamond members, and we had enough points to stay anywhere on the island, and we chose this location (even over the Waldorf Astoria El Conquistador!) because of the friendly employees and great service. I was so impressed by how nice everyone was, and that friendliness even extended off the property. We ran into one of the front desk staff at the Fort, and she was just as sweet and kind to us there as she was on the job.

We were not excited about driving all the way to Dorado (1/2 hour from the airport) with 2 young kids that late at night. Unfortunately no amount of begging would help. I was told by the main reservation center and Henry the night manager that I would still be charged 1 night's stay. So I gave up. A few days later with our GPS and a few wrong turns we finally made our way to the hotel,,arrival time 1.45am.,,did I mention the few wrong turns? :)... The room was nice with all the usual amenities. I was not \"WOW'ed\" by the breakfast, but it was free, so can't complain. Most of the staff were friendly but nothing I can really commend the hotel for. I've been to resorts in Jamaica and other places where you'd swear the staff faces hurt from smiling all day and stopping to interact with the kids. None of that at this resort. One staff member at Dorado del Mar (Israel at the front desk) was very very friendly and helpful, he made up for the haughtiness of some of the others. My biggest disappointment was the beach, NO ONE could bathe at the beach of this \"Beach resort\", rocky sand and mucky seaweed nixed that idea in a hurry, you have to drive to another beach. The manager explained that the tide brought the seaweed in. Nothing they can control of course, but I wish I had known before booking. There were no planned kid's activities. The General manager herself was pleasant and interacted with the guests which was refreshing. The manager's reception in the evenings were a nice touch although the drinks were very light. Overall I \"might\" stay there again, because Dorado turned out to be a peaceful place to stay outside of the city, and the kids LOVED the pool, but we felt like we were missing out on the excitement Puerto Rico promises. One thing that did resonate was a previous reviewer's comment that the resort was a hang out for the locals. There is an ownership/timeshare part to this resort so I assume everyone else besides the few of us with a wrist band (given at check in) were the owners and all their friends/guests.

The pool is cleaned every morning and the beach is cleaned as well. The pool is only 3' 6\" deep and has a bar and food available. The pool also had a play area and a pool for younger children. The pool is shared by another property but was not crowded at all. The beach does not belong to Embassy Suites as all beaches in Dorado are public. The hotel does take care of the beach by cleaning it and providing chairs. We found the beach to be clean and the water to be very clean. The manager's reception is a nice touch. They had pop corn and tortilla chips every night. They had wine, beer and mixed drinks. No frozen drinks! We also enjoyed the breakfast which had plenty of choices for a breakfast which was included in the rate. My wife got a massage by Joann, which she loved. Self-park is not an issue! It is very close to the main entrance and someone is always at the entrance to the parking lot. Isaias was great! He was extremly helpful in giving directions, suggesting restaurants and always had a smile on his face. He even asked if I could think of anything negative about the hotel as we were checking out. The other staff was also great! Dorado has many fast food restaurants (taco bell, pizza hut, kfc, burger king), Starbucks, CVS Rx, Baskin Robins and more. We did take the 5 minute ferry from Catano to Old San Juan. This was nice except the ferry station is not very well marked. This is definitely better than driving to Old San Juan.

They could go to bed at their normal bedtime on the pull out couch & my hubby & I could still enjoy the balcony off our bedroom. Though I read the pool was open 24 hrs, we never heard excess noise. The pool area is wonderful for families of all ages. Having small children, we stayed on the kids side where there is a zero-entry to the pool as well as a smaller pool with fountains, and a small playgroudn in between. My kids LOVED this area! There's also plenty of shady spots around the pool if you've gotten too much sun. The beach is fantastic for small kids too since the rock reef breaks the waves well before they hit the beach. The staff was all very helpful! We liked that they had printed directions to all the places we planned to visit. We had a GPS, but it was nice having a \"backup.\" Our day trips included Pinones in Loiza, Ponce, El Camuy caverns (be sure to hit Heladaria Lares after for ice cream flavors featured on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern), El Yunque rainforest (don't miss the 1/2 mi path back to the falls you can't see from the road - ask the guide at El Portal), Loquillo Beach, and the walking night tour of Las Cabezas and the bioluminescent bay - Laguna Grande.

This was the best hotel that we have ever stayed at. They had great rooms. One thing I noticed is that the rooms were quiet - most hotels are noisy until very late at night - but this one was always very quiet and great for sleeping in! The breakfast was awesome - so much variety and very good food. I agree with another poster that they might want to extend the breakfast hours until at least 10:00 am because we had to wake up early just to make it to breakfast. It is in a very safe location and the employees were all helpful and spoke great English! That means alot when you are in a place that is primarily spanish speaking. The pool is huge and so nice. You can have tons of people in there and still find a little spot away from everyone. The beach is nice as well! Everything was clean and comfortable. The only negatives were that the rooms were cleaned really late. We had come back from a day out at the beach (very sunburned and really tired) about 3:30 one afternoon and really wanted to take a quick nap but they were cleaning our room and we had to wait for about 30 minutes until they were finished. Also the resort fee is really high (about $105 plus parking) and would have not been so bad if we had taken advantage of the things that it is supposed to cover.....but my husband and I don't drink so happy hour meant nothing to us and we don't play tennis so we didn't use the courts either. We did get a couple of free waters but we could have bought those for much less money somewhere else!

I read hundreds of comments about all kinds of hotels and decided to pick this one because it had consistently positive remarks overall. So here is what I really thought about it all... 1. The grounds are beautiful and very tropical looking - great for pictures. This hotel is in a compound of sorts which means that only people who are supposed to be on the property are there, which is nice from a safety perspective. 2. The hotel is very clean in the common areas. My boyfriend did the one finger swipe several times and never could find dust. They also have a hand sanitizer right at the elevator which I like because I am a little leary of germs with so many people around. It did take a while for the room to be cleaned - think 2pm to 3pm. 3. The rooms are nice. The sofa in our room had a big stain on it that looked like coke or some kind of drink. It could stand to be replaced. I loved the private room area and the bed was fantastic. I drifted away to heaven the first night in that bed after a long day of traveling. The fridge and microwave were a nice touch and will help you save money. 4. We had a view of the pool area from our balcony, which was nice. And if I crooked my neck to the side I could see the ocean. We had a meal on the balcony one day and that was cool. I spilled some juice on the balcony table but the cleaning people never wiped that down. 5. The breakfast was good each time we had it, but we missed it a couple of days because we partied the night before and it closes down at 9:30am. I feel like they should review the hours that the breakfast and happy hours are offered. I am on vacation, I don't necessarily want to get up by 8:30am just to make breakfast before it closes at 9:30. Also, if you do anything away from the resort, it is dang near impossible to get back before 5:30 when the happy hour begins. It does go on for two hours though. 6. You will not find a nicer staff in my opinion. Everyone was very friendly and graciously answered all of our questions. Giberto the bartender was my favorite and he made sure that we were taken care of on our trip. I don't know what we would have done without him! 7. We ate lunch at the pool hut - 2 orders of hotdogs and french fries and 3 alcoholic beverages ran us $41. No lie. It was a very big hotdog and the drinks were good, but good lawd! 8. Stay away from the Gift Shop! Can anybody say overpriced? And what got me the most was that they did not have one postcard that was not a picture of their hotel. Come on people! There is more to the island than where I am staying. Am I the only person who still sends postcards??? :) Things nobody will tell you but me... 1. You NEED a car - Dorado is nice, but is in the suburbs. There is nothing to do outside of the resort area. If you are looking for night time excitement you must leave Dorado. 2. Try a mofongo (Puerto Rican specialty) but BRING THE ROLAIDS! The food is a richer and they use a lot of spices and grease. 3. Take some mini liquors with you. And a trip to the local grocery will also help your pocket. Don't expect coupons or deals in America to apply on this island. The $10 Pizza Hut deal? Yeah right! We spent $33 on a large specialty pizza, a med pepperoni and a 2 liter Pepsi. And look at your receipts. They charged us for 2 Pepsis but I only ordered one and they only brought one. 4. Take advantage of the \"complimentary\" waters. It is hot and you will need it. 5. A GPS navigation system is a MUST! I don't know what I would have done without my Susan! I did not get good directions from anybody while I was there. The street signs are also in Spanish and beware of one way streets - they look a little different and are not adequately marked.. I ended up getting pulled over for driving the wrong way down a one way and being in the bus lane (which was headed against the one way and was not marked). Thankfully the cops just laughed at me and helped me turn around. Oh, and there are like 55 different sets of cops on this island. I couldn't keep up! And the police and ambulance always have their lights on, so don't be alarmed or move to the side until you hear a siren. 6. Take your Spanish dictionary. You will find a lot of people don't speak English once you leave the resort area. Thankfully I speak and read Spanish fairly well and was able to communicate. My boyfriend, on the other hand would have been lost without me. 7. Oh and expect to spend more money on the hotel than you have paid already. If you take a car you will be hit with a $7 per day parking fee. You will also have a $14-15 charge per day for a resort fee which includes your \"complimentary\" waters, internet services, access to the tennis courts, etc.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, beautiful grounds, nice family getaway\u201d", "Author": "hockeyfamily20", "ReviewID": "UR59060901", "Content": "This was our first visit to Puerto Rico and we're already planning our next! We are a family of five, our children are 15, 9, and 8. We decided to book here after reading reviews of several hotels in Puerto Rico. This property had the best reviews in our price range. We were very happy with our experience. PROS: *Friendly staff - Everyone we encountered was friendly - front desk at check in, breakfast staff, evening reception staff, housekeeping staff, restaurant servers, bar tenders, even the towel stand at the pool - It's been a very long time we've stayed somewhere where every employee was friendly - This made our experience so much better. We had asked for extra towels (there are 5 of us) from the girl who cleaned our room the first day and we were left extra towels every day of stay without having to ask again. *Room - We booked a room with 2 double beds - the boys shared a bed and our teenager slept on the pull out coach - This was very convenient - Most of the time as a family of 5 someone ends up sleeping on the floor - The pull out couch made our teenager very happy - We had a partial ocean view from our balcony and really enjoyed that *Breakfast - WOW! What an amazing meal we had each morning! Food cooked to order, so many choices, and the staff served it with a smile. Items were replaced quickly if they were getting low, there was never a time where they wer out of something. It was a wonderful way to start off every morning. Pool & Beach - Amazing!!! We could position our chairs and watch the kids on the beach AND in the pool. They are steps away from each other. Our kids were too big for the little kids play area (although they did go down the slides a couple of times) but I still thought that was a great touch. There were plenty of chairs, even during busy hours. The pool was clean and the beach offered a beautiful view. And the kids enjoyed playing the giant connect four game, too. We were on vacation to do nothing but relax, and this was definitely the place for that! Evening Reception - The nachos and salsa were good, the free drinks were nice, and the kids loved the popcorn. Dinner in the restaurant/cafe - The food portions were huge, and I felt the kids meals were reasonably priced - The food was good, the service was excellent. CONS (very few) *The Italian restaurant was closed for construction, so that left little choice for meals - This should have been noted on the website or mentioned at check in *Lunch service at the pool side bar/restaurant was very slow and the food was a bit pricey and only average *It took a very long time every day for our room to be cleaned - we would leave early, go to breakfast, and then spend until 1 or 2 o'clock at the pool and return to our room to find it still not cleaned *Dinner in the restaurant/cafe was pricey, but the kids meal prices were worth it with due to portion sizes *Items in the shop (sun block, etc) were VERY over priced *The additional resort fee added to the bill is a little high - It might be better to just raise the room rate a little bit. I think adding this additional fee at check out kind of leaves you on a negative note. All in all, it was a very relaxing stay for all of us a family.

I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take enough photos. There are plenty of lounge chairs around the pool, on the lush green lawn and on the beach. Complimentary towels and bottled water are abundant. We ran into the manager the second morning; we saw a well dressed woman in the breakfast area helping people find tables, walking briskly in and out of the kitchen, and even cleaning tables. We introduced ourselves and complimented her on her hotel. She even graciously arranged a late check-out so that we could enjoy an extra hour or two at this great resort. Advise: If you want to save a few bucks, rent a car. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too expensive for cab fare and rental cars are cheap. My only Con: the $7/day self park wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have seemed unreasonable if the driveway condition to the parking lot was in better shape. There was no sidewalk so you had to play hopscotch around the many rain filled potholes. It seemed as if the parking lot was an after thought since it was so uncharacteristic in comparison to the rest of the well maintained hotel. But you could pay double (plus tips) and have your car valet parked. Overall, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine a better value in all of Puerto Rico. Our experience couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been better. We will definitely be back. We just hope that Ms. Colon is still running the hotel when we return.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cA Toddler's Paradise...and Good For Parents Too...\u201d", "Author": "Cincy_World_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR58527781", "Content": "Recently we stayed here for a week with our 20-month old. I think some of the more negative reviews may have stayed in one of the older rooms. We arrived late at night and were given a room that looked outdated and somewhat worn. The air conditioner had a very musty smell that is unfortunately common in many hotels that are located in tropical climates. I spend about 20% of my nights per year in hotels, so I sensed that this was a room where I did not want to waste a week of my time. I contacted the front desk and asked for a room change. They weren't able to make a change until the morning, so we went to sleep. We woke up sneezing in the morning from the musty air. We were contacted by the manager the next day around 8:30/9AM and offered a different room. This room smelled fine and looked like it had been recently refurbished, noted by the presence of flat-screen TVs (previous room had old tube TVs - see pictures, unfortunately I did not take any pics of the new room!). So, suffice it to say, problem corrected and we were happy room-wise with the rest of our stay. I would like to add that the hotel staff in general was very accommodating and customer service-oriented (although housekeeping seemed a little slow - we'd spend the morning at the pool, returning around 2PM and sometimes the room had not been serviced yet). It is true that the breakfast room can be very busy at times - there was a day or two where we had to wait quite long for the cooked-to-order (CTO) breakfast. Unfortunately, the \"ready-to-eat\" hot section is right in front of CTO, so inveritably if you just want to grab some scrambled eggs or pancakes, you have to politely push your way thru the line of people waiting for their CTO. The food is fine and pretty much the same as any other Embassy Suites. They seemed to have plenty of high chairs available although make sure you bring a wipe since some are not very thoroughly cleaned. We spent most of our time by the pool. It did not seem too crowded when we were there, since we could always find lounge chairs available. This pool is a toddler's paradise, because it has one section that is like a very shallow beach. The depth is extremely gradual and our toddler could walk-in about 15 feet before the water level was up to her neck (obviously, we were right there, but the point is that she could choose the depth where she was comfortable). There is also a separate kiddie pool with a fish fountain and a decent-sized playground. I remember some previous reviews showed a picture of a rickety old-school playground. That must be gone, since there is now a nice, modern plastic-based playground with a cushioned surface (the only thing I don't understand, and this goes for all plastic playgrounds, is that the slides are not shaded. Which means they get way too hot for use when it is sunny - and the Puerto Rican sun is strong.) Honestly, our toddler did not want to leave since she was enjoying herself so much (and it appeared that other families with babies/pre-schoolers were having a good time). Food at the pool bar was pretty good...it is very enticing when they fire up the grill mid-morning and you smell burgers being cooked. Most sandwiches seemed to be in the $8-10 range - I'd say the menu pricing (incl. drinks) was approximately the same as any mid-priced chain like Applebees. If you're a cheapskate, I guess you could drive to one of the many fast food joints at the entrance to the complex (about a 5 minute drive thru the golf course over many speed bumps). Besides fast food, there are several sit-down eating options outside the golf course complex - just ask the front desk for the list/map (BTW - there is a wonderful pastry shop/restaurant called \"Sweet Ann's\".) The beach is an artificial cove created by a breakwater. The view is great because the Atlantic seems to generate a lot of waves, so you see them constantly hitting the rocks outside the cove. Beach itself was OK, but if you're expecting sugar white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, this is not your beach. To clarify, the water quality is fine and many people seemed to be enjoying it, but I have simply been to better beaches in south Florida, Thailand, south Pacific, etc. The manager's reception in the evening is quite good, better than many Embassy Suites that I have visited previously, with complimentary beer, wine, and mixed drinks. They have non-alcoholic selections (juice, cola, etc.) as well including \"kiddie cocktails\" but curiously, you can only get milk if you pay for it. Snacks were chips/salsa and popcorn. The TV selection was good, they have local channels as well as the American networks. Although the resort fee is annoying, it purportedly covers the \"complimentary\" bottled water tickets and \"free\" internet access. Hilton's web site clearly stated the resort fee up-front and I think that the total price paid was still a good value considering what is included (breakfast, mgr's reception, bottled water rations, internet). All in all - I would definitely stay here again if the price was right. If you're looking for a nice family place for relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of San Juan, this is it. One tip, though...if you have a flight before 10AM, I would leave about 3 hours before the departure time.

From the hotel, if you have a car, it was very easy for us to get to El Yunque (about 1 hour drive) and Old San Juan (about 30 mins to the ferry at Catano). The only downside for us is that we are vegetarians, and the food choices beyond breakfast were slim to none. The pool bar had one veggie wrap and the lobby bar had a cheese quesadilla, but that was it. We eneded up going into town a few times for dinner, but a lot of the choices there were just fast food.

A little variety would be nice. But all of these are insignificant, compared to the lovely grounds, the pool and beach area, which are well-maintained, the evening cocktail hour, and the overall friendly and accommodating staff, which did everything possible to give us a memorable experience.

There are a variety of pools at the area. It is a \"Hidden Gem\" and a \"Great Value\". Maids, front service and all personnel service exceeded my expectations. The interior of the hotel is great. Nice sitting area around the fountains. For those looking for a casino, they are building one just across the street but at the right distance away from the hotel as to maintain the peaceful environment of the area. The beach area is very private and inviting and the water is tranquil. The sandy beach is separated from the pool area by a stone wall. The pool area is a little bit higher than the beach sand where you can seat and enjoy the view from above. Regarding dinning, there is no need to eat outside the hotel area. We enjoyed very much the evening 1 1/2 or 2 hours daily of free happy hour in the bar area. Fine dinning is offered. Hot Breakfast Buffet with served to order omelet is complimentary. During the day you can eat by the pool area and in the evening they serve more formal dishes inside. Price is very reasonable, even more economical than restaurants outside.

The hotel is beautiful and clean, the grounds have lush vegetation, indoor atrium is bright with tables to relax at, and it had all the amenities we were looking for. The included daily breakfast buffet was convenient and very good with numerous choices, had great omelettes, and everything we needed. The free daily nightly Manager's reception was an excellent plus to wind down after an active day. We had a rental car and went to several good Dorado restaurants at night, as recommended by the front desk. We ate at Villa Dorada D'Alberto and our favorite for several visits was \"Antojitos del Kitrinche\". Sure, self parking at the hotel was a challenge at times due to the construction but this is a temporary inconvenience and the staff always and quickly offered valet parking to us. We did not find this an issue. The beach area is protected by a rock reef and is great for easy and safe swimming - a nice idea. It's not a long calm beach as some tourists expect, but that's because you're on the active north coast of the island with big waves. The pool was broken up nicely into different sections and we enjoyed it. Yes, there were kids but the security staff stopped any diving or unruly behavior. Our room was a clean bright beautiful 2-room suite with a great balcony and everything we wanted; we loved it. The free daily bottled water and coffee was a nicety. We were very fortunate to meet Hotel Manager Marisol Colon during our stay - she's warm and personable, is very visible around the hotel, is on top of things, greeted us several times during our stay, and will recommend or assist you during your stay if given the opportunity, as she helped us.

I'm sure there are some legitimate complaints about noise, long lines, crowded areas and unruly groups during the peak holiday vacation breaks, but this can be said of any resort at their busiest times. That's why we travel at quieter times and when school is in session. As at any hotel, there are small places and off-peak times that you can find to get away from the crowds. We did not have an opportunity to play on the resort's golf course but hope to next time. Reading back on these reviews - I think some travelers will always complain about any thing, especially if it's a little different than what they are use to at home so put those negative comments into perspective. And many of the travelers are vacationing during the busiest times of the year when everyone else is traveling too and the resorts are packed. Don't miss out on a great resort with great staff !

Our two-room ocean-view suite had obviously been done over recently and was clean, bright, and modern. The pool area was delightful and not crowded; there's a small beach with a breakwater that gives you a terrific view of the crashing surf, but is protected, so good for swimming and wading. There's a poolside bar and restaurant with excellent food, drinks and service for lunch. The location is not bad, near the town of Dorado, in a gated golf community. Outside the gates are all the comforts of \"home\" with a Walgreens, several chain restaurants, but also some nice local restaurants. You DEFINITELY need to rent a car at the airport; there is nothing in walking distance and your cab trips to and from the airport will cover the cost of a car for a week, I'm sure (Look out for aggressive drivers and incomprehensible traffic patterns island-wide). Our favorite restaurants were a local Benihana-type place, \"The Chop House,\" a family owned casual steak place called \"The Crazy Bull Steak House,\" and a lovely restaurant with outdoor dining called \"La Terraza\". All were recommended by the hotel, which provided detailed maps and called ahead for us. That brings us to the greatest selling point of the hotel, the incredibly personable and helpful staff. Everyone we dealt with, from our check in to the restaurant to the pool security could not have done enough for us. But special mention goes to General Manager Marisol Colon, who greeted us (we'd seen her quoted here on Trip Advisor) and made us feel like old friends, and to front desk manager Isaias Rodriguez. In additioning to making excellent food and sightseeing recommendations, we had a bit of a crisis on our third day: I came down with an ear infection.

Gettin in pool or going to beach is just outside of our room was real nice specially in 90+ temperatur. Excellant golf course. Israel - morning agent was great help in finding all direction that we need to do our sitseeing. Having printed direction at fingertip made our driving around Purto Rico much easier. Breakfast - Hot breakfast every morning with order to cook omlett was great - even if I had to wait in line for 10 minute or so.... it is well worth over precook breakfast. I strongly recomend for those who do not mind driving little and save lot! During our stay we interface number of employee in different area - from restaurant to pool to parking lot. Everyone is well trained to serve their guest. Finally we got to meet GM- Marisol Colon as we were checking out. Her personality made me believe why rest of her staff is so friendly and helpfull.

Also, I had a rental car and so never hired taxis etc. I was at the hotel from Tuesday until the following Monday. The hotel is up its own semi-private (gated) drive and you drive past/through the golf course. (I don't play golf so I can't say if it's a good course or not but it looked very nice.) There was some building work going on at the hotel because they're building a new casino as well as a multi-story parking lot. There was very little construction noise even though my room was a golf-course view room which slightly faced the construction site. The only minor problem was parking but that was handled as well as could be expected under the circumstances. I never had any problems with it. The hotel staff were always very helpful and accommodating. The complimentary cooked breakfast was extensive and very good and we sometimes also has a couple of free cocktails in the evening. I didn't sample the restaurant. The hotel did get full up at the weekend and the parking lot was displayed as \"full\" but as a hotel guest I didn't have a problem. The breakfast area did get very busy at the weekend but was managed well by the staff. If you want a quieter time, they have the busy/quiet times displayed on a sign. I did go to the pool and beach on the Monday (see photos) so I don't know how it was over the weekend but there didn't seem to be many (young) children running around so I don't think it would have been overcrowded. I often used the WiFi in my room and was getting DSL-type speeds (e.g. 0.52Mbps down and 0.25Mbps up). The suite was very spacious and for the two of us we had room to spare. I know it's probably a little over-the-top to give 5 stars for everything at the hotel but really, I didn't have a problem with anything and also the rate I paid was very reasonable. The local town of Dorado seems to have a bit of a night life but again, I didn't sample it. This was my first trip to Puerto Rico. My girlfriend recently moved back there - temporarily - to help look after a sick relative and so I had a great excuse to visit! The location was excellent for me as she's near Arecibo and so I didn't want to stay at a San Juan hotel (which is about an hour further away from her). Being a native English speaker (Brit) without almost any Spanish, I have to say that Puerto Rico was a very \"easy\" destination compared to somewhere such as Mexico or Spain because not only is there no money conversion problem (because it's all U.S. currency) but many of the businesses are familiar (e.g. WalMart, Home Depot, Burger King etc.) and many of the smaller businesses have signs just in English! (e.g. \"Hair Salon\", \"Nails\"). Of course, having a Spanish-speaker with me most of the time did sometimes come in useful because - obviously - not all the people speak English, although a good proportion seem to understand it.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cvery nice stay\u201d", "Author": "TheGreatGlynns", "ReviewID": "UR48152005", "Content": "We stayed at the Embassy Suite while visiting family in Vega Baja.

We researched alot of hotels before choosing a more budget friendly hotel, the Embassy Suites with their advertised breakfast included and happy hour each day. However, we arrived on a Saturday on what we found out later was the equivalent of P.R.'s 4th of July celebration. I literally cannot describe how many people were packed into our hotel's swimming pool, beach area, and the hotel itself. Children running around the entire hotel screaming constantly, people getting on and off the elevators soaking wet, lines for the happy hour were long and if you went to breakfast anytime after 7:30 in the morning the lines were ridiculously long. It also felt like we were fighting for our food and tables every morning at bkfst. Not relaxing at all. We like kids and families but this was beyond anything we thought it would be. We did not know the timeshares/condos shared our pool and the entire week we were there they were constantly overrun with tons of people. The pool stayed open 24/7 while we were there but we only got in twice because there were so many kids in it and the water looked \"murky\". Never got in the beach/ocean at our hotel. Also, the hotel was definitely where people from Puerto Rico take their vacations, not a tourist hotel at all. On the plus side, if there was one, all of the staff was very friendly, the valet parking was extremely quick when requesting our car every day, and the room was nice and clean. Great view of the ocean from our room. However, for a first time visitor to P.R. I would not recommend this hotel.

The hotel was easy to find with the help of GPS. Parking will cost you 7 dollars a day. It did not seem too bad of a deal, but it should be part of the room rate if you ask me. What did make me mad was on friday, saturday, and sunday the hotel becomes very busy and full with several events in the ball rooms. I was forced to park several blocks away along a golf course. For 7 bucks you should not have to walk several blocks away just to park along a road. I am glad it was a rental car because parking along a golf course can be very dangerous. I never had a single complaint against the staff. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They always greeted me with a smile and asked what they could do for me. The room was just what I would expect from an Embassy. We had a great view of the ocean and the pool. The room was clean and comfortable. The only thing that concerned me was that there was a black substance around the airvents. It looked like it was mold. The managers special was great. Two hours of free drinks, popcorn, and chips. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable. The breakfast was always hot and fast. We ate at the restaurant one time. The food was very good. The bill for the 3 of us was 75 dollars with tip. We bought food and the grocery store down the street and saved a lot of money. The beach turned out better than I thought. I was expecting garbage all over from the past reviewers. This was not the case. The hotel must be paying attention and have since cleaned things up. The beach is surrounded by a rock jetty so there are no waves. During high tide we were able to snorkel over the weed beds. Other reviewers were right about a couple of things. The hotel becomes busy on fridays, saturdays, and sundays with locals. The pool is very packed. We always had plenty of room on the beach. It does get noisey in the lobby on the weekendswith bands and screaming kids. The pool turned out to very nice. I did not see the broken tiles that others reviewed about so they must have did some repairs lately. One word of caution....On the weekends they have several events in their ballrooms. The band/dj played until 1 a.m. I found this to be unexceptable for a hotel. We had spent the day surfing in Rincon and were very tired on saturday night, but we could not sleep do to the pounding of the music. This went on until 1 in the morning. When I complained I found out that all of the rooms were sold out. They did give us a voucher for room service, refunded the night, and refunded some of my resort fees. This helped to make up for the loss of sleep. At least they were willing to work with me. I recommend renting a car with GPS. Restaurants, shopping, and other beaches are not within walking distance.

Upon arrival, first impression of the grounds were favorable, although we were turned off to the fact that the resort is in the middle of residential property. The golf course is not well maintained, but playable none the less. We checked in with ease; staff was pleasant. This is a family friendly hotel, so couples or adults who don't want alot of screaming kids running around, should go elsewhere!! We got to our room, and were disappointed with the view. We paid alot for a partial oceanview room and we got a room overlooking the employee parking lot, with the ocean to the left. For the money we paid for this room, we could have gotten a full ocean view in Mexico (which is where we would have gone if it were'nt for the Swine flu epidemic!) After we were settled in our room, we went to take advantage of the manager's reception. I must say, that the 2 hours of free drinking made up for alot of the resort's shortcomings. We arrived on Friday afternoon, and there was live entertainment every Friday and Saturday in the hotel bar which was nice. The full service free breakfast was very good and also made up for the resort's shortfalls. The waitstaff was pleasant and very accomodating. Now, on to the pool area... The resort's pool is in desperate need of repair. There were broken tiles (which could pose a safety issue as there were lots of kids at the resort). The pool could have been cleaner, but with the sweltering temperature, we took advantage. A couple of feet from the pool is a small beach which is public. The beach grounds were dirty and not maintained. There were lots of shady characters there, and we did'nt feel safe, which was a turn off for us. The beach was very disappointing!! The resort has a poolside bar that serves food as well. The bar area was overrun by crows and pigeons and lots of bird poop! We tried to overlook it, but it's kinda hard when a bird is taking a dump on the empty seat next to you!!! In spite of that, we still kept an open mind. Be careful when it comes to ordering drinks, there are no prices for many of the drinks listed on their drink list. My husband and I were hit with a $75.00 bar bill for 2 pitchers of Sangria!!!! Needless to say, from that moment on, we waited for the free drinks from 5:30 to 7:30!!! The food at the poolside bar was nothing special as was the case in the only resturant at the resort; which by the way has about the same menu as the bar. There are local restuarants within 5 miles that are authentic cuisine, as well as some familiar fast food and convenience stores. If you can read spanish, rent a car!!! Taxicabs are ridiculously priced; $45-65 from the airport and anywhere else you want to go. We took an excursion to Old San Juan and it cost us $90 round trip!!! Keep in mind if you rent a car, the resort charges $7 to park in addition to the 10% resort fee that they tack onto your bill upon checkout. We prepaid for our trip, but upon checkout, they charged us an additional $70 in resort fees and taxes!!!! In summary, for the money we paid for a 4-nite getaway, we really should have gotten more for our money. We had better expectations for a resort that has the Embassy Suites/Hilton name. The Hilton Corporate headquarters should be ashamed embarrassed to claim this resort as their own. We have stayed at Hilton and Embassy Suite hotels in the U.S. on numerous occasions and have always been satisfied with our accomodations. We would never have expected this resort to be in such deplorable condition. We will not recommend this resort to anyone.

Ok now on with the review. This place is far from San Jaun and cab ride one way is $70.00 but that depends on how many of you there are. We rented a car for that reason got a rental for $116.00 for the week but when I got to the counter I was told that I had to buy collision for another $98.00 can you say rip off! Ok so on to the hotel. Got there 3:30 pm they gave us a room right away which was great until we got into it. It was dirty smelled horrible and was in need of some serious TLC. Didn't want to dwell on the room we had a long flight and just wanted to get to the pool and relax. We go down to the pool first thing I notice is that it is in disrepair. Tiles missing or broken all around the sides( nice scratches on kids back) water not clear and plenty of stuff floating around in it. Now there was something I couldn't ignore random young men roaming around and in the pool. What I didn't know was the beach which is Gross by the way is public!!!!! Now from what I was told people on the not registered hotel guests are not allowed to use the pool. What a crock! So you pay up to $200.00 a night and they use it for free no wonder you have to pay a resort fee but god knows what your paying for they certainly don't use the money for the upkeep on the place. Bottomline we did not feel comfortable or safe. Now back to the room we went back to the room so we could change and go to Burger King so we could spend $20.00 on food for 4 instead on $80.00 at the resort. So we changed and go out while I'm out I buy a few things to put in the fridge we get back and I open the fridge it smells like someone left fish in it!!!!!! The smell resonated through the whole room I'm not kidding When I called for a new one they said they would be right up that didn't happen I waited while the boys checked out the hotel. Two hours later still no one showed up so we left to got get dinner. When I came back thinking I would have a new fridge I opened it and bam no new fridge just the smell of dead fish! I had one of the boys unplug it and put it in the hallway. I called the frontdesk and they said they would take care of it. They did and that was that. I put my water away but threw out the mill because it was sitting out for a while although on ice I didn't trust it because the airconditioning was not working all that well. At 3:00am I wanted a water it was very dry in the room I opened the fridge it was bearly even cool so I turned it up and went back to bed. The next morning engineering comes to the room about the fridge he asks where the other fridge is I told him we put it in the hall he seemed very irked by that then gave me attitude because I turned the fridge up to coldest setting. All he kept saying was there would be a block of ice in the back and that it's a lot of work to chip it off and not good for the fridge. By this time I had had enought we had been there for 17 hours! I called the travel company we booked through and they were more than happy to help. I spoke we the hotel manager on duty and informed her that I was not comfortable and felt unsafe and all she could say was well come down to my office and we can discuss it. By that time I was done with this place! Upon checking out I was told I would have to pay the resort fee and taxes and parking, the least they could have done was refund my entire nights stay including the charges I mentioned. As it was all I wanted to do was leave. They were willing to put me in the other San Jaun location but I choose re Dorado location because I had teenege boys with me and didn't want them getting into any trouble. Drinking age is 18 in Puerto Rico. I moved to the El Conquistador in Fajardo it is very nice beautiful grounds , staff is friendly and professional. Only kicker is I am not getting a refund for hotel portion of my trip for 30 days so I had to spend another $900.00 for this hotel for the rest of the week. Now have read that it is expensive to eat here those rumors are all true it is very expensive but so was the Embassy Suites they wanted $20.00 for pasta.

Unfortunately, it's the only hotel in the area, so if you need to be here, you're really just stuck with this one 'choice'. They bank on this, because the property has declined significantly over the years. Others have described the pool and beach area accurately. I'll just add that the beach is very dirty (with manmade trash), and shoes should be worn at all times. I don't come here for vacation, so my review is more geared toward the inside rather than the outside of the hotel. Staff is pleasant and efficient. Room service is slower than necessary, but it is island time and I allow for that. The main issues I have are with the room furnishings. There is one lamp in the living area now--the floor lamps have disappeared. The fixture that was over the dining/work the table has been replaced with a flush mount ceiling light and there is a laser like work lamp on the table...all with very very low voltage bulbs (yes, they are 'green' but I can't see anything in the room!) Coffee tables have been removed, no pillows on the sofa. Very uncomfortable living quarters. The bedroom is better due to the extra natural light. On the up side, the carpet and mattresses were finally replaced a couple of years ago---but in the humid climate it was very overdue. Overall, it is a dark, uncomfortable space---something that could be fixed with proper lighting, furnishings and detailed cleaning. Other than a quick breakfast, I've not eaten in the hotel restaurant, but get room service. It's ok but very expensive. The restaurant across the driveway is now closed due to casino construction.

We found the lunch and dinner cooking a little unpredictable; some nights dinner was exceptional, while the same dishes on other nights were blander and clearly made with different ingredients.

Dorado is a nice suburb with a few familiar places to shop/eat and also at least one very fine restaurant (El Ladrillo) near the city center about a mile from the Embassy Suites.

I read all the recent reviews on TripAdvisor and thus had a good idea of what to expect. Advantages of this hotel include: located in a safe, quiet, pleasant luxury suburb of San Juan; small private beach with breakwaters to ease the waves and lots of rocks at each end to keep out the riffraff; very quiet and peaceful at pool and beach on weekdays; gorgeous, soothing and well-maintained landscaping and architecture; well-equipped fitness center; and wonderfully delicious complimentary breakfast (which is a real cooked-to-order breakfast rather than just continental as at most hotels). All staff encountered were courteous and pleasant. Disadvantages of this hotel: Mandatory 12% \"resort fee\" and $7 parking fee (why couldn't that be just rolled into the room rate?); huge crowds of raucous local Puerto Ricans on weekends at the pool and beach who are apparently staying at the Aquatic Club time-share on site; awkward parking situation; the concierge is never in; speed bumps galore coming to and from the main highway (at least eight, I think); cranky computers and printers in the business center; and large but shallow kid-oriented swimming pool that needs refurbishment (it has a few cracked and/or missing tiles here and there). No sign of the Chilean soap opera. Guess they finished filming! As for the room itself, it was well-maintained and clean, with only the slightest trace of a musty smell, and in excellent shape. The bed was warm and comfortable and the furniture looked practically new and in good shape with no obvious scratches or tears. The only major problems noted with the room were a tiny bit of rusting seen on the tiles in the bathroom, a mediocre-quality sealing job on the edges of the walls and fixtures in the bathroom, and a psycho A/C system that seemed to be capable of only various degrees of cooling (cold, very very cold, and ridiculously freezing) and was unable to provide heating or just a straight-through fan. Bring a cozy sweatshirt to stay warm at night. Anyone visiting this hotel in the next year should be warned that the parking lot clearly visible on Google Maps or Windows Live Maps satellite photographs to the southwest of the hotel has just been torn up. The hotel is building a real parking garage (apparently to ameliorate its chronic parking shortage). Unfortunately, this means that you will either have to park in the tandem parking in the temporary parking lot built to the southwest of the old lot, or they will direct you to park on one of the golf course paths on the east side of the hotel, where the hotel employees also park. Also, as many people have noted, try to avoid getting a room facing towards the southwest because that means you will be facing the noisy giant two-story tall air-conditioning unit that keeps the whole complex well-chilled, as well as the construction site for the new parking garage. Fortunately they gave me a room facing the east, so that wasn't a problem. As others have noted, the problem with most of the east-facing rooms is that you don't get much of an ocean view, but that is actually a good thing because the hotel complex is so close to the ocean that anyone actually facing the ocean runs the risk of being kept awake by ocean waves constantly crashing loudly on the breakwaters (at each end of the beach). Another issue is that in the winter, with the sun rising low in the sky to the south, the sun shines on the beach and pool area only from about 7 in the morning to 4 PM in the afternoon. After 4, the pool is in a deep shadow created by the hotel itself and the only area with sun is a small area of the beach at the west end, which gets sun through to about 6 PM. Finally, there's the issue of the distance from the city. Obviously, because the resort is 10 miles from San Juan, you will either have to rent a car or use taxis. If you don't rent a car, you will be stuck in the resort most of the time, which may be a problem because the Embassy Suites is rather small compared to the super-resorts where one wouldn't mind spending an entire vacation (the gigantic Hilton Waikoloa Village comes to mind). If you do rent a car, then you get the dubious pleasure of navigating Puerto Rico's insanely wild traffic. Keep in mind that staying in Dorado outside of the city means having to get up at 5 AM to fight San Juan's morning rush hour traffic to catch a 8:15 AM flight back to the mainland (unless you live somewhere close enough to PR that you can take a later flight). And the morning rush hour in San Juan starts at 6 AM, which implies you can look forward to sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic all the way to the airport on the last day of your trip. Overall, I had a good idea of what I was getting into (no hotel is perfect), and I thoroughly enjoyed my vacation at the Embassy Suites Dorado del Mar as good value for money. Puerto Rico has the highest homicide rate in America and I enjoyed being able to retreat to a beautiful hotel in a safe, quiet neighborhood at night after exploring the island during the day. But if you need (1) a larger, deeper adult-oriented pool for real swimming/diving, (2) an actual beach for walking, not just lounging around all day, (3) a white sand beach with turquoise water rather than an ordinary brown sand beach with blue water, (4) a hotel that includes all fees upfront in the room rate, (5) a hotel that is in the city, (6) a hotel that is far, far away from the city, or (7) a hotel that doesn't have a crazy number of speed bumps and makes you park on a golf course, then you might wish to look elsewhere.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cReally Great!\u201d", "Author": "saw1964", "ReviewID": "UR22382560", "Content": "We had a great stay!

The reservations were done around 10 months ago through one of the classmates who volunteered to make all arrangements for everyone participating. When I arrived Friday with my family, I went to the front desk, the employee found my name on the computer, and then I was sent to the Aquarius, which is next door. Finding a parking place was nearly impossible, which is odd considering it is supposed to be the group parking lot. To my surprise upon entering Aquarius, there was a long line. After one hour of waiting in line, I contacted my friend who made the reservations and she said that I was not the only one from the group who had problems with the reservation. She proceeded to talk with the manager on duty, who gave her a couple of different reasons of why they where having problems with the group reservations. After three hours of waiting in line (everyone waiting was already in a bad mood, and also having problems with their reservations), we finally had our room, but I already missed part of the evening that I expected to share with the classmates who I have not seen in a long time. As I met some of my friends they also expressed their problems with their reservations. Some were told that there was no room available and they had to wait until later that day. Others were sent to Dorado Beach, which was at a driving distance, to spend the night and come back the following day to get their room. They waited most of the day and some did not get their room until late that Saturday afternoon. As I was getting ready for our class dinner, I received a call from a hotel employee and was told that their records show that I was supposed to be there for only one night. I explained what happened with the reservations and the group that I was with, and the caller put me on hold for a very long time and never got back to me. The following day we received an envelope with the hotel statement inside, but it did not show the $150.00 that I gave as a deposit for the reservation. When I went to check out, I pointed it out to the front desk employee, and she and the manager had me waiting another hour while they checked. The classmate who made the reservations had to get the copy of my check and reservation document in order straighten the situation. It seems to me that they have to upgrade their computer system, or possibly fire the computer programmer. This will probably save them money as well as keep them from losing more clients. The service on the hotel was OK, but our stay was prematurely dampened with all this reservation problems. Needless to say, my recommendations to friends and family will be poor.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Neenah, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cBest Beach Value\u201d", "Author": "NeenahGirl", "ReviewID": "UR18119680", "Content": "We stayed at the Embassy Suites over Easter weekend after a planned check out from the Hyatt vacation club down the road.

The great - the protected and private beach was safe even while other beaches in Puerto Rico were closed for unusually rough surf this past March. The pool has a variety of depths and play areas, some are even shaded, to accomodate large numbers with varying degrees of swim skills. Rooms were clean and comfortable with unobtrusive and attentive housekeeping. Concierge desk is helpful as is the front desk staff. Fellow patrons were friendly. The good - Plenty of beach chairs, great breakfast, attentive staff and a family-friendly pool. Clean, spacious and in an incredible complex. The ferry to Viejo San Juan is a short drive away. There is easy access to the highway system and the restaurants in town are gracious and good. The mediocre - Our room reservation was for an ocean view; we ended up in a room that overlooked a parking lot, then a neighborhood and finally the ocean. The staff corrected the mistake after the first night. Ocean front rooms have king beds only with pull out couches making it a tough decision....do we get two beds or make the kids sleep on the pullout for the sake of a spectacular view? The noisy - The open atrium is rockin' until 11:00 on holiday weekends. The suite bedrooms were quiet enough, but the living rooms were too noisy for kids to sleep on the pull out couches.

Storms in the Northeast kept us there for three extra days and the hotel staff was very accomodating in extending our stay. When we arrived late at night we were told the Embassy Suites was overbooked and we were moved to the Aquarius/Golden Sands rooms that are adjacent to the main hotel. The rooms in this building are larger than the Embassy Suites with more substantial kitchens (full sized fridge, dishwasher and a two burner stove). As Embassy Suites guests, we were still able to go to the free breakfast each day and the hotel happy hour in the evening. We ended up preferring the larger room and quieter building. The only con was the housekeeping services were basic - I would have liked a more thorough cleaning each day - two days the housekeeper didn't even show up. You need a car if you plan on doing anthing in Puerto Rico besides sitting at the hotel pool. We rented one at the airport when we arrived along with a GPS which was a godsend. We visited the rainforest (beautiful), the Arecibo Observatory (we could have skipped this ), Languillo Beach(dissapointing, crowded and dirty) El Morro and Old San Juan (great day) and took an all day catamaran trip on the Spread Eagle II (not a joke) to Icacos, an uninhabited island off Fajardo - the trip was beautiful, but if you have snorkeled before you will find the fish/reefs a dissapointment. The other days we stayed at the hotel and used the pool which is perfect for kids. The beach sand is coarse and not white, but most of the beaches in Puerto Rico are like that except for the off islands. There are very few places to eat in Dorado and the places that were recommended were lousy. The Italian restaurant at the hotel, Oregeno, was the worst. The food took nearly two hours to come out, and one hour into our wait they came out to tell my husband he couldn't have the pesto pasta because they were out of pesto. My sons chicken strips were RAW in the middle. The hotel restaurant in the main building was ok, but don't expect to eat well on this trip. Lots of fried food with very few options for children. The pool bar was perfect for a late lunch in our bathing suits and the waitstaff was terrific. We saw them filming the soap opera at the hotel, but there were never any areas closed to guests. Overall, the value of this hotel is good. The people were very nice and bingo every afternoon was a big hit with the kids!

Transportation: As this location is 45 minutes from San Juan without traffic, I would highly recommend renting a car. Also, the restaurants in the hotel are somewhat limited so it allows freedom of choice for dining options. There are major roadways that resemble the US road and street system. The symbols are the same but the language is in Spanish. The speed limits are posted in Miles but everything else follows the metric system.

The gym is outfitted with new Precor? equipment and does focus on the aerobic stuff with limited barbells. Also, there is a game room and coin laundry in lower level area.

I lodged numerous complaints because in planning I thought I was careful and had personally phoned the 800 number and the hotel itself making sure to clarify what it was that we were seeking. Ocean, ocean view -the beach- we live in a landlocked community and wanted the beach. I was reassured that the room would have at a minimum a partial ocean view and we would be accommodated. The first evening the manager more or less told me too bad, the next morning the am manager offered to move us to the other side. There we looked over a gated community and if you sat in the right corner of the patio the beach was visible. If we could have returned to the airport and gone home w/o $$ penalty- (5 travelers) we would have. We especially wanted to leave after the day we spent traveling on a \"dry run\" to the other side of the island to set up our snorkeling and night swim outings. A long trip from Dallas this was to be our big family \"island\" vacation. The \"oceanfront\" beach offered is a miniscule bay with moss/scum on the bottom of much of the area you can walk. Likely due to the lack of movement within the man made cove. That drive to the other side of the island to do any of the things one might want to do, snorkel, deep sea fishing, ferry to other island or swim in the evening with glowing fish - well the traffic is worse than metro DC, Dallas and any other city we have lived or traveled to and the drive took us 3.5 hours one way. We were advised at the hotel that it was worse during the week. The breakfast buffet was the highlight. The servers wonderful. I have not eaten eggs since returning though. The all inclusive happy hour in California included frozen non-alcoholic drinks for the kids, not here they charged 3.50 or more for them.

I recommend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Ladrillo\" in the center of town for dinner (a little pricy, but worth it). You do have to ring the buzzer for them to open the door. Don't dine here if you are in a hurry, sit back and enjoy! Breakfast is free every morning and offers many items to choose from; cold cereal, pancakes, French toast, donuts, fruit, and eggs cooked to order, pastries, bacon, sausage and an omelet station etc. The line can get long so plan ahead. There are laundry facilities in the basement area next to the game room and workout gym. If you are visiting San Juan on your first night staying here, I recomment hiring a driver. San Juan It is approximately 30 minutes away. I hired a driver for $65.00 each way (worth every penny) we got dropped off and called him back when ready (didn't have to worry about drinking and driving or getting lost the first time around) You can also hire a driver to take you around the Island. I recommend Guavate on the weekend. They have a local fiesta every weekend, vendors, crafts and traditional food and music. It is in a mountainous area, not for the faint at heart. I paid $165.00 for round trip for both (he stayed with us the entire time and made sure we were comfortable, approximately 4 hours, also explaining the different foods and customs) Again worth every penny. Not every tourist experiences this. The driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name is John Benuchi and the hotel can provide his number. I used a rental the rest of the time and the two times I hired a driver instead of driving my self, I was not charged for parking. If you would like additional information on my stay and photos, please email me at dee@massopenhouse.com. I visited the Bioluminescent bay in Fajardo with Kayaking Puerto Rico and Scuba dived in Aguadilla at Cable Beach with Aquatica. I also visited briefly Camuy and Ponce.

My friends and I were return guests because we'd been so impressed with the property during our first stay. When it opened in 2003 we had been among some of its first guests. We had a great time then and very much looked forward to returning. What a difference 4 years makes. As has been mentioned by a number of reviewers here, a soap opera was being filmed during our entire stay. If I'd been alerted to the fact that the property would pretty much be monopolized by the cast and crew, I'd have chosen another property. There were times when the lobby, the restaurants, the beach, or the pool were not available to us. We also found that the restaurants and larger bar in the hotel closed at 5pm! That was definitely not the case during our first visit. There was no experienced, capable concierge available during our stay. Another disappointing change from our first visit where the concierge was knowlegeable and helpful. Apparently, all their contracts with such vendors as major car rental companies, and tour operators have been severed. We had to rent a car and drive to excursions and sites ourselves. The staff at the pool charged with dispensing towels, cleaning lounge chairs etc., needed more than retraining. They needed to be fired. They were downright rude. When we requested towels the young man on duty said in spanish to his two female co-workers \"Toallas grandes para las gordas.\" Translation: \"Big towels for the fat girls\" Unfortunately for him, 3 of the 4 of us are spanish-speaking. Add to all that the furnishings are shabby at best, the beach was absolutely filthy and they've added a playground area around the pool for children that was also filthy and needless to say that as a seasoned travel and a travel agent, I'd never recommend this property to anyone.", "Date": "January 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cWHAT A FIND!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Travellfor3", "ReviewID": "UR12292068", "Content": "Our family spent the week of Christmas here and we had a wonderful time!!!

Each room has seperate bedroom and living room w/pullout and a fridge and microwave. Although we never used our room except to sleep, shower and change. There is a good golf course right on the property and the most beautiful course 5 mins. down the road at the Dorado Beach club that is open to the public to use. The pool is wonderful and the property grounds are beautiful with palm trees and manicured shrubs all around. The beach is small but great for swimming as the water is very calm due to the jetty that is very far out. Food was simply ok, except breakfast which was great. However, there are so many resteraunts around the area that it didn't matter. Definitely rent a car. All in all we would absolutely come back again.

The hotel overall was nice although it is showing some of its age. Some areas near the hotel were nicely designed/landscaped/maintained. BUT, other areas had a 3rd world appearance, e.g., an employee side entrance/dock and my pet peeve the guest parking lot. Parking was $7/day but guests should be paid to park there! It is absolutely 3rd world atrocious, could never pass in the US especially an Embassy Suites and ESPECIALLY an Embassy Suites that requires paid parking. To go from the parking lot to the hotel required not stepping in sizable potholes, tripping over broken/uneven pavement, soiling and wetting shoes and luggage. Check-in was disappointing--I have been a Diamond VIP for years yet am still aggravated that attention isn't paid more closely to upgrade requests per online reservations...in fact, automatic upgrades should be the norm for Diamond VIP (but isn't) despite my communication to Hilton--too much variability between hotels0. After checking in to the room, I proceeded to go back down and politely inquire for my original request of an ocean view and was graciously given another room but still an unnecessary hassle. The pool is one of the best features of the hotel (NOTE I am not much of a pool fan). It is large and sweeping with 3 different areas/levels with cascading from one to the next, with shade from palms interspersed. Water quality was very good with no obnoxious chlorine smell (which actually is an indicator of possible by-product of bacteria kills). The small beach is fairly nice with great breezes and surf since it is located on the windward side of the island. Of particular note was the entire lack of mosquitoes and bugs. [Let this be a warning--see my yet to be written piece per our stay at the Hilton in Ponce on the leeward side (southern) of the island 2 days later.] The breakfast was typical Embassy Suites level. However, a dinner meal turned out to be disappointingly bad. The manager's reception has booze but nothing of note to munch on, although the Caribbean band set up near the pool was great. The fitness room was being refurbished and I was VERY disappointed in the temporary digs with lack of equipment and not cool enough--only 1treadmill was operating--NO EXCUSE. Our room overlooked the plaza/pool/beach but noise was not a problem. The band usually quit around 11PM. We had problems with a sluggish shower and toilet drain which required maintenance 3 different times. Overall attitude and service was good but not great--I guess I am too used to great attitudes and service from Mexicans (don't bash me, my wife is a Mexican). Getting to the hotel is not easy but was tolerable in my trips between it and Arecibo about 55 miles away to the west. For 3 nights Tue.-Thur. we paid (my company) $139.99 + 7$/day parking + the usual and unusual fees/taxes. Our 4th night Fri. was $149.99 plus out of our pocket.

I have to agree with the other reviewer that the place felt like it was overrun with locals. It was packing with local business people from Merck and the hotel seemed to cater to them first. Several times, the Paradise Cafeteria was closed off to host their events. On Thursday night, the Merck people had a reception in a conference room that we could hear on the 4th floor. When we called to the front desk, they acted as if they didnt know what we were talking about and told us that they checked with the room right below us and didnt hear anything. Hello? Anyone in the lobby could have heard it. So my girlfriend and I decided to get dressed and join the Merck party. Why not? They were too wasted to care. Their was no conceirge the entire week. We had to enlist the help of local waiters to plan our trips to Cuomo and El Yunque. Be advised that the Blue Seahorse bar closes at 5pm. So if you want a frozen beverage or food and you are by the pool, you have to dry off, get dressed and go inside to the Calypso bar. And the manager reception does not include frozen drinks.

Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really no access to outside people. The reason I think its made public is because the hotel is linked to a time share called Aquatics so you get the people from there as well. The beach is very small and narrow. The water was calm. The down fall of the time share is that you get more people than you need to while you are vacationing. Beware that you will get asked to join.

The only downside was that there was not a wedding coordinator who worked with me on the day of the wedding; luckily, I'm very laid back and was able to work around this. Not all brides would have been this way. We were married on the beach overlooking the ocean and in my mind, it doesn't get any better than that. I definitely believe that everyone who was with us would not hesitate in booking a trip back here. I will say that the weekend got very crowded with kids in the pool, etc, but up until that point it was perfect. Also, a car is probably a good thing to have.

Overall, it was a great way to spend a vacation. The hotel was clean and well-maintained and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Our room was also clean and generally well-maintained. We stayed in a king suite. The king bed was very comfortable and seemed to be fairly new. I cannot say the same thing about the sleeper sofa in the living area where our daughter slept. That was sadly in need of replacement. As a sofa, the cushions were flat and \"rock-like\". When the bed was opened the mattress was also hard and lifeless. Housekeeping (or maintenance) was very accommodating and brought up another sleeper sofa mattress, which helped for the time we were there. The breakfast buffet included with the room was generally decent, really typical breakfast buffet type food, but perhaps could have been warmer. The restaurants associated with the hotel were okay. We ate there a couple nights, when we didn't feel like heading elsewhere. \"Oregano\", in the golf course clubhouse across the driveway, had reasonably priced Italian food and tasted much like a Fazoli's or Olive Garden may. The food at the restaurant in the hotel was okay, as hotel food goes. Not great, just okay. The beach in front of the hotel was pretty nice, but could have used just a little more maintenance. Since some guests apparently couldn't be bothered with picking up after themselves after finishing their food and drinks, there was litter that could have been cleaned up. Maybe if they had a few more garbage cans, people would get the message? But, on the other hand, the pool and hot tub were very nice. The Dorado Del Mar golf course was an enjoyable lay-out, but the sand traps could have used some sand. I expected the traps to be wet, as there was scattered light rain daily while there, but they looked like they had not had any sand in them for a long while and missed the upkeep I would expect from a course that charges $108 a round. As a side note, we made a couple of trips into Old San Juan, about a 35-40 minute drive away in our rental car. We visited El Morro and ate at \"Buren\".

While our stay was technically at the Aquarius, this building formed an L shape with Embassy Suites. The Embassy Suites building runs parallel to the beach, while the Aquarius timeshare building runs from one side of the Embassy to the beach. The pool sits in the middle of the \"L\". We were in room 2174, and loved the location and the view. We were on the ground level, with a great view of the pool and also a view of the ocean. The patio had a small table with 4 chairs, which were in the shade most of the day and nice for eating meals out of the sun. Our trip was with our family of 4 - mom, dad, 14-year-old daughter, and 13-year-old son. Beds were small (doubles, not queens), and not real comfortable. We woke up with back aches most mornings, and the kids fought when going to sleep & when waking up (as most teens do - especially when forced with such \"togetherness\"). The rooms were okay, and clean. However, there was hardly a kitchen to speak of. As the photos show, there was only a microwave, and a tiny fridge. We were provided with 2 dinner settings, and when asked, were promptly provided with 2 more. With no dish soap and no washrags, however, we ended up doing dishes in the sink with a face towel and liquid hand soap. The kitchen also provided a mini coffee maker and coffee for the first day. We bought more coffee and filters (the regular shape, not cone) at the Grande market, which was a grocery just outside the resort entrance - very convenient, and had beer, etc., too. Not much came in small sizes, though, so you may want to bring small sizes of jelly, seasonings, etc. if you plan to eat much in your room. We checked in on Friday, and finally got maid service on Tuesday. With some asking, we were able to get towels exchanged sooner, as they did not dry even when hung up, and were not real desirable after a couple days. Our phone in the room never did work the entire week we were there, but this was only a minor inconvenience for us, fortunately. Other than that, they were helpful when we asked for more towels, dishes, etc. Also, bring soap - they only have those refillable liquid dispensers for hand soap, shampoo, and shower soap, and nothing suds. The pool was great, and pool chairs were abundant - even for us late risers. No problem finding chairs even at 10am or later. The pool was clean, but a tad cold. Nice for cooling off in, but a little chilly for me to hang out in. The beach was ok. There were signs to watch out for amenones, but we never saw any. The beach is sandy and big enough for the crowd, with lots of chairs as well as a volley-ball net. The beach area was protected with large rocks further out, and there were no waves to speak of (nice for little ones, but boring for the teens). Overall, it was a pleasant stay. Would have been nicer to have more kitchen facilities, more chairs for just hanging out in the room, and definitely better mattresses on queen-sized beds. However, I guess we can't have it all with a studio. Check in and out were easy. The women working the front desk were very friendly and helpful. English was widely spoken at the resort. Two other things worth mentioning. It was nice to finally stay somewhere that doesn't threaten to charge $50 for a lost pool towel, but the $7 per day charge for our rental car parking was a bit much.

The hotel is a typical suites arrangement, with breakfast and a cocktail hour included in the price of $235/night. The breakfast food is passable but certainly not restaurant quality. The only food arrangement worth noting is the Blue Seahorse bar/grill at the pool, where lunch is available from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The food here is tasty and the portions are large, and an idea is to eat a large (if mediocre) breakfast and then do dinner at the pool bar/grill before it closes. The hotel has a very nice beach and a beautiful series of interconnected pools. There are pool toys and floats that can be bought or rented, and many people simply stay at the water all day. Other activities include tennis ($10/hour) which I did twice, and golf (which I did not do). The two tennis courts are in mediocre condition and not terribly well maintained. Noise is a big problem at this hotel. Once or twice a week there is a band playing in the center atrium until nearly midnight, and there is no escaping the sound. This is an odd situation because there are so many young children as well as several golfers who want to play early in the morning when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooler. For private events the hotel has a ballroom; be sure your room is not over that facility because the noise and vibration from the music are astonishing and will make you very unhappy. The local shopping is all fast food and typical of low level U.S. shopping centers (e.g., the nearby strip center has a Western Auto), and it is over one mile away. You must rent a car near the airport; do not consider using a limo service to the hotel (as some guests did) because you will be totally stranded. This is a particular problem at dinner time, because there is only one restaurant (upscale) open every night and an Italian restaurant open Wednesdays through Sundays. The best attraction in Puerto Rico may be the rain forest (El Yunque) but it is nearly two hours away past San Juan. The roads and entrances are poorly marked and you should assume that most of a day will be spent going to/from and at this activity. By the way, the directions provided by the hotel were mostly wrong; instead, get a map. Of course, the architecture of Old San Juan itself is fascinating and worth a day trip, although many of the lovely homes have been turned into tourist shops. In summary, the Embassy Suites Dorado Beach is marginally acceptable for the price and for those looking for a family friendly resort. Many of the staff understood this mission; some did not and that made for a few unpleasant moments. If you want sun and water, this may be a reasonable choice.

They cooked hot omelets or eggs, fresh pancakes and had waitresses asking if you needed anything - just ask for them to reheat your food and it was done. Fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, pasties, french toast, etc... I figure about a $40 value for free. Also the cocktail two hours was great - free cocktails (everything but frozen drinks).

The woman was very nice and pointed us toward the hotel check-in desk. Check-in was a breeze even though there was only one person at the front desk. The manager on duty immediately walked up to us and helped us use the electronic kiosk for check-in. He was very pleasant! When we told him we parked our car near Aquarius and were wondering how to bring our bags in he said no problem and immediately called the bell-hop who went with us to our car on the other side of the property and brought our luggage upstairs.

It worked very well for our needs. The hotel had a very nice pool area which we all enjoyed, including a nice wading pool for the kids. The beach area was perfect for our little ones, though the lack of waves might bother some. We generally went out and about during the mornings and returned to the hotel mid-afternoon to relax at the pool & beach, which worked out very well - the pool and beach were rarely crowded.

The ferry from near the Bacardi factory made the trip into Old San Juan an absolute breeze (at least once we found the ferry terminal). Our primary complaint with the hotel was the food, as also mentioned in other reviews. The restaurant within the hotel was very bland and uninteresting, and the Italian restaurant across the street wasn't very exciting either (and quite frankly, when in PR I really don't need to eat Italian food). The breakfast was convenient but unexciting - the lack of fresh juices and fruit was surprising. We did venture out a few times to other restaurants in the area, but none I'd really recommend. The most \"authentic\", interesting food we had was in Old San Juan at a little luncheonette called Cafe Manolin - inexpensive, tasty and very friendly service, filled with locals.

We selected this resort due to its close proximity to golf courses. We also were traveling with our two boys ages 4 and 1.

The beach was a bit of a disappointment due to the seaweed but the boys enjoyed playing in the sand and we didn't have to worry about them being knocked over by large waves. The free breakfast and the managers receptions were nice and we were always able to find a place to sit. Drinks at the pool bar were very good and reasonably priced for a resort. My favorites were the Mudslide and the Dorado Vice. Now, for the negatives. During the weekend the pools were very crowded with locals, the clientele was not what you would typically find at a resort. On Mondays all restuarants in Dorado are closed except for the fast food. Restuarant choices in the area are limited but we did have a great meal at La Morenas. There is also no good shopping in the area and San Juan is at least 45 min drive. While in PR we did visit the El Yunque Rainforest and El Morro. We enjoyed them both. The rainforest is a bit of a drive (about 11/2 hours). I would recommend visiting both if you have time.

Overall, this property was great. We were there during Massachusetts April vacation week, which also coincided with Easter weekend. We arrived on Good Friday, a major holiday on PR, so a lot of things were closed. Check in had the potential to be slow but my husband is a Hilton Honor member so we got to use that line and it made check in a little quicker. The property was sold old for Easter weekend. It was about as crowded as you could get. We tried to hit breakfast by 8:30 and never had a problem getting a table. Mostly it's a buffet, if you order an omlet or fried eggs, that will be the hottest part of the meal, everything else is pretty much luke warm. Having read the reviews we went to the pool after breakfast and reserved 3 chairs. By noon on Sat and Sun. I'm not sure there was a lounge to be had. The rest of the week was busy, but not like Easter weekend. We ate at El Ladrillo, as recommended by others, and it was a great dinner. Expect to pay $100 for dinner for 3. Our other favorite restaurant was Morena, again $100 for three. Atmosphere was terrific, presentation superb. Take a right out of the gate and take the road along side the Gulf station. We actually ate at Morena twice, picking it as our favorite restaurant for our last night on PR. Manager recommended Las Brasas, Argentinian steakhouse. Don't waste your time, no atmosphere and the food was mediocre at best. PeeWees was a good lunch spot and had dinner there as well. La Terraza was very good, but not as good as El Ladrillo or Morena. Oregano was ok, we went there on our first night. Other restaurant at Embassy Suites seemed to always have a themed buffet for $25-$28. Not a big buffet fan. Never made it to the Hyatt, casino seems to be closed at this point. Ask at the check in desk for a map of the area. They have one with all the local restaurants and grocery store...we didn't get on until about day 5, when we asked for a restaurant recommendation. It would have been very helpful earlier in the week. Bacardi rum tour was fun, better than we expected. Comes with 2 free cocktails. Old San Juan, a good day trip. We experienced a lot of frustration with the traffic. Tried to get several places and got stuck in traffic for 60-90 minutes and would give up. The manager's cocktail hour 5:30-7:30 was more than welcome on those days! Found everyone to be very friendly.

Being from a big city myself I definitely did not want to be anywhere that reminded me of home. And yes parking at the hotel is $7 a day but who cares you're on vacation. It's not an all-inclusive resort so don't expect all the perks. The hotel is primarily a FAMILY hotel. So if you are on your honeymoon I do not recommend you stay there. There are kids everywhere.

The restaurants were quite PRICEY but that was expected. It was nice to have the complimentary breakfast which offerered EVERYTHING and it was not crazy at all.

The breakfast was more then adequate, I don't know what some people possibly expect. They had everything from eggs and pancakes to yogurt and cereal. We never hit the crowd because our kids are early risers, so we were usually eating by 8:30 am. Besides, you're on vacation, so take it slow! The pool and beach are perfect for kids. We weren't a bit nervous about letting our 2 1/2 year old run from the kiddie pool to the zero entry larger pool. And the beach is so calm that he had his freedom there too. My 9 month old napped in the shade of his stroller and then took a dip in the pool with a floatie we brought from home. You can rent floaties by the pool for $15/day or $5 for an hour. Then we would eat lunch at the pool bar and return to our spacious clean room for afternoon naps (the kids, not us). For dinner, you can order in from Dominoes Pizza or Pizza Hut if you choose or eat in the hotel at Oreganos- decent pizza, pasta was eh. We also took car service to a local restaurant (Il Ladrillo) which was delicious and to the Hyatt Cerromar which has a Johnny Rockets (good for kids) and a delicious Chinese/Japanese restaurant. The manager's reception was outside by the pool. Mostly kids getting free Shirley Temples, but we took a glass (more like a plastic cup) of wine here and there while my son had ice cream from the store in the lobby. We really enjoyed our vacation.

We stayed at the Embassy Suites in Dorado for 3 nights. The hotel is relatively new and located in a private residential area on Dorado Beach. It was a nice get away from the hustle and bustle and cold weather of New York City. The hotel is a Embassy Suites hotel - the lobby is open with greenery and waterfalls; the suites are clean and spacious; and though our room didn't have a full ocean view, we could still see the ocean from our balcony which was nice and relaxing. The hotel is very family oriented, so expect kids of all ages. The pool area is really cool and the beach though small area wise was more than enough. Plenty of sun, drinks, and food, they even provide massage service on the beach!! All of the hotel staff, with the exception of the concierge, were extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge was very pushy and tried to sell us hard on renting a car from him. We didn't want to drive during our trip so we passed. My wife and I are vegetarian and the waiters/waitresses at the restaurants were more than accommodating with the lack of vegetarian items on the menus. They tended to our every want and concern. The \"made to order breakfast\" is more of a buffet rather than what ever your heart desires, but it's still a nice touch. The Italian restaurant in the golf complex across from the hotel was also very good. We actually ate dinner there two out of three nights. But be aware, it's closed on Monday and Tuesday. The hotel is secluded from the rest of San Juan, from the rest of Dorado for that matter. It is difficult and can be expensive to venture out of the resort if you don't have a car. If going to Old San Juan, I recommend taking a taxi to the ferry port ($35 dollars to ferry port and 50 cents for the ferry) and taking the ferry to Old San Juan. The whole process of taxi to ferry and back was actually very easy, because the ferry drops you off right in Old San Juan. The hotel's taxi driver, Louis, is great. Also, be aware the rain forest is approx a 2 hour drive from the hotel.

The staff kept our room immaculate - i would say to try a room on the upper floor as the weekend entertainment can get very loud- but if you close your inner door, you won't hear it- although there were quite a few families with young children, we must have hit a week where the hotel wasn't fully booked because we were able to find quiet areas to retreat to. Free Breakfast could be busy but that varied and we were even able to grab one of the few tables on the little balcony area overlooking the gorgeous courtyard on several mornings. If you ask the cooks to throw the lukewarm pre-cooked meats and potatoes on the grill as they cook your made to order eggs, it greatly improves the meal- The free cocktail hour was a nice littel break after a day in the sun, sefvice was good and drinks were premium brands. Not for big drinkers though- 2 per person limit- which was plenty for us. Everyone working there, from the front desk to the kids who helped set up chairs and give out towels, seemed to really enjoy their jobs and get along with each other and would help with anything we asked. the restaurant across from the lobby, Oregano, had a good variety, good value and the food was better than we expected. Go into town to El Ladrillo for a treat- the local art on the walls is an extra plus- a little pricey but well worth it. There are stores close by outside the complex - no problem finding things you might need- plenty of familiar chains around. if you go to the Bacardi plant, ask about the ferry in CAtano and take that to Old San Juan for 50 cents- don't drive! the traffic can be brutal and there's no place to park- you can grab a cab once there or walk up to El MOrro- Just be careful if you drive not to miss the turn off as you get close to Dorado- get good directions, as there is no sign for Dorado going west from the airport once you get off the main highway- exit for Dorado is right after toll - if you aren't looking for lots of action on the premises, this is a great place to use as either a relaxing hideout or a central location to travel to other nearby tourist sites. but we found the grounds and hotel itself to be so inviting, we didn't leave to do any sightseeing for 5 days!

Navigating the roadways was a challenge and we got lost a number of times. But on this, our second trip here, we felt like old hands and were able to hit all the right twist, turns and unexpected freeway exits to arrive at the hotel a mere 30 minutes after picking up our rental car. A quick drop off of kids, luggage and mom was followed by an equally quick return of dad and car when the hotel parking lot proved to be full. In a smart, but more costly move, we elected to valet the car our entire stay for quick entrances and exits. Check-in was smooth once we were able to obtain the attention of a desk clerk. Lines predominate here and at the concierge desk as neither seems adequately staffed. Once through the line, we were whisked up the glass elevators to our ocean-view suite on the fifth floor with a lovely panorama of the pool area and ocean. A wonderful breeze wafted in and we drank in the 84 degree weather before quickly changing and heading to the pool. We spent the majority of our time here as our children preferred the pool to the beach area although we did mange to build a few sand castles and attempt to snorkel the calm, walled in bay-like beach. The hotel boasts four pools: three joined by a series of water falls with a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool off to one side. Parents can feel comfortable letting little swimmers navigate all pool areas as none exceed four-feet in height. And while floats and pool toys (and umbrellas!) can be rented for $15 a day, we had elected to bring our own (make \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem blow-up ones for easy packing). Our days passed easily enough just hanging out at the pool on our rafts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because we are old hands at more than navigating Puerto Rico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roads. We are also old hands at navigating the Embassy Suites system. Like the front desk and its lines, things take time in all areas of the resort. We knew to order lunch from the poolside restaurant at least 45 minutes before we thought the children would get hungry. We also knew to hit the local grocery store (just 5 minutes outside the resort area) to insure that we had snacks and the makings of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for those times we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gauge our children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs correctly. We also knew our room would not be made-up until late in the afternoon. And, we also knew to avoid the hotel for evening meals (or risk never eating dinner at all). We also knew to hit breakfast early so there was no need to wait for a table. And speaking of breakfast, the one offered by Embassy Suites has everything you need for a good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meal: made-to-order omelets, breakfast meats, cereals, breads and rolls and an array of non-chilled juices (but accompanied by a big bucket of ice to offset that problem). While the main attractions at this hotel are the beach and pool area, it also offers a small game room (with many games out of order while we were there) and a gym. Massages are also available and, of course, the ubiquitous Embassy Suites Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reception with free drinks and munchies presented every evening from 5:30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7:30 pm.

While planning this trip, i found most other big name hotels sought $300-$500 a night, while ES was only $225 including breakfast (which was just ok-but-free, so who could complain) The location of the hotel in Dorado was not very convenient to the rest of the island. you are 7 minutes from the highway, then a total of 30 minutes to san juan, 1 hour to the rainforest Luquillo area. there really is nothing close by, so if you like to explore, be prepared to drive lots. the pool area was beautiful. It consists of an above average inifinity pool looking out to the ocean. bravo. the view will take you far from the winter up north, and put you into tropical bliss. my only complaint here is the lounge chairs..just the basic strap type, and cushions would be nice. the beach: very serviceable..not the most beautiful, but i dont think anyone would find the beach here a drawback from enjoying the property. the ocean is calm. the staff were mostly pleasant. many would go out of their way to greet you, and were helpful. this place seems very well managed on new years day when the hotel was fully booked, they had extra staff to accomodate the masses. impressive. the rooms were standard ES size, but in very good condition as the hotel is relatively new. not many quality dining options in Dorado, so once again, be prepared to drive to SJ or other areas. In Dorado, A la brassa, steakhouse just ok, nothing special, the italian restaurant on the ES property better, but again, just OK.

It is a great place for a relaxing beach vacation although there is not much else to do - my teenagers were bored after a while. Also the beach is very protected with no wave action at all. Hotel service was fine except our kids were late sleepers and we sometimes had to remind the cleaners to service our room in the afternoon. Breakfast hours (ends at 9:30 during the week) are more in line with a hotel serving business travelers than vacationers. Resort restaurants were ok but limited -you definitely need a car to get around to eat in other places. Service in the poolside restaurant is horribly slow.

La Terrazza was very good (paella was the best I have EVER had). Most meals for a family of 4 (remember we are foodies and that means 2 appatizers and dessert) was around $150 with tip.THE best meal we had was at Villa Dorada D'Alberto at Dorado public beach and that meal was only $80. If we had more time we would have went there numerous times. In old San Juan we ate at Barrachina village, it was so good we went back again for lunch one day.They include the tip no matter how many are in your party so make sure you check the bill. Don't go to Burger King unless you speak fluent Spanish, they speak NO english. We ordered breakfast and ended up with whoppers and fries.

We stayed as timeshare owners. After reading other reviews AFTER we booked our vacation, I was prepared for less than an Excellent hotel, but was still disappointed. We rented a car based on other reviews. A car is a must as this hotel is not within walking distance of any stores, restaurants or attractions. This hotel is not near anything, except the Hyatt which has a casino. Driving is an experience! Be prepared for cars changing lanes without signaling and basically cutting you off. When we arrived, the parking lot was totally packed and disorganized. The parking lot is not sized to accommodate the golf and hotel guests. Also, to our total amazement, we were charged a nightly fee of $7 to park the car. We have never incurred a charge for parking a car at any timeshare location prior to this one. Upon check-in, our room was not ready until 6:30 p.m and that was after complaining to the manager. The pool and beach area are very nice and great if you have children. The pool is max depth of 4 ft. in one small area only. The pool has 3 levels and all are viewable from the seating area. Though the beach is on the ocean side, they have built jetties which allow the waves to break further out. The water is very calm and safe. The food at the hotel is expensive and we were not impressed. The rain forest was a great place to visit and Old San Juan. Both are a drive away. Aside from these two attractions, and the casino, we did not find much to do. The hotel had some activities for the children, but not every day. There is a large supermarket down the road, but you definitely need a car to get around. The kitchen is not well equipped so be prepared to cook in saucepans. The sofas need to be replaced. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

A little costly, but not much options except the fast food places outside of the resort (you would have to drive out of the resort in your own rented car, hotel doesn't take you out). The pools were nice. 4 different pools. The free drinks and free breakfast were great. People are very friendly.

Parking: TOTAL DISASTER We rented a car since it is located 25 min from airport (without heavy traffic) and wanted to tour island. Parking is a total disaster. First you must get a ticket from a machine, then try and find a spot. IF there aren't spots, told just double park someone and then walk back to entrance to leave keys at payment booth. So yes--we often found our car double parked. The parking situation is totally out of control. It got worse every day especially on Saturday before cruise departures. Would NOT stay here again just based on this problem. Facilities: Gorgeous inside main tower, pool area great, cove, beach area pretty to look at. Son tried using beach- rough sand, very rocky. Cut foot on rocks, Appears created to just say they have a beach. Don't book this hotel based on having a beach. Pools are more family friendly-did have a shallow pool for children separate. Ice machines-often empty, ice tasted horrible. Thankfully our room had a refrig. with filered water & ice. Breakfast: Good spread, cooked to order also. Actually have a sign posted: 7am GREAT breakfast,8am ok breakfast,9am-fair This was so true---we awoke at 7am to get food, by 7:30am filling up and 8am lines. We had hoped to take some food up to our sleeping teen son--were told no food left buffet area--it would be charged as takeout. I spoke with manager of area-and explained should I waste the food I put aside on a plate for him? They agreed one time and gave me a takeout box. Internet: A free terminal next to front desk, guests asked to limit to 15min. Rooms: If get main tower room -same standard as all Embassy's. \"Aquarius\" vacation suites: Larger, our Air conditioning was just ok, not as cold as main tower and humid in room. We had constant trouble with lock and having to call engineering. Was told being an outside room the rain ruins the computer card in lock and have to replace often. Also side wing access is not attached to main tower, no stairs-aways had to use a erribly slow elevator. Pool & Beach: Pool gorgeous, well landscaped, palm trees, tables, chairs, relaxing area especially chairs over looking beach. Beach: good to view, water quality dark, murky, very rocky. Not a useable beach except to sit in a chair on, perhaps play in sand- do not come for beach facilities. We arrived at 11pm on a Thursday night pre-cruise. Despite requesting main tower, non smoking a year in advance, \"the main tower was sold out\" but we would be upgraded to a better wing, larger room etc. OK- This area we learned was called \"Aquarius\" which they try to sell as vacation club. It is larger room with full kitchen versus a mini fridge. It was quite larger than a standard Embassy Room. However it was in a separate building requiring pulling luggage past pool, taking a super slow elevator (even if we wanted to use stairs to second floor there aren't any except a firescape down). There are two versions also of these rooms- interior hallway wing -DO NOT get as everyones cooking permeates hall and noisy as we saw the trend of families bringing all their extended family members and piling into a room. We were fortunate to have the wing with outside hall doorway. It also had a lovely view of the ocean. The next morning we got a call telling us to check out, bring luggage and move rooms, or they could get our luggage later and move it for us. NO Thanks--we discussed with front desk and were given permission to stay in the special room for our 3 night stay. We just had to put up with door lock not locking, or locking us out, A/C not as cold as main tower. Maid Service: Friendly and no problems.
