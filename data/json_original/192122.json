The receptionist was so welcoming and wafted us upstairs into a gorgeous room, just stuffed with furniture. It was amazing! We felt so cossetted. There were gorgeous chocolates awaiting us, and a copy of the Evening Standard. We went downstairs for a pre dinner drink and the drawing room also had a roaring fire. We ordered martinis, to kick start our evening out, and they have got to be the best we have ever tasted!We went out to a big event, and a 'butler' hailed a cab and made it all seem so easy, being in the big city. When we returned later, we slept so well in the big cosy bed, it was bliss. The next morning we awoke to birds singing - we hadn't realised there was a private garden and our room looked out onto it. We went downstairs for a piping hot cooked breakfast, served by a smiling waiter. I must say the whole experience was superb.

Service at the hotel is first class, the food excellent, the lounge and bar area so comfortable and inviting. Each day we would return from our outings and go straight to the lounge for drinks or cup of tea. Its is such a welcoming place to stay. We had adjoining rooms, one standard and one grand deluxe. No attention to details was spared. Hot water bottles, bath pillows, a candle at turn down service, the list goes on. The rooms, as is the whole hotel, are beautifully decorated. This hotel ticks all the right boxes for us and also for the 20 year olds. This is no mean feat as I find fault. We have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental on Hyde Park and the Dorchester.
