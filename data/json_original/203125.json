The bathroom was no better. The shower didn't sit at the top of the rail and kept falling down, and the floor of the shower was so badly drained, it flooded! The minor problem was that the TV didn't work. Anyhow, I asked that our room was changed, and having been told we would have to stay put that night, as the hotel was full, we were promised a room change the next day. This I had to chase. The second room itself seemed ok, bed was better, decor clean, and no musty smell. However, we soon discovered that the drainage wasn't much better in the shower, and it was also not at all hot, luke warm at best until the Sunday night when it eventually, became something resembling hot. This I can only put down to poor plumbing. And, the next problem - the toilet didn't work... And despite leaving our key with reception on the first night and constantly complaining asking for this to be fixed, it wasn't and we were ignored, so we ended up having to use the hotel's 3 floors down!

Again the staff did not care and said you will have to wait till morning. The next morning we asked about the airconditioning and were told the air conditioning is not turned on and they wont turn it on for a few days. This was rather irritating because we booked the hotel after reading \"individually controlled air conditioning\" from Hotel Fiamma's website. We asked why it would say this if there was none but again staff did not care. We recieved a 20euro discount which was not nearly enough for being constantly uncomfortable in our room during our stay. Our room was on a very busy street and it was very loud even with the windows closed. There was construction, a garbage truck that came every night ay 2:30, and a few different busses that drove by all night. Unfortunately because we had no airconditioning we slept with the window open because it was too hot in the room. As for breakfast, there was not a very good display of food. And if you were there to late it was very picked over. And the coffee service was horrible. You had to sit at your table and wait for the staff to decided to come out to bring you coffee. One morning we sat there for 20 minutes before I found someone at the front desk and asked him to help us get some coffee. He yet again did not care and just told me to wait till they come out. They finally showed up another 10 minutes later and we had coffee. The only thing I enjoyed about this hotel was its proximity to Termini Train Station and the neighborhood was not to bad at night.

I did not like it at all. When we finally got into the room, this had a very bad smell, the furniture was really, really old and the A/C was broken. I went to reception to ask, with friendly manners, if the A/C could be fixed as it was a very hot day in Rome and could not stay in a room like that. As it was Summer time in Rome!!!! The GM/receptionist kept going with the rudeness shown before and did call the head housekeeper who was even more rude and had no manners. She told me that they were aware of the failure in the A/C and that the following day would be fixed. I did not accept that answer and asked them for a room change. After several minutes making me feel like a trouble maker, she informed me that there were no more rooms in the hotel as all of them had been reserved for a group of American tourists. The head housekeeper also informed me that the group was very important for them since they were paying much more than me. Quote: \u201cI cannot give you any other room reserved for the Americans because they pay more than you\u201d. After 30 minutes of begging and humiliation, the head housekeeper and the GM/receptionist discussed something in Italian (I do not speak Italian but it is not difficult to be understood by Spanish speakers as myself). I understood something like \u201cgive him room number # so he will not want to move anymore\u201d. I took the key and checked this new room.

The hotel is very close to the main train station, and very easy to find. It was not noisy at night and we managed to get enough sleep. Those are the plus points, so it does do what is required. However if I had booked in for 2 nights, or had children, I would have gone straight out and found another hotel, never mind another room. I am not very fussy though, and told myself it was only for one night. But there are lots of hotels in Rome, and lots in this area, so I should have looked harder, I could have found a better room for less money. I was unhappy the whole time I was there and could not wait to leave. The staff on reception were short with us, not really rude, just not very forthcoming. We had to push them to find out about breakfast, and they wouldn't show us where the room was. We were given the very top room and told there was a couple of steps but in fact there was another flight of narrow stairs we had to carry our luggage up since the lift did not go that high. The room was large but dark and looked dirty, the windows did not close properly and the bathroom door kept opening by itself. The wardrobe would not close properly and the bedside table, desk and curtains looked like they might fall down if you touched them. There was no plug in the sink, which we needed. We couldn't close the bathroom window at all and we woke up cold in the night because of this. There were numerous things that made me realise there was no point in changing rooms, the problem was the whole atmosphere of the hotel. The walls were stained and the wallpaper was peeling. Fortunately the sheets on the bed were clean, so we went out and had something to eat, staying out as late as we could so we spent as little time as possible in the hotel. In the morning breakfast was a totally self-service affair, no sign of any staff at all. There was a coffee machine and the usual buffet but none of it was very good and the coffee was so bad I couldn't finish it. After we had eaten we saw a waitress stick her head around the corner of the room, then go back out again. At no point was anyone clearing tables or replenishing the buffet.

Not a bad breakfast either, no eggs or hot food but plenty of choices. The staff were okay as well. The front desk staff's English wasn't great but I can't fault them for that. Some of the negatives.

Restaurants and bars are few and far between in this area and you needed to walk at least 15 minutes to find something reasonable.

However on arriving at the Hotel Edera we were told that due to a problem with the hot water, they had moved us to the Fiamma, near the Termini. At first we were not happy as the Edera is closer to the Colusseum, and we had heard bad reports about the Termini area. On arriving at the Fiamma, there was a bit of grafitti on the adjoining building (VERY common in Rome) and also although the reception was clean and tidy it smelled a bit damp. However, when we got to our room, it was suprisingly nice. The room was spacious, had a big window and good air conditioning. The bathroom was very modern with a good shower. The sky TV was also great- MTV and CNN channels to keep you amused. Also there is a reasonably sized fridge in the room to keep chilled water and drinks. The hotel was also very quiet- and the breakfast in the morning was good. The location was not really a problem- literally a 2 min walk to the Termini Station. The colosseum is about a 10/15 minute walk and its a nice 30/40 minute stroll along to the Piazza Navona, Pantheon and Trevi Fountain. The Vatican City is quite far away, but you can get a metro from Termini to Basilica St Paul which is 2 mins away from the Vatican for 1 euro and it will take about 10 minutes. There is so many nice sights to look at though that you dont realise how far you have walked! One tip- taxis in Rome are a rip off- it cost us about \u00a310 to travel the equivalent of a 5 minute walk. There are some good bars near to the hotel- at Piazza Dell Esquilino there is a great pub called Druids Rock- cheap pints in Happy hour which lasts till 10pm. Also the Fiddlers Elbow, Finnegans Wake and Marcionis are within 2 mins of Piazza Esquilino. Overall the hotel was perfectly acceptable. I wouldnt say it was 'seedy' like other reviews and we saw no trouble at all in the area. We booked through Expedia so it cost us about \u00a360 a night- Dont pay any more than that though as it wouldnt be worth it. If you want to spend a bit more, I would advise to try and get a hotel nearer to the Piazza Navona- or on Via Veneto- a lovely street that is very central also.
