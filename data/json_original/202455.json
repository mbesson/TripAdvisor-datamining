I've stayed in several other hotels around Prenzlauer Berg, but I'll be coming back to this one. It's one block from a U-Bahn (subway) station. There are plenty of nice places, cafes, restaurant and night life just a few blocks away. The rooms themselves are somewhat rustic but overall in good shape. There is free Wi-Fi but you need to fill out and sign a whole form before they'll give you the password. Having said this, they seem to take their paperwork very seriously, I really needed to fill out every little box on the registration form, with my phone number and all, perhaps the otherwise very friendly lady at the reception was new or perhaps the other hotels I've stayed at in Germany were a bit more lax in that respect. ;-) I haven't had breakfast in my room rate, and I didn't take it in the hotel so I can't make any comment on breakfast here. I do know something though: there is an absolutely fantastic breakfast place called \"Anna Blume\" just a few blocks away around Kollwitzplatz, if you are two people they have a breakfast combo on a three-layer platter that will blow your mind. If you have time in the mornings, try out that option, you won't be disappointed. Good value, I'll be staying here next time I want to be close to Prenzlauer Berg!", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saltspring Island", "Title": "\u201cMike from Saltspring Island\u201d", "Author": "MikeSaltspringIsland", "ReviewID": "UR118507889", "Content": "Stayed three nights the end of August 2011.

Based on this experience my judgment is that its room rate of slightly below one hundred euros including breakfast may be called moderate for Berlin standards in relation to the comfort and the level of service it provides. Hotel Jurine is situated in the nice Prenzlauer Berg quarter of Berlin, fairly close to the next subway station. From there all the major attractions of Berlin can be reached within reasonable travel time by means of public transport. The quarter itself does not only comprise a lot of beautiful old houses but also numerous restaurants and bars of all kinds in bustling streets like Kastanienallee. Thus, there is no need to take the subway or to walk very far just in order to have lunch or dinner. On the contrary, the choice is so wide that it is difficult to decide where to drop in. The entire hotel seems to have been thoroughly renovated only a short time ago and so everything is in excellent shape. The rooms are decorated with taste and the baths are perfect. The evaluation of the quality of beds is always strongly influenced by personal preferences. For me the mattress and the pillow were too soft. But what bothered me most was the fact that the quilt was so thick that I sweated heavily at night although it was cool in the room. If your room is at the back side of the house there is absolutely no noise coming from the outside and you can leave the window open at night. On the other hand, the rooms are only poorly protected against noise from the corridor. So it depends on the fellow guests how often you get disturbed at night. The TV set in the room conforms to the usual standards. However, I missed a dedicated news channel. As a business traveller I would have wished a better illumination of the desk in the room which apart from that permits reading and doing paperwork comfortably and is equipped with WLAN access. Although quite a few cafes in the vicinity of the hotel serve breakfast I recommend to enjoy Hotel Jurine's comprehensive breakfast buffet. It offers virtually everything one could possibly desire to eat in the morning and I consider it as the hallmark of this hotel. In summer you can even take your breakfast in the beautiful garden behind the house to make the enjoyment complete.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel that works at all levels\u201d", "Author": "partner049", "ReviewID": "UR10064205", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Jurine for four nights and found it superb.

What more do you need in a city such as Berlin but a clean room and bathroom and great beds - this hotel has it all. Situated about five minutes' walk from the U-bahn in a quiet area.

The hotel has a parking accommodation which we found quite unique - all I can say about it is that an SUV won't fit, but if you have a normal size car and good driving and manoeuvring skills it's some experience!

People do their job, more or less, efficiently enough, but don't look for friendliness or a smile or chattiness like you find, say, in London. For most Germans being \"korrekt\" and \"sachlich\" is what counts and, sadly, for many businesses that deal with people, the customer is still viewed as someone who disturbs the smooth running of the setablishment. This isn't a review of the Jurine per se, because the service I received there was such that the booking is going elsewhere. My father and sister are coming to Berlin in June 2007 so I am looking for rooms for them. I wandered into the Jurine to enquire about availability - two rooms for five nights. If someone comes to me wanting to spend anything up to \u20ac1,000 (price including breakfast) I'd have been friendly and welcoming. Not so the woman at the front desk who made me feel distinctly unwelcome. Can't think why since I showered this morning and my German is still fluent. Asking questions about the rooms also seemed too much for her, since she just gave me a leaflet and told me it's all there. And while I'm at it, charging \u20ac13.50 for the breakfast buffet is heavy, especially as any of the nearby caf\u00e9s are cheaper. But then discounting the bill by only \u20ac8 if you opt out is (are you listening, the management?) is not a selling point. It leaves the customer wondering why they should pay an extra \u20ac5.50 for something they don't want! So to sum up: lots of hotels in Berlin.
