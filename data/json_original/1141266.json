Have to say it was exactly what I expected and more. My wife was so pleased with our choice of hotel that she has said the next time we decide to visit Dubai, we would defo stay at the Media Rotana. The rooms and the hotel overall was unbelievably clean, the room service was amazing and the customer service within the hotel is second to none. Everywhere you go, be it to the breakfast room, outside the hotel or just walking past the main reception, we were always greeted with a smile and a hello. Made us feel really welcome. All the staff at the Media Rotana were very friendly and helpful. But there was one person at Media Rotana who made our stay at the hotel extra special. He was a young man called \u2018Kenneth\u2019; I just can\u2019t praise him as a person and his customer service enough; Very polite, very helpful and a true gentleman!. As it was our first holiday in Dubai and I did not know what and how to arrange our excursions/trips, Kenneth kindly provided us with his recommendations of what is worth doing and seeing as well as booking all our trips and making sure we were looked after at all times. This made our trips extra enjoyable and headache free. Both me and my wife were so grateful to him that we feel he is a real asset to the Media Rotana. On the location of he hotel, it is in a quite location which was nice, just what we were looking for, The metro was close by which was also a plus (10 min walk) and if you ask anyone, the taxi\u2019s are very cheap so getting to places in Dubai was not a problem.

The room was huge and comfortable. The roof terrance and the pub on the main floor were both great! It isn't in the best location if you don't have a car - but very easy to locate and travel from if you do. The only negative was that I felt like they were constantly rushing us to leave - both on the terrace and in my room. The morning of checkout, there was a knock at the door at 9:00 am and then a glowing message on the TV at 10:30 am asking when we were leaving. Odd since checkout was at noon.

The meal was reasonably priced and was inclusive of wine party hats and crackers and the staff were extremely polite and efficient. After our meal we adjourned to the terrace where not only were we give an excellent disco by the hotel, we had views of the fireworks from the al Arab and the Al Khalifa. On a minus side though, we went into the City about 10am on the Saturday morning and when we returned about 3pm our room had not been made up. We were told the this would take about half an hour but when we retuned then we were told that it would take another half an hour.

The staff are extremely pleasant and very helpful except for a few times when trying to communicate with housekeeping and laundry services.

It overlooked the pool and while we could hear music from the pool bar it was not enough to keep me awake at night and I am a very light sleeper. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries were L'Occitane. The staff at Club Rotana, the business lounge were fantastic and the food was very good. It wasn't heavily used while we were there so it was a nice quiet place to have a snack and drink. The room was well cleaned but not until very late in the day. One day I finally called at 5:45 pm to ask for the room to be cleaned. After that I started asking to have the room cleaned as I was leaving the hotel in the morning. The area is not near the tourist sites. The metro is about a 10 minute walk and is cheap, clean and easy to use. Late October/early November the walk is fine, if a bit dusty, but I wouldn't want to do it in the heat of summer. It takes about 30 minutes to get into town via the metro. Taxis are easy to get and also relatively inexpensive. 38 AED from the hotel to Dubai Mall. Internet City is a very short and cheap taxi ride away.

The front desk people were courteous and professional but check in was way too slow. I asked for a non-smoking room and was given a smoking room. Since I had traveled all day and it was late, I stayed there the first night and it was quite unpleasant. I called the desk in the morning and they apologized and switched me. The new room was very good. Laundry service used twice. Very good and on time. Where the hotel falls down is the restaurants. Breakfast buffet was really a pain in the neck. We had to chase down staff for utensils and coffee. They seemed unable to grasp the concept when two of us arrived and asked for a table for four and explained that our other two were doing some quick business at the front desk. We had to chase down staff for utensils and coffee. Even though we asked several times, our second two people waited and waited for place settings. The buffet was not crowded at that time. It's things like this that irritate people in the mornings. The food was actually really good. We had to catch a midnight flight on the night that we were leaving and decided to get some food on the terrace. We gave ourselves plenty of time but the service was so slow and the servers so detached that we had to wolf our food and run to make it to the airport. It shouldn't take the better part of an hour to serve a club sandwich. The hotel is on the edge of town. Not near anything of interest and nothing is walkable. Taxis are cheap in Dubai so you can get where you need to be without much trouble. I suggest staying near Dubai Creek or on Jumeireh Beach where you'll pay around the same money and be nearer to points of interest. The Sofitel is my point of reference and they beat this hotel as I said in attention to detail. You'll have a decent stay here, but this is Dubai.

The big issue here is that is out of town. Not that far from the Emerates mall but far enough. It takes about 45 mins to drive to the airport. We were in Dubai in Ramadan and for us that was an issue although you can consume alcohol on hotel premises. It was possible to find somewhere to eat at lunch but you had to look and food was expensive in those places that were open. The hotel has good quality rooms, the air con works well and it was not noisy. We had expected some since it is in an area being developed. The staff were very good and helpful. If you take a cab the hoel has them lined up by the exit but these are at a premium price. The standard cabs, which abound, are much cheaper and can be found a few yards away. Beware, though, of walking about; it is incredibly hot and you are advised to go from one air conditioned environment to another. The fountain with music is super and well worth a cab there and back. Take a drink at Carluccio's and watch it in comfort. The shopping, perportedly cheap, is not i.e. in the malls. We shopped in the souk, full of indian and Iranian small shops. Loads of fake goods some of which are good. It is worth seeking out a shop selling perfume both mens and womens. These are the same fragrances that you are familiar with and made in the same factory in Switzerland, the difference being that these are stroinger and oil based. The fragrances last a very long time so you use less. The price is very reasonable. The gold souk and spice souk are interesting. The museum is okay and a trip over the creek on a boat is worthwhile. My advice is to bargain and bargain hard but not in the malls where you are required to pay what is shown. In Debenhams my wife assures me cosmetics were considerably more expensive than they are in my local branch. Food in our hotel was of reasonable quality (Italian|) but portions are not large and it took a while to be served. If you ask the cabbies or the vendors in the souk they will advise you where to eat. We went to a Persian restaurant, very basic but the food was superb, very good value and the atmosphere was very interesting. Breakfast in the hotel was very good, that is if you don't mind turkey bacon. Is that an oxymoron? It was buffet style with freshly made for you omlette or fried eggs. Great variety of fruit.
