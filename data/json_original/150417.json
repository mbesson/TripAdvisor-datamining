This is Hotel El Guajataca. Parador El Guajataca is across the road and not on the ocean. We stayed two nights. There is good handicap accessibility. Every room has a balcony and a view of the ocean. We were on the second floor and the view was gorgeous. Loved sitting on the balcony; loved going to sleep at night listening to the waves break on the shore. Two nice pools. Grounds very well kept. Our only complaint: The floors are brown tile and so do not show dirt. The maid obviously had only been broom-cleaning the floors. They looked clean, but when you walked on them you realized that they were grimey. I had to get her to come in and mop them. It was $98 a night and we were traveling on a budget, so we were willing to put up with that. The room had a king-size bed and ample space. Amenities are minimal. There are 7 steps up to the second floor and 7 steps down to the first floor. The hotel is hard to spot from the road; signage is poor. Going west, take the first right after you pass Merendero Recreation Area. If you see the sign for Tunel de Guajataca, you've gone too far. The plain front belies the beautiful view in the back.

So long was the wait that I went for a walk and returned 20 minutes later figuring this was more than enough time. No such luck! After waiting yet another 10 minutes, I went for a second walk. Upon returning the clerk greeted me courteously but rendered no apology for my wait. I checked into room 202. As soon as I entered, I heard voices from the room next door. Not that the next-door guests were loud. But, the rooms were connected by a common door which was too thin, making it possible for me to hear their conversation. I requested another room. I was sent to room 208. As I made my way to 208, I observed several pieces of litter and an outdoor lamp dangling from exposed wiring. Although this room was not connected to another, I was appalled by what I experienced upon entering. Flies and mosquitoes buzzed around as I took a wiff of a foul odor. The bathroom window had no screen and could not be closed allowing insects to enter. The room's brown floor tiles and decor was dark, drab, and depressing. Given that I was hungry, I left my luggage and proceeded to the restaurant. But...it was closed that day!!! I left disappointed in search of a nearby place to eat. Having found a nearby place, I mentioned my experience to the waitress. She told me how she'd heard similar complaints. She then recommended a place across the road from Guajataca called Parador Vistamar. As soon as I finished my early dinner, I drove to Vistamar and was amazed by what I saw. Not only was the place modern, clean, and with a better view but, the room fees were lower!!! I raced back to Guajataca and told them I needed to check out. They would not reimburse me. I explained the odor and fly issue in room 208. I was handed a bottle of odorizing spray and was told that someone would be there soon with insecticide. \"No thanks\" I said. And with that proceeded to leave minus 118 dollars. I have no regrets for the decision I made. I enjoyed two beautiful days at Vistamar. This is one place I will definitely return to.

All of the rooms have balconies that look out to the pool area and the gorgeous beach. If you stay for 2 nights or more, you can get a package deal that includes breakfast and lunch. The menu was a little limiting but if you can find something that you like it is well worth taking the package offer. You can also drive into the town of Quebradillas to eat. There are a couple of fast food places as well as some of the local cuisine that is very good. Plus there is a grocery where you can stock up on some stuff. One note of caution, from June-August a summer camp is there and the noise level is quite loud by the pool area and if you are located in a room near the pools you can still hear the noise with the door shut.
