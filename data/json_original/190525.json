The free internet terminal in the room is a great idea...except it didn't work. The drain in the shower was blocking up all the time and a few other little things like that but it was fine for what it is. I would stay here again and I would recommend it so it wasn't so bad. Breakfast downstairs was amazing, that was the best part of the whole deal. Make sure breakfast is included. Also, a beautiful Italian restaurant just down the corner you absolutely must visit....

These seem to be in the newer (newer as in ownership rather than build date) part of the hotel and seem to be thinner walled. This leads to excessive noise from the next door rooms and the corridor, although there does not seem to be and exterior noise intrusion. Pay the extra and have the superior room. Free internet access is always a bonus and the location is very good.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cNice little hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Ilona52", "ReviewID": "UR86525790", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed there for 5 nights last November when we visited Berlin for the 20th Anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down. This place was super clean and comfortable, despite the small room size. Probably the only negative thing about it is the fact that there is no elevator and we were on the 4th floor which is non-smoking. Some nights I was so tired I literally crawled up the stairs. Other than that - absolutely no complaints. Staff is friendly and helpful and the free in-room computer/internet was definitely a plus.

I stayed there for the second time and found the rates very reasonable compared with other places in town. The location is directly across the street from the S-Bahn, an ideal starting part for traveling all around the city, and is also directly across from a taxi stand and close to the U-Bahn. Excellent restaurants within walking distance, with delicious local food at good prices. Stores and shops in the other direction. Breakfast downstairs for eight Euros is also good value. Selection not great but certainly adequate, and the fresh baked rolls and bread are excellent. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful, and speaks English. They also provided prompt responses when I made my reservations by e-mail. Rooms are small, but clean and adequately equipped.
