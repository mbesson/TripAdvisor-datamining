I stayed there for 3 nights. It is very close to the hawker food market (great food!) and a 10 minute walk from the MRT (easy and cheap transport by train). You basically walk 10 minutes, take the MRT to Chinatown, Little India and definitely must go is Marina Bay at night. The Skyline of Singapore is just breathtaking. Didn\u00b4t go up the Flyer (biiiig Ferris Wheel at Marina Bay) because it was 30$ per person. Jon, the receptionist was great! He helped us a lot, explained where to go which bus to take etc. He also offers daily free tours around an area of Singapore not in the lonely planet (5pm) which is great since he showed us where the locals go to pray, how to pray in the temples and the meaning of the different rituals. He also took us to a foodcourt for a typical Singapore food. One negative about the dorm room: We stayed upstairs next to the rooftop area which was quite noisy until late at night. That is probably not so bad, but after 11 hour flight and jetlag it is just annoying. Apart from that, the room were small but clean, air conditioned but bathrooms very small. I would still recommend it, because Jon made us feel welcome from the beginning and also good place to get to know people.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Umea", "Title": "\u201cBest in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Peter A", "ReviewID": "UR128039032", "Content": "Best hostel i have ever been to!

Little Red Dot's location, security, and cleanliness is good and I love their free breakfast! I just had a problem with their wifi, I can't connect thru my laptop but thru my iphone, I can. Some of the guests experience the same. Also, they're turning off the air-conditioner from 12noon to 7:00pm. So don't stay in the hostel between those hours. In terms of their staff, I don't like Jonathan. In some of the reviews, the guests say that Jonathan is the good guy. Yes he is, to those people who gives him alcohol drinks! Every night he's drunk! He initiates noise especially at night! Some of the guests don't like him because of his habit. He's arrogant to guests whom he thinks he can't get a drink! I really want to commend SUSU... one of the hostel's staff. He's the real good guy! He doesn't drink and he always clean the hostel. Unlike Jonathan who always drink alcohol and I have never seen him cleaning the hostel! Geeeezz!!! Anyway, I really like Susu, he's accommodating and an honest guy! :) TIP: Don't go with the map that Little Red Dot Hostel's will provide when they send an email to you for booking confirmation. It's inconvenient to walk at the back area of the place especially at night. I think it's not secure to walk there. Just do this: when you're taking the MRT, as you exit the terminal (Lavender Station), turn left then up to the escalator. Turn left again, go straight to the main road, then turn left again go straight and you'll pass by Fragrance Hostel then Hotel 81, from there, I think just a 5-minute walk, you'll see the Little Red Dot! :)", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest hostel in Singapore!\u201d", "Author": "Susannak90", "ReviewID": "UR126316576", "Content": "We had a great stay at the little red dot, the place is modern and clean and staff is very friendly!

The check in is at 3pm so until that time we can let our luggage at the hostel for free. about the room, my dorm was just next to the living area/kitchen....so it was so noisy!! bring your earplugs just in case if you can't stand the noise. There are lockers in the room (but lockers not provided) the beds are simple but confortable. there are showers to share outside the dorms, they are cleans but not very pratical because you don't really know where to put all your stuff. as for the breakfast, there are tea, cereals and bread with exotic marmelad, but I have to say that I didn't even try it because the food is so cheap and good in singapore that I never eat once at the hostel (even though, I don't even think that there is a kitchen there...) so to conclude, I think the hostel is not bad, maybe I didn't have the best room, I can't say don't go there because it is a nice place after all, but improvement can be done.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Stockholms L\u00e4n, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cJonathan made Singapore so much better!\u201d", "Author": "Lyrran", "ReviewID": "UR125606946", "Content": "Really nice staff.

If it wasn't for Jonathan I don't even think I would be writing this review as I had to tell all other travelers about the amazing individual who will do anything to make sure you enjoy your time in Singapore. I have sent along 3 different groups of friends to this hostel since I last stayed and they have all been well looked after. Thank you Jonathan for ensuring this. All in all, the hostel has similar facilities as the other hostels in the area, free wifi, breakfast etc but what makes this different is the staff.
