{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Friendly and informative We stayed at the Duilio for two days on our trip of Italy. The hotel owner, Vicenzo is a very friendly man and is a great guide in giving you the history of the place as well as the culture and cuisine. The rooms were very comfortable except for the bathrooms which were small. Besides, the hotel was more like a house and hence gave us a comfortable stay. The walk by the river in the evenings was an added advantage of staying in the hotel besides, being a quiet place.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR247065314", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "World_tours"}, {"Content": "Loved it First, the hotel is at the top of four flights of stairs and does not have a lift. Secondly however, Vincenzo carried our bags up for us - PHEW!!. On arrival he made us two lovely cups of coffee which were needed after our travelling that day. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. There is a fantastic selection of books in the lobby outside which I thought was a lovely touch. Breakfast is not provided on the premises, but you are given a coupon for a coffee and cake (traditional Italian breakfast) at a near by coffee shop. I thought this was a great idea as all the other hotels we stayed in did not provide breakfast at all. Our room was ensuite and the bathroom was a wet room, but that didn't cause any problems. The location is about 10- 15 minutes walk from Il Duomo and everything else central. It's a good location in a safe area with some lovely restaurants near by. I loved walking down by the river in the mornings and I recommend getting up early and walking down to the Ponte Vechhio before all the tourists are out and about. It's a beautiful stroll.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR845004061", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DublinJamie"}, {"Content": "Vincenzo, the Superstar Host of Florence!

We stayed at Hotel Duilio entirely by accident, as we ended up being in Florence longer than expected. We got the lowest low season rate in the middle of August, so it's worth looking around at last minute deals. We stayed for two nights and loved it. Vincenzio is very friendly and helpful, and the lobby is stocked with tons of information and books, e.g. a Lonely Planet for Florence, which can come in handy for the ill-prepared traveller! It is on a quiet street which is a short leisurely stroll along the Arno river - not right in town, but it's kind of nice to get away from the crowds. It is up a couple of flights of stairs, but Vincenzio kindly offered to help us with our bags. The room was not large and we had a shared bathroom, but there was a sink and bidet in the bedroom and it was otherwise well-appointed (e.g. a REAL double bed not two singles pushed together, a fan, and a bug repellent plug-in). We were given a voucher for breakfast at a nearby cafe which turned out to be lovely - fresh, still-warm pastries and espresso at the bar with real Florentine businessmen! Also there was WiFi in the room at no extra cost, which went down when we were there, but is a great service and not so easy to find in Florence.", "Date": "Aug 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR109382318", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kewb"}, {"Content": "Great way to do Florence on a budget We just got back from a three night stay in Florence, where we stayed at the Hotel Duilio.We picked the hotel based on three factors1) Cost2) Trip Advisor Ratings3) LocationHappy to say it didn't disappoint on any of these. The location was fine for us, being a pleasant 5-10 stroll along the river into the historic centre. It was also nice and quiet at night, as it was near the US Embassy so the road access was restricted.Our room (upstairs) was spotless, adequately sized and quiet. The bathroom was small-ish, and the shower not particularly strong, but again it was spotless.As every reviewer says, the owner, Vincenzo, was extremely helpful, and made our stay all the more welcoming.Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for people looking to explore Florence within a budget.", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR749401087", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sendittojack"}, {"Content": "Love love love Hotel Duilio!       hallway to our upstairs room", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR169574757", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mariss2323"}, {"Content": "Great little place I stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine a couple of years ago.

Vicenzo and his family were very nice and so very accomodating on our last night of our 14 day honeymoon but that was not enough for us. Upon arrival, we had to walk several flights of stairs with our luggage and about half way up, he Vicenzo came down and helped me with mine. He allowed us to put our things in our room well before check-in time so that we could walk around, which was very nice as well. The room was so-so. Nothing nice but being that it was the last day of our honeymoon and our flight was leaving from the Florence airport at 6:30 am, we really didn't think we'd care bc we wouldn't be fully using the hotel. We made it back to our hotel after a long, final day of tourist shopping in the flea market areas and were getting ready for bed when the problems began. The walls here were paper thin, if anyone in that place moves, you definitely will know about it!! Our room also had the neon Hotel Duilio sign outside of the window which shined through the window, bright as day, all night long!! We also had to leave the window open for air circulation and as people were leaving the bar down the street, we heard them screaming and partying til about 4am!! There was a gentleman in the room next to ours that talked on the phone all night long and we heard every word of his conversation too!! Overall it was the worst idea to go cheap on the last night and we decided that we will never do this again....we will pay triple the price so we can get a good night's rest.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR218868221", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sparklysparky"}, {"Content": "This is my new Florence Hotel Vicenzo and his wife welcomed us with warm smiles.
