Provided lots of tourist tips, printed tickets for the Hagai Sophia so we avoided queues - they couldn't have been more helpful. Wi fi in rooms.Rooms clean, fresh, and the team are truly hospitable. The breakfasts are fantastic with honey combs on racks, fresh cheeses, fruits, meats and fresh baked muffins. (The post holiday diet soon followed!) It is a well priced mid range , great value hotel. The concierge also arranged our return transfer, provided ferry times to the Princes Islands and the Bosphorus. Do tip the room maid and the concierge - they really deserve it - the whole family felt most welcome. Top tips - don't fall for shoe shine tricks ...avoid carpet shops ...we staggered the week by alternating city trips with ferry trips. Musts: Roman underwater cisterns, blue mosque, hagia sophia, turkish bath & massage, and grand bazaar. Try more local restaurants off the beaten track - the food is great and fresh bread will be cooked, kebabs are great... baklava too.

I chose this hotel based on price and location (and previous reviews). They did an excellent job in making my trip a very pleasant one. From arrival and check-in to a very early morning check-out, everything was handled smoothly and professionally. We booked directly through the hotel website (which I always think is best for any hotel) and we were able to take advantage of the special offering free transport to the hotel from airport and the free meal in the hotel restaurant which was excellent (see my review of the Pasazade restaurant). Check-in was smooth and the room was very comfortable. I emailed ahead and specifically asked for a room in the newer wing with a balcony. Our room was spot on, nice size - with a nice balcony with a small table and two chairs which over-looked a small but atmospheric street behind the hotel. The window/door was sealed tight and shut out noise. It was very quiet in the room. We could hear some sounds in the hall and room next door - but nothing different than any other hotel. The room (and hotel as a whole) was spotlessly clean. No faults here. The housekeeping service was fine. The bathroom was a nice size and had a shower only with great pressure and hot water. No problems here. The room safe was in the small closet. It would not open for us on the second day - we called the desk - and it was very promptly fixed. The staff at the front desk later asked if it was still working ok - follow-up - that is a great thing. The breakfast each morning was very good and offered a large selection of food, from fresh vegetables (the tomatoes and cucumbers were especially good), breads, cereals, and egg/meats, juice, coffee and of coarse, tea. A nice touch was the daily newsletter provided at each table with tidbits of information about the city and the current weather and upcoming events - it even had a little Turkish language lesson each morning. The location of the hotel was one of the best points. Close to the tram (Gulhane) stop, walking distance to many of the major sites. A couple of small grocery-type stores where very close (we made friends at one little store across the street and to the left), lots of restaurants nearby and tourist-type shopping too. The value (excellent price), service (outstanding), location (perfect), cleanliness (spotless) make it easy for me to say I would stay here again without hesitation.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGood Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "Alex R", "ReviewID": "UR126814320", "Content": "The Erboy hotel is a *** star hotel in Istanbul.

I enjoyed both of these hotels and wouldn't hesitate to recommend either of them. To me, their prices seemed very fair for a large urban city. I had reserved a couple of nights at the Erboy just to start our journey, and then when I went back to add more nights, the Erboy was booked so I added some nights at the Orient Express. First, the desk staff has had excellent training and is just terrific. Upon arrival at both hotels, the front desk staff provides you with a map and helps you determine where to go if you are sightseeing. The desk staff is consistently friendly and helpful at both hotels and willingly answers questions. Second, at the Erboy, you are given apple tea upon arrival--it's great. At the Orient, there was Turkish Delight left in the room. Third, the rooms at both hotels were sufficiently clean and nice. I reserved a triple (3 twins) for two people online at Expedia at the Erboy just to have extra space, and when we first arrived, we were upgraded to a quad (one double, two twins). The room had no real view but was very quiet and comfortable with a flat screen TV with remote. I had reserved a twin at the Orient Express and it was a smaller room which I expected. The beds were pushed together but there was room to move around, and I hadn't asked for a larger room. The TV was older but still had a remote. I preferred the larger bathroom at the Erboy but I suspect the Orient Express has rooms with larger bathrooms as well so I am comparing apples to oranges here. We had hot water at both hotels. Fourth, the location of both hotels is terrific. The Erboy is up a hill about 2 blocks from the Orient Express. You walk down a manageable incline street (with restaurants and shops along the side) to reach the Orient Express which is on the tram line with the access to the tram a short distance away. The Orient Express was on a busier street but I had requested a quiet room and got one. Both hotels are within easy walking distance of the Topkapi Palace, the Haigia Sophia, and the Blue Mosque. There is also shopping within walking distance. The tram line only costs 2 TL and is very easy to use. (Get some 1 TL pieces and put them in the automated machine for a token at the access point.) Both hotels are also within easy walking distance of the Sirkeci train station. We caught a suburban train which also cost only 2 TL one way (uses a different token but uses same method to get a token). There was a convenience mart across the street from the Orient Express to buy a soda or bottled water. There was probably one nearby the Erboy as well. One night I couldn't find a small bill to pay for the water and the propietor of the shop across from the Orient Express was going to let me take it on credt--wow! I did finally find a small bill to pay. Fifth, both hotels had wireless which worked and had two computers for guests to use near the lobby with internet access and a printer. Sixth, the breakfast at both hotels was very similar--lots of fine bread, cheeses, cucumbers, olives, at least a couple of hotter items, tea, etc. I have no complaints about the breakfasts and enjoyed them. Seventh, the Orient Express had a nice looking pool that we didn't use. I would recommend either hotel wholeheartedly. They are at least as good as any Holiday Inn Express I have stayed in and actually have better breakfasts, more services, and more outstanding staff than I usually encounter at hotels. Each hotel also had a restaurant although we didn't have time to use them.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Bucuresti, Romania", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

We stayed at the Erboy which is literally two short blocks from the Tram, which will take you anywhere on the line for 2TL. We were able to walk to many of the major sights on days that we weren't willing to ride the Tram (they can be very crowded). The area is full of great restaurants offering everything from traditional Ottoman, Turkish, Italian, Thai and Continental cuisine. The hotel itself is a nice basic hotel. The rooms are small as is standard for the region, but absolutely big enough to unload the suitcases and still have room to move. The rooms are clean and have the expected tea and coffee available. Maid service was available everyday, we only used it twice as we didn't need a full cleaning, but each time it was done it was done well. We ordered take out one night instead of heading out to a restaurant and were so happy with the cheese and fruit plates, bread, olive oil and tea for 30TL that we ordered in the next night too, much cheaper than going out! The rooms come with a safe for storing passports etc, our laptops fit in as well. The one thing that I will say that was not great, was that the walls are fairly thin and you could hear other people coming and going, conversations in the hall etc. It wasn't enough to keep me from going back as it was quiet at night, but if you are sensitive to that you might want to be aware... The complimentary breakfast was traditional Turkish: bread, cheeses, yogurt, beautiful honey comb, jams, meats, dried fruits, also continental stuff: cereal, scram eggs, homefries and lots of fruit. The staff could not have been more helpful, arranging transportation to and from the airport that was efficient, affordable and friendly. My flight home was early and they offered me a complimentary boxed breakfast to take with me. Both drivers spoke English and were only too happy to point out the sights and give some interesting history. The transportation from the airport was complimentary as was our first night's dinner, in the hotel restaurant, which was lovely and the service was exceptional. The return trip to the airport was 25TL, so less than $15, a great value for a private transport with friendly drivers! Traveling alone to and from the airport as a middle aged woman in this HUGE city was a concern, but I never felt uncomfortable. I had a few questions prior to my stay, all were answered by e-mail within 24 hours by the hotel Guest Relations Manager, Ayse Sancak. They were obviously concerned that we have a positive stay, even following up with an e-mail \"thank you\" once I returned home. This is NOT a luxury hotel, what it is, is a great basic hotel with a nice restaurant, great staff and a terrific location. I paid $500 USD for 6 nights which included a a complimentary dinner, breakfast every morning and transportation from the airport.

So it is quite easy to go and see a few things and then come back to the hotel and then go out again. Makes for a very relaxing experience. The other major advantage is that it is about 50 yards from the tram stop which makes getting to and from the airport an absolute breeze (there is an easy connection from the tram stop to the metro line to the airport total cost 4TL/person and about one hour). Although we didn't do it the tram also runs across the Golden horn to the new district. There is an elevator so getting to one's room is not an issue. The rooms are small but quite comfortable - but the TV leaves a lot to be desired. Don't plan on taking a tub bath because there isn't, one but the shower is good sized with good water pressure and hot water and the size of the bathroom is adequate. Everything was clean. The breakfast has all the traditional fare- is the same every day but there is plenty of choice so it is possible to vary breakfast each day. The staff were very polite and helpful. Didn't try the wifi in the room but the computers (2) in lobby were generally available. The major drawback is the noise - from the street and the hallway but strangely not from the rooms next door.

As this was only for 1 night, we did not complain. We enjoyed a good sleep and upon leaving requested a better room for our 4 night return stay after visiting the Aegean coast. The 2nd time around we were shown to what seemed to be a pleasant room overlooking Ebusuud Street. Our pleasant, somewhat larger room (also without a suitcase stand) turned out to be extremely noisy. The ablution sounds from surrounding guests did not spare the imagination! Furthermore, late into the night we were bothered by noises, which we thought were coming from the floor above. Upon enquiry the following morning, we were told that it was 'a party on the terrace'. However, the 'party on the terrace' was in full swing again the following evening! We investigated and can only assume that the strange thumping, scraping noises were in fact the workings of the lift mechanism. Otherwise, this is a pleasant enough basic hotel with good breakfast and restaurant facilities. Just be sure to request a room that is neither at the back of the building nor on the floor below the terrace. One word of caution: When paying for external services (i.e. shuttle/tour) at the front desk, do request a receipt for monies handed over. Shifts change and it could be that no one has a record of your request and/or payment.

The Erboy is the only central Istanbul hotel we have stayed in and have no reason to consider any other in future. We were picked up from the airport by a driver waiting with a name card. This transfer service (free if you book direct and stay a certain number of nights) was very welcome after a long journey and the struggle to get through the airport formalities. Tip: keep some one Lira coins for the airport trolleys. The hotel also offer a free) dinner in their highly rated Pasazade restaurant (if you book direct and stay a certain number of nights). This time we had two rooms, both of which were of a good size and very clean. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job of keeping them clean and tidy. We were so impressed by them that we left some tips. Everything worked properly. The air conditioning was very good in both rooms and definitely needed at this time of year. Value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think this hotel represents excellent value as a good three star hotel close to the main tourist attractions and the tram system. It certainly had all the facilities we wanted. Service - The reception staff spoke very good English and have always been very helpful. Sinan even managed to cope with my sense of humour and the Customer Services Manager, Ayse - was, as always, extremely helpful and she never stopped smiling! Since our previous visit, tea and coffee facilities have been provided in rooms, which was a very welcome addition. In the total of about 3 weeks we have stayed here on the three occasions, we have never had any serious issue or complaint and anything we raised with the hotel was dealt with quickly. For example, we asked for some plates and they arrived within a few minutes. Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we like the location. It is not in the noisy area of Sultanahmet but the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sophia are only about 10 minutes walk up a gentle slope. The Topkapi Palace is about 10 minutes away if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a steep incline or about 20 minutes using a much gentler route going around the Aya Sofia. The tram station is about two minutes away. The docks for the ferries are about 10 minutes walk away. The Spice Bazaar about 15 minutes walk and the Grand Bazaar about 10 minutes by tram.

The breakfast at the hotel was superb. The room we got was recently renovated and aircon was good. The icing on the cake was the wasroom. Towels were new and fresh and the force in shower was amazing. I had the best shower here in 8 day Turkey trip. Here we made payment in cash and got seven per cent discount.. WoW!

The reviews on Trip Advisor clinched it for us - so many positive things said about staff and service at the Erboy...and in our experience, all well deserved! The location was perfect - five-ten mins walk to the major sights, a picturesque part of the old town with cobbled streets, a sumptuous, generous and tasty breakfast, wonderfully warm and friendly and helpful concierge services. We called on their help for a day trip booking, a converter plug, a lighter/matches, etc. We actually felt more confortable than usual asking favours of our hotel reception and found ourselves calling upon them more than usual! We were welcomed with a cup of tea and an introduction to Istanbul when we arrived, were provided with our room keys, maps, leaflets and an explanation of all the latest deals immediately after arriving. The hotel explained their two latest deals - if we paid in cash in advance, we'd receive 7% off - it doesn't sound much, but in actual fact, it brought our daily room rate down to about 69euro, a price we would usually pay in some places. We also qualified for their one nights free dining in their hotel restaurant. It included entree, main and dessert (not drinks) and the meal was stunning - the best we had in Istanbul; traditional Ottoman cuisine, and in fact their Pasazade restaurant is the top rated restaurant on Trip Advisor for Istanbul. It's very well priced, has super service and offers delicious, interesting dishes. I'll put a more detailed review on Trip Advisor under Pasazade though. The hotel room was cleaned daily to an excellent standard, looked brand new (we were in room 2302) and had all the usual amenities, plus a kettle, tea and coffee, which can be unusual for European 3 star hotels. An extra note, our room was the only one with a proper balcony, while others had a kind of narrow fire escape space, so you might benefit from requesting our room!

Pro: - Good size room, modern design & amnenities. Very clean. - Excellent location, tram is down the road and Sultanahmet square is within easy stroll - Value for money bonuses: free private pick up for 3+ nights, free welcome dinner @ Pasazade for 4+ nights (now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s min 5 nights), 7% cash payment discount, 10% Sirkeci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s group restaurant discount. - On time private transfer (not shuttle); the car smells like cigarette though; thank God the room is okay. - Free wifi. Speed is good. - Responsive to emails/queries. Cons (Nothing too alarming, but if I have to pinpoint): - Terrible currency exchange rate (we were paying in USD while they quoted in Euro); you better exchange outside/from ATM. Even rate in airport is much better! - Room key doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work after few days; had to go to receptionist to fix it. They did not apologize at all for the inconvenience! - If you stayed at their cheaper room; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not renovated. Experience would not be as good. - Our room is at 5th floor but the elevator only goes up to 4th floor. We had to use manual stairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for us it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a concern (young couple with only 1 luggage); but just FYI.

Actually we could recommend the hotel for everyone looking for clean, cosy hotel with friendly staff, great location and reasonable pricing. Positive experiences started due to reservation directly through the Hotel's own reservation system, which worked OK. I received e-mail welcoming us and giving tips and hints for our stay from guest relations manager, Ayse. After receiving the welcome note I started to bother Ayse with total of 15 e-mails. Most of those mails she answered within 30mins, which is on my opinion super fast, especially from 3 star hotel, which was packed with people. During our mails I changed room type, made some special arrangements for our wedding anniversary, reserved a car seat for our baby and transportation from airport. Everything before arrival was arranged extremely well by Ayse. With our arrival everything continued to go as planned. Transportation was waiting at the airport and was quite fluent to the hotel. At the hotel all paper work was done for us while we were sitting an enjoying ice tea. Ayse shared us the highlights of old city, gave us a map and opening hours for the targets of our interests. When going our room everything was as planned - wine open and huge flower bouquet on the bed. Great start. The room itself was in style and glass following \"scandinavian style\". Very nice materials, good quality air conditioning, large room (superior), fridge. That room could be placed in any new Scandic or Hilton hotel and I wouldn't notice a difference. Already from the beginning it also was easy to notice that cleaning lady on our floor was doing excellent job - that I can't always state about Scnadic hotels ;). Since travelling with a 4 month old, we ended up to use hotel restaurants more than we usually do. The quality of food was actually positive surprice, and especially the service on the roof terrace was outstanding. The whole crew was great, and for example dancing our boy on bar table, but still biggest affect on us did the fellow with moustache (sorry, forgot the name). Our very best for the whole team on the picture! Some people have stated here that breakfast could be better. I agree, but still there was nothing missing and comparing price, stars and variety of food I think the combination is good. Since other elements were higher than our expects, maybe breakfast was just on our expectations - and our expectation are not too modest I must admit. As a conclusion I would say this is one of the nicest hotel experiences I've had. Erboy meets the standards for 4 star hotel, which is not the cases every time in 4 star hotels in Europe. Staff at Erboy were willing to go that extra mile for making our stay extremely pleasant, as an example someone brought his/her own baby seat for our airport transportations. That describes quite well how much these people were willing to do. Special thanks to person offering the baby seat, Ayse for all the support, roof top terrace crew and to our cleaning lady on block 2, 4th floor.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belek", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, staff, location, food, everything was fantastic\u201d", "Author": "belekvillas", "ReviewID": "UR102352986", "Content": "My mother and I stayed at the Erboy hotel, our first ever trip to Istanbul.

It was obvious that the room had been recently renovated. In addition to the outstanding cleanliness, there were several features I really appreciated. First of all, in every room I have ever had in Europe there has always been a shortage of electrical plugs. Not so at the Erboy. There were four easy to reach plugs available in the room. Second, the shower was a wand with fantastic water pressure. You could almost pressure blast the dirt off you. Finally, I really appreciated the fact that the bathroom had a window in it. I hate steaming up the hotel room. I also want to note that the hotel staff is very gracious and helpful. They simply cannot do enough for you. We had an early departure flight and they offered to make up a quick breakfast for my wife and me before our departure, two hours before they served breakfast.

My impressions of the hotel are very, very good.

I have to single out Tolga from the front office team, who is very kind, efficient and professional. The other hotel staff is also great, professional and helpful. I also benefited from the promotions offered for making a reservation via the hotel website: free transport from the Ataturk airport for 3 or more nights stay, 7% discount for paying in cash upon check in, welcome dinner for 4 or more nights stay and a family card for 10% discount in Sirkeci group. Ottoman cuisine Pasazade Restaurant in the hotel is very good, with reasonable prices and friendly staff. Room was very clean, quiet and comfortable. Nice surprise is a water boiler with a complimentary tea and coffee bags that you can prepare and enjoy quietly after an exciting sightseeing day. Room has a safe box (a laptop fits in - although I have to say I felt very safe at the hotel due to kindness and professionalism of the staff, so I didn't feel like using the safe box). Buffet breakfast is of very good quality, much better than one usualy gets in the hotels. Generally, value you get for the price at the Erboy Hotel is very good, at much higher level than in 3 star hotels. Location of the hotel is very convenient, in a quiet and safe Sirkeci area, within a few minutes walking distance from Sultanahmet Square. If you are tired to walk, from the G\u00c3\u00bclhane tram station near the hotel you can easily reach most of the interesting spots both in the Old City and Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu. The Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc dock for Bosporus cruising is also within walking distance or easily reachable by tram. I will definitely go back to Erboy Hotel and recommend it to friends.

Well, it is. Erboy DOES NOT solicit positive reviews from their guests. When we returned home, we got a polite email from the hotel, asking about our flight and inviting us to post our opinions on Tripadvisor. There was not pressure whatsoever to make a positive comment, nor was there any incentive to be less than truthful about our stay. So here's my two cents' worth: Erboy is a great value, in an absolutely perfect location for enjoying the Old City, and every positive comment about the staff and the food at Pasazade Restaurant is right on the mark. There are plenty of reviews about room size, etc., so I'll post some less common factors: We qualified for a free shuttle and chose to use it on arrival. If for some reason your shuttle driver isn't there to meet you (this happened to us), the staff at the information kiosk just beyond the ground transportation greeting area will phone the hotel for you. Brita filtered water and the makings for tea are supplied in the room, and these were restocked each day. If you want inexpensive bottled water (or other drinks or snacks), pop across the street to Unal Market. There's also a pharmacy across the street should you need it. We had a small balcony (Room 3302) and the windows were absolutely soundproof. Although the hotel is very near several mosques, we were never disturbed by the early morning calls to prayer. We were also very near the elevator, but since we were only a couple floors up, most people used the stairs. The elevator noise could be a problem on upper floors; if you're worried about it, just ask. The staff are great! Engage the staff in your plans! Aysa and Jada were both a great resource, and in no time had us oriented to the city--and confident enough to use public bus transport for many of our excursions (an entertainment we're glad we didn't miss). Our bed was VERY firm, and instead of a full comforter or spread had only a narrow strip of decorative fabric at the foot. We found that the air conditioner/heater worked very well, so it wasn't a problem. The only downside was at times an unpleasant smell from the bath, but it wasn't bothersome enough to complain about. If we had said something, I'm sure the staff would have found some way to deal with it. I hope you have a great trip--we loved Istanbul, and we're already planning our return.

The room is a little bit small for three people, but it was warm and cosy. The bathroom is clean and looked new - although climbing into the shower's 2 feet partition can be a challenge for some. Hotel Erboy is located a block away from the tram station Gulhane, close to the Topkapi Palace. One can pretty much walk to the Sultanahmet area in one direction, or to Eminonu ferry station in the other. The alleys behind the hotel are quaint and replete with boutique restaurants and cafes. Explore the alleys a little further for cheap, good eats. The roof-top bar is not always open due to weather, but when it is, it is perfect for some wine or beer and catching up to the days activities. One can then proceed to the main restaurant at the below-lobby level. The food is good, but not great. The breakfast spread is probably the fanciest kind you would find in Turkey with a good spread.

Always check prices and do haggle in advance over everything including beer and food otherwise you will pay unneccessarily inflated prices. Shops near Erboy were selling many items at lower cost than i was able to get in the grand bazaar. again, the bazaar is spectacular, but in my opinion asking prices are about 70% above what you need to pay. Be friendly and firm and you can get what you want for a fair price. remember turkey is a poor country and their average shop/ bar worker has a 12-15 hour working day for between \u00c2\u00a310 and \u00c2\u00a320 per day wages. There is no justification for charging \u00c2\u00a33-\u00c2\u00a34 for a large beer. Final note, I didnt use a single taxi and was exceptionally impressed by the trains, trams and ferries.

Our flight into IST touched-down at 6.00 in the morning and naturally i was skeptical if the hotel would actually send someone to pick us up at the airport like they have advertised on their website. The guy was there alright, so far so good. Checking-in was quick and we were given our room immediately. Location of this hotel is just perfect. Very near to the sights,shops, restaurants, tram-line, piers and all the must-visit places..all within walking distance.As others have mentioned, the room size is small, so too is the bathroom. Anyway, it doesn't bother us as we are out most of the time. More importantly, the room and bathroom were kept tidy and clean whenever we got back to the hotel later in the day. Breakfast spread was good, fresh and plentiful but they dished out the same thing every morning so you tend to get bored after the 3rd day or so. Anyway, you can always grab something else to eat at almost every street in Istanbul. We find the hotel staff, especially at the front office, friendly, efficient and are more than willing to help us out with our daily itinerary and special thanks to Cigdem and Sinan for making our stay at Erboy a memorable one.

This is not only an excellent value hotel for the prices charged, but one that is made exceptional by the care and service of the staff. We booked originally through Expedia and because it was our wedding anniversary I asked the hotel directly for champagne and flowers to be in the room. We unfortunately had to cancel due to the Volcanic ash flight ban on the night before travelling. The Erboy agreed to waive their late cancelation fee. We then tried to book again through Expedia for the resheduled flight 4 days later but there was apparently no room at the Erboy. I however used the hotel's website where I was able to book for the required dates. Not only is this worth knowing if you want to book the Erboy, but, as others have stated the first night's dinner was complimentary - and it is was well received. (Also, if you pay cash for your booking when you arrive they give you a 7% discount on the room booking). Anyway, having booked the room, and rebooked the champagne and flowers with Ayse (the excellent guest relations manager) we were forced to cancel again when it was apparent that the airban was unlikely to be lifted. Again, we were not charged. Remarkably, the ban was lifted and I rebooked for the 3rd time, 4 hours before our actual departure! I didn't reorder the flowers & champagne as our anniversary had passed and I was giving the hotel no notice. When we arrived (after travelling by taxi in a very busy Istanbul - the streets are manic and the driving is atrocious!), we were greeted by the very pleasant hotel manager who was as pleased to see us as we were to be there. The hot apple tea we were given on arrival has now become a favourite of mine. The room was probably one of the the better ones in the hotel. It is not luxury but it is certainly excellent value especially for Istanbul. We went out for our first walk through the bazaars and when we came back the room had a lovely bouquet of flowers and champagne on ice (and a few other nice personal touches that were certainly gratefully appreciated). The complimentary meal in the evening was very nice and we booked the following night in the sister hotel restaurant Imbat. There, we also had a very pleasant meal, although we did wait some time for the sweet menu - the reason being, was that they had prepared a lovely surprise sparkling cake and announced to the restaurant that it was our 25th anniversary to applause - another very nice touch that made it a very special evening.

We originally stayed for 5 nights but came back for 7 more after the volcanic ash disruption.

This was quick and comfortable. When we got to the hotel, we were offered apple tea which was very welcome and, after our travels, very much appreciated. During our two stays we experienced three different double rooms. The first was fairly small, in line, I understand, with other hotels in Istanbul. I was woken up by noise from one of the lifts and asked if we could change rooms. Without hesitation, they said we could and asked us to pack up our belongings and leave the bags in the room when we went out. When we returned from being tourists for the day, our bags had been transferred to the other room. We had, in fact, been upgraded to one of the largest rooms. We really liked this room which appeared to have been recently renovated. There was a small LCD TV with 5 English channels (3 news and two movies). The bathroom was a good size though the lighting in it could have been better. Having completed our holiday we went to the airport. Our flight was the first one to London to be cancelled because of the volcanic ash cloud. The airline took us to a 5-star hotel which we disliked because of its location outside Istanbul and its terrible service. We put up with it for 2 nights and then went back to the Erboy until we could fly back a week later. There were many people stranded by the air travel chaos but the Erboy, to its credit, did not try to exploit people by raising its prices. When we arrived, we were again given apple tea and they reminded us (without any prompting from us) that we were again eligible for the free dinner. On this occasion we again had one of the recently renovated rooms which was of a good size. We felt lucky to get a room at the Erboy which seemed to be filling up with people stranded by the ash cloud chaos. The staff are excellent and it is the service which really impressed us. I would particularly compliment Ayse (pron: eye shay), the Customer Relations Manger and Sinan at the front desk both of whom treated us very well, more like friends than customers. We decided to wait out the airline problems but I saw Ayse spending a lot of time helping others with travel arrangements. The other staff were also very good and by the time we left we were happily joking around with them. When we did leave, Ayse and others came outside and saw us off (and that is definitely a first in my experience of hotels!). When we arrived the second time, we asked Ayse for tea cups. We received these within minutes. However \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this is what set the service here apart \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we also received plates and full sets of cutlery without us even asking! The location of the Erboy is excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very close to a Tram stop and a gentle slope between the two. It is also only about 5 minutes walk to St. Sophia and the Blue Mosque and in a quieter area than touristy Sultanahmet. Not once did the azan (call to prayer) wake me up. Breakfast was plentiful and there was a wide range of food. It did not change much from day to day but we did not find this to be a problem given the range of food available. The hotel restaurant (Pasazade) was very good and reasonably priced. To summarise, it was the outstanding service and thoughtfulness (particularly when we were stranded in Istanbul) that really impressed us. Would I recommend the Erboy?

This is certainly a hotel for all visitors who wish to stay in the central of Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractions without spending too much on their accommodation.

The room is of reasonable size by European standard and you can get free wifi in the room with your own laptop, hairdryer, air-condition, central heating and a flat screen TV.

The hotel is also about 100 metres away from the tram station of Gulhane and you can take a tram from there all the way across Galata Bridge to Kabatas and then change to take the funicular to Taksim and experience the night life of Istanbul at the very lively Istiklal Avenue.

The breakfasts are of the best quality and there is plenty of it too, not rubbish food either! Do visit as soon as you can before the city prices rise further (it's still good value there now) because of the 2010 status \"city of culture\". My friend had booked us a double room for neglecting to state we were just 2 female \"friends\", so a double bed had been allocated. As soon as the receptionist saw us he asked if we would prefer to swop it for a twin without us even having to ask. The en-suites are very good, showers that actually work and hairdryers too. Comfy beds and clean pillows even. Everything is within a short walk from the hotel and there is no need to ever use a taxi. Even the feri-boats connecting east to west (Europe to Asia) are a short walk away. Atatrk Int. is the closest airport to Istanbul but if you fly into the Sab. Go. airport which is well outside Istanbul (but easyjet, so cheaper) it is still easy to reach the hotel for total of 3 turkish liras (\u00c2\u00a31.30p) by using public transport. Leave a/port, jump on local bus just outside signed to \"Karakoy\" pay fare of 1.5 liras. Leave bus at terminus at Karakoy. Hop off bus and straight onto ferryboat to \"Eminonu\" fare 1.5 liras.These both run so frequently that there is no need to consult a timetable. Leave ferryboat and walk 10 mins(if you don't know the area then follow the tram lines up from the normal train main station) to hotel or if lazy get the local tram for one stop only! 2 mins maximum walk from tram stop,named \"Gulhame\", and you are inside Erboys' welcoming reception. Go tomorrow! Don't bother with the main normal trains in Istanbul, or Turkey in general, as they are not much use at all and it is easy to get anywhere using public buses etc. Last year I began in Istanbul (solo 64 yr old female) and backpacked for 7 weeks covering Ankara, Antalya, Adana, Antakya, Cappadocia, Goreme (not to be missed) etc.etc. and even when I was very close to the borders of Syria and Iran I felt safe.

Of course, the driver had tried to overcharge us, and when he saw the staff member walking out with me, he quickly chopped of 15 lira from the tab. :) Anyways, as we were checking in, the staff told me I could take a free upgrade to a 5 star hotel right down the street, which just happened to be rated # 1 on this site out of 352 hotels in istanbul, the Sirkeci Konak hotel. I was skeptical and almost turned down the offer, thinking it was a scam, but Im glad I didnt. I will also write a review on the Konak, but based on the help with the cab and free upgrade I had to leave a positive review for the Erboy!

I stayed at Hotel Erboy after considering several other places nearby. I'm glad I picked this location. The Guest Relations Manager (Ms. Ayse Sancak) patiently helped me with my questions prior to my reservation. This helped me decide on the property. She set a fine example of great customer service. Once I decided, she helped me with the directions to the property. I took the tram from IST airport and Erboy was very easy to find after getting off. Upon arrival, I was greeted with an apple tea on the house. Ms.Sancak was there at the reception when I arrived. Though I had planned my itinerary for the duration of my stay, she offered her opinion about the key attractions, changes in timings, closings due to construction etc. She also ensured I got the specific room I asked for, that was away from the elevator and had a window view to the Bosphorous. Thereafter, she handed over responsibilities to the reception staff. They worked as a team and ensured my stay was comfortable. Now, to the specifics: 1. Breakfast: Good variety that suits both regional and international travelers. Continental breakfast was part of it as well. I stuck to the continental stuff, not wanting to experiment when I had busy days ahead. The coffee was exceptional. There was a variety of breads to choose from... along with a variety of fruits. 2. Dinner: I was offered one free dinner as part of my reservation. I am a vegetarian and had my doubts before I dined. However, I found enough options and had a filling dinner. Food was served well. 3. Room: The room was sufficient for my needs, though it wasn't the same size as what one would expect of a 3-star hotel in the US. The bathroom area was particularly small, but served the purpose well. The beds were comfortable - my room had 2 single beds. TV was 19\" color TV that had mostly local channels and some news channels in English. I didn't bother much with them other than catching a few minutes before hitting the bed. 4. Additional perks: They also offered a free ride back to the airport. This was convenient for me as I had an early morning flight. Overall, very nice place to stay that enhanced the vacation. Also, Erboy is very near to Aya Sofia and Topkapi Sarayi.

They should not be using it for two people.Then the only room availabe was back to a room on floor 3 and it is the rooms facing the back of the hotel where the work is going on in the Erboy. Breakfast was basic, cereals, cheese, meats, boiled eggs , enough for a breakfast. The price of a drink in the hotel bar/restaurant was expensive so needless to say it was empty most of the time.

We stayed there five nights and reserved through their internet site, and so could take advantage of their offer to pick us up at the airport for free, which was great! Also the dinner offered by the hotel, which was a good meal, and very practical the first night as we were a little tired. The room was on the small side, but was clean and comfortable and had everything you need. The air conditioner was working fine. We didn't always use it and left the window open some of the time, which meant you could hear the tram passing by about a block away, but that wasn't really a problem. It was generally pretty quiet. The T.V. had a variety of stations in different European languages and was also working fine. The hotel staff is overall very friendly and helpful. They offered us some tea when we arrived. I had numerous questions and they were generally able to answer them. There is one lady who can give you a lot of advice about what to visit, itineraries, etc. However, if you happen to have a question pertaining to someone you're waiting for at the hotel, it's better to ask the others, I found, because she is not always behind the desk and may not know who's come by. The location is one of the best things about this hotel - walking distance to the major sites : Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Saint Sophia, Bazar.. and the tram is one block away for what you want to see farther afield. We also took advantage of the rooftop bar/restaurant where it's great to have a drink as you have an amazing panoramic view of the city. Difficult to think of much I didn't like about this hotel. There is a construction site next to the hotel at the moment, but we actually didn't notice the noise from this much. The hotel is a three star, but I would say it's a local rating and not quite as fancy as three star hotels in Paris, where it would probably be a good two star hotel. If you must have spacious and luxurioius rooms, I would say Erboy is not the hotel for you.

Value for money was excellent and I will definitely return to Istanbul and stay here. Therefore my overall rating is based on what one might expect compared to other hotels of the same price/caliber. Two friends from the US who are living in Istanbul saw the room and the Erboy has now become their new recommended hotel for visiting friends. I am a 46 y.o. female professional who travels for pleasure, and frequently solo. My younger days as a budget traveler have given way to more comfort and higher budget, but I don't seek luxury accomodations as I prefer to spend the money elsewhere. Therefore, I value modestly priced hotels that are safe, clean, comfortable and are in good locations. I love a great find and I consider the Hotel Erboy a great find. I do not recommend this hotel for those who like American-syle rooms, chain hotels, or who need 4-star accomodations to be satisfied. LOCATION: For those wanting to stay in Sultanhamet , the location is excellent. Short block from tram stop. Street not a very busy one. As solo female, I felt completely safe. Walk to Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, and Topkapi in a few min. Also can walk to Grand Bazaar, to the ferries, and over Galata Bridge to Beyoglu. Private airport transfer or taxi from airport is 50 TL (approx. $30) but the light rail/tram is easy and incredibly cheap (few dollars) and I highly recommend. No stairs enroute and I never had to lift my luggage once. ROOM: I had a room w/ two twin beds on the 3rd floor overlooking the street in front of the hotel. Basic styling but not sterile. Size was average (by European standards). Mattress firm and very comfortable with good sheets. Built-in closet/armoire and separate vanity w/ mirror and stool. Convenient wall mounted lamp over each bed w/ convenient light switch at bed level. Several electrical outlets for recharging electronics. Bathroom was spotless w/ marble tile floor and ceramic tile walls. Bar and liquid soap provided. Good shower and plenty of hot water. Some sound thru walls transferred but not bothersome. Windows glazed so street sounds (limited traffic) not a problem when window closed, but I slept w/ it open and it was fine. Room has A/C w/ remote control. Television w/ channels in French, Italian, English (incl. BBC), among others. Phone. Room service, but didn't use. Two elevators on each guest room floor. BREAKFAST: After 3 weeks in Turkey and having seen a variety of breakfast quality, this was by far the best and most varied. Besides the typical Turkish breakfast of tomatoes, olives, cucumbers, feta, white cheese, hard cooked eggs, and bread/butter/jam, there was muesli, milk, yogurt, honey, fresh fruit, selection of breads/rolls, criossants, scrambled eggs (although runny) and REAL filtered coffee - everywhere else I got Nescafe. There was the typical salami (pink meat common throughout Turkey - they don't have pork there so it's like bologna). Ignore the \"orange juice\" as it's orange drink, but that was typical in Turkey not to have oj - they seem to have fruit nectars in the grocery stores. Easy to get fresh squeezed oj on the street cheaply so it didn't bother me. There were other breakfast selections I don't recal. Breakfast room is a pleasant one with linen table cloths. Of note were individually wrapped sugar cubes, a first in my month in the country where everywhere I went the sugar bowl was spoonless and saw countless hands reaching in. This was a clear commitment to hygiene. STAFF: Consistently warm and helpful and this goes for every single individual with whom I interacted. This management is clearly focused on customer satisfaction. Ayse, the concierge, was friendly and attentive, providing me with options for group tours as well as independent exploration. I detected absolutely no pressure or push whatsoever toward tours. ROOFTOP LOUNGE: Was open for drinks only as it was early in the season. It was charming and pleasant. RESTAURANT: Daily specials (15 Euro for complete meal w/ appetizer, salad, and dessert). Food was decent although forgettable.

Our contact with the hotel before the conference was purely by email and just a couple of phone calls, and I was impressed by how well all our requirements and wishes were taken care of. No single point was missing or wrong. I can say that I never experienced this with any hotel before, after organizing several conferences, some at much more fashionable hotels.

Some rooms are a little dated decor-wise but the rooms are a pretty good size. On this trip we were in room 503 which has amazing views of the Golden Horn and Topkapi Palace. Breakfast is great - loads more to choose from than the usual turkish breakfast and because of this it is really popular with all the guests. I have always found the breakfast staff very helpful and friendly and they work hard to keep all the food replenished and tables cleared quickly. All the staff working in the reception area (including the porters) too are very polite and helpful - I found them welcoming and not at all pushy. Always have time to chat and answer questions for you. The guest relations manager Ayse is lovely and is a great help for visitors as she can give great suggestions of how to maximise your sight-seeing in your limited time there. As I have been to Istanbul many times I did not need any help from her, but she was always happy to chat about where I had been that day and where I was intending to visit next. I have stayed in quite a few hotels in Istanbul - some better than others, but always rely on staying now at the Erboy.

If I return to this part of Istanbul, I'd be happy to stay here again. Be sure to ask about other services avail at the chain's other hotels (such as using the pool at the Orient Express around the corner), and the Erboy has someone on staff who can help you plan tours, either with companies or on your own, to make sure you see all the sights. I would advise single women travelers to consider going on group tours (or finding a one-to-one tour option), especially for the old city area. On your own, you will get an extra dose of harassment, with men asking you your name, where you're from, sometimes following you as you walk away even if you ignore them. It gets tiring and takes some of the enjoyment out of the experience. Also watch out for the taxi driver scam. Make sure you know what notes you give, and watch them as they take them from you.

First of all, it felt very reassuring that the PR staff of the hotel contacted us a few days before our arrival and offered to help with any information we needed regarding our stay in Istanbul. The hotel is indeed only 5 minutes away from all the important places of this incredible city (so you can stay out as late as you want since the Topkapi, Aya Sofia, the Blue Mosk, the Spice Bazaar, the Galata Bridge are so close - and seeing these places by night is definitely a must), 2 minutes away from the tram station (which will take you directly across the Golden Horn if you want to see the Galata Tower, the Dolmabahce palace or the Taksim Square or Istiklal street) and the Eminonu ferry station (5 minutes walk also). Thus we saved a lot of precious time, since there are so many tourists in Istanbul and we did not waste time finding or reaching these places of interest. On the other hand, the hotel is surrounded by a lot of restaurants, so you have a lot of choices when it comes to dinner or just having coffee or a tea. Clean, cosy room, VERY CLEAN bathroom (this is very important to me), rich breakfast, very clean sheets and towels, A/C that worked properly - these can be said about the hotel, all coming at a price we considered extremely reasonable. However, all of the above would not be enough to characterize the hotel without mentioning the helpful and kind staff of Erboy, be it the reception desk or the restaurant (I also recommend the Pasazade restaurant downstairs for ottoman specialties, choose a table by the narrow, colorful street and for dessert order the Sultan favourite). I had the strong feeling that kindness and friendly politeness come naturally to all of them. The first reassuring feeling I talked about earlier was constantly reinforced by their attitude.

In fact if you do not have much luggage you can travel to and from the airport very comfortably and without hassle using public transport alone.

The breakfast spread was very generous and of very high quality, and access to the internet was free. However, when we found both PCs occupied, we used the internet cafe on the first floor of the restaurant across the street. Most important was the super service we received from every staff member. I wish to name two in particular, viz. Sinan (at the Reception desk) and Ayse (Guest Relations) , both of whom went well out of their way to make sure we were not wanting for anything. To give just one example, we had purchased an expensive and rather fragile ceramic vase at the Dolmabahce Palace gift shop, and had asked them to hold it for us for about a week when we would return to pick it up on our way back home. On my request Sinan wrote a brief note in Turkish to the Palace Authorities requesting them to allow us to enter the Palace grounds without a ticket so we could proceed straight to the gift shop to collect our package. It worked, and we were let in. Ayse too very willingly helped us plan our days, working out the optimal routes we should take to be able to fit in as much as possible in the all-too-brief timespan we had in Istabul. All in all, a wonderful place to put up at reasonable prices, where you get super value for your money. Thanks, everyone at Erboy.

The rooms were pleasantly furnished and equipped, we booked 2 triple rooms as there were 6 of us, 3 adults and 3 children, which comprised of a double bed and one single in each. We had lovely views out of our window and felt completely comfortable. The only negative i can think of is that the walls are quite thin, we could hear when next door were having a shower or when their water was running in the bathroom. We could even hear each other talking in the side by side rooms we were in. There was a complaint put in to reception from the couple next door saying that our children were too loud, even though we didn't think they were, and we became conscious of this and tried to spend the rest of the week whispering! In spite of this we still can't really fault the rooms. Breakfast offered a wide range of breads, pastries, fruits and cereals, the waiters were very friendly and incredibly efficient, they made sure that we had everything we needed and always had a smile for the children. That is one of the best things about the hotel, the staff are very child friendly and always had time for them. Our favourite member of staff was one of the porters, Hamdi Ergul, the children were completely bowled over by him, he was always had time for them and laughed and joked with them, my 5 year old nephew was talking about him most of the plane journey home and says he misses him and wonders what he is doing now! The hotel is very conveniently placed within walking distance of most of the major attractions, the only thing i would be wary of is when taking a taxi to somewhere further afield to book it directly through the hotel. We made the mistake of taking a taxi ourselves back to the hotel one day and were charged 21 lira, we did think it was too much but felt like we couldn't say anything, we were told by Ayse, the hotel guest relations manager ,that it should have come to no more than 5 lira! She was completely shocked that we had been charged that much! After that we always booked through the hotel. Ayse answered any questions and queries that we had and nothing was too much trouble for her, she put us completely at ease and arranged for whatever we required.

I found the Erboy one of the best 3* hotels i have stayed in. The best factor was the staff - they bent over backwards to help us, from everything such as reserving a table at local restaurants to booking city tours., and their English is impecible. Rooms are fairly standard as you would expect for a 3*. Bathroom was a little small in our room (413) but adequate. After all, you're only in the bathroom to freshen up. I found the soundproofing was a little poor, especially on Monday night, for some reason there seemed to be much more noise than on Sat and Sun of my stay - possibly due to the start of the working week? Some of our neighbours also seemed to enjoy slamming their doors very late at night raher than simply shutting them, which didn't help in trying to sleep! This is the reason my review is not a 5* one. Breakfast was excellent - a vast array of foods as a buffet.The restaurant on the bottom floor do good local lunches and dinners. I also recommend the Imbat restaurant in their sister hotel Orient Express just 1 street away. It has a great panormic view of the bosphorus and skyline. Location is probably the biggest attraction to this hotel. It is about a 10min walk up to the Topkapi palace and Sultanahmet Square (Haghia Sophia, Blue Mosque and Basilica Cistern etc). Even in thick snow (which is v.rare for Istanbul) we managed to reach these places easily within 15mins at a slow pace. ADVICE: If coming from the UK, be aware Easyjet run flights to Istanbul, which can be very cheap. If you arrive with them (or another carrier) into Sabiha-Gokcen airport, get a transfer for \u00c2\u00a339 each way with [-] - very efficient and safe drivers. They also run transfers from Ataturk. The Erboy hold luggage after you checkout for no extra cost which we found good as our flight wasn't until 20:20. You may be hounded by sneaky carpet tradesmen who lurk around popular sites.

Likewise, avoid the mini supermarket over the road but find the bigger supermarket a few streets behind the hotel on the main tram line.

Erboy is located in Sirkeci and is very convenient for visiting the Haigha Sophia, the Covered Bazaar and various other tourist attractions. There's even a street nearby with a Starbucks, McDonalds etc. for tourists who have kids, although I prefer to eat at the hotel due to the good food and atmosphere. I especially liked the fact we were so close to the sea-buses (small ferries), which allow you to reach anywhere in Istanbul for less than 50c. Also, they have a terrace on the top floor where you can have your meals outside during the summer. The view is quite exceptional and picturesque. The rooms have double beds and have good heating, constant hot water as well as air-conditioning which you can adjust to your own needs. Also I found the room prices to be ideal. In fact, some friends who were staying at another hotel wanted to change to the Erboy just because of the better room rate, but they were leaving the next day.

Erboy hotel is located in the old town of Istanbul and within walking distance to most of the city attractions. Gulhane Tram station is only 150 meters left side from the hotel. The tram took to all other destinations within the city with YTL1.3 one way ticket fare, should it need a connection with furnicular train or tunnel train - the fare should be added up another YTL1.3 one way. The surrounding area of the hotel is convenient for pedestrian with numbers of cafetarias, groceries and neigborhood hotels such as Best Western. Lobby area is very effective with a guest access computer for internet access and two lifts lead to the guestrooms. These lifts are small and only for up to 3 persons to ride. The stair and guestroom's corridor is less light. Room is generally twin bed and outdated furnishing with standard facilities, 14 inches TV, safety box, hair dryer and mini bar. Ask for room #212 for larger space and quieter since the other of our first stayed is very cramped and dark facing out the road. Air-con is working normally but the heather is centrally controlled and sometimes too heated and forced us to open the window when we were in the room. The temperature outside was 2 to 6 degree celcius only. Breakfast room is in the basement. Avoid peak tourist hours having breakfast at the same time at 7 to 8:30 am or you will find no empty seat or clean table. Food and drinks choices are standard but sufficient to start your day.

This request was accommodated with no problems. Myself and another couple of our party also requested room changes to double rooms, one party changing and myself deciding to stay because our other option did not have so much nice natural lighting so it was a trade off we decided to go with. The rooms are really only to sleep in, you cannot spend any time in them socialising as they are too small BUT we came to visit a different country to appreciate a different culture and how boring it would be if everything was the same the world over. Breakfast had a good selection and was included in the room rate so that was a good added bonus. We socialised outside at the lovely seating down the side street and spent a couple of hours in the evening at the rooftop bar. We found the happy hour outside to be good value but upstairs bar was rather pricey and sometimes the order for drinks got mixed up in the translation. Location is fantastic, staff were friendly and helpful. Free internet was another bonus. We went away for an overnight trip and our luggage was kindly accommodated for us. When we returned we were all in different rooms and this time myself and partner had a lovely corner room with a double bed, single bed and sofa with lots of windows and natural lighting - it was fantastic.
