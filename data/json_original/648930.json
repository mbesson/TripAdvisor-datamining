New towels, sheets, bedspreads. Good location, great rates. Good view of ocean from second floor. Now for the down-side: The desk clerk is behind a glass window, you have to stand outside(rain or shine) to check in, we couldn't even see who we were talking to...so it's kind of impersonable. We weren't able to get WIFI in our room or outside, had to drive down the street to a restaurant. Free coffee consisted of 2- small packets for a 4-cup coffee maker during a six night stay, we had to buy coffee at a grocer. We spent most of our time out of the room, sight-seeing, so we didn't request maid service on a daily basis, but on the 3rd day we did ask for maid service.... was a bit disappointed that the sheets weren't changed as we had sand in the bed. Our only real complaint would be the lack of notice that there would be painters working the entire week. First morning we woke up to the front of our room being sprayed off at 7a.m. We hurried out of the room about 8 as the painters were painting the outside walls and the stair railing. Our last night, the painters were painting the walkways and steps, actually painting while guests were in their rooms on bottom floor, making it difficult to leave their rooms.We returned late in the evening, tired and needing a rest before dinner, only to find the painter painting the walkway and sitting area in front of our room, he was annoyed that we had returned, so we left and sat down the street while he finished. We would have appreciated notice that the workers would be there, so we could schedule around them. The new paint made a world of difference to the motel.... a bright-fresh look. Floors are not hard wood...they are thin laminate... but still cleaner than carpet. I doubt that we will stay here again, but the rates can't be beat. Wouldn't consider this motel as \"kid friendly\"... there are no places to play... just the parking lot. There is no phone(but who doesn't have a cell phone these days?), no pool (but the ocean is just across the street). Walls are a little thin, so don't make any noises that you don't mind your neighbors hearing.... have learned to hate the snooze button on an alarm clock... our neighbor didn't want to get up.... and it can be embarrassing facing your neighbor after he's had a passionate night ;).", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWow, home away from home!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "anita19750505", "ReviewID": "UR127996700", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 weeks to get an inheritance, its clean, beautiful view, convienient to everything, well priced and definately worth getting a trip advisor app on my phone to spread the good word, thank you studio 1.

From exterior, it's not very impressive. I arrived around 9pm, it was dark & I thought \"oh my!\" The room, however, was a pleasant surprise. Laminate wood floor was a nice touch (so tired of grungy motel carpets!) - small kitchenette with microwave, fridge, real plates/utensils, etc. There was someone's food left in the fridge - but it was clean. Beds were comfy, nice table, adequate space-wise for me, I imagine it would be crowded for more than 2. The bathroom was very clean - but I did see 2 short black hairs on shower wall. (I'm a redhead). One thing that was odd was outlet in the bathroom - There wasn't one (or so I thought) I had to use cord in kitchenette. Turns out there was an outlet over the mirror - I wouldn't have been able to reach it unless I stood on toilet... The door is \"old fashioned\" key - security-wise, that was a bit of a concern, but the place was quiet. It is directly across the street from beach - great deal if you want close to the beach.

We put a \"do not disturb\" sign on our door to prevent the cleaning staff from using the dirty mop water on our floors. We knew that if the cleaning staff didn't clean before we got there they certainly wouldn't while we were there. The place was DIRTY!! you couldn\u2019t walk on the floors without turning your socks or feet black!! We had to buy a mop!! The floors are NOT hardwood they are laminate. I have two words for the person that does laundry FABRIC SOFTENER! we had to wash our own towels and sheets because they were so rough and smelled like an ashtray. There was no phone in the room!! No hair dryer, we were given one after requesting it. When a hotel says a hair dryer is provided you shouldn't have to ask for one! The gentleman that worked the office acted like it was a bother. You have to pay the total stay when you check in, not when you leave!!! The washer didn\u2019t work they did eventually fix it, but there was no explanation no apology, nothing! For 3 days HBO didn\u2019t work! we finally told the cleaning staff and she fixed it. I haven\u2019t seen a TV so big since the 80's! You can only take about a 2 minute shower...unless you like only cold water with no water pressure! The kitchen had about 4 forks, 2 spoons and 2 knives, the frying pan handle fell off after the second day. We were provided one after we complained, but the cleaning lady took one from another room to give to us! All the dishes and cabinets had to be washed before they could be used!! The garbage can had stuff growing in it! I think someone was doing a science experiment! The toilet was GROSS!! We had to change 2 light bulbs ourselves! the bar stools at one point were white...not any more they were stained beyond belief! The hotel is right on the street!!! a car going by sounds like it is in your room! The room is not insulated well enough to buffer any noise at all. Good luck crossing the street to get to the beach!!! The white glove award was won years AGO!.....probably when the hotel first opened. Part of my issue, when you are on vacation you shouldn't have to clean, or ask for a new frying pan because yours is awful, or change light bulbs. The rooms should be maintained by staff and these problems should not be discovered by guests. We shouldn't have had to tell staff the light bulbs were out (when we arrived) or that the frying pan handle was broken. This hotel has the potential for being nice, if it was well maintained.

The hotel was just two levels and it was right off of Atlantic Ave. Parking is convenient because it is right outside of your doorstep. Just be careful when you back out of parking and don't accidentally back out into traffic!! There was a small window attached to the office where you check in. You ring the doorbell and wait a bit for someone to come see you. Once the man opened the window the smell of cigarette smoke came all out. I don't like smoke and I was not happy about that. I thought I reserved a room on 2nd level, but it was all booked by more people smoking. I was afraid the place might burn down that night. Once we opened the door the smell of smoke came visiting my nose again. Our room was quite big with a full kitchen. The room had 2 beds and a bar area with 2 bar stools. There were some drawers and a television. The bathroom was a good size, but the floor had this big yellow/brown stain a bit bigger than a basketball. They probably need to replace the tiles in the bathroom. In the kitchen there was a door to the back patio. There was someone's house behind the fence which I thought it was a little funny. There was a convenient beach access right across the street and a 7 Eleven RIGHT next door to the hotel. We went there so many times the clerk there thought we had no life. It was just about 10 steps from our door. After a little while in the room I started getting a headache because of the smell of smoke. When we left for the race and came back the smell was there. When we left the hotel the next day the smell was stuck on our pillows, towels, clothes, and bags. Check-out took a little a longer than I expected. Nobody answered our ring for more than 5 minutes. A nice housekeeping lady was kind enough to take the key from us and told us that we can take our time leaving the room. Overall the place would've been fantastic for if it was smoke free.
