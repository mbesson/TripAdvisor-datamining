She was a restored grand old lady of a house of a bygone era. She needs some restoring, again. The staff is wonderful and the setting delightful. One thing that draws us back is the garden and the conservatory; a great place to sit and have a beer after a long day of sightseeing/shopping or a quiet meal with it raining outside. We love the caravansary next door and it is a stone's throw to most of the key spots of the Sultanamet. There is paint cracked and peeling, and worn and broken bits here and there. Sort of what you might expect from Grandma's house but perhaps falling short of a first class boutique hotel that they aspire to be. Breakfast is more than adequate but not a sumptuous buffet. We hang on to her because, like an old relative or friend we can see through some of the superficial wear and tear but unfortunately we see a trend here and probably will give her a pass on our next visit to Istanbul and just go for the beer in the garden. For the nitty gritties, the bed was pretty firm (read mattress on a plywood foundation) the privacy shades were paint splattered and had to be repaired daily. There was a charge for bottled water in the room but it was waived on checkout.

The location in a small street in Sultanahmet is good - a few minutes walk from many of the major sites. At night it is quiet, but on some days there can be a fairly constant stream of passing tour buses. It is also very close to the blue mosque so be prepared to be woken by the call to prayer which sounds very loud when the windows are open. The walled courtyard garden is lovely and would be a great place to sit and enjoy a drink or food on a warm day. When it is raining hard - it's of limited value. The hotel decor is in need of refurbishment - peeling paintwork and furnishings. The air con was ineffective. The shower in our ensuite was tiny. The breakfast adequate but uninspiring. The staff are friendly and helpful. I am sure when this hotel first opened it was a great place to stay, but it now feels like it is trading on past reputation.

Rather than a business hotel, we chose a 21 room hotel located in a renovated, large 19th century wood house (except along stretches of the Bosphorous where the rich had summer homes few wood houses remain). We also went for location. Yesil Ev (green house) is located on a small street just to the side of Sultanahmet Square. It was perfect. Walk out and go to the left, and in 3 minutes you are at the Blue Mosque. Go to the right and in 4 minutes you are at Haghia Sophia. Go to the right and walk straight for about 5 minutes and you are at the entrance to the Topkapi Palace (more accurately, a huge area of various palace and civil administration buildings plus gardens). Our room in Yesil Ev was large, with lovely period furnishings. Shower power was terrific. Air conditioning was fine. Tip -- ask for a room off the street. It is a small street and noise (vehicles going by, conversations) floats up. One omission that might bother some -- no TV (or internet access). A room off the street would likely look over an unexpected feature of this hotel -- a lovely and sizable garden.
