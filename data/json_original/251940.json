Since the transition to Comfort Inn, the hotel has been completely refurbished inside and out. It reopened under its new management in January 2012. As such, many of the earlier reviews may not be relevant. The property is set back from the highway so it will be in your best interest to map it out ahead of time. We used the nearby I-Hop as our landmark as there is no road signage for the hotel. Check in was efficient once I got past the couple who booked through a third party and whose reservation did not make it to the hotel. The lobby was nice but simple. The adjoining breakfast area was also sort of small. Note that as of early February they were still working on the first floor. As a result, that main corridor is blocked for passage. That is the corridor that also leads to the outdoor pool but the February temperatures were not conducive for swimming. The elevator was terribly slow but once we got to the third floor the room was nice. Nice bright corridors too. Flat screen TV, micro/fridge in the room. Comfy beds. And a \"towel swan\" was sitting on the bed on our arrival - something you do not see at a hotel in this price point. Wireless internet worked well with the laptop but was problematic with my Blackberry Tablet and Smartphone. But that is likely a Blackberry issue. Several points off for ambient noise. The walls are thin. You can hear folks in the adjoining room as well as the corridor. Some University of South Florida students were across the hall and we could hear them pretty distinctly. Our solution was to keep the heater/air conditioning on at low speed. That provided enough white noise to make for good sleeping. Very hot shower and good water pressure too. Breakfast was simple fare and did not vary over our three day stay. Eggs, sausage links, waffle maker and the usual variety of cereal, bagels and some fresh fruit. The breakfast area is smallish. As we were up early it was not an issue but during peak travel season it could be a problem. I did not see a gym or business office, but the first floor (beyond the reception and breakfast area) is still under renovation. Staff was polite. There are several dining options withing walking distance to include the previously mentioned I-Hop and a Perkins. Many more places are on the road but I do not recommend trying to cross Irlo Bronson Highway on foot. All in all, it was an inexpensive and decent stay.

Although I never had to wait for her to get off to answer my questions. She just whispered the answers I needed while making sure one hand covered the reliever of the cell phone.

The hotel was very clean, the bathrooms were clean, and everything in the room worked perfectly. I am a stickler on bathrooms, and I was satisfied with this one - no funny smells or mildew. One thing that was good for us was that the sink was outside the bathroom (so the other person could be taking a shower or using the toilet while the other was brushing teeth), and the sink counter space was huge, so there was enough room for all the toiletries and cosmetics that two women bring. They gave us extra towels and hangers without any problem. The maid service was good as well. We had a 2 queen bed room, and the beds and pillows were comfy, the linens were clean and comfy as well. There was a fridge and a microwave and a large 4 drawer dresser and a desk, and it was pretty roomy. Also there was a coffee pot and hairdryer. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Whenever we asked how to get somewhere, they either whipped out a map and showed us how to go, or gave us prepared directions to major destinations. The breakfast was not terrific, but had all the essentials, plus you could make your own waffles, which was quite nice. We didn't use the pool at all because we were never there during the day, but it looked ok, although it is full sun in the morning and full shadow in the afternoon. The hotel is very well located. about a half hour from the airport, it's set back off a major highway so you don't feel like you are right on the road. There are strip malls galore on that main road, making it easy to find food and a CVS when we needed them. Also, it is a close and an easy drive to Disney and Sea World, which are the only places we went to. If you stay at this hotel, I think that you must have a car, although you could certainly walk to restaurants, etc. The shuttles from the hotel to Disney went only twice a day, I think - I just glanced quickly at the schedule - if you'll be relying on the shuttle, you should check with them on timing and frequency. Also, it would probably be expensive to get to the hotel from the airport (1/2 hour), although I never looked into it. There is an outlet mall within just a few miles, which we enjoyed as well. The hotel is non-smoking, the only place people can smoke on the property is just out front where there are ashtrays outside. Which makes for a clean hotel and property.

Please note that the hotel is nothing fancy, it is a budget type of accomodation, but it is clean, has decent sized rooms, and offers a continental breakfast which I found to be excellent (although the breakfast area is very small). It also has an outdoor pool which is not heated, and a nice hot tub. What more could you ask for? The hotel is set back from busy 192 and you can't hear any noise from traffic. It is also close to Disney World. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, especially after reading some reviews of other budget type accomodations on trip advisor.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Harbor, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel after a horrible night nextdoor at the Ramada\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5478131", "Content": "We had a room on the 1st floor, clean, clean cleaner than clean.

Check in was efficient but impersonal. The first floor room we received had dated water stains on wall near window. They appeared to be old rain water leaks or perhaps from a/c unit in room directly above ours. Room was relatively clean but had a musky scent probably due to moisture. It rained during our stay and each time the carpet near the window was soaked. One of the queen mattresses was very worn. In sitting on the corner of the bed, you could almost slide all the way to the ground the mattress was so worn. This is probably what a one star hotel should be. Although, considering and comparing to how bad some of the surrounding hotels in Kissimmee are, it would probably get 2 stars. For around $65/night, would probably only stay here again if we had no other choice. However, after we had left town, the staff did help us find and retrieve an item that we had accidentally left in the room.", "Date": "June 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, good location, clean and nice\u201d", "Author": "Chiquita50", "ReviewID": "UR5026393", "Content": "We stayed there while we went to the Disney World, it was a great location not too far from the attractions, and a great breakfast was included.

Excellent value for money. Good size room - microwave & fridge included. Cleaned daily so no complaints there. No sitings of ants, cockroaches or other bugs!

Only complaint is the pool which is FREEZING (came to the conclusion that its built on the wrong side of the hotel. Hot tub perfect! Staff friendly. Free internet and newspaper. Plenty of parking spaces available. IHOP and Perkins opposite.

I am currently staying at the Baymont Inn and am very pleased with the hotel and staff. The room is clean, a good size for my family of four (two queen size beds with a work table/chair).

They have the fresh waffle maker, cereal, fruit, juice machine, coffee and today eggs, sausage and biscuits. Not bad at all. The hotel is set back off 192 enough to provide \"privacy\". Wireless high speed internet works great in the room and there is one work station on the first floor for those that don't bring their own laptop.

We were not expecting much from this hotel because of it's budget price point. However we were pleasantly surprised. The furnishings and carpets are in very good order and I think the hotel must be fairly new given its overall condition. Our room was larger than we expected and all the essentials were there, but the beds are not king size, just queen sized. The bathroom was also clean and tidy, the bed linens were fresh and everything smelled clean. Housekeeping were efficient and friendly at all times. The shower pressure was good, even on the top floor. The Baymont also has free wired/wireless Internet access in the hotel rooms, which is something we did not expect at this price. The only negative side is the breakfast area, which is surprisingly small. This can mean that you have to queue up or wait for a table if you do not time things right. The breakfast selection, although small does include at least one a hot item and the choice of four cereals and various pastries, bagels and bread. You have to be quick to get fruit as it is quite limited. As we usually have a light breakfast anyway, this did not prove to be a problem, but if you have fussy kids or a large appetite then it may be worth taking a trip to one of the many local chains who serve huge breakfasts for little money! We did not use the pool as it was January, so cannot comment on it. The hotel is just off the 192 Highway and approximately 10-15 Minutes Drive from the main Disney complex. It's also close to a multitude of restaurants and shops. I can recommend the Olive Garden and Smokey Bones, both within walking distance. Perhaps the best recommendation can come from the fact that we did not need to contact management or housekeeping at any time during our stay to correct an issue, as everything was right first time! Very highly recommended, I reckon about the same quality as a Hampton Inn but at half the price.", "Date": "February 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the King Size Bed & Free Breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "winniepoo", "ReviewID": "UR4357078", "Content": "We stayed here because of the nice reviews and now we know why.
