I booked our reservation online 2 days before we arrived, but when we got there at midnight they didn't have our reservation, so the man just gave us 2 rooms and he took my printed confirmation. The next morning though a lady came to our room shouting \"no reservatoin no reservation!\" and came back 3 times so I finally had to go downstairs with her and open my email, and she stood over my shoulder the whole time pointing to any email in my inbox and saying \"no no no!\" I found the confirmation email for her and printed it, but this didn't calm her down and she told me we had to change rooms, which we did with no problem. So a half hour later when all had been worked out, she completely changed her attitude and offered us breakfast and made us cappucinos, told us how to get to venice, which bus to take and everything. So i forgave her for the yelling and actually enjoyed the rest of my stay. Everyone is very nice, nodding and smiling because they don't speak english, but we felt very taken care of. The hostel itself is actually in Marghera, but it's only a short bus ride to and from venice (the number 6 runs to and from the hostel until past midnight) and everything in venice is accessible by walking or water bus. Overall, this place is just fine for a stay in venice.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Service and Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4627012", "Content": "Hotel Piccolo is a very simple hotel that is located near Mestre station. Only one bus (numero 6) takes you directly to Venice and back, but it is fairly far. The breakfast is not included, but at 4 Euros per person, it gets you going in the morning. The coffee is not too shabby. This hotel has little rooms and horrible showers. Venice in general has nothing special about it. The people are rude and impatient. We found that we had to yell back to get better service. Italians tend to pay more attention if you act like they do. You can cruise the Grand Canal in about an hour. We even went to Murano island and to Lido on the one day. There is nothing special about Murano island and the glass art is overpriced. The sales people are very pushy and will ignore you once they know you won't be paying 4 to 5 thousand Euros on a piece of glass. We found that Granville Island in Vancouver has more creative pieces of glass art, better service and more lively entertainment (and it is closer to home). Beware though that if you buy some little glass trinkets, they give it to you and break it while they are wrapping it. Either watch them wrap it or open it right away before paying for it. They are mean-spirited only treating you well if they think you are going to buy their over-priced pieces of glass, even then, buyer beware. Anyway, the hotel does not provide you with a map or directions, so either bring your own or ask around. Other tips that we learned about which you might find useful are: * Make sure you validate your bus/train/bartello tickets before getting on or you can be fined about 30 Euros per person if checked. * You might want to purchase the 12-hour (for 8.50 Euros each) or 24-hour (for 12 Euros each) global pass instead of paying 5 Euros for each one way trips along the Canal. * Bring some Euros with you until you can get to a bank or ATM machine in Rome - we didnt do this in Venice. * Check out the menus at restaurants before sitting down because prices vary considerably from place to place and you don't want to feel ripped off (we paid huge $ for places that looked cheaper and reasonable $ for great food at other places that had an expensive look).", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Al Piccolo Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d237379-Reviews-Al_Piccolo_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$86 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Trieste, 2/h</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30175</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237379", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/33/55/33557fedbf2a439ba540b22a119ece7c1large.jpg"}}
