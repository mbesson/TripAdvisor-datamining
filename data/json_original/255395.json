{"Reviews": [{"Content": "One Great Hotel On my recent trip through of Australia that ended with a flight out of Sydney I chose the HI Rooty Hill because it was close to the Blue Mountains and far enough away from the CBD that I didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot for my rental car. I was very pleased with my choice. The hotel very comfortable and reasonably priced for what you get. The rooms are large and the beds are comfortable. The property is not surrounded by shops and restaurants which makes it a problem if you do not have a car. However, places to eat and a large shopping mall are only a short drive away. Right next door to the hotel is an RSL Club. As I understand it's for service veteran's. The hotel has an agreement with the Club for guests to use the restaurants in the club. I ate there on night and the meal was inexpensive and of a great quality. And, there is a casino in the club as well.The drive to the airport is a bit over 40 KM. which took us 90 minutes during the morning commute. The drive tot he heart of the Blue Mountains was only 90 minutes as well.The size of the room was wonderful to give us a chance to spread out as we packed for our return trip home. I highly recommend this hotel. We got a rate of $160 AUS for a large with with a Queen and a Single bed. Earlier in our trip we stayed at the HI Darling Harbour and paid $270 AUS for a much smaller room.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR475163771", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "highdesertbadger"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d255395-r22710966-Holiday_Inn_Rooty_Hill-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "255395", "Price": "$92"}}
