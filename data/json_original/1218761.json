From the seamless private transfer, to the welcoming cold towel and Mayan health drink ; offered by a hostess that greets guests in the gorgeous Asian inspired central pavilion, with vast outdoors spaces and arching roofs overlooking a central pond which is a scene straight out of a Kyoto temple. That is when the perfect spirituality of this gorgeous peace of heaven hits you for the first time. The registration formalities are understated and quickly you are on your way, transported by golf trolley by a smiling driver - everybody smiles at the Banyan Tree .The accommodation is spectacular and in this instance a 5000sqft , tri-level townhouse designed in a Adobe/Mayan style.The first floor living area is bigger than many NY apartments and offers sweeping view of tropical ponds and the greens of the PGA golf course which is part of the resort . Downstairs to 3 bedrooms , the master with patio leading to the pond, ensuite bathroom with rainshower and vista tub with panoramic view, beautiful Mexican twin painted vanity sinks add to the Mexican inspired interior decoration to which the simplicity of Asian Feng Shui has been applied. The King size bed is sumptuous and with blackout curtains and only the sound of nature as an accompaniment, it is possible to achieve a primordial peaceful, darkness - great for those who are used to garbage trucks churning at 3am in NYC. Finally, the roof terrace, with infinity pool, lounges-beds,and basic barbecue implements- which are used to prepare catered buffets which are offered as part of the in room dining options . The scent of lemongrass and Ylang ylang offer an olfactory delight , gently relased into the air by scent burners which are attended to by a support team who clean and tidy the villa twice a day , and who at turndown service deposit small locally produced momento- my favorite the carved wooden turle- to symbolise returnng to your roots. The Spa at the Banyan tree has to be the most enchanting experience on the planet. You are transported to invidual Balinese inspired , thatched masage cottages. With your feet floating in pools of rose petal water, your body is gently scrubbed with banana and papaya pulp infused with herbs. Then a massage from an Indonesian therapist whose diminuitive size belies her ability to remove all knots and spains, whilst at the same time offering a tanscendental experience- thank you for your gift Dhassi. Dining at the Banyan Tree offers a varied selection of Thai, Mexican and International cusine at any of the 3 main restaurants- dining on the floating deck at Saffron is a must -try the Thai Tasting menu. Breakfast is served in the Oriente and really is the best deal at the hotel.In addition to the normal breakfast fare of tropical fruits, juices, bread and pastry baskets the kitchen serve some vaired and tempting addtions; shrimp curry, pit roasted pig, grilled sea bass or mexican burritos and refried beans. Of course, American favourites like omelettes and egg benedict can be cooked to order. Sands, the beach side bistro offers a great selection of Asian inspired options complimented with the freshest daily catch of the day and Mexican classics and is a great place to relax late in the afternoon. Finally, the staff at the Banyan Tree are superb.They act like gracious hosts, they are discrete and attentive at the same time and on hand to deliver any of your hearts desires.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful; service lacking\u201d", "Author": "SuperPicky111", "ReviewID": "UR126468724", "Content": "Have been to Banyan Tree Mayakoba twice. Went back the second time because the first was so terrible they invited us back. Punch line is: hotel is beautiful and beach spectacular but service sub-par. Detail: we stayed on an oceanfront villa. The villa was beautiful with a pool. The bathroom was very nice with a great outdoor tub and shower. The bed was very comfortable and they had a pillow menu. Transportation: since the resort is in two separate area, the reception and the beach, guests need to use the golf carts to get around. The problem is that you can easily wait 10-20 minutes, if not 30 minutes for a golf cart at night when guests are trying to get around. The boat option during the day is cool but not practical since the boat only runs on a set schedule. Gym: nicely appointed with modern equipment. Spa: I got a massage, it was ok, not incredible. The masseuse was Thai and she was very gracious but she had tiny hands with skinny fingers so she struggled to apply real pressure. Also had the water treatment, it was not my favorite. Food: the pool restaurant was good although menu limited so after a week the food was a bit boring. The Thai restaurant was good but could be better. The breakfast was nice, the buffet was quite comprehensive. The restaurant in the main area by the lobby was underwhelming for fine dining. The problem: the whole system falls apart when it rains... The rooms are poorly built so tons of water leaks in so they put towels down to soak up the water. After a few days of rain they are out of towels and things get sticky to the point where they used our bath towels and didn't replace the so we didn't have towels when getting out of the shower. Most of the restaurants are outdoors so they have very limited seating when it rains which meant we ended up having dinner in the yoga studio one night!! Once you have issues the staff has no idea what to do so it becomes a comedy of errors. While it is a beautiful resort we won't return.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, Oregon, USA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Posted by a BanyanTree.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126347512", "Content": "Since Arrival at the amazing Mexican location on the Riviera Maya we were welcome by a typical from the area dressed hostess, who offered a delicious refreshing Jamaica flower water, the grounds are amazing!

This time around, it was all about rest and relaxation, and this hotel was so pampering that I couldn't bring myself to leave the entire 5 nights I was there. The Banyan tree is situated on a prime strip of beach with beautiful turquoise water, and the Asian- inspired decor creates a tranquil oasis. The Courtyard Pool Villa we stayed in was incredibly spacious and luxurious, and featured outdoor shower & bath, huge private pool (that was beyond anything that we could have anticipated), bowl of fresh fruit, a set of tea forte teas, comfortable king sized bed with impressive floor to ceiling headboard, and a his and hers bathroom that was one of the most beautiful and well-designed I have seen in any hotel. During our stay we dined at both Tamarind and Saffron, and in both restaurants the food was very good - though the candlelit Saffron was breathtaking, and therefore more enjoyable. We treated ourselves to Balinese and Thai massages which were both very good, but pricey (as is to be expected at a five star hotel spa). The service was all-around efficient and at a high level, and we were greeted with smiles and by name. While walking the streets of Varansi in India, I came across burning incense that smelled very similar to the Champaka scented ones they burned in the BT Mayakoba spa. It immediately brought back a fond memory of a truly pampering vacation, and compelled me to write this review.

We had a lovely time. The hotel was SUPER accommodating with our son -- they had his crib waiting in the villa at our arrival (normally we have to call for it at any other hotel we stay at). They had a full package of kid products for his bath, etc. The villas was amazing and just as pictured. What can I say about the service...it was UNBELIEVABLE!! Most all of the hotel employees knew my son's name within the first few days of us staying there. We did have a small hiccup with my husband's golf plans, but they resolved it and he was able to play for 2 days at a discounted price. For anyone that is traveling with kids...this is a great spot. They have great pools and the beach is also amazing. If you are going for a long period of time, such as 5+ days, you will run out of dining options - as there are only 3 restaurants on the property -- all of which serve simply amazing food, but you may be a bit bored of it by the 5th or 6th day. However, we did hear that there are some nice restaurants in town...Playa del Carmen which is a few minutes from the property. We would have to compare this property very closely to the hotel we stayed at in the Maldives, in terms of service, food and setting. We couldn't believe we were in Mexico, it almost felt as if we were in Bali or somewhere in the Far East. The only slight drawback was there are not a ton of kid actives, if you have older children...they may be bored somewhat. We did hear about a few excursions, including swimming with dolphins...which is about a 20 minute ride from the hotel.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent honeymoon/romantic vacation spot\u201d", "Author": "M2NC", "ReviewID": "UR125730013", "Content": "Stayed in a spa pool villa in early May 2011 for our honeymoon; perfect spot for that kind of thing. Pros: -Privacy (high fence around entire suite, private pool, jacuzzi, outdoor bath with tea candle wall, do-no-disturb switch beside the bed that warns staff outside the front door...). One minor warning--you may be visible from the upstairs outdoor shower during the day--use the downstairs indoor or outdoor showers. -Suite size: yes, you really do get that entire space to yourself. And it's very nice to have the entirely separate sitting area--one person can nap in the bed while the other relaxes in the pavilion. -Thai restaurant: Fantastic. I wish I remembered the name of the mini-appetizer the chef sent out the first day. One of the best things I've ever eaten. And we ordered the massaman curry two nights in a row--it was that good. -Massage services: Had a couple's massage with my wife--her first massage. Both masseuses were excellent, both trained in multiple styles. Our massage room was in a stand-alone building on stilts over the water; much nicer than having someone in the next room. (DIdn't use the spa tables on the 2nd floor of our suite--really too hot in May for that, and I found the massage rooms much more comfortable anyway). -Room & resort appearance/style: Asian simplicity with hints of Mexican flair. Comfortable beds, choice of pillow types, etc. -Rain shower/steam shower: nice combo in your room. -Wifi: worked well in the rooms. Nice when you're taking a break from the sun or looking at excursions. Don't count on Netflix or the like working--those are blocked off in this part of the world by those services. -Service, cleanliness: both excellent. Cons (or potential drawbacks depending on your tastes): -Quiet resort: This isn't the place to party, although the bartenders at the beach/pool bars make great beach drinks. If you don't venture out to the ruins/towns, I'd keep the stay five nights or less. They'll be wonderful, relaxing days and nights...but that's about all the relaxation I can handle. No on-site night life, although you can go to the main complex and have a drink in the open-air bar up top. -Not on the beach: The beach is nearby--you could walk (long walk), take a bike, take the boat from the lobby, or call a golf cart to take you. Didn't bother us a bit--we took the boat the first day and mostly called a cart for the rest of our stay. -Limited number of restaurants: we loved the Thai restaurant and the breakfast buffet, thought the poolside restaurant was fine. Room service has a limited menu; tastes fine, but I prefer the restaurants. You can go eat in town or at one of the other resorts in the Mayakoba complex. To me, this is more of a \"duration of stay\" item. -Wouldn't take kids: this just isn't the place for them--and by \"kids\" I mean anything from infants through early teens. I think they might have some kid-related programs during the high season, but given the resort setup and eating choices, I just wouldn't recommend it. -Cleaning time: ok, this is nitpicking, and some people will love it. The suite is big, and you have your own pool, and they keep both very clean (and put away your shoes, etc.)...which takes a while (even though they send in a couple of people at a time for the room and another for the pool and grounds). And then when they come in for the turndown, I swear they do a quick second clean/straighten. Just be prepared to switch between the pavilion and the bedroom if you happen to be in the suite when they come (i'm sure you could get them to come back, but there's really no need--huge couch/day bed in the pavilion, plus table and chairs. You'll need breaks from the sun). Final word--we loved the place from the moment we arrived.

I'll start with the good. The room we stayed in was a courtyard room and it was more than ideal. A huge room with everything you can ask for. An amazing comfortable bed, great aircon, peaceful and an great nights sleep. More than enough room for 2 and I can't really see the point of going for a better room ( except for the hot tub). The resort was clean and perfect but you could have been anywhere really. Although its so nice that you don't really want to leave (well not to go to playa del carmen anyway). The service was great at all times if a little bit formal and scripted but I suppose that's what is expected at this sort of place. And the breakfast buffet was amazing. By far the best I have ever had. But I felt that the overall value was pretty average especially on food and drink. The food options were quite limited and the quality was not as good as expected. Especially the Thai food which, being a Thai brand, I was expecting to be much better. I know that it was never going to be cheap but there is a difference in paying for an amazing room and just being ripped off on little things such as the price of water (up to $10 a bottle). One other tip is that the private pool was freezing and unusable because of the time of year and it wasn't heated so consider this if you're going in winter. I would stay here again without a doubt but maybe for a shorter period so the food doesn't get boring.

We are frequent Cabo visitors (Las Ventanas and Capella) and met a couple while in Cabo that raved about this place. This place is nice....but we felt a little let down. Pros for us: Food is pretty good! We loved biking everywhere!! We stayed in a 3 bedroom townhouse (we got an awesome deal off jet setter) - while there was only 2 of us it was still nice to have such a spacious place to stay. Great Spa! We loved the breakfast buffet! Cons: No full length mirror - I know some people could care less about that but I could not get over the fact that there was no full length mirror anywhere in the 3 bedroom townhouse! Water leaks out of the shower into the bathroom, master toilet does not have a door, there is a his and hers sink...but they are right next to each other, rooms were a little outdated, no mater how cool we set the ac it could never get cold enough - we are from texas and are used the heat and humidity - but it was still tough coming in after a long day on the beach to a not so cool room. This brings up another point - the beach...the hotel is RIGHT on the beach which we found a little strange, and the lack of pools/pool space, we loved the main pool but there were very few places to lay out there - the pool down by the beach was the puniest pool we have ever seen - thus we stayed on the beach despite the strong winds! The service at the beach was lacking - I think they only came around twice the entire day, The gym is also the smallest thing ever - 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals - I know the majority of people probably dont work out on vacation but every time we did the treadmills and ellipticals were consistently being occupied! The service was okay...the place seemed to be pretty empty but it still took quite some time to get a buggy, also service at the lounge area was severely lacking. Don't get me wrong - service was good - but visit Capella or Las Ventanas in Cabo to experience truly amazing customer service. All in all this place is nice...but I feel there are much better places in Mexico that are just as expensive but nicer!", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Bliss!\u201d", "Author": "Bola2218", "ReviewID": "UR125189360", "Content": "Overall Banyan Tree Mayakoba can't be beat and it's just what you're looking for in the middle of winter! from the moment you are greeted, you know your expectations will be surpassed and service excellence is their commitment. We held our wedding there with 40+ people and they surpassed all expectations. Katherine Heisinger, our Romance Coordinator was the best! Highly recommend her! Am putting a more thorough review on bestdestinationwedding if you want more details! Villas: We stayed in two different kinds of villas and had the opportunity to visit 3 different types of villas. Every villa is super clean and the turndown service is great. The beds and pillows are very comfy and they have extra amenities in case you forget them. The best for a couple is the courtyard villa with heated pool and jacuzzi. The environment is intimate and the heated pool in February when it can get a little chilly is perfect to stay a few more hours in the water. The shower is beautiful and the outdoor bath is also great. The three bedroom townhouse is quite spacious and is perfect if you have kids. The only drawback is the unheated pool on the roof. Maybe in the summer it would be fine but in February for me it was too cold. The other one we saw was a one bedroom villa which was also perfect for a couple. Not sure if the pool is heated but the layout is nice. Bellboys/Service at Banyan Tree Mayakoba: We can't say enough about our bellboys and the coordination of all of our transports to/from villa/beach/restaurants/luggage, etc. Beginning from Alberto who always answered our calls so pleasantly, Ernesto who I think orchestrated many details, and then we have the bellboys who during every single moment always had a great demeneaor, were extremely helpful with any request, and were always a nice familiar face. I have to name a few of the one that stood out for us: Erik, Armando, Gui, Jose, Jose Manuel, Gilberto, Adrian (very knowledgeable about the wildlife). Spa: I also had great service at the Spa with Poi and Ami. Very relaxing environment and perfectly tailored to whatever you may need. Food: Breakfasts are perfect! They include a wide selection of fruits, natural fruit juices, fresh breads, eggs any way you want them and delicious creations every day! We ate at the acclaimed thai restaurant, Saffron, one night. Beautiful cozy terrace/restaurant on stilts over the mangrove under the moonlight. We didn't experience any bugs but got to see plenty on huge fish in the water. The service all around is excellent, particularly Benedicto and his buddy. The food was a good thai restaurant (we expected a little more authentic) but the only thing that blew our minds was the sauce that accompanied the bread for the table. We also had food at the Sands beach club. The linguini with clams, left a lot to wish for, however, I had a bruschetta with portobello mushrooms and that was wonderful! Beach Club: The staff at the beach club are amazing: Eduardo (head of recreationn), Cristiano and Guadalupe who were always so attentive and ready to set up our beach beds/umbrella. Manuel with our food and beverage service. I know there were at least another 3-4 people here who went above and beyond and my memory fails me, but suffice it to say, the staff is excellent and as nice as can be. The heated pool was perfect. The beach is very nice, although right in front of the hotel you have rocks, not too many, but enough. I suggest walking towards the fairmont beach or to the right to find a less challening entrance. The other thing to note is Mexico does little to regulate where jet skis go so when you are swimming be careful for newbies on jet skis coming close to shore, particularly if you want to snorkel. Having said that, the Banyan tree staff are equipped with everything you need to snorkel and stay safe (bouy to tie to your lifevest) which I know other resorts are not ready to do. The quality of the snorkel equipment is top notch... so much so we're going to go buy it since we scuba dive and they fit perfectly.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNovember getaway\u201d", "Author": "traveler29556", "ReviewID": "UR125181580", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to the Banyan Tree in November for a romantic getaway.

The villa's pool was a nice size, bigger than your average plunge pool. There was also nice outdoor space surrounding the villa with a 2-person hammock, lounge chairs and eating area. We tried all of the restaurants at the resort. The Oriente breakfast buffet was definitely the standout. There was an amazing selection of fresh fruit and juices along with a variety of hot dishes and pastries. We lingered over breakfast for so long that we often didn't need lunch! Our favorite lunch and dinner option was Sands, the beachside restaurant. The service was great as were the salads and ceviche. Saffron was good, fairly standard Thai fare with interesting rice options. Tamarind was disappointing; food was overpriced and average at best. The grounds of this resort are stunning, and golf carts are readily available to transport you from the main resort down to the beach. There is also a boat that takes you through the Mayakoba, and the guide provides information on the wildlife. You can also rent bikes and explore the Mayakoba on your own. The main pool, just outside Oriente, is very peaceful, perfect for lounging and reading. The infinity pool at the beach is more lively and offers stunning views of the Caribbean Sea.

For those on the East Coast of the U.S., it is also a very short flight to take in order to experience a very remote-feeling resort. The greeting upon arrival was quite warm, and I thought the welcome drink was a nice way to start of the checking-in process. You are introduced to your resort host, who walks you through the various ins and outs of the resort. After a quick buggy ride to your villa, you enter into paradise, and relaxation mode commences. Upon entering the villa, you are greeted with the faint scent of incense and the pleasant sounds of a relaxing CD playing. We were in a 2-bedroom courtyard villa, and I cannot imagine a more pleasant layout. Although I would echo prior comments about the 2-bedrooms not being ideal for parents traveling with small children, it is an absolutely spectular set-up for couples, friends, traveling with adult parents, etc. Each and every part of the villa's design is stunning. The use of color, woods, stones and fabrics really did a fantastic job of blending the Asian sensibility of the Banyan Tree heritage with a hint of local Yucatan flavor to remind you of where you are. All in all, I have to say that the bedroom layout and quality (for both bedrooms) was beyond reproach. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms were luxuriously appointed and functional all at the same time. The living room (pavillion) also provided a nice change of scenery if you wanted to get out of the bedroom. Despite my raves about the bedrooms and pavillion, no review of the Banyan Tree Mayakoba could be complete without mentioning the fantasy-like pools! Although the plunge pool concept is not exclusive to the Banyan Tree, I have never been to a resort with a private pool that even comes close to the size of these pools. You could do actual laps, which was a nice way to combine exercise with sloth-like relaxation. We traveled there during the summer, so I have no complaints about the water's temperature. It was always perfect during our stay. The pool was also regularly cleaned, and we were very satisfied with the quality and consistency of the cleaning. If you are looking for an active, mingling-type resort, I question whether this would be the property for you, but if you are looking for exclusivity, privacy, relaxation and top-notch service and food, look no further. Each of the staff members, from the housekeeping to the buggy drivers to the resort hosts to the waiters in the restaurants, was spectacular. Never without a smile on their face, they made you feel so welcome at each point of the day. Their positive attitudes were infectious, and you could not help but get swept away in the spirit of it all. We would like to particularly thank our resort host, Laura, who was simply a gem. The food is also quite fantastic at this resort. I would have to say that it would have been nice to have more \"local\" fare on offer, but they did a fantastic job of making you forget this after your first meal. The quality of the food was amazing, using the freshest of ingredients and with daring and beautiful presentation. The waiters were also very knowledgeable about the food and quite helpful with suggestions. One tip: try the tasting menu at Saffron; you will not regret it. We ate at each of the restaurants, and I would whole-heartedly recommend each of them. We did not avail ourselves of the opportunity to visit the sister properties in Mayakoba for dinner, and I honestly think there is not much use to doing so, as they have perfectly wonderful food on site. We did not really make use of the common areas during our stay, but I can say that they were magnificently maintained. You will exhaust the memory card on your camera whilst here. Also, be sure to check out their spa. I tried the Balinese massage and have not found a better experience (well, except for the other Banyan Tree I visited recently). Also, be sure to do the lagoon tour. I thought it would be \"hokey\", but it was quite nice and showed a lot about the property. In sum, this is a fantastic resort for those looking to be pampered and get away from the hustle and bustle of reality. The staff here make every effort to make the guests happy, and even when the occupancy rate is fairly high (as it was during our stay), you feel like you are the only ones there.

I'd highly recommend snorkelling and the 'Espectacular show' at Xcaret. We also did a one day visit to the mayan ruins and pyramid. We also dined at all the 4 restaurants in the resort. Our favorite was the beach restaurant called 'Sands'. They have the most delicious appetizers and drinks! We also enjoyed the excellent ambience of the Thai restaurant called 'Saffron'. We had a wonderful dinner under the star studded sky right by the water. The other restaurant called 'Tamarind' was nice -- but a little expensive over the others. Plus, being vegetarians, there were fewer options. All in all, we had a great time at the banyan tree and so glad we chose this for our honeymoon!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cReally, really good.

All in all, it was a great experience. We were greeted at the outdoor lobby with a bracelet made of berries and flowers, as well as a drink made from local juice. From there we were taken on a golf cart to our villa (room number 521). The front door of the villa opened into the lawn and pool of the suite. If we turned right, we could access a separate room that had a huge sofa/bed, a small table and chairs, tv and, coffee maker. If we turned left, we reached our room. Once in the room, the bathroom with a walk in closet, huge stand alone double vanity, shower with glass wall to the outside, and private outdoor bathtub, were to the left. To the right was the bedroom with glass on two sides, both sides with direct access to the pool. The \"yard\" portion of the villa contained a hammock, pool, jacuzzi, lounge chairs and a small table and chairs. The lagoon that connects the three hotels of Mayakoba was behind the villa, although we were told that the area behind the villas is not used to ensure privacy. We ate at two of the three restaurants while there, Tamarind and Orient. We ate at Tamarind for one dinner and ended up doing the seven-course tasting menu. It was really, really good, not great, and expensive, but still enjoyable. Orient was great for breakfast, with lots of standard and Mexican choices. On our last night, we ate on the boat (Xchel) and really enjoyed it. To be honest, the food was very average (we chose the Mexican option) but the experience was magnificent. We spent two hours on the candle lit boat as it was driven around in the dark on the lagoon, going by all three hotels and the golf course. It was SO quiet and peaceful. It was unlike anything I have ever done before. On the middle day of our stay, we had appointments at the spa. We started out together with the \"Rainforest Trail.\" After changing into swimsuits, we met our guide who took us through the many different stations that included a rain walk, three different steam rooms, three different shower experiences, two different saunas, an ice rub and a pool that had three different massaging water features. Everything is indoors and we spent about five minutes at each station. It took about an hour to go through the whole thing. A couple of the stops seems either redundant or not as good as they could be (the water features in the pool at the end were so strong it was hard to relax) but it was a very cool experience and I would highly recommend it. Once done with the Rainforest, I went on to a 90-minute Thai massage which was quite possibly the best massage I've ever had. Great pressure, nice variety of techniques and incredibly relaxing. Like most everything else about our experience, we found the service to be really, really good, but not great. Small details were missing. The staff would sometimes speak loudly when it was inappropriate. We could also hear music and other noise while in our room coming from one of the staff supply areas across the lagoon. There we also more children than we expected, although they only got on our nerves a couple of times. :-) We have now stayed at both the Rosewood and Banyan Tree hotels at Mayakoba. I think overall the Rosewood is more \"us.\" It was tad more modern and the service and food were great. The two things that we liked better about the Banyan Tree though were the pool in our villa (the Rosewood just has plunge pools - still cool, but a lot smaller), and the boat dinner.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding in every way\u201d", "Author": "laterallife", "ReviewID": "UR124908912", "Content": "Although we didn't stay at the hotel, we did see a few rooms and dined in the Thai Saffron restaurant which was OUTSTANDING.

This time we stayed in a Courtyard Villa which was even nicer than our Garden room from last time. We also got a great deal through Jetsetter. You simply can't find a nicer hotel for the price - assuming you take advantage of the offers that are out there on various discounter sites. However, the service took a big hit since our last stay. Even though the hotel's occupancy was only around 60% during most of our stay, everything we tried to do seemed to be \"fully booked.\" For example, the hotel has this great eco tour around the mangroves that's free for guests. We tried to go sign up on 3 occasions and were told that the tour was booked. We finally went on our last day - we were on a waitlist - and of course after sitting on the boat for 15 minutes waiting for the other guests that never showed, we got our tour. We were the only ones. Apparently this happens all the time. On another night the hotel was having a special Argentinian BBQ at the beach restaurant. We tried to sign up for it and were told that it was booked solid. After complaining, the manager squeezed us in. Needless to say, during our 2 hour dinner we were one of 4 couples eating at the restaurant - so much for fully booked. We finally realized that they hotel management had no idea on how to yield manage its amenities. The other big change since our last stay was that this hotel became very kid friendly. There was tons of families with young children at the property and a nice kids clubs. We were even able to get fresh purees for our 6 month old every day delivered to our room for a nominal price. The babysitting service that the hotel uses is also great and very flexible. If you end up booking the service for more than just a few hours here and there you can negotiate a steep discount to the quoted rate. Bottom line, I would still recommend this hotel. However, if you are staying for more than a few days definitely get a rental car. While Playa del Carmen is a little cheesy, its nice to get off the property for dinner and there are lots of good and much more reasonable dining options in town. Cabs are extremely expensive.

Normally I travel to Cabo once or twice a year and almost exclusely stay at the One and Only Palmilla. I have stayed at the Rosewood Mayakoba previously and loved it but got such a good deal on this resort that I couldn't pass it up. It exceeded my expectations for sure and I loved it much more than the Rosewood. I booked the trip through Jetsetter (highly recommended as you can get an awesome deal) and we stayed in a Garden Villa. It was more than enough room for the two of us with a lovely outdoor covered daybed as well as loungers and table and chairs. FYI there is a plug by the daybed to charge your ipad or plug in your laptop. This room does not have a hot tub but does have the lovely huge private pool. We had daily visits from a very large but tame anteater in our courtyard and morning wakeups from very annoying chachalaca birds (the locals say they taste like chicken!). As far as bugs go, there were tiny ants in our courtyard which did bite but bug spray helped that. I got maybe 2 mosquito bites the entire week. As others have said when it rained hard there was some water leakage under the front door but not a big deal, loads of towels in the room to dry it up. We had lovely weather the whole week actually so rain wasn't much of an issue anyway. For two people this room is more than enough size and very luxurious and when I return I plan on staying with this room category. We didn't spend enough time in the room to really use a sitting room other than the outdoor areas. We had room 401 btw. We spent the first day at the large pool by the main building which was very quiet and relaxing. After that we trecked to the beach pool for the rest of the days which was a lot smaller but warmer (we were told both were heated). Plus lots more action down at the beach. My friend went out on a snorkeling trip on a kayak with one of the staff (if the water is calm they are happy to take you out) and we had almost daily complimentary massages by the pool which were amazing. We did not golf or take advantage of the spa but heard they are both great. We did not rent bikes but used the golf cart service and never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a cart.The one activity we did participate in was the boat tour. Ignacio knew all the places to find alligators, turtles, nesting birds, and cenotes. It was a really cool tour and worth the time. We were amazed by the food. The breakfast buffet (which we did not miss!) had different hot selections daily including local fare and the chef was happy to make you anything, especially if you were dining late and they ran out of something on the buffet. We had dinner the first 2 nites at Sands which was amazing. We had the grilled seafood for 2 the first night and I had the lamb chops the second night, both excellent. We ate at Saffron the next two nights and this was amazing Thai food with good selections (I live in the midwest so finding good Thai is not easy). We enjoyed the Massaman beef and Shrimp pad thai. The appetizer sampler was also delicious. The third night we ate at Tamarind. Excellent carrot soup-highly recommend! Chairs there were a little strange though! For lunch we ate by the pool or skipped because of a late breakfast. Lunches were quite good. Loved the shrimp quesadillas. The food was almost as good as the One and Only and much better than the Rosewood. We did not leave the resort because the menu options were extensive and all was so delicious! What really made our stay exceptional was the service and the staff. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home and all of our needs were met on a timely basis. Room service was quick and friendly. Housekeeping was exceptional. The little nightly local made gifts they left us were a treasure, and they were so kind to provide an extra each night for my friend upon request. We travel a lot together as we live in different parts of the country, and for the past few years we have had a travel companion, a plastic lobster named Larry. He even has his own wardrobe! Larry was a hit with the staff who inquired of him if he was hidden in our bag. Many took pictures with him to show to their kids! At breakfast the chef would bring him his own plate of eggs and the waiters would bring a glass of champagne, just for our toy friend! The bartenders at the pool made him a mini tequila shot which was hysterical! A few staff to mention in particular who were outstanding. I would mention more but I can't remember all the names! The first night at sands we met Emmanuel the manager who was so lovely and accomodating. Erik our waiter was phenomenal and is studying to be a sommelier so his knowledge of wine is extensive. We asked for him the second night there and we were seated out by the pool under the stars which was perfect! Ask for him when dining there. Every day around 3 we would head to Reflections bar to visit with the bartender extraordinaire, William (aka Will.i.am). He is the funnest lovliest guy ever! And quite the fortune teller! He makes a great drink and plays great music. His smile is infectious and we just had a blast with him! We even went by on our last morning to say goodbye and have one last tequila shot! All of our waiters at Saffron, Tamarind, and Oriente were amazing and went above and beyond. I am sorry I cannot recall their names. We enjoyed a glass of wine nightly before dinner at the Copa bar with Cecilia and the gals there just loved Larry. It was so much fun to talk to them. Also we can't forget Eduardo Martinez, the head of the pool/beach staff. He gives an amazing massage and took my friend for her snorkeling expedition. He is an exceptional individual. All the other pool staff were also just as friendly and accomodating. Ignacio from the boat tour was awesome! He let Larry captain the boat! He was very knowledgable. All the staff love practicing their English and love to talk about the local culture and their lives...all you have to do is ask! I highly recommend this property, not only for the accomodations, but for the service and the experience you will have while here. If you are looking to stay right on the beach with the waves breaking at your doorstep, this is not your place. However, if you are looking to relax and enjoy good food and excellent service, this property is not to be missed.

The prior reviews suggesting that there are seemingly 3-4 employees per hotel patron are not hyperbole. That is actually the case. These employees bid you a greeting, hold a door for you or explain that \"[your] satisfaction is [their] number one priority.\" Without exaggeration, in the the common areas, it is sometimes virtually impossible for a patron to hold a door for oneself. Although we were told that the property was half-full, we seemed to see only 5 or 6 other couples during our entire stay. Due to the expansiveness of the resort and the desire of many people to not even leave the confines of their villa, I do not doubt that the staff being candid with me about the level of occupancy. That's the beauty of the place: you feel, at all times, like it's yours and yours alone. At times, you need to pinch yourself to check whether you are in a deep utopian dream. We stayed in the lowest end Garden Pool Villa. The pictures on the website don't lie. Even the lowest end villa is an embarrassment of riches -- lavishly appointed room with separate bathroom suite, and a dainty little 1,000 square foot separate outside private pool patio area and an outdoor bed, in addition to the one indoors. While I'm more of an adverturer and my wife is generally more content to stay on-property during beach vacations, at no point did I feel even slightly inclined to leave the property. The exception was taking a shuttle over to the (still on property) Rosewood for dinner one night (which, incidentally, was also exquisite). Read other reviews for how good the food is at every on-property restaurant -- it's all true.

Out of all the places we've stayed at in the western hemisphere, Banyan Tree Mayakoba comes out on top. When we looked around for our spring vacation, I couldn't find anything that offered as nice of a room (in terms of space, pool, etc.), especially for the price. We thought the beach, restaurants, spa and facilities were all very good and the room set-up, service and brunch exceptional. Highly recommend paying a little more for the courtyard suite, to get your own hot tub (as the pools are on the cool side, even in August) and dining pavilion. While I generally prefer to stay right on the beach, the inland private setting was lovely, and I didn't mind the 5 minute commute by golf cart. While this hotel has more of a honeymoon than a family vibe, we found it to be absolutely ideal for traveling with a young child. While our baby was napping, we were able to enjoy the villa's pool, lounge chairs and spacious outdoor area. The hotel provided a nice crib and swag for baby, and we were thrilled to see that the crib fit perfectly in the walk-in closet, so our baby had her own sleeping quarters where she had total darkness and slept soundly. Most nights we ordered room service after our baby went to bed and enjoyed a nice leisurely dinner in the villa (we brought our monitor so we could be in the pavilion and hear she was ok). When the baby was awake, she had plenty of room to play and run around in the villa (which was relatively babyproof) - she loved every minute of this place! The staff was incredibly warm toward children, the babysitter we used twice was very sweet and good with kids, and there were a few other kids our baby's age who seemed to be enjoying as well. Re food, We enjoyed dinner at Saffron (gorgeous setting), liked the restaurant at the beach for lunch and dinner and didn't try Tamarind (no kids, but this time I will have them deliver to our room) - all were the same price as restaurants in NYC and not quite as good, but still above average for a beach resort (I have yet to find one with truly exceptional food). Room service was quite good, but I wish the menu had a bit more variety (it got old after so many nights). The in-room BBQ looked amazing but was incredibly expensive, so we did not partake. As far as concerns, nothing material - we had a few ants when we left food out, but as soon as we dealt with the food, there were no more ants. I didn't get any mosquito bites despite seeing them in the air (they normally eat me alive).

The reviews on this site swayed us to stay at the Banyan Tree over the other Mayakoba properties, and I can say that we were THRILLED to have made that choice. Arriving at the BTM was a really cool experience. Entering through the grand Mayakoba gate, passing through the serene path, and then through another security gate was both exciting, and also added a good sense of security. We pulled up to the amazing entrance of the resort and were immediately greeted by staff who welcomed us, took our bags and car, and brought us in to meet our \u201cgreeter\u201d. Everyone called us by name right from the start. The greeter walked us in to the outdoor lounge area, served us a nice local juice concoction, and gave us a great explanation of the resort. She then escorted us to our villa. We chose to stay in a Garden Pool Villa, #111. It was conveniently located right near the main area. Having your own villa is great, and having one with a really big pool, yard, outdoor tub, outdoor lounge, along with the view of the lagoon is just amazing - and this was the 'lowest' level accommodation. We settled into our room and just took in the amazing surroundings. The villa itself was really great. The decor was really nice, and the huge glass windows/doors gave us great views of our gorgeous yard and pool. The bathroom was luxurious and opened up to a really romantic private tub. The yard itself was perhaps the greatest part about the BTM. Multiple couches and lounge chairs adorned the large private yard settled around a pretty large infinity splash pool. We found ourselves lounging here a lot throughout the vacation. Some folks have commented that the unheated pool was a problem - certainly a bit warmer would have been nicer, but I didn't find it to be a big deal. Also, I'd recommend asking for turndown service nightly - our first night we came back from dinner to find our bed covered in roses, with incense burning, music playing, and a bottle of wine ready to be opened. It was wonderfully romantic. The main area of the resort was quite spectacular. Besides the stunning architecture and artwork, it was a wonderful place to relax. Whether it was the bar with live music, to the outdoor couches to lounge on, or in the gallery and shops, there was always something to do in the main area. Dining at the BTM was also great. We ate at the Sands, Oriente, Tamarind, and Saffron. Each was a special experience. Our first night we ate at the Sands and had a great authentic Mexican meal, accompanied by some really tasty Tequila drinks. The service was personal and friendly from our server Eric. This meal set the bar high, and every meal following was equally as good. Tamarind was a really good Mediterranean meal, and Saffron, the signature restaurant was amazing. I'd recommend asking for the two person table on the pier overlooking the river. It was absolutely stunning to enjoy 5-star Thai food while looking out on the water under the moonlight. It was so good we went back. We also ate at the Sands every day for lunch on the beach - great Mexican snacks and light meals to go along with your margarita and pina colada. And anyone who goes to the BTM will tell you that the breakfast at Oriente is epic. Calling it breakfast is a disservice - it's one of the most sumptuous meals you'll ever eat. A combination of classic continental breakfast along with a complete feast of local fare will have you going back for seconds and thirds. It's an amazing way to start your day. And as usual, the service was some of the best I've ever had. We actually travelled to the Rosewood for one meal at Punta Bonita (Mexican food) and it was quite good too. It's great that you can travel between the Mayakoba resorts and bill to your room. When you're at a resort like this, you are going to spend a lot of time on the beach. I will admit, the beach down at Mayakoba isn't that huge, but it's certainly adequate for hours of lounging. It's located by the Sands restaurant and the infinity pool and bar. When we arrived, we asked for two beach beds which the staff graciously set up for us. No better way to relax on the white sand than with a comfortable lounge bed. The ocean water was warm and clear blue...we could have spent all day in it! The staff from the Sands were always very attentive to us, bringing us drinks, snacks, towels or umbrellas - always making sure we were happy and comfortable out on the beach. I highly recommend guests take a ride on the free Eco boat tour. It's a great way to see the entire grounds of Mayakoba and also see some beautiful plants and animals indigenous to the region. We also HIGHLY recommend the rainforest spa. I've never seen anything like it. It's a full hour temperature, color, sound, and texture sensation that you can go through as a couple. You go through various showers, spas, saunas, and heat pools designed to soothe you. You walk out feeling brand new. And don't forget to check in on Foursquare for a discount! Finally, though we didn't get to do it, I hear the cooking classes are a fun way to learn about the local cuisine and try something new. Next time we'll have to try it. There are SOOO many great things to say about BTM that I can't even remember them all here - and really, only minor things to complain about. My only gripes are the availability of some of the restaurants for dinner (Oriente and Sands are rarely open for dinner, and sometimes in Mexico you want Mexican food), the unheated pool, or perhaps the reliance on buggys to get around (which worked just fine for us). We also definitely recommend using the bug spray provided in your room and at the outdoor restaurants! The resort is just spectacular, and honestly, I've never experienced service as good as I had there. It is the warmest, friendliest, and most helpful resort staff I've seen in my life - and they'll do ANYTHING to make your trip perfect. I can't express how much of a game-changer that is - I'd rather go back to BTM knowing how great it is than try one of the other, very good resorts in the area. You cannot go wrong, and most certainly will be happy if you book a trip to the Banyan Tree Mayakoba.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWOW.

After traveling far and wide to some amazing resorts, Banyan Tree Mayakoba stood out like no other, and we have even decided to return to this resort every year from here on. PROPERTY: This property is stunning. I noticed a previous reviewer mentioned that no matter how much you read, whatever pictures you see, and how much you build up your expectations, you will still not believe it until you see it with your own eyes. Every last detail put into this resort is incredible. From the Banyan Tree itself literally in the middle of the resort to the decor in even the bathrooms, this place is gorgeous. We must have taken over 100 pictures a day of probably the same thing over and over again, but we could not get over how beautiful everything was. Similar to the St. Regis, the entrance is very jungle-like until you reach the entrance and lobby presented with their grand architecture and a lilly pond. The lagoon is a really nice addition in which the Banyan Tree stands, and I love that you can take a boat ride over to the other side of the resort and even eat at one of the restaurants that is on the lagoon! Also, I strongly recommend everyone rent bikes... I learned to ride a bike here! We then rode our bikes literally everywhere, including around the golf course. It was an amazing ride and a great way to get around as the beach is further away. There are paths everywhere, this is a no brainer. While most resorts offer transportation via golf carts, Banyan Tree gets it right by also offering the option to take the boat to some locations as well as renting bikes to get around the property at your leisure. The one annoying thing is that it's $5 to rent each bike per day, but considering that is the one issue I had, who cares. SPA: Oh.My.God. We walked into the spa thinking we'd just take a look, but the service was so amazing (they serve Hibiscus water as you sit with a consultant, yum!) and the trophy labeled \"2011 Best Luxury Resort Spa\" standing true and proud on the counter, we just had to try a massage regardless of price. This is the best massage I have ever had, my masseuse was actually trained in and came directly from Bali. I can't explain the experience, I just know it is a must for anyone that stays here. We also did the rainforest experience -- another experience that cannot be imitated. This is an incredible idea and experience, we had so much fun and my body was and still is glowing. GYM: Great gym. It's not big, but it has newer equipment and everything you need for a full body workout, is very clean, and is always stocked with towels and water. FOOD: The reviewer that said breakfast is an emotional experience nailed it. Get the breakfast buffet, you won't regret it. Anything you want, you got it. If you want to be really healthy or really disgusting, there are options and they will fill you up. Further, they serve you your drinks so it's not annoying to carry your plate as you try and pour and create a mess. In Villa dining is very quick, but it's hard to customize certain orders -- we are vegetarian, so it was tough. Regardless, all delicious and I requested a tea that was from the spa but not on the menu, and they got the ingredients and made it for me, wow! The other restaurants are delicious... I've never been to a place where I could eat at all the restaurants and really enjoy the food, but here I did, and there's great variety. One thing I did miss was authentic Mexican food. Also, had I known that you could venture to the Rosewood to check out other restaurants, I would have definitely done so. ROOMS: Just, wow. And we only had the standard Garden Villa. Our villa was next to the lobby, so I can't relate to the complaints about being far, but again, you are on vacation and either enjoy the walk over or rent a bike, because if it weren't for property size, the amenities wouldn't exist. Anyway, the first entrance opens up to a ginormous area where you have a mini outdoor pavilion with a couch you can lay on (think Miami), as well as two very very large and comfortable lounge chairs with an umbrella. The pool is large, I mean, you can swim laps around this thing. Past the pool and around the corner of the villa is a hammock to lay out (nice!) and nearby is a view of the lake (which is blocked enough by trees for some privacy) and a small dining area for two... nice! There are sliding doors all around (see picture) and when you enter the room, to the right is the mini bar, foyer, office area and bed. The ceilings are huge, the lighting is excellent, and the beds are oh so comfortable. The decor is amazing all around. The mini bar has an espresso maker stocked with illy - really fun to make my own frothy cappuccino every morning. The bathroom is to the left of the main entrance, and it is my dream bathroom. There is a HUGE walk in closet, a separate bathroom, and a separate rainforest shower big enough for two and even has a marble seating area. There are two large sinks within the counter in the middle of the bathroom, and floor to ceiling mirrors -- needless to say, it was plenty of space for the two of us. There are sliding doors that lead outside to a beautiful bathtub with a wall of candles, it was too bad we couldn't use it because it was cold. A really nice touch is that the resort thinks of everything -- in the closet you will find a beach bag, swimsuit bag, laundry bag, umbrellas, bug spray, and other necessities. In the bathroom on the sinks there are pouchettes with toiletries like shaving foam and a razor, toothbrush and toothpaste, swabs, hair brush and comb, etc. It was a small touch, but like I said, every detail is thought through at this place and I have to mention it. SERVICE: I wanted to hug everyone at this place. Each and every staff member's contagious, genuine smiles made me smile back. These people take their jobs seriously and literally take pleasure in making people happy. I can go on about this for pages, but basically anything you need, they will do. The cleaning service is so amazing (we had six people cleaning our villa every day from stocking the fridge to cleaning the pool and even folding and hanging all of our clothes) and the friendly service makes you beam. Overall, this is a gem of a find and you cannot go wrong with this price.

The Garden Villa was spacious, with a huge bathroom, outside tub, a separate comfortable seating area, private pool and hot-tub (both heated). All was very private and luxe looking. The resort property is very nice and the service is fabulous. Townhouse Room I am giving this resort 4 stars because of the hiccups we had with our first room (we switch because of this). Our first room was a 3 bedroom townhouse (for 2 people but, I got a great deal on expedia). The platform bed was broken - literally the board kept collapsing. The safe broke and we couldn't get our money out until the next morning (missed dinner out), the lights down the stairs broke 4 times (or rather there was a circut issue). The town house was huge and probably great for a family but, we didn't need all of the space and walking downstairs to the bedroom felt like we were going into a basement. When we moved to the garden villa - it was fabulous. Same type of room but, all on one floor. The pool here was heated but, in the townhouse it was not. Odd. HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW If you are looking to have a room on the beach - this is not the place for you. In mayakoba, the hotel (main lobby) and the rooms (private bungalows) are surrounded by manicured trees, mangroves, canals that runs on for about 6 miles. There are three large hotels in the mayakoba area. At the Banyan tree and I think the others - you need a golf cart to take you around the resort. It is spread out in a very pretty setting - a natural jungle like setting which is a little ways in a cart from the beach. All of it is very pretty but, you are not right on the beach. It is hard to get a sense of where you are in the resort because all of the rooms are separate and spread out. We liked the Banyan Tree set up but, were happy to have a few days in Cancun at a hotel right on the beach. THE BEACH at the banyan tree is a very small strip. Not the nicest MAIN POOL (pool looking at the ocean) was quite small - chairs were limited. We didn't sit by the pool by the hotel - it was not by the ocean and it was not heated. RESTAURANTS Oriental - great buffet breakfast Saffron - pretty good. limited inside seating and it was cold Rosewood Beach restaurant - you can take a golf cart there as well - pretty good. Spa - incredible massage We loved our stay was we switched to the Garden Villa and actually used all of the space. Regarding other reviews - the mosquitos were not troublesome. They were there but, I didnt get one bite! The gym - I am a work out fanatic. There is a gym - small but, very nice.

The complex, set amongst a large network of mangroves and canals, comprises three resorts (the Banyan Tree, the Fairmont and the Rosewood), an 18-hole golf course managed by the Fairmont, as well as room for two additional resorts. The set-up of the Banyan Tree, similarly to that of the Fairmont and Rosewood, differs from your typical beach-side hotel, in that the majority of the villas (aside from very few large two-bedroom villas) do not face the sea. Instead, they are spread out in the mangroves, facing internal (man-made, surprisingly) canals, clustered around the main structure of the hotel where most amenities are (reception, restaurants, spa, boutiques, main pool, etc.). Guests access the beach through a beach club reachable by buggy, boat trip through the canals (from reception, about 10 mins every 15-30 mins) or bicycles (which can be rented for USD5 per day; journey time depends on location of the room, but I reckon anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes). Now, although this set-up can be strikingly pictoresque at times, being at least 10/15 minutes away from the beach may not be to everybody\u2019s liking (I must say I wasn\u2019t a huge fan) and it is something that should be borne in mind before booking. Rooms The rooms themselves are well appointed (we stayed in Garden Villas, the basic type), with a large-ish outdoor pool facing the mangroves/canals (not heated, a problem during the slightly cooler season), Bose stereo, large flat-screen TV, free Wi-Fi (which could have been decidedly faster), coffee machine (with Illy system), walk-in closet, large bathroom with separate tub (outdoor) and shower. As the hotel is relatively new, the state of d\u00e9cor/cleanliness in the room is immaculate. However, in my view, the key factor for the rooms is location - I recommend requesting villas that are close to reception, so that you can walk to the restaurants, spa, etc. As people have pointed out before, you do not want to be stuck somewhere in the middle between the beach and the reception area, which would force you to take the bicycle/buggy everywhere. As I have said before, very few (large) villas are actually by the beach, and you will invariably need some sort of transportation to access it, so you might as well be near reception. Beach The beach club, once you get to it, is rather disappointing. The pool is far too small and the beach loungers are mostly concentrated on the stretch of beach immediately facing the pool, which, during high season, makes for a rather unpleasant and cramped atmosphere (with loungers placed horizontally, i.e. not facing the sea, all next to each other, as you can see from some travelers\u2019 pictures). There are some loungers located on an adjacent stretch of beach, which are more spread out so you don\u2019t quite feel like a sardine. The catch is that you are exposed to more wind. There are two restaurants at the beach club, more on which later. The sea is also nothing special. The main pool by the reception area is quite nice and feels more secluded and intimate. It is heated, which is certainly a plus in December/January, and the are fewer, better spread-out loungers. Alas, most of them face the wrong way, away from the sun all day long. By my reckoning, there are only 6 or so loungers (by the children\u2019s pool) which actually do face the sun. A rather silly design flaw, if you ask me. Which brings to another problem, the sun itself. At least in December/January, the sun sets rather early (at around 6pm) and is weak after 4pm. This is obviously not the fault of the resort but it is something that people should bear in mind when considering the Riviera Maya as a destination during the winter months. Restaurants As to the food, it tends to be rather good. As has been mentioned many times before, the breakfast buffet at Oriente is particularly well assorted, with pretty much every breakfast food you can think of, most of it of excellent quality. Tamarind, a Western-type formal(ish) a la carte restaurant, was truly excellent one night (tasting menu) and somewhat disappointing another (a la carte). Sands (by the beach club) and Reflections (by the main pool) were both excellent for lunch fare, with the club sandwich at Reflections one of the best I\u2019ve had in a hotel recently. Saffron, Banyan Tree\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019 Thai restaurant, was very good for dinner (a la carte). My only gripe is that there is a rotating buffet that alternates between Sands, Oriente and Saffron for dinner. We caught it at Sands (BBQ theme) and it really wasn\u2019t very good I\u2019m afraid. Then again, I am strongly prejudiced against buffets and I wished they got rid of them altogether, keeping both Saffron and Sands always a la carte at dinner time and simply shutting Oriente. Also, next to Sands, there is MK Blue, which, at least during high season, offers a light lunch-time BBQ buffet to relieve some of the pressure off Sands. We tried it once and it was just about OK (all the meats were pre-cooked of course and simply re-grilled to order, a la Nando\u2019s). The prices are reasonable, perhaps cheaper than at expensive US resorts and certainly much cheaper that a equivalent resorts in Europe (USD10-20ish for starters, USD20-40ish for main courses, USD15 for cocktails, USD6 for beer, etc.), though bear in mind the service charge and taxes (more on the former below). In particular, the wine list was put together with an eye to value, with decent bottles at, considering the context, far from extortionate prices, with plenty of (good) choices below the USD100 mark and a fair few below the USD50 mark. For a resort of this kind, this was rather refreshing. Normally, you can also try the restaurants in the other Mayakoba resorts, something which we looked forward to doing. Alas, this was not an option during the Christmas/New Year period. Having said that the food was generally quite good, we had one spectacular disappointment \u2013 the New Year\u2019s Eve \u2018gala\u2019 dinner at MK Blue, by the beach. At USD300 plus drinks, it was reasonably expensive and was, simply put, beyond redemption. With large communal tables of 10-12 people, food that was mostly pre-prepared and generally not very good (some sort of Asian fusion from hell), and really cheesy entertainment (band with Diana Ross wigs, fire jugglers, and, I kid you not, people on stilts), it felt very much like being at a poor wedding reception or corporate event. We dined out on two occasions: once at Luna Maya in Playa del Carmen (reasonably good Mexican food in a pleasant setting, away from the street chaos, though with painfully slow service) and once at La Marea restaurant at the Tides (the restaurant was very good; the hotel, which I had considered booking instead of the Banyan Tree, seemed rather charming, if a little bit on the tired side). Service The service was impeccable. It truly was. Everybody was extremely friendly, polite and efficient. I don\u2019t think I exaggerate when I say that it probably was the best service I have come across in a resort of this sort recently. With one exception. I was told by a member of the concierge staff that, in light of the high season, it was highly advisable to book restaurants ahead. After some toing and froing with the concierge, we settled on a plan, which the concierge confirmed, including NYE dinner at MK Blue and a dinner at a restaurant in another Mayakoba resort. Upon arrival, I was presented with a restaurant itinerary for our stay. There was no mention of the other Mayakoba restaurant (only then I was told that during high season each Mayakoba resort only takes bookings from its own guests) or of the NYE dinner (which I had to book from scratch there and then; fortunately (or unfortunately, as it turned out), there were places left). The reservations at the Tides and Luna Maya were, however, confirmed. Or so we thought. When we showed up at both, they had no record of our reservations. Thankfully, both had tables available (though at Luna Maya the table was inside, which was not quite as pleasant as outside). All a bit bizarre, I must say. I planned on raising the issue with the concierge but never got around to it. I should also point out an oddity regarding the service charge. The room fee is subject to a 15% service charge, which, for a week during high season in a Garden Villa, comes to about a grand. I thought this would cover all tips in the hotel. Not so. Each food/beverage/service is subject to an additional 15% service charge. On top of that, you can leave \u2018additional tip\u2019. Frankly, I was a bit baffled by this entire arrangement and asked what it was all about. It seems that the 15% service charge is shared amongst all the hotel employees, whereas the \u2018additional tip\u2019 goes to the person that served you directly. Of course, as everybody was so nice, you always felt you should leave at least 5%-10% additional tip. However, if you take into account how much you\u2019re paying for \u2018service\u2019 in total, it does add up. I did say that the prices for food/drinks are fair, so 15%-25% on that is fine, but the rooms are really quite expensive and paying 15% on that on top of everything else seems a bit much. Golf Although I am an appalling golfer, I did give the golf course a go. The green fee is not cheap at USD120 per person (from 3pm onwards) (plus USD40 for the clubs and a USD30 rider fee for those not playing), but the course seemed very good (at least to my decidedly amateurish eyes). Conclusion All in all, a beautiful resort, though not without flaws. For those looking for a \u2018pure\u2019 beach experience, as perhaps I was, I recommend looking elsewhere (not just in Playa, but beyond). For those who are keen on Playa, then, if you can live with not being right on the beach, then I suspect that, despite the hiccups, the Banyan Tree is as good as you\u2019re going to get (possibly tied with the Rosewood). P.S. Unlike some posters below, we did not have any problems with mosquitoes at all and had only minor issues with the ants (not in the rooms, but when walking around/on the beach).", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cExceeded all expectations!\u201d", "Author": "thekiwiguy", "ReviewID": "UR122186396", "Content": "I have traveled all over the world and stayed in some amazing places.....This place ranks right up there as one of my favorite.

The first time was in in 2009 several months after they opened, and when time opened usually improves the quality of service and getting out the kinx, the oppositie was true with this property. First, lets start with the positive. I must admit, the rooms at this place are incredible and at the price point, nearly impossible to beat. Huge rooms, private pools, etc. However, the service has gone downhill BIG time since the first visit. The attention to detail seems to have vanished and they have a REALLY hard time managing their own reservation systems. 2 examples. They have on sight special BBQs on the beach. When we attempted to sign up, we were told it was booked solid and they had no space. They called us last minute with a cancellation. Well, when we got to the BBQ, we literally were one of about 3 couples there over a two hour window- so \"sold out\" didnt appear to be the case. Same holds true with their Eco Tour-- every time we tried to sign up for it, completely booked. But when we finally got on the last day of our trip due to a couple cancelling, we literally were the ONLY ONES on the boat. Again- bad management of their own reservations systems. Food was ok- but worth having a car and going in to Playa for better, more authentic, and more reasonably priced food. Finally- while the first time around, we didnt seem to mind the carts you have to take to the beach club. Well this time we had our infant in tow, and realized it is a bit of a pain to have to load up all of his stuff on a cart, and constantly be waiting for transportation, to get back and forth to the villa.

Our courtyard garden villa (one level above the basic) had high ceilings, plenty of space, and a separate sitting room that served as an office. Our private plunge pool was large enough to swim in and the jacuzzi was fantastic. The grounds are gorgeous, there were always friendly faces available to help, the buffet breakfast was scrumptious, the spa delightful, room service exquisite, and Saffron restaurant was perfect (see below) In sum, it is a world class resort. So why the four star review? Well we had a rough start. We arrived at noon and were informed our room would not be ready until 3. Totally fair since that is check in time. We went to the beach to wait, ordered some food (they got the order wrong) and when we inquired about our room at 2, they informed us shortly thereafter that our room was ready. We packed up our stuff and took the five minute golf cart ride to the room. When we arrived the seemingly confused host asked our names and realized that this was not our room (which was a blessing since this room 211 is between the beach ad the lobby making either one a significant hike). We stood there for ten to fifteen minutes as she made phone calls only to eventually inform us that this was not our room. We were taken back to the lobby and then just left there until we walked in to ask what was going on and were finally informed our room was ready (which we loved and was in a perfect location walking distance from the main lobby).\u00a0 Other issues were related to the fact\u00a0that in high season they seem a bit overwhelmed. We had to wait for a table on more than one morning at the breakfast buffet, the tour guide/travel advisor was almost always occupied with others, and the gym was often crowded with one cardio machine (out of four) that was out of order for most of the week and another that worked on and off. We informed the staff about it but they remained out of order and so we simply had to forego cardio on a couple of occasions (I know not the end of the world but still. . .) Finally, when they moved the lovely Saffron into a different location due to weather claiming it would be the same food, service etc., it was a shell of our first experience with none of the amenities and only mediocre service (the other restaurant tamarind is also lovely).

With the upgrade comes an additional room with a living and dining area, a slightly larger pool and a hot tub. I would definitely want these again for our next visit. Our room was close to the lobby area and 2 of the 4 restaurants - which means that it was quite far from the beach. However, every half hour during the daylight hours there is a boat that leaves from the lobby to the beach area. It takes about 10 minutes and it is just so serene and beautiful - I looked forward to it each time. If you miss the boat there are always golf carts ready to take you back and forth. The beach is very nice and the beach front pool is heated. There is also a big, beautiful pool in the lobby area which is unfortunately not heated so I never saw anyone in it. I knew going in that our villa pool would be unheated so I didn't expect to use it. I forced myself to go in one day and it was okay once I got used to it, but not really enjoyable. My husband went in a couple of times and said it was \"refreshing\". The restaurants were all very nice and the food was very good. Tamarind and Saffron were both very beautiful at night.

A few cons before we get to the pros. -We went in December and were eaten by mosquitoes. Although this maynot be indicative of the resort and just the area/season, waking up with mosquito bites makes for an itchy day! -There are 2 fine dining restaurants at the Banyan Tree with the option to also go to sister resorts (the Rosewood and The Fairmont) aswell. However, when we were there the Rosewood had private events, so the restaurants were not available. Advice: take the time to book in advance and know your options. Pros: -The Banyan Tree resort is beautiful. Immaculately maintained with all the amenities you could want in a resort. The villas were spaced out nicely to allow for adequate privacy but you didn't feel deserted. The beach and pool club was a little far, but one can easily call to be escorted by golf cart or rent bikes for the duration of your stay, like we did. The bike ride was really nice and bikes can be parked easily all over the resort. The villas are very modern with attention to every detail to make your stay comfortable. When we were there the plunge pools were too cold to use, however we imagine these are a wonderful amenity to have when visiting in the summer. -The breakfast at the Oriente was great. A versatile offering of food each day, all prepared fresh and well made. The juice bar was a favorite of mine, especially the delicious Green Juice (Jugo Verde), which I wish I had gotten the recipe for! The lunch option was mainly the Sands, which was right by the beach. This was adequate for lunch and the convenience of not having to leave the pool/beach area was great. For dinner, we dined one night at Tamarind and another night at Saffron. Both were very good, with excellent service catering toany special food needs you may have. The experience at both were very enjoyable. The third night we took a recommendation from the hotel of a place to go to in Playa del Carmen called Maya Luna. The food was ok, the service was good but the area around the restaurant was empty (it was raining that night), so we didn't walk around and returned right after our meal. Unless you plan on walking around, probably not worth it. -The boat tour of the mangroves was something we were going to skip, but then upon recommendation of the staff, we decided to go. It was definitely a fun/interesting thing to do. We were able to see some beautiful birds, croccodiles and some other parts of the Mayakoba property. It took about 1hr and 15 min to do and the boat ride was pleasant. -We also had an excellent experience at the Spa. The masseuses were extremely skilled and the spa itself was really clean and calming. -Lastly, the service throughout the entire resort was impeccable and extremely impressive. We were always greated with a smile and anything we needed was attended to within seconds. The staff is constantly communcating via radio/earpiece in a subtle manner that ensures that the resort runs securely and efficiently and all guests are attended to. Advice: Bring extra singles with you for tipping. We ran out of them and getting change was only possible at the main reception (which, with the layout of this hotel, we didn't frequent). Given the extraordinary service, you will want to show your appreciation.We really can't say enough about the wonderful service at the Banyan Tree and it is one of the leading reasons we will definitely return!

You simply will not find any nicer accommodations and or service anywhere.

We chose the Banyan Tree Mayakoba under an unusual set of circumstances - we had actually rented a house on the beach that was horrible upon arrival. Frantically I used TripAdvisor to find a suitable replacement for the remainder of our trip, and I knew Banyan Tree from some Asian vacations my husband and I had taken. We both agree now that it was the best thing that could have happened to us, as we would not have found this oasis of a vacation destination to which we are certainly planning to return. We literally showed up at the front door asking if they had availability, as the house we had rented did not have cell service. We felt welcomed right from the start, with fresh towels and drinks for the whole family. They took ALL of our bags, including a ton of groceries (since we had been planning to cook), to our room and didn't say a word about the hassle. They escorted us to their family-friendly restaurant while our room was being prepared, and that was the start of our worry-free, spoiled-rotten vacation. A few people have noted that they did not think the Banyan Tree was a preferable resort to take your children. I whole-heartedly disagree. The 3-bedroom townhouse could not have been more perfect for our family, with the roof-top pool and the small kitchen. I read that some of the villas had separate rooms that small childrens would have to walk across a courtyard and/or pool to get to their parents. To those folks I would say - get the townhouse. All 3 rooms on the same level with your children just across the hallway. Everyone had their own bathroom, and tons of room for all of our family \"stuff\". I also think that the rooftop pool was perfect for a family - a good size and not bothering anyone with the kids splashing around. The Banyan Tree was VERY catering to our family. We even called to ask if they had a baby gate to keep our 1-year-old from falling down the stairs, and they had one to us in short order with the tags still on it. We joked that they probably didn't have one, but ran right out to buy one for us. Now that's service! The service really was top-notch. From the same waiter that greeted us every morning and welcomed us to the fantastic breakfast buffet, to the employees always willing to whisk us away on a golf cart to wherever we wanted to go. The turn down services were so nice....the candles and the soft relaxing music. It was even romantic with a baby and toddler running around! The whole family loved the boat tour, as we cruised around the riverways of the resort with an incredibly nice host who went out of his way to show my kids animals that would make them squeal with joy. One of the highlights exemplifying the service at this resort was a request we had on Thanksgiving day. They were only serving Thanksgiving dinner at their \"adults only\" restaurant, which at first really disappointed us, as we were there with our 3 kids and wanted to celebrate this day as a family. Instead they brought us the entire meal, course by course, to our room and set it up at our in-room dining table. The poor guy had to keep going back to get the next course, but it was all delicious and presented in such a lovely setting. It was a fantastic Thanksgiving! We were so grateful they made that happen for us at our request. We are just thrilled to have found a non-traditional resort in Mexico, as my husband and I both agree that we are not as in to the typical all-inclusive resorts there. We absolutely love Asia and their amazing properties, of which the Banyan Tree reminds us. I sometimes had to remind myself that we were actually in Mexico, and not Bali. For us, having this type of property on the other end of a 3-hour direct flight, is something we are DEFINITELY going to take advantage of for future family and \"just us\" trips. Thank you, Banyan Tree, for taking care of us in our time of need. We'll be seeing you again soon! PS - don't forget the mosquito repellent.

This is a great place for a honeymoon, anniversary or any special occassion. The reviews you read about this place are true! It will exceed your expectations. We especially enjoyed Cesar and Alejandro at breakfast. They wait in the Oriente breakfast buffet. They were extremely personal and warmed our mornings. They remembered our names and always made us feel welcome. As many have mentioned the breakfast buffet is incredible. It had plentiful offerings of fresh fruit and juices, meats, cheeses, breads, mexican specialties, omlettes prepared to order, etc. We dined at Sands at the beach for a late lunch. Open air, nice selection of foods, the most reasonably priced restaurant on property. We also dined at Tamerind. The setting was very nice, but the food was amazing. My wife and I both had the carrot soup. I had lobster and she had scallops. I finished with the lemon pie. Everything was incredibly tasty. We would finish our buffet every morning and take the 15 minute stroll down to the beach. The pool and beach setting was private and beautiful with great service.

Every \"villa\" has its own pool and private courtyard, and no interior walls connect with your neighbor giving you complete privacy and quiet. Just check the pictures on their website. The entire time we were there we continually marveled at the vision, the design execution, and the incomprehensible amount of money that went into building what is arguably the finest resort in North America - built in the middle of a swamp in Mexico. But this \"swamp\" is unlike any I've ever seen before. It is uniformly lush and green, with all the vegetation at a uniform height, and the water is crystal clear and pristine. The manicured quality of all the wild vegetation sometimes made it hard to determine where the landscaping ended and the wild swamp began. And the most amazing thing we noticed was the complete lack of bugs at the resort (in November). Everything said about the high quality of service is true. An example of the attention paid to the customer occured during routine turndown service. My partner and I are both over 6' tall, and one of the guest robes was a small. I noticed the next day it got discretely changed to a large. Same was true with ice. (Why is it the more deluxe the resort the more involved it is to get ice?) When we ordered some upon our arrival, it came in a small insulated ice chest. Perfect - it lasted two days. The third day, upon returning from dinner, we were delighted to see it had been thoughtfully refilled. Breakfast was a treat. Included with the room rate, the buffet menu changed daily with a wonderful variety of interesting dishes. Not once did I go to the omelet station - I can have standard eggs and bacon anywhere - but grazing the constantly changing, high quality array of food items was a great way to start the day. Regarding the other restaurants, the food and drink at the hotel is uniformly good, if rather pricey. Drinks are $15 each, but I must say, the Mai Tais at the Beach Club pool were abundantly sized and superb, nearly equaling the slightly drier original only available at Trader Vic's. Also, the Sands Restaurant at the Beach Club is terrific for light lunches. We ate there twice. This is an amazing, unique place, unlike any I have ever encountered. Our stay there was magical. Before arriving, I read that many people never left the property once they arrived. i thought, how odd, with such a lively town nearby with so many restaurants, etc. But after being at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba I now understand why you never want to leave!

After a spectacular experience last year, we decided to return. Overall, I would still say this is a fantastic property with great service. However, the bar was set quite high last year and somehow Banyan Tree didn't quite live up to expectations on this stay. As someone that was looking to get a work out in on their vacation every day, the gym was a real let down. For a property of this caliber you would expect something much nicer. It is very small with 4 pieces of cardio equipment -- one machine was out of order and the other 3 had touch screens which were not calibrated properly leading to frustration for anyone attempting to use them. The temperature in the gym was 77 degrees despite numerous complaints I heard every day from other guests to the staff. The gym is so small there is no room to put a mat out anywhere. There was one mat provided in the gym which happened to be really gross and dirty. While the service at Banyan Tree is still great, it is not at the same level as last year. For example, on our previous stay we were assigned a resort host who checked in with us every day at breakfast and was the one point person we dealt with during our entire stay for all requests and issues. This time we were not assigned such a host. There was also a hiccup with our transportation reservation to go to the airport. Despite receiving written confirmation that transportation has been arranged, turned out it wasn't. We had to order a taxi at the last minute resulting in about a 20 minute delay in getting to airport. The resort was a lot busier this time than on our previous stay which I think impacted service all round. Buggies could take 15-20 minutes to get to your villa, phone calls to guest services took longer to get answered (sometimes no answer), and service was slower at breakfast. The quality of the villas and housekeeping is still outstanding. We had a courtyard pool villa which is the same as the spa villa we stayed in last year minus an outdoor shower and roof top massage tables which we didn't miss. Having experienced a \"perfect\" stay on our first trip, we noticed other minor items that we probably wouldn't have otherwise.

We always stay in five star resorts and the Banyan Tree Mayakoba provided us with some of the best accomodation we have ever stayed in.

The villa was so spacious, private and spotlessly clean that we spent most of our time in our own garden lounging by our pool and enjoying the hottub. The breakfast buffet was amazing, with a huge array of choices, and was served until midday so you could turn it into brunch if you wished! We stayed 9 nights and in that time ate in all three of the restaurants.My partner has a wheat and dairy intolerance and we found that all of the restaurants bent over backwards to accommodate his dietary requirements, bringing him all sorts of special dishes and generally spoilling him! Every meal we had was delicious and although not cheap was of a standard that you would expect in some top London restaurant. We particularly loved eating on the dock at Saffron, very romantic! Cycling to the beach every afternoon for cocktails and a walk by the ocean was the only exercise we managed all week. The beach was a tiny bit disappointing, and there were areas that we felt were not being properly cleaned, but it was lovely sitting at the beach club and looking out to sea. The staff throughout the resort were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and everyone had a smile for you. I would recommend the complementary Mangrove Tour, it was really interesting and a relaxing way to while away an hour.

A 10.5 hour flight each way for a week in the sun needs the hotel to be something special and BT Mayakoba certainly didn't disappoint. As always at Banyan Trees we were met in reception and givena gift of a flower bracelet and a soothing drink as we checked in before being taken to our villa. We had booked a garden villa but were upgraded to a courtyard villa. We've stayed in some fantastic rooms in the past but I think this probably claimed the top prize. The villa comprised a large bedroom with huge patio doors that take you straight into the pool and a lovely big bathroom off which is a walk in wardrobe and a wet room. The bath is located outside. Across the courtyard was the pavillion. This was a lounge come dining room which in itself is probably as large as some rooms we've previously stayed in. As has been mentioned on here in other reviews, the pool itself (which was about 10-12 metres long) is a little nippy, especially as ours never really got the sun. It wasn't too cold to stop me doing 10 lengths before breakfast each morning though. The resort as a whole is stunning although I can imagine some people being frustrtated that the beach is a fifteen minutes walk away. There are buggies and a boat though if you don't want to walk. We found it was nice to have a stroll, especially outside the hottest hours of the day. It is a bit strange in the resort as even when it is full, the fact that all suites have their own pool means that the public areas are very quiet. This was perfect for us but some people might like somewhere a little more lively. There isn't a great choice of restaurants but the food is excellent. The breakfast at Oriente was wonderful. A wide variety of food including many items you would never associate with breakfast. For dinner, Oriente didn't open but on a rotating basis, two out of Saffron, Sands and Tamarand. We ate in both Saffron and Sands where the menu was varied and the food delicious. The only negative comment I would have about the hotel was the staff on reception. They were friendly enough but the customer service didn't quite live up to the rest of the staff. We were given incorrect information on more than one occasion and they also failed to inform the bell boys that we had checked out despite me asking for the cases to be picked up and when trying to book a restaurant several hours before dinner didn't let me know until an hour before the booking that it was full and so they hadn't been able to confirm the bookings. On the final day we did the Eco tour on the boat around the resort's rivers.

We rented a car and drove to the property from the Cancun airport. It took us about 45 minutes to an hour to reach the resort complex. The Mayakoba resort complex contains the Banyan Tree, the Fairmont, and the Rosewood Hotels. Once inside the large, main gate (with security personnel who verify your reservation) you drive through winding paths of trees & grasses to reach the actual hotel. You will encounter at least one other security guard on the path to the resort, who will again verify that you are a guest of the resort. May seem like a bit much, but I did feel very safe at this resort. All the villas at this resort have their own private pool, which we loved. It is actually large enough to swim around a little bit, or have at least 4 to 5 people in it. The villa had a good sized courtyard area with two beach chairs and an umbrella set up by the pool. The villa entrance has a large privacy fence, and large bushes frame the other side of the courtyard. Privacy is paramount here, which is great for couples. The villa itself was beautiful. It was very large and airy, due mostly in part to the 20 or 30 foot ceiling in the bedroom area. The bathroom is well appointed, with a rainfall shower, ceramic Mexican-inspired sinks, and an outdoor bathtub. You will also receive two travel kits-one for men, one for women, with any sort of toiletry or other amenity you could possibly need. We also really liked the large, walk-in closet, that allowed us to keep all our luggage (including my scuba gear) and clothing out of sight, but well organized and easily accessible. The mini-bar in the room is nicely stocked, and there is an iPod/iPhone dock in your room should you want to play your own music. The only issue we had with anything in the room was trying to get the coffee maker to work! My husband struggled with it for a while and finally did get it to work. We had a great meal at Saffron Restaurant, excellent service, wine selection, and food. On our last morning at the Banyan Tree, we asked the staff to set up a private dinner for the four of us in the resort's wine cellar that evening. They gladly obliged, drew up a menu, sent it to us for approval, and paired excellent wines with each meal course. Our waiter was extremely attentive, friendly, professional, and well versed on both food and wine. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The breakfast setup was well done and had a myriad of different choices, from eggs prepared to your liking, to cereal, yogurt, pastries, fruit, and some Asian specialties. The freshly-squeezed and/or prepared juices were delicious! The experience is taken a notch higher with the addition of sparkling wine. :) We liked the pool with the swim-up bar, and the beach was also well maintained. You can either request a golf cart to take you to the beach, or take a boat through the mangrove-lined freshwater estuary. The bar had a great atmosphere to relax with friends and enjoy drinks and tapas. There was even live music on some evenings. My husband and our friends utilized the gym, and enjoyed the facility and the equipment (all brand-new and top-notch!) Should you want to go anywhere around the resort and not walk, simply call the front desk, and a golf cart will arrive in short order to pick you up and take you wherever you wish. I would definitely recommend renting a car and getting off the property (as nice as it is!) to explore Playa del Carmen, the Tulum Ruins, and some of the other smaller towns, like Puerto Morales.

The minute we entered the grounds of the resort we left all of our troubles behind. The place is absolutely beautiful and the service is by far the best I have had yet...

We were upgraded to a villa which was a nice surprise although it didn't have a jacuzzi ..this was a little disappointing as I was so looking forward to those relaxing moments and the turn down service with all the candles that I read so much about . The one suggestion I would have to make is that the lighting in the rooms are a bit to low in the villa we stayed in, especially in the bedroom since it is on the lower level (the villas have 3 floors)...it felt a bit dark at times. The food at the Sands (at beach & pool) was really good... we tried a few mixed drinks and was not so thrilled about them (a bit watered down) so we stuck to drinking ice cold coronas. The best drink I had at the resort was at to hotel's lobby bar \"Copa\". We also ordered food there which was great and not pricey. We also had dinner at Saffron (wanted to experience it) and I was not thrilled at all. It was definitely over priced and in my opinion not authentic Thai food..fine but not great..and again the drinks soso @ $15 per drink..didn't taste any alcohol in them at all and very small glass. We did go into town at Playa de Carmen 5th ave one night for dinner..cab there from hotel $20..cab back $12. You can easily catch a cab back on 5th.

We also added the stop to the \"Big K Mart\" for an additional $30 to pick up some stuff although the driver recommended to take us to a different store instead which he said was just as good (said it was closer to resort and to avoid construction traffic) was not great ...fine for the basics (water,soda,cigs) would not suggest.

This resort is simply stunning; I have been to none better. You get your own Villa with a decent sized pool. The pool isn't heated but, personally, was a great way to kick start the morning. You could walk right out of your bedroom, open the doors, and jump right in. The yard was very well kept, bordering the snaking mangroves/streams. There are ipod docks. Mini bar. In room dining. They give you little gifts every morning. The staff was kind, very concerned about your needs; I asked for some ice, they brought coolers of ice to my door. The rental car company had forgotten to return my credit card, they called them up and took care of it. One of the bartenders, who earlier in the week gave us a highly recommended Tequilla tasting, showed us out to look at the moon through a telescope on the lobby terrace. The food for breakfast was very good with plenty of options. It's a free buffet style with anything from sushi, to chicken curry, to waffles, to papaya and kiwi. We dined at the Saffron and Sands. I wouldn't say Saffron is a must; if you have good Thai food in your city, which we do as we're from NYC, then this isn't anything mind bending--and is a bit pricey. The location is nice; watch out for mosquitos. Sands is better; a bit more casual and with more Mexican flavors. We also had several mean cocktails by the beach around Sands--all of them strong and tasty. Do know that all food, and activity charges, come with a standard 15 percent service charge, which you can add more tip to. We had a sports massage which I'd recommend. Beautiful grounds for the spa. We took the free Eco tour by the Banyan tree in the lobby. Also recommended as we saw some Cenotes and Crocs. We also took a yoga class; our teacher was wonderful, she knew her stuff, but i'm not flexible, so I may have embarrassed myself. You can rent bikes but the walk isn't too bad and you can also call a buggy and they'll take you right there. The lobby's bar has live music at night and sell cigars. The reflections pool is well designed, clear and cool; you can swim around in a small loop and also wade right up to the pool bar. I would suggest making it out to Playa del Carmen if you're at the resort for more than a couple days--the food and experiences there are welcome changes to the secluded, relaxed scene at Banyan. We rented a car but they will call you a taxi. The only complaint I have was the way I was charged...My account had a hefty deposit held on it for several days after I left and I wasn't able to access any of those funds. It was resolved eventually--but I had to wait four days after I got back until that held deposit cleared.

They even thought of a hammock for two and a spa-level bathing tub that is designed to take mud baths.

The tender touch massage I had there was easily one of the best I have ever experienced. Finally, I must speak of the service- I have stayed in many five star hotels, but the level of service that is demanded at the Banyan Tree is second to none. The staff are earnest, eager and actually happy to do their job, making this resort so heavenly. There are just two words of warning- 1. bring your bug spray, and use it often.

It was a while ago but I thought the resort deserves a recognition. From the moment you get picked up from the airport, they made me feel like a special person. We asked the driver to stop by at a convenience store to pick up milk and water for our little kids and he was more than willing to accomodate and wait while we finished shopping. That was a nice begginning to our heavenly trip to Banyan Tree. We stayed at a 3 bedroom townhouse and it worked out perfectly. Each room was very well decorated at a 5 start level. Bathroom fixtures were top notch europeans. Linens were flawless. Attention to detail was clearly visible. We also had a kitchen and it helped a lot cooking for our picky 2 year old. The hotel seemed almost empty so we were able to truly relax. The open design similar to those seen in Bali was extremely airy and attractive. We spent more than $1000 a night but felt that we were getting a lot of value out of it but trust me, we're not millionaires. When the level of service, atmosphere and everything else balance well, that is when you feel like you're getting every single penny out of the experiences, and that is exactly how we felt in Banyan Tree. The rooftop pool was very nice for our screaming kids. I didn't need to worry about bothering other guests and the kids were able to play freely. The toddler pool in the main resort was very spacey and nice too. Breakfast was stunning. Nothing you can compare to fancy breakfast in the US. We were able to experience the true Asian-like hospitality in Mexico. We travled to Bali a few times and I have to say that it was almost close to the real thing. Service again was top notch. Every single person was there to please us including our 2 year old daughter. The boat-ride to the beach was fun too. We took a golf cart back to the room. The only thing is that several of us got sick toward the end of the trip. We were really careful about drinking water but we suspect that it may have come from one of the drinks we had in the beach resturant. Perhaps ice cubes...no idea. We had lunch there and got sick from the late afternoon and that basically ruined the rest of the trip. Again, everything is extremely clean on the surface and nicely decorated. Silverware and china were high end items and bathrooms were extremely well maintained. I still can't figure out how we got sick.

Saffron Restaurant is still Thai, but much less impressive this time. Breakfasts at Oriente are eclectic, with Asian, Mexican, and Western choices which were all good, but not great. Last time the breakfasts knocked our socks off with all the creative salsas, the buffet, and menu offerings. Now, there is an egg station instead of the menu with Mexican specialities. A little disappointing, too, to find out that now the hotel charges for bicycles. Seems like nickel and diming at a resort of this caliber. It was very flattering to be recognized by staff who remembered us from our former visit. Service everywhere--in the restaurants and throughout the hotel--was excellent, but there were a few misunderstandings with the front desk--when we called to get our car, they brought around one of the hotel vehicles, instead.

There were definitely pros and cons, but all in all, would recommend this hotel. Our favorite parts of the vacation were: * the amazing breakfast - I would suggest trying EVERYTHING, the food was seriously awesome. I usually never eat a full meal, and I swear I ate as much as michael phelps. my favorite was the pineapple tamale, and i am so pissed that I didn't try it until our last day!! * the rainforest - this is like disneyland for adults. a guide takes you through all these spa's/sauna's/shower's to rejuvenate your body. it was AMAZING the first time around, but definitely wasn't necessary to do a second time. * taco night at rosewood mayakoba hotel - i can't put into words how much I enjoyed this meal. we were starving when we arrived, so we definitely ate too many chips. SAVE UP ROOM FOR THE TACOS!! The flank steak taco?! the shrimp tempura taco?! the chorizo taco?!!!! Everything tasted better than the last, which we didn't think was possible. And the tacos are endless, but we were only able to each eat one. We should have taken the advise of our excellent waiter to slow down on the chips, but the chips and the various dips were so good too, we couldn't help ourselves! the parts of the trip that were sub-par: * they didn't have our hotel room ready, and it took them almost three hours to get one (and mind you, the hotel was at 30% capacity, so not sure what took so long). although they did give us a free lunch, i was surprised that they didn't upgrade us. * my husband LOVED his massage, but mine was just okay. in my opinion, the spa closes early (6:45), and we didn't end up getting a lot of treatments because of this. also, they don't have a steam room/sauna in the locker room, which was a bummer. * the thai restaurant was okay - felt the restaurants at rosewood mayakoba were MUCH better. * private pool is FREEZING. * seating area at the main pool is limited, and the beach was tiny and had four chairs available to guests (we also arrived after a big storm, so this could have been the reason why the beach was lacking) * we rented bikes for a day (the property is very large, and although it is possible to walk, would suggest calling for the golf carts to pick you up), and the breaks didn't work. plus the walkways are so small, everytime a golf cart came by, I would end up driving my bike into the woods to let them pass. all in all, the services and pool seemed much better at the rosewood mayakoba. again, the banyan tree mayakoba was excellent, and we would definitely recommend. but if you have a choice between rosewood and banyan tree, I would try out rosewood!!

I personally did not expect it to be that far away and you cannon see a trace of the sea from your villa unless you stay at the 2 bed room beach front villas. One of the reasons we booked banyan tree was the private pools which we had in our villa. The weather does not permit swimming at all as a result having a pool and paying about 600 usd is a complete waste. I then thought that I could use the tub in wash room but that was outdoor as well and I felt really bad for the whole experience. The resort should anticipate such weather and have some covering against the rain. The breakfast is good but the food at sands near the beach was not up to the mark. We will be dining in the Thai restaurant and we expect that to be nice since banyan tree is an Asia based resort.

We saw the Mayakoba Banyan Tree on Snique Away at a great price and made the leap. We stayed 10/9/11 through 10/13/11 at a Garden Pool Villa. The villa was even better than we had expected. I was concerned about space as it was the smaller of the single bedroom villas available, but for our purposes it was perfect. Situated not far from the main building our location provided great access to all the hotel had to offer. The private pool was ideal, the outdoor living areas were wonderful and well used, while the view of the water behind it was beautiful and entertaining with the wide variety of birds that frequented it. The high ceiling, and sliding glass doors that afforded expansive views of the pool area from the foot of the bed and the stream from the side gave a feeling of living outside while being comfortable inside. We were afforded complete privacy which we took full advantage of. Never heard our neighbors or felt in anyway that we weren't alone when in our villa. We never noticed any noise from traffic along the path outside or from the cleaning and gardening crews that were constantly at work. The service we received throughout our stay was exemplary. Every member of the Banyan Tree staff that we passed said hello and smiled, while every request was met with a friendly willingness to see that we were completely satisfied with the outcome. Our first morning after breakfast we asked the manager of the Oriente where the Saffron restaurant was located as we would be dining there two days later. He didn't just point it out, he didn't merely show us the path that led there, he walked us there, showed us around and thanked us for giving him the opportunity to do so. The breakfast buffet in the Oriente restaurant was fantastic each and every day. They offered an impressive variety of breakfast fare each morning. The wait staff brought your drinks and each time you left to go get more from the buffet you'd find that by the time you returned to the table your napkin was folded and clean silverware provided. Fruit to start including bananas, peaches, watermelon, cantaloupe, kiwi fruit, honey dew melon, assorted berries and more. There were several yogurts along with granola and other cereals to mix. A selection of cheeses and cold cuts. Several different breads along with English muffins. The hot dish servings of starches and meats changed each day save for the standard bacon and link sausage; some were Thai and some were Mexican. Eggs and omelets were made to order and brought to your table when ready. The staff exceeded expectations as they were always quick to help and very friendly. The Sands restaurant and beach bar was nice. Most inexpensive food at the resort, too. We rode bikes out there and that was fun. Also took the buggy and that was quicker, but I'd opt for the bikes even with the $5 charge for the day. The pool bar at the beach was nice, although that pool seems to be where people with kids hang out. Once again the service was fantastic. As we walked up two gentlemen met us, asked where we would like to sit. After picking our spot one set up the umbrella while the other prepared our loungers with a towel on the bottom, a towel and pillow on the top and a third towel for use when we got out of the pool or the came in from the beach. The beach has a few rocks - mostly off shore, but it was pleasant and the water felt great. Our first night we had dinner at Tamarind. We ate at a reasonable hour, about 7pm, but we were almost the only ones in the entire restaurant, even when we left around 9. The service again was wonderful, the food was delicious and we had a great time other than when one of the waiters had to encourage a bat to leave the dining area. I'm compelled to go off on a bit of a tangent here. We were told they were at 60-70% of capacity but for much of our stay we felt as if it were our own private resort. I don't know if it always feels like that or if we just happened to hit the resort at an odd time - we were staying Sunday through Thursday so we missed any weekend crowd. We went in the main pool three times - we were always the only people in it. Eco tour had two other people on it. Tamarind was empty when we ate there. We had cocktails at Le Copa twice and saw only 4 other people total not counting the wait staff. Did the Rainforest experience and saw no other folks in the spa or locker room. At Saffron we had only two other tables occupied during our dinner. We did see a few people out at the beach both times we went, but never more than 3 other people in the pool there and had our pick of loungers. Also Oriente was busy but not crowded for breakfast each morning, so I know there were other guests. Perhaps the seclusion and serenity of the rooms kept most folks otherwise occupied. We took the Eco tour and really enjoyed it. It launches from the dock by the Saffron restaurant and traverses canals throughout the Mayakoba property, taking you past Rosewood and Fairmont resorts, too. You see a variety of wildlife including crocodiles, birds, lizards, and fish along with interesting views of the reserve. I recommend you take advantage of this should you visit. Some jumbled miscellaneous thoughts on our stay: Get out and see the other resorts, Rosewood and Fairmont. We had a wonderful evening spent at the Tequila Library at Rosewood where it just happened to be Margarita Monday and Fatima helped us make our own margaritas selecting different flavor infused tequilas to do it. The food was good too. Trip into Play del Carmen runs $20 each way plus tip. Worth going in to see the beach and the city, but the huksters are insistent. I did have one salesman at a cigar shop try very hard to get me to sell my Tommy Bahama shirt to him which was amusing. If you think perhaps you can save money on food in PDC over what you pay at the resort you'll need to stay for two meals in order to account for cab fare spent. Ride the bikes at least once. It was a fun and pleasant trip out to the beach that way. Be warned though, if you indulge in a few shots of tequila at the pool bar you're still going to have to ride back. Wifi worked great. I have an over-sized laptop and housekeeping/security kept leaving me notes to lock it up when out of the room, but it didn't fit in the room safe. The mosquito kit in the room let us know to be wary of these pests. While I was never bothered my wife did have one night where she was bit several times. We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We're already trying to set up a group visit with some of friends. It was beautiful, it was luxurious, it was peaceful and we were well taken care of by a warm and friendly staff.

Unfortunately this resort could not keep them. I was shocked (after reading so many positive tripadvisor reviews) to say this was my least relaxing vacation. I typically skip over reading reviews detailing too many petty complaints but I could write one. I\u2019ll spare you the details but suffice to say, my best friend and I checked out 4 days early. Most of the staff we encountered were very nice and that keeps me from giving only one or two stars for this review. However, there were way too many service issues on top of the facilities being in disrepair. I\u2019ve never paid double my airfare to leave a vacation early before. We weren\u2019t mad at anyone, we felt a little cheated at all the money we had spent for so many problems, but we felt sorry for the resort at the same time. This resort\u2019s plunge pools aren\u2019t heated and were far too cold to use. None of the scenic beauty can be seen from most of the resort: the main lobby, breakfast, spa or villa areas. I\u2019d recommend Banyan Tree\u2019s Cabo Marques in Acapulco over this resort. At Cabo Marques you can see panoramic beauty from your bathtub, breakfast table and hotel lobby. We also had a lot of rain while here and the villa is geared toward outside living. We would\u2019ve preferred a bath tub that at least had a cover/roof over it so it could be enjoyed in the rain or beating sun. An indoor tub would be even better--sometimes you just want to escape the swarms of mosquitos and get clean. (There were more mosquitos here than I\u2019m used to seeing. Perhaps they don\u2019t spray?) Our tub wouldn\u2019t hold water when we tried to use it. Also, if you get a garden pool villa, there is nowhere for two to sit inside unless you want to get in your bed. We ran into a whole host of maintenance issues and I slept two nights in two different rooms that each had standing water next to the bed I was in. There was really hard rain, which is not the resort\u2019s fault, but I would expect facilities that can keep the water out especially near the beds. Even the ceiling over the computers in the business center was leaking in several spots. I've never encountered so many issues at a resort before.

Every single employee there is warm, welcoming, and there to make your stay better. I will try and answer certain questions that I wondered BEFORE i went there. Location - Mayakoba is a complex of hotels consisting of Fairmont, Rosewood, and Banyan Tree. While all separate, Banyan Tree will shuttle you to any of the other hotels, and you can sign your Villa # for dining at Fairmont. Not sure about Rosewood, as we didnt venture there. Dining - As previously mentioned in other reviews, it is expensive. We are not big liquor drinkers. Saffron the food is about a 7/10, but the setting/service is a 10/10. We had the spring rolls, a rib eye salad, and chicken satay as appetizers and all were fantastic. For our main courses we had one of the shrimp dishes, and the wok fried noodles. Both were ok. Nothing out of this world, but good. Total cost including tip (tip is included into everything), was $130.00 US with 2 diet cokes as drinks. We also ate 2 meals at Fairmont, one at La Laguna and the other at El Puerto. La Laguna is their traditional mexican restaurant. We had a guac appetizer, 2 main dishes, 2 grey gooses + sodas, 2 tequila shots, and a pack of cigarettes for $98.00. Great value. Food is pretty solid. El Puerto is the Fairmont steak/seafood restaurant. Decent. Nothing outstanding. Slightly cheaper then US steakhouse prices. Meal with 3 apps, 2 mains, no desert and 2 drinks was $130 US. We also ate everyday at Sands by the beach. Best restaurant at the resort. This is at Banyan. Amazing! We loved it everyday. Beach - Heaven. Ask for the beds and spend the money and ride the bikes down there! They are totally worth it. Bikes were awesome Villas - Also simply outstanding. I took a video of our garden pool villa and if you want to see exactly what they look like, PM Me and I will send you the youtube video link. Service - This is what sets Banyan Tree apart from anywhere. On our last day i was stung by a jellyfish.

When she told me she'd be visiting me in September and she wanted to go on a vacation, I wanted to pick a place that was literally an escape from reality, somewhere we could really relax for the first time and just not think of anything that had to do with our lives back home. just for a week. And BTMK delivers. just to reiterate what all the positive reviews have already been saying, this hotel is 5 stars for a reason. Many of them in fact. I have never received such warm, genuine service; each and every staff member you come across, whether they be opening your taxi door, escorting you to your villa in a golf cart (they call them buggies), or carrying your plate of food back to your table for you, they would always have a smile and a greeting for you. It really makes you feel like you're at home. A beautiful, really nice smelling home that cleans itself. I loved the soap and lotion in the villa so much I bought a travel pack in the gift shop before going back home. We were upgraded to the spa pool villa (#701) from the courtyard pool villa, the only difference is that there is another level above the main bedroom with spa beds and a shower - this is probably just so you spend more money on in-villa spa services, and we didn't end up using it at all. Nevertheless the villa is beautiful... all the linens, the fixtures, beautifully appointed. The bathroom... the bathroom! To die for... I dream of having my own steam shower someday. The separate living pavilion was convenient since my boyfriend tagged along and it provided an extra bedroom (and privacy) for both him and me and my mom. We just asked the staff to prepare the oversized (really large) sofa as a bed every night. No rollaway bed needed, so we saved $200 a night this way. Our reservation only included 2 breakfast buffets, and even though we signed a bill every time my boyfriend chose to join us for breakfast, they never included any of his breakfast meals on our final invoice, which was a nice gesture (he had complained a bit about the food at Saffron, and the manager said he wanted to make it up to us). The food...the breakfast buffet is, as they say, amazing. Impressive variety, and they do change up the fruit and hot dishes every day which is great. I got to try a lot of new things (mexican hot chocolate, nopales) and everyone working in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful. Roussell even happily obliged us with takeout containers when we said we wanted to take some food for later. Sands is the best option for lunch if you are staying on grounds, but we also had the hotel call us a cab (they find much nicer ones sitting along the streets) to take us into town and also to place where the driver likes to eat (best way to eat locally!). We ended up hiring the same driver for the whole week so he became more like a friend to us - highly recommend this route. Saffron was their fine Thai dining option... coming from Los Angeles it's hard to say this food was good; there is so much good (and cheap) Thai food where I live, and this place felt a bit stuffy and oppressive... I felt like I couldn't speak loudly or take any photos, like a museum. Our last night we had dinner at Tamarind, their open air fine dining option and we were totally impressed. From the amuse bouche to the dessert, everything was outstanding. For a recommendation in town, I recommend Yaxche, off 5th Avenue, for excellent Mayan cuisine. Next time I visit PDC, I will probably stay at a more modest establishment, as BTMK is definitely a decadent splurge for a once in a lifetime experience. But it will not disappoint. The beachfront property is small for some people, but I felt it was cozy and felt more personal, and the water is unbelievably clear. Jose operates the boat that will take you there from the lobby, he'll show you all the wildlife on the way there; makes for a much more pleasant experience and you forget that the beach isn't that close by. The only thing I would warn against is the mosquito population - being on the water is lovely but DO bring a strong repellant if you are susceptible to bites. I got eaten alive despite bringing my own since it was usually a choice between sunblock, repellant - and later - aloe vera for my sunburn! I second another reviewer who recommended the turndown service. We only asked for it a few nights out of the week but it's really nice what they do - light the candles, turn on soothing music, lay out your robes and slippers, and get your bed ready to sleep in while leaving you a schedule of the next days activities, the weather report, and a small handmade trinket :) In summary, if you are looking for a place to get away from it all where all your needs will be met before you even realize you have any... then this is the place.

From the moment we arrived and were greeted by valet parking and smiling resort hosts we knew we were in for something special; and we weren't disappointed. Nothing is too much for the staff and they go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your stay. And how could you not enjoy it! We stayed in a Garden Villa which was close to the main hub and ideal for walking to restaurants and breakfast. Getting to the beach mean't a longish walk or simply jumping on a golf buggy or the boat. The boat was a nice way to see the river and some local flora and fauna. Each villa has a pool and the rooms are very welcoming with tasteful decor and luxurious feel to them. The turn down service at night was a lovely touch as were the bathroom extra's in case you forgot anything. Bug repellant was provided - and needed! This again highlighted that BT goes the extra mile to give you what you need for a lovely stay. Moving onto the food - we ate at The Sands for both lunch (when at the beach) and for dinner. Tamarind was another lovely meal and we also enjoyed La Copa bar and tapas on our last night. It was fantastic to eat under the stars! We found the prices to be comparable to many other resorts of this standard and not anymore expensive then what you'd pay for a nice meal in London. Of course for Mexico that may seem costly but for what you receive, the service and location it is all worth it. And then there's breakfast! This is a buffet with a difference; the fruit was delicious and changed daily, there was choice after choice of different meal options and they provided take away when we headed out early for the day. And Grandma's hot chocolate is a must try! Spa - our booking included a 60 minute massage for one which was another luxurious treat and highly recommended if you get the chance. Very relaxing. Golf - although we didn't play the course looked immaculate and is Greg Norman designed. The hole by the beach looks like quite the water hazard! Driving into Playa was a breeze and you can find parking for 13-20pesos/hr on 10th Avenue which is only one block up from the popular 5th Ave pedestrian area. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, markets and general shopping to do along with a nice beach to wander. So what else is there to say?

The best part of BT was the service and staff. The staff were all so courteous and friendly and really seemed to enjoy their work. There was never a wait for anything! The staff went above and beyond and provided great attention to details. I saw an employee adjust an umbrella 3 times so that a sleeping guest would continue to be in the shade. When I commented to him about it, he just replied with a smile \"I don't want the sun to wake her up from her nap\": The nightly turndown service was perfect--loved it! Only negative was that our outdoor bathtub didn't work and there was a slight unpleasant odor in the room( due to the humidity).

This is easily the nicest resort/hotel we have ever stayed at, and although we normally would not have been able to afford such a nice place, they were offering great deals since this is their low season. Since it was the low season, we also had the resort all to ourselves for the most part as they told us only ~ 15% of the resort was occupied. Although it is not a large resort, the off season feel really made it feel like a boutique resort and all the more special! Here were the most impressive aspects of this property in our opinion: 1) the service was absolutely top notch with a staff to guest ratio that was unbelievable (again partly due to low season). They made us feel like VIPs at every single turn, and we were only staying in the (least expensive) garden villa. Everyone was extremely courteous and always willing to help a hand or do whatever they needed too to wait on you hand and foot and pamper you to the max. 2) the room and resort architecture/layout/scenery was amazingly beautiful and inspiring. This place was every bit as good as the pictures look in the internet and better. Apparently it is only 2 years old and one of the newest resorts in Playa del Carmen. Banyan Tree is top tier Asian resort chain that specializes is expansive and decadent villas instead of typical room layouts. Their resorts seem to be just as nice as Four Seasons, St. Regis, Ritz, etc. but have an amazing uniqueness about them. Our villa was a complete sanctuary of peacefulness and romance, and we found that we ended up just camping out there often even though we are generally the adventurous, want to get out types. Otherwise, the resort and all the common areas was almost completely open-air and done very tastefully in a mexican/asian theme that was very attractive. Mosquitoes were around, but were not nearly as bad as we though they'd be. 3) the food was amazing at all of the restaurants for breakfast, lunch (although the breakfast would often hold you over), and dinner, and although the breakfast was included, the dinners were very expensive (but worth it in our opinion). And lastly, 4) the beach was our favorite place. This is a great resort to go to if you really want to unwind, relax, and check out mentally. Although the beach is not next to the main resort (and is short bike or buggy ride away - this was actually kind of nice because it made the resort feel more expansive and \"broken up\"), it is accompanied by a wonderful restaurant, infinity pool on the beach (with great swim up bar), and a lovely little beach with wonderful staff. The only drawback was that getting in the water was a little tough because of the rocky seabed right as you walked in (it got much better once you got a little bit). Otherwise, we felt like rockstars on our beach bed/lounges with umbrellas, getting food and drinks served to us and pampered like none else. It truly reminds you of a Corona commercial. Other than that, we'd recommend you ask for a villa that is close to the main facilities since some can be on the \"outer loop\" and require a bit more walking to get to all the amenities. Make sure you visit the spa if possible too since Banyan Tree is world-renowned for this. If the services are too expensive, try the Rainforest experience at the very least, which is very affordable. The weather was great for us, and going in to Playa and doing some of the surrounding activities was a blast as well. We recommend trying the Mayan restaurant Yaxche in Playa for great cuisine and El Fogon if you are looking for true great mexican food at this common local eatery. All in all, we were absolutely captivated by this place and are already trying to figure out when we will be back.

After reading all of the reviews, I expected a little bit of let-down (nothing could be that perfect) but WOW, was I wrong. Beyond perfect. Transfer from airport was easy (we booked USA Transfers for $80 round trip). Warm welcome with a couch, cool drink, refreshing towels, bracelets and tour. Then, off to the villa in our \"buggy\". Courtyard Villa was just great-we loved having our own pool, outdoor jacuzzi, and bath for 2. Our favorite feature was the separate room, \"Pavillion\" which had a huge daybed, coffee/tea station, dining area, tv and stereo. The tough decisions each day were: beach, pool by the beach, pool by the main building, or our own villa pool...then the next tough decision was what to choose from the breakfast buffet. Words can not express the perfection that is the BT breakfast. You just have to see it. The juices, pastries, entrees, smoked fishes, meats, mexican, thai, european, anything you could possible want was there. We fell into an easy routine of breakfast, late light lunch and then late dinner. We did not eat anywhere else, we did not want to leave BT once we arrived-it was too perfect. We went into the trip thinking we would go see some ruins, cenotes, etc. We could not tear ourselves away. We also thought we would venture out to Playa del Carmen and/or Rosewood, Fairmount but quickly realized that there was no reason to. We ate 1 dinner at Tamarind, 1 dinner at La Copa (Tapas), 1 dinner at Sands, 4 dinners at Saffron, and 1 dinner in our villa (by the pool). All were great but we really enjoyed Saffron (as you can probably tell). The prices were reasonable for us. Don't quote me on prices here (I was enjoying my holiday too much to pay attention). Cocktails were pricey ($12-16) but so well made, worth every peso. Beer was $6. Menu prices were similiar to what you'd pay at any fine dining restaurant and cheaper than most resorts we have eaten at. Appetizers around $10-15, entrees around $20-40, desserts about $8, if I recall. The quality was consistently great. We did not do the Villa BBQ because we felt we couldn't eat that much food but the in room dining options were varied and we enjoyed that very much. We played golf (excellent), did the rainforest experience followed by couples massages (finally a strong, Balinese, massage), eco tour via boat (loved that and saw 2 crocodiles, iguanas, a coati mundi and many birds). We walked a lot, rode bikes one day, took the boat to the beach a couple of times and had the buggy bring us home if we got tired. The amenities in the villa are great: flip flops, beach bag, robes, shaving cream, toothbrushes, ironing, hair dryer-anything you need (I could have packed a lot lighter). Turn down service was so great-little gifts, candies, lighting, music..all waiting when we returned from dinner. And now, the best part, service. Never have we experienced such incredible, thoughful service as this. Polite, friendly, professional always. Across the board-from housekeepers, waitstaff, resort hosts, gardeners...every single employee was great. We quickly realized that any experience after this was going to pale in comparison. One more thing we loved about the BT-well, two more things actually-the landscaping and the decor. The landscaping was lush and well maintained-I came away with many inspirations and ideas for home. The decor was this understated, relaxed mix of Mexican and Asian. Uncluttered and warm. Textures, colors and great lighting. One more adjective to describe the entire experience: Romantic.

Tamarind is good but nothing to write home about. Unfortunately we were never able to experience Saffron (be sure to book more than a day in advance). You will need to make advance reservations for all of the restaurants. It was frustrating to be told nightly that our preferred time was not available - only to go past the restaurants and see they were only 1/4 full. I strongly recommend renting a car and driving from the airport in Cancun. It is a very easy drive - a busy, straight motorway. We felt very safe - even driving at night.

Overwhelmingly, the reviews on TA rate the hotel as 'excellent' and rave about absolutely everything. Certainly the daily room rate indicates that this should be the case and so my expectations were set sky high. Honestly, I felt a little bit disappointed that only 4 ot 5 reviewers pointed out the significant improvements still required with the service. I felt it was important to add my own experience here in an effort to balance out some statements! The service to me seemed at times amateurish - although staff were polite, I lost track of the number of instances that I had to repeat myself to get stuff done. A bit of a buzz kill. Room service and house keeping were the main offenders - no doubt because of the size of the resort things moved veeeeeery slowly.\u00a0 I expected\u00a0the room would be cleaned by the time we had finished with lunch and headed back for a little siesta. Typically this was not the case...they normally showed up after 3pm by which time we would typically be sleeping and so things got a bit out of sync. To be fair they did a thorough job once they showed up.\u00a0 Similar story with room service taking for ever to deliver the simplest of things...and then needing multiple chasers to clear up. It seemed that various bugs and especially ants were much more keen to make an appearance and clear the food (all 30 million of them). Talking of food - the restaurant options are average with the exception of the breakfast (which was epic) and the Tamarind which made a good effort. This is a problem because being on a resort means you're a little bit stuck for options. We were there for just over a week and so started dining at the nearby resorts...cost/quality ratio the dining left me underwhelmed. The breakfast was phenomenal and you could see some wise old owls \"stocking up\" to avoid having to have lunch at the resort...shame I thought. To end with a positive, the resort is immaculately kept, sensationally decorated and felt very special. The amenities were brand new, the details and tangible \"stuff\" is all there and at your disposal. Making a visit to the nearby resorts for \u00a0food emphasizes that banyan tree is head and shoulders above the rest in terms of style.

We felt totally pampered. The rooms were immaculate. The service was fantastic. The swimming pools in each villa were enormous. The food was eclectic. The access to the beach was unique. The golf course was unbelievably well kept and wide open. The town of Playa Del Carmen is a 15 ride for exploring other food options or hitting a few bars. The rooms were enormous and the housekeeping service was incredible. Each day at least three different people came through our room to turnover the room and clean the pool. Our peronal villa pool was larger than we expected. The six of us literally played marco polo in one couple's private pool, and it was a blast. We did the in-room \"Mexican BBQ\" which is highly highly recommended (though expensive). They set up a table and chairs for the 6 of us in our of our villa's gardens right next to the pool. They setup their own grill and cooked 4 courses for us while we relaxed and chatted. They played music for us on an iPod dock, served us wine, then cleaned and removed everything after providing us a most memorable meal under the stars. Our meal included appetizers ceviche, salsas, guacamole, grilled shrimps, grilled fish, grilled lobster, baked potatoes, grilled corn, and grilled ribeyes. And desert was berries and chocolate pieces. They offer two other versions, one Thai and one Mediterranean. Again, highly recommended. We did the Rainforest experience at the spa, and that was very unique and good option for a group of 2-3 couples. Book your spa needs on your first day there, as they fill up very quickly. Breakfast each morning is great and if you eat around 10-12pm, it lasts you comfortably through evening without a separate lunch. Breakfast includes made to order omlettes, waffles, chilaquiles, breads, authentic dishes, and randomly some sushi items. We ate at Saffron one evening and while the scenery and setting was amazing, the food was mediocre for the expensive price (we are thai food snobs though). But I don't regret eating there as the experience was worth it. The Sands beach club is accessible by boat or golf cart, either takes ~5-10 minutes. Marcus set up lounge chairs and umbrellas for us each day and was extremely friendly. We appreciate your kindness Marcus. And my last morning there, I called guest services at 630am to see if I could get on the El Cameleon golf course. In 10 minutes a buggy was there to pick me up, and by 7am I was teeing off on the first hole. Where else can you literally walk onto a world class golf course on 30 minutes notice?

We had looked at similar accomodations in Thailand, etc....and chose this property because of its rave reviews on Trip Advisor and because we would not have to spend significant time flying. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. The highpoints are detailed below.... We went for the luxury SUV service to and from the airport, which was wonderful (I don't know if it was $275 per couple wonderful, but considering a cab each way would have been between 120-140 round trip, we went for it). It was also nice to not have to worry about having to be poached upon at the airport by the tons and tons of companies providing taxi service. We arrived to our welcome bracelet and drink- both nice touches- and our \"resort experience specialist\" highlighted parts of the resort while our room was prepared. I fired off several questions which she was able to answer with ease. We took the buggy service to our villa where our specialist showed us around. Our courtyard pool villa was magnificant. It was completely secluded and completely enclosed. I agree with the other reviewers who noted that even if the resort was booked, you would never know it. The only place you might see other people would be the beach or in the restaurants. Everything was just top scale luxury all the way- in every aspect of their operations. Banyan really \"wowed\" us after an unfortunate issue with ants. On our second day there, we noticed ants in the bed. Literally within 30 minutes, a team of people were at our villa, including a full housekeeping team and exterminator. They took apart the bed, sprayed, cleaned, and then sprayed and cleaned all of the other areas of the villa- interior and exterior- for good measure. That appeared to have taken care of the problem until three days later. We had not noticed anything, but received a call from the front desk asking us when a good time to fumigate would be, as the housekeeper had reported seeing ants again. I was impressed that they brought this to our attention rather then waiting for us to notice it. We spent all day at the beach, and when we returned to the villa, we still saw bugs (even after we verified that the fumigation had been done). They promptly moved us to another (bigger) villa, and all was well. A note about the bug situation: YOU ARE IN THE JUNGLE. So, this should all be fairly expected. Also, count on mosquitoes. Bring your own bug spray, because the organic stuff that is provided in your room works okay, but hard core chemicals appear to work better. And wear it all the time. All of the dining was amazing, albeit expensive. We expected this caliber of pricing given the pricing of the resort as a whole. I felt that the food selection was great; however, after 6 days, and even this vast selection got boring. The breakfast buffet (and Orient staff) was so wonderful, I really wish I could have forced myself to eat more every morning I was there. The buggy service was amazing. You call them and they come within mintues (usually). We did not rent the bikes; however, we chose to walk a good bit throughout the resort. All are viable options. The beach, pool, spa- all were wonderful. Ask for Pim if you are getting a massage. Oh, and we were not as thrilled as other reviewers with the Rainforest Experience. We kind of thought it reminded us of like multiple different types of water torture. You go from hot to cold and back with water being sprayed in your face during multiple intervals. I am half joking, but we really didn't think it was worth the money for that amount of discomfort. If you venture into Playa del Carmen, which I do suggest, go to Bites. It is a tapas place on one end of 5th Avenue, and all of the food is to die for. We tried most of the small plates on the menu and paired them with their signature Guava Mojito- which was one of the best drinks I have ever consumed. This place caught our eye because it was one fo the only places not begging you to come eat there. We feel if you have to beg for patrons, your food must not be that great. We also ventured into Coba to hike the ruins, and arranged a car rental rather then booking a tour. We don't like to be herded on buses, and would rather do our own thing.

My husband and I are on a strict diet and brought along our own frozen food and asked of the hotel to heat it up for us each night. We told them very specifically what time to bring it to our villa/restaurant and we were assured that it was not an issue at all and they were used to this from other guests at the hotel. ( By the way, yes we paid them to have to heat the food up, which is totally understandable and was not an issue and we were willing to do). Dinner time came and our food was not at our villa the time we asked- we called in villa dining and they said there was a mistake and it would be another hour. We we very hungry and upset because we were assured it would be taken care of and not a problem. We were there for 6 nights in total and 2 out of 6 nights there was a \"mistake in the kitchen\" and our food was never prepared for us, even thought we reminded them every single day and even called the front desk to remind them. It sounds like not a big deal, but when you had a long day in the sun and are very hungry, it was just not ideal. We were actually so surprised that it happened a second time because after the first mistake we were assured that it would not happen again. This was definitely a flaw on the hotel/kitchen part. We ended up getting comped the fee to heat up the food, and the second time they felt bad and we had a free set up of the outdoor bath, which I would never spend the money on because all they do is light up candles and throw some rose petals around for $100. That being said, the villa is magnificent, the architecture and design of the hotel is something really special and amazing. The outdoor areas and the villa is kept extremely clean. I would recommend getting a room close to the reception and spa so you do not need to walk/bike/trolley anywhere far. The only time we took the trolley or the boat on the lagoon was to the beach. Besides for the earlier mishap I discussed, the service was good. The best service I have ever had? definitely not, however, it was pretty good. Chef Eric was very helpful even with the mishap, he tried to go out of his way to help us. For the weather in July, it was very hot and humid. If you were not swimming or at the beach, it was way too hot to enjoy. At night and even by day, the bugs are beyond awful. Been to lots of islands and never had such bad mosquito bites. Also, the black raven birds were very loud due to the fact that the hotel is set on wildlife around these muggy swampy lagoons of water, which also is why the bugs are so bad. The best part of this hotel is the private pools in your own room. The pool was always clean, right off the master bedroom, and soooo amazing! Bathing suits do not even need to be worn because its so private. The outdoor areas are immaculate and beautiful. The finishes and fabrics and design of the villa is superb. The bathroom is stunning, huge walk in closet, incredibly comfortable bed, the villa always had this amazing smell also. They left us these incense sticks to light and it made the room smell incredible. Another unbelievable part of Banyan Tree was the spa, yes very expensive, but very well worth it. Try the Balinese massage. The masseuses are brought in from Thailand and trained special for the Banyan Tree spas. The treatments are great and the private villas where they perform the treatments are beautiful and clean and smelled amazing as well. While we were there, a bunch of families with young children were there, I do not understand this, because this hotel did not seem family friendly at all. But, to each its own.... The beach was nice, not great, cannot be compared to Anguilla's and Turks and Caicos beaches at all. The water was very rocky and not clear at all. I was expecting a nicer beach, Also, the actual area of sand is tiny! I was so surprised at how little sand area there was for the guests to sit on. The service at the beach definitely could have been better. Anytime I wanted a drink, I could not get a servers attention, I had to stand up and physically wave them down...which I was not too happy about. All in all, go here for the amazing villas with private pools, but do not go for an amazing beach, or for the not so out of this world service. Would I go back?

We had a Garden Villa: the villas are next to eachother, but the \"garden\" of the villa is completely private. The pool of the villa was larger than the plunge pool we had expected and obviously very nice. Whilst having so much privacy is nice in a large resort, we missed having a view at some point (if you stay in your villa/garden, your world becomes very small). We hardly saw any mosquitos, but liked the wildlife in the mangroves (fish, turtles, crocodiles, etc) and would recommend taking the free resort boat tour. The beach is a short boat/buggy trip away, but is too far to walk. The beach is of nice white sand, but not very wide and the coastline in general is not very exciting. We had hoped to do some snorkelling, but the reef is too far away to do this from the hotel.

However, it is not for families with small children, unless you do not mind having the1 yr, 3 yr old and 6 year old in a total separate building by themselves. Even the upstairs room on the 2 bedroom villa, is an exterior stairwell at opposite end of building and around the corner.. Please study diagrams carefully and quite frankly it should not be marketed to families with small children. I cringed as I flew home and saw an ad touting it as a family resort- I guess to fill their 2 & 3 bedroom villas. The 3 rd bedroom is across the yard in the livingroom pavillion which has the small kitchen (no utensils/pans) The problem is even that has an open swimming pool and open hot tub between it and Master villa that a sleeping child could step in- not to mention the baby or 3 year walking around in day time. In addition, it opens to the beach so even a 6 year child could walk off- or even worse be visited by a beach walker during the night- in their totally different building bedroom or exterior entrance upstairs bedrooom. In addition, there were no children's play area at pool, beach or whereever, the kids club literally looked like it had been planned to be a beach restroom or changing room and was converted to a beach club that housed basically crayons. No activities for children or anything- very very boring for little small children. Staff was wonderful, it was beautiful, from the bell staff always having car with cold waters packed when you left the site, to the kids manager, etc, everyone was wonderful and gracious, but restaurants were not meant for children even if allowed, We had 3 adults and 3 chidlren -so plenty of supervision but the resort is not set up for families of small children. If you had a choice the neighboring Fairmont had better options for small children- pool area and kids club. If you must stay at Banyan Tree with small children, the option would be one bedroom or the timeshare 3 floored villas- they are all contained in one unit and your bedroom is next to children's. Staff wonderul- just not set up for children.

Eduardo was great about showing us around and answering questions. My only complaint, if I had to be really picky, was Eduardo set my bag on the bed and I would rather not have had the dirty bottom touching nice clean sheets. The villa itself is fantastic. The website says private but it really is PRIVATE. Like bring a swimsuit but you won\u2019t need to wear it around your villa. Every single villa has its own pool and they aren\u2019t just a plunge pools either. The water comes right up to the sliding glass door and has steps into the pool from the main courtyard or the side patio by the hammock. There was also a little pavilion with a lounging sofa on the opposite side of the courtyard. The \u2018river\u2019 which is really a small channel of water borders the back of the villa/courtyard but there is so many trees and shrubs that its impossible for anyone to see in. Ditto for the people staying on either side of you. The main room of the villa is beautiful, furnished nicely and very clean. The bathroom area is stunning as well with a separate outdoor soaking bathtub surrounded by candles and very romantic. There are two ipod docks and a Bose CD player in the room which is nice when you open all the sliding glass doors and have music playing while swimming, etc. A word about prices, I think the resort is fairly priced and a decent value. The villa itself was a step above/on par with Esperanza in Cabo which charges around $1000 per night. Breakfast for two was included (and delicious) which cuts down on food costs \u2013 its huge, you likely won\u2019t be hungry until dinner. Dinner at Tamarind with 2 drinks each cost $168. Margaritas cost $12 inclusive of tax and tip. A beer is $6 from any bar/restaurant on property or the minibar. We had rented a car so several of our meals were had off property. We also stocked up on a few bottles of wine and brought them back to our room which saved. The cheapest bottle of wine on in suite dining cost around $48 incl tax and grat and goes up to $1224 per bottle. In room dining is 24 hours and fantastic. A pizza with goat cheese and asparagus costs $20. The spa was really incredible as well and is worth a separate mention. Treatment rooms are in private little mini villas so you don\u2019t have the large locker room and have to hang out with everyone else while getting ready. Everything is so private. The massage was very good and included with our reservation so I can\u2019t even tell you what it would normally cost. Upon leaving the spa I was too blissed out to think about grabbing a menu of services. I loved how many of the staff greeted us by name, even several days after checking in and how friendly the staff was in general. I love the public areas, gorgeous landscaping, beautiful d\u00e9cor. I didn\u2019t love that it rained almost every day we were there, no fault of the resort. I didn\u2019t love the little ants that found their way into our villa and on our bed. With that being said, housekeeping was quick to change our bedding and some of that is expected with the complete indoor/outdoor open set up that the villas have. I didn\u2019t love that the resort itself is somewhat difficult to figure out and although we requested a map of the property we never saw it. When you turn off the 307 (main hwy) and pass through the gates you need to go through about 2 more guard points which are along winding roads that aren\u2019t clearly marked. Is it charming getting lost in the jungle, trying to find your way to your fabulous resort? Sure. After the third time, I just wanted more signs. The Banyan property itself is set up into 2 main areas. The river front portion is the main part with the reception, all restaurants/bar except for Sands, spa and about two thirds of the villas. The second part of the property is the ocean front portion which can only be reached by buggy, boat (leaves every 30 minutes) or a really, really long walk. If you go for the ocean front villa you will get the beach but you are somewhat cut off from the rest of the property. The restaurant, the Sands, is delicious and the beach staff is great about bringing water, drinks, towels. I do believe that the oceanfront villas are somewhat less private as we were walking on the beach we could sort of see into the courtyards of some of the villas. I don\u2019t think anyone would be comfortable skinny dipping in those villas. If we go back I don\u2019t think I would ever stay in the oceanfront portion as I found it to be slightly irritating to wait for transportation back to the main resort. Do take the boat ride and have Jose cruise you around the Banyan tree\u2019s waterways and the adjoining properties which are all connected on the water. The wildlife is amazing and seeing it close up from the comfort of your boat with a drink in hand at sunrise was priceless. Also, when you make reservations, make sure to request a villa close up to the main portion if you prefer to walk to restaurants, spa, etc. or further away if you don\u2019t mind having to call a buggy every time you leave your villa. The resort is big and spread out which is great bc it never appears crowded but you do get your exercise. Speaking of exercise, the work out room is clean, well equipped but in a somewhat public place with walls of glass. All in all a fantastic resort.

All of it was superb. As it was our honeymoon, we came back on our first night to find rose petals on the bed. A really nice touch. The in villa bbq was sublime with delicious food prepared by the friendly, yet professional waiter. We also had a couples massage & did the rainforest experience \u2013 both of which were fabulous.

Every morning we stayed in our villa and used the pool until about noon and then made our way to the beach. The service and food were great.

The breakfast buffet was the best I have ever had when travelling. After eating there every morning we were full until late afternoon. We also rented the bikes which were really fun. However, I do agree with other reviews that they should not be charging for these. The Spa was also a great experience. My husband I did the Rainforest Experience which we very much enjoyed. The resort is meant for privacy. With that said the resort was a little too quiet for us. Even at the pool or pool bar people kept to themselves. We where there on our honeymoon and like to relax, but we also like to socialize with other guests, which we did not find here. Overall Banyan Tree is exceptional in everyway.

We ended up splitting our time between this resort and another one on the beach in Playa Del Carmen, and I'm glad we got a chance to experience both. Lets start with stating the obvious - mind blowing architecture, extremely spacious individual rooms with plunge pool, restaurants in a spectacular setting, outstanding breakfast buffet, over the top Thai spa, and attentive staff. The down side - semi inconvenient of getting to the beach, having to wait around for carts (unfortunately, can't get anywhere without them! ) and not being able to see the ocean the second you walk in. This is not a beach front resort, you will need to take a 5 minute boat ride along the lagoon to get there.. Another words, you will not be able to see the ocean the minute you walk into the lobby, from the restaurants or the rooms (unless there's ocean views rooms?), HOWEVER, they have done a fine job with the lagoons and make up for it in many other ways! Anyhow, after spending 3 nights in a dream casita within 80 steps to the waters of the Caribbean, I was a little bored at the Banyan Tree, and couldn't gotten the idea in 2 nights. My husband and I are fine travels and have had the pleasure of enjoying some amazing resorts, and this is definitely up there.

Also, as a side note, some of the pictures of the resort are outdated. They have hedges planted along the lagoon edge, so there's no lagoon view in the Spa Pool Villas. The beachside pool also has a higher hedge for some reason, so it's not quite so \"infinity\" When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted by Guadalupe, who was very friendly and provided us with much needed cold drinks and cold towels. We were there as part of our celebrations for our 7th anniversary and we were given an upgrade from a 'Courtyard Villa' to a 'Spa Pool Villa' which we would come to regret. Our first evening, we made reservations for Tamarind, and contrary to a number of the other reviews, we very much enjoyed the food. Our first evening was quite relaxed and enjoyable. On our first \"day\" there, we woke up early and had a very nice breakfast at Oriente and then went back to our villa to change into our swim wear. It's at this point, after changing, that we found..! An army of ants had appeared, marching out of the walls of the closet into all the drawers, our clothes AND into all of our luggage. We absolutely panicked initially, and called housekeeping to figure out a solution. It took over 2-3 hours to \"resolve\" the situation, as initially only a staff member with a bug spray canister came to the scene. It took us elevating the issue to the head of housekeeping and accommodations before someone realized it wouldn't simply be a \"spray\" problem, as there was no way I was taking these guests back home with me from Mexico. Eventually the situation got handled, and appeared to be handled well - all our clothes were laundered, we were given some clothing to wear from the gift shop (we were only in our swim wear) and we were moved to another villa. An appropriate response, which we were satisfied with, but the whole event consumed much of our morning. We were told our clothes would be ready by the evening and we made reservations at Saffron that night. We were also asked that if we wanted to check out late or extend our stay as we had lost so much time to resolve the issue - unfortunately we had a hard flight out and couldn't stay longer. We spent the day at the beach and enjoyed the amazing service at the sands and by far the most delicious flank steak sandwich I've had in a very long time. My girlfriend had the soft shell crab tacos which were also delicious. The staff at the beachside were fantastic, ever ready to adjust our umbrellas and even refreshed our melted drinks for free! Kudos. When we arrived back at our Villa - there were no clothes waiting for us. We waited. And waited. Called housekeeping. Called guest services. And waited more. Our clothes did not arrive until 11PM. Another issue. We couldn't go to dinner until we had clothes - the restaurant had a dress code, so a late dinner we had that night. We were told when we departed that they were very sorry for the issue with the clothes and had comp\u2019d our dinner that night. Overall, the resort is beautiful, absolute paradise - and the Spa, wow, absolutely amazing! We did the \u201cRainforest\u201d treatment as well as a couples massage, and their spa services are as good as I have ever had. Overall the resort is beautiful, a very serene romantic environment that is perfect for couples celebrating their honeymoon or anniversary. Side note: if you're someone who attracts mosquitoes like me - be aware that all of Mayakoba is situated on a lagoon and there are lots of mosquitoes! They provide you natural bug spray so that should provide a clue. There were much fewer during our visit, but will always be an issue for when you make use of the outdoor amenities in the Villa or eat out on the patios/decks in the evenings. So in closing, I have many many good things to say about the resort, the staff, the food and Banyan Tree overall.. But for there to be such issues at the resort AND to have such difficulty resolving such issues (which ate up a significant portion of our short stay there!) - at such an exclusive high end resort was simply unacceptable! I must say even in closing that I feel conflicted, as the resort was so beautiful, I feel like my vacation there could have been so much more. As I look upon our vacation photos and the photos on Tripadvisor, it makes me feel like I should go back and even recommend the resort to others based on the \u201cgood times\u201d that we experienced, but I find it difficult to justify it given what had happened.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Atlbrown_Fun_Seeker", "ReviewID": "UR113544546", "Content": "The villas, beach, service, and food are 5 star.

There are Bose wave radios so just bring your IPOD. I've read some complaints about the location of the TV, well if you go to Banyan Tree to watch TV you're wasting $$$. The \"plunge pool\" is too large to be called a plunge pool - the water was great and being able to take a late night or early morning swim was great. The pool size was a huge plus over Rosewood. The service was special and what you'd come to expect at a 5 star resort. Every attempt is made to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Marcos at the beach was always on the job take care of business \u2026thanks Marcos. For golfers the golf course is right on property and it's a fair and beautiful course. I finished 18 holes in 3.5 hours and really enjoyed the course. One thing that I hadn't read before is the ability to shuttle between the Fairmont, Rosewood, and Banyan. If the concierge makes dinner reservations or other arrangements on your behalf, you can charge directly to your room. Also, each hotel will take you to the other hotel, as there seems to be a working arrangement between all resorts. We didn't go to the Fairmont, but Rosewood's lobby area is picturesque and it's work going over there to the tequila bar or lobby areas. We really wanted to stay at a resort where we could see and hear the beach from our room, and if that\u2019s must there are 5 star resorts like Maroma.

Stayed their for 1 week from 19th to 26th of May 2011, weather was amazing, overall service pretty good, one or two issues with the service but nothing major. Thought about what to say in this review and best advice/tips for anyone thinking of going, so here goes ... 1) Day Trips - recommend using the hotel travel office, they can arrange trips and activities for lots of things, we did the Mayan ruins tour to Tulum and Coba, cost $600 for 2 people which sounds ridiculous but actually well worth the money as you get your own air conditioned car, local tour guide, don't have to queue etc... 2) Beach Club - in my opinion the best part of the Mayakoba resort and well under marketed on the official Banyan Tree website. The beach is nice, sand not pebbles and the Caribbean sea literally takes your breath away, waves are not big or small, fairly calm. Have breakfast around 9am (served till 12) and then be at the beach for 10am to get the best loungers, the ones by the trees are good as they provide all day shade. 3) Bikes - a lot of people are annoyed you have to pay $5 per day per person to hire a bike and I agree, when spending $500 a night on a room, it is not fair to have to pay this charge, think Banyan Tree seriously underestimate all the negative PR they get for this. Anyway, bikes are good, its very easy to ride round the resort, down to the beach, to the main reception or the spa, restaurants.. 4) MiniBar - is very expensive as all high end hotels are, recommend taking a bottle of whiskey, gin or whatever you like with you and then using the coke, lemonade etc... Its very nice having a drink around 6pm as the sun goes down in your own villa with a lot of privacy. 5) iPods/Music - all Villas have a Bose radio/CD/ipod player so take your own music as you quickly get bored with the Chillout music from the 2 CD's they tend to play everyday. 6) Restaurants - not a lot of choice considering its status as one of the leading hotels of the world. Recommend using the other hotel restaurants at the Fairmont or Rosewood. (there are 3 hotels on the Mayakoba complex) Food choice in the restaurants is fairly limited to be honest and one surprise is there is no mexican food on the menu's. The fish/meat grill was the best thing we eat all week, kind of surf n turf style at Sands, the beach resort. 7) Sun cream - take lots with you, its very expensive in the hotel shop, $50 per bottle ! 8) Tips - another controversial subject which gets a lot of attention in reviews, the hotel charges 26% on top of any bill for food/drinks. 11% is for Tax and then 15% is automatically applied as a service charge. So leaving another 10% to 15% as a Tip is hard to accept and another PR issue I think the Banyan Tree needs to communicate a lot better to avoid the regular negative backlash. 9) Bath tub - is huge and well worth relaxing in ! They offer bath experiences in your villa, bottle of champagne, honey and milk oils, candles lit everywhere etc.. 10) Wardrobe - you will have a large walk in wardrobe so don't worry about storage space, take as many clothes as you want, there are plenty of drawers and hangers for two people.

First and foremost, I can't speak more highly of the staff, as they are who make the stay so welcoming, accommodating, and stress-free. Everyone was so warm and friendly; we were treated so kindly everywhere we went, whether it be the boat, the beach or the spa. Truly, they were amazing. And that's just the staff! The resort itself is incredible. Agree with other reviewers that the place felt empty more or less the entire time--but in the way that made it a special secret, just for us to enjoy. The grounds are immaculate, the decor beautiful. Take the boat tour of the canals and see the incredible wildlife! Crocodiles, great blue herons, turtles, everything! With Adrian at the boat's helm and the on-staff biologist (I'm sorry I've forgotten her name!) pointing out all of the incredible birds nesting around, it will definitely be an hour to remember. The beach is too good to be true. The sand is so fine and white and never once is hot to the touch. The food was wonderful. Darn, that's a great breakfast buffet. Just TRY not going back for seconds. Not possible. And the green juice? You'll wish you had bottled it and smuggled it home (I do). As a vegetarian, I found there were always loads of options at every meal. I do wish they were a little bit better about preparing tofu but really, that's splitting hairs. My boyfriend loved everything (meat included) he ate. Our villa was amazing. Between the peace and quiet of sitting by the private pool while reading my book and listening to the birds sing to each other in the canal, the incredible bathroom and shower, the beautifully appointed (and inviting!) bed and the outdoor bathtub in our Garden Villa, it was tough to figure out where to roost! Coming home to the turn-down service was a true treat, as well. And don't forget the spa and the Rainforest! Both were amazing experiences, though I think I'd take a treatment from Aim over the water-park-made-for-adults. All in all, BT Mayakoba is amazing.

First, this place is in an amazing location \"Mayakoba\" which is definitely the best location to stay in Playa Del Carmen. The weather was great for our stay and the scenery was unmatched; from a world class PGA tour course, to the beach, to the lagoons surrounding the property, the whole thing is surreal. Upon check in we were greeted by a host who showed us to our villa which was second to none. My wife and I travel 5 star very frequently and have never stayed in nicer accommodations. The villa was like a small guest house complete with a private pool, outdoor tub, lounge and hammock area, etc. The inside was great too....I would say that the villa was about 800 sq. feet and was spacious and inviting. Food - For us it was amazing. We ate at both Tamarind and Saffron and enjoyed their portions, price, and selection. The staff of the entire resort was what made it for me. As a business owner myself I understand the importance of human capital and that is clearly evident here! The employees love working there and take pride in their jobs. The grounds were lush, the workers were polite and all spoke English, they were all very accommodating all of the time. If anything were to set this apart from other locations we have traveled in the world it would definitely be the people. Spa - World class...we did a spa day with lunch in between and I would compare it to some of the best spas in the world. The treatment rooms are villas that are private and all of the people working are expertly trained in Thailand. Truly a relaxing experience that was unique to this property. Beach - Perfect, clear blue water, true (comfortable) lounging chairs, and attentive service at both the beach and swim up pool beachside. Tip....order the soft-shell crab tacos for lunch they are wonderful!

We also enjoyed that boat trips to and from the beach, as well as riding the bikes around the property and to the beach.

The Banyan Tree Mayakoba could get there but only once some real annoyances are ironed out. These annoyances are highlight by other reviewers and we saw others staying at the same time as us experience similar frustrations too. First the positives: - The villa concept is great and we loved our private, squeaky clean, quiet villa space with pool, hot tub, day room etc. - The communal areas are also clean, well maintained and beautifully designed - The staff are smart, friendly and always willing to help (albeit not so efficiently always) - The golf course is in great shape and challenging but fair (and windy!) - The breakfast buffet and team are outstanding. This brings us to our first big annoyance. Far too many requests were forgotten, incorrectly followed through or simply not possible. Our restaurant booking the first night did not exist, on the second night was messed up too. After spending the first two days stressing if we had dinner reservations or not, eventually we gave up, and ate at the Fairmont the next three days where the telephone receptionist was able to make bookings in any restaurant with immediate confirmation. We had to ask 4 times for the lock to the main villa door to be repaired, twice it was patched up, twice nothing happened at all, never was it properly fixed despite me showing the maintenance guy where the real problem was! I recommend that you book SPA treatments, in Villa BBQ (great BTW), etc before arriving. We stayed 7 nights and on day 1 were told the first BBQ booking available was on our last night 6 days later. Never were there any free SPA treatment in the popular 4-6 slot. For an exclusive hotel there should be more capacity for such requests. Our second big annoyance was the dining options. During our stay Oriente breakfast restaurant was closed evenings, leaving a Thai restaurant, a high end Mediterranean restaurant and a beach restaurant with only a set menu Grill choice. Getting reservations is overly complicated: in an exclusive hotel you should not need to book yet we saw at least three parties including ourselves being turned away from these restaurants despite clearly available tables - completely inexcusable. I gather in room dining is great (our BBQ certainly was) but after a day in your private compound you want a change of scenery. The food was always fine, but the Mayakoba's dining alternatives do not offer value for money or provide enough real alternatives. All advertised prices are exclusive of 10% tax and 15% service charge that is applied regardless of party size: it ends up costing c.25% more than equivalent service and quality at the neighboring properties. I would love to be able to wholeheartdly recommend Mayakoba Banyan Tree, but cant right now. All it requires is a bit of hands on management: Mr Lennkh, get out from behind your PC responding to Tripadvisor reviews with \"I'll pass your comment on messages\" and spend a bit more time walking the hotel. We did not once in a week have any interaction or see any management in action. The villas are a lovely concept. My recommendation for now is if you go: reserve all treatments, restaurants, golf, bbq well in advance and get confirmation in writing. Then relax and enjoy.

Several employees made our visit and outstanding one. There were Manuel and Alejandro at the bar, Manuel, Francisco, Felipe at breakfast and the Sands. Ivan, Carlos and Emmanuel at the beach club. Their smiles were so warm and we immediately felt welcome. A tip is to rent bikes to get to and from the beach. $5 a day. What a fun way to see the property, which was immaculate. Every single person we saw on our daily ride greeted us with smiles. Another tip is to get extra key cards to use for the a/c while you are out of your villa. Our unit did not cool down fast enough in the evenings without the key card in place all day. Pack your sunblock and the sun is intense! it is $26 a bottle at the gift shop. Change money to offer as tips and pay for smaller items. Our villa was a garden villa. We did not have a hot tub or bigger casita. We did not need one! We used the pool daily. The temperature was perfect. The hammock was key for naps. Bottles of water, fresh fruit and delicious coffee were in our villa every single day. The bed and linens were top notch. The rain shower felt heavenly on my sunburned skin. The Beach Club and Sands has the only lunch option outside of room service. I enjoyed every single dish I tried. Breakfast, which is included, was the biggest and best buffet. Even had sushi! And if you did not see something you wanted, they would find it for you. Saffron was our only choice for dinner. And it did not disappoint. We had the filet and pad thai, several appetizers and wine. We sat outside and watched huge fish swim by the dock. A very romantic setting. We went off campus to the Fairmont and Grand Velas. Both hotels were beautiful. But not to the level of The Banyan Tree. We played El Cameleon Golf Course twice and saw crocodiles and tons of iguanas. We went to Playa Del Carmen twice by taxi. It is a $20 ride and so much fun. I felt very safe the entire time I was there. Whether I was at the Banyan Tree or if we were downtown. Although we saw several children enjoying their vacation, I would not bring my little kids until they were old enough to enjoy the luxury of this hotel. The majority of the visitors paid a lot of money to enjoy the peace and serenity. I would not want to disturb their vacation. And now to the spa. Heaven inside the Banyan Tree.

Rooms: Awesome rooms...every year we've had the villa with a bedroom and separate pavilion. Each suite has a private pool and jacuzzi...and an outdoor bathtub (some have outdoor showers in addition to the indoor shower). Bathrooms are massive...lotsa space to explode your luggage. Restaurants: We ate at Oriente every morning for breakfast (full buffet included in room rate), and typically went to Saffron, their signature Thai restaurant for the dinners where we ate out. Saffron's manager started out as a waiter at Banyan Tree-Phuket, so it was gratifying to see that the Banyan Tree corporation is promoting from within and offering opportunities abroad for their talented staff. Great Thai food, by the way. Bellmen: Awesome. These folks are the backbone of the resort. They're empowered to cater to their guests' needs, and follow-thru with any and all requests. Check-in/Check-out: A pain point for our visit. We had a $14US room service charge that we were overcharged and brought it to the check-out staff's attention the night prior to leaving. The follow-up that was committed was never completed. The next morning, when we went to settle our bill, the day staff at check-out weren't aware of the issue, nor did they seem to be empowered to make the decision to adjust our bill. This has been a consistent issue with each of our visits. It was a minor charge, but wasn't the best way to end our vacation. Beach/pool staff: Excellent. The folks there recognized us from our previous visits, and were extremely attentive. We were able to leave our children at the kids' club one morning and they had a great time. One thing we did notice on this trip was that there was a bit more trash on the beach compared to last year. Room Service: We had room service dinner for five of the seven nights we were there...par for the course if you've got young children. Room service dinners were as nice as eating at the restaurants, especially if you have dinner set up in the pavilions. Follow-up: Resort hosts were there for the check-in, but when we contacted them about activities or special requests, the follow-thru didn't seem to be there...we had to call them back to get a response. Suggestion: In-room checkout...by the resort hosts. This may smooth out the check-out process issues that we've had. One comment about the breakfast staff..actually more of a commentary about the other guests: Even though breakfast was included in the room rate, we tipped the staff $5-$10 each morning. This seemed to not be the norm, and mid-way thru our visit, we were noticing that the waitstaff were EXTRA attentive to our family. These folks were working very diligently to ensure that breakfast was running smoothly, plates were being cleared, etc. We got the impression that the other guests weren't tipping them at all.

Waking to an outdoor shower, stepping out of the bedroom directly into a heated private pool, having a wonderful dinner cooked by a private chef, this place is simply wonderful. Some things I was wondering about before we went and now understand: The difference between a spa pool villa and a courtyard villa is more than just the rooftop massage area. The spa villa gives you a heated pool and spa versus just a heated spa plus you get a steam shower in the master bedroom (AWESOME!!!!). We thought we would like the roof massage for two but the mid day sun was sooo hot we elected to do our massage in the pavillion. If you do get a spa villa book the massages well in advance for sunset and it will be perfect - the hotel was full when we arrived and we had only morning and early afternoon massages available (hint most packages come with a massage so the hotel has a much higher spa use ratio than most properties) OK some hints if you are going here: book the in villa barbq - we left for a cocktail party and when we returned they had placed magical lights all around our pool and dining area and we had a great chef grilling our dinner, serving us on white linen under the stars, a wonderful time and not too pricy about $135 per person - almost $500 less than places like Las Ventanas charge for a private chef experienece. The Ixachel private boat dinner was certainly remarkable and an event we will never forget, but all in it came in at $450 per person for dinner and drinks so it may be out of reach for most, but 3 hours sailing along on a boat, listening to love songs while the sun set and a private chef fed us drinks and expert food, it was beyond awesome! The rooms are as great as the rest of the posts describe, the little touches like a full size laundry hamper and seven pillow choices we continued to really appreciate through our stay. Improvement areas are with the free internet service: one word SLOW. This place would seem to demand good high speed service rather than the turtle speed we had.

It you choose to dine outside at Saffron, they have a \"moon table\" that overlooks the lagoon. Ask for it when you make reservations. It's semi private and extremely romantic. In the late morning, early afternoon we would ride our bikes to the beach. There were huge loungers with comfy pads and thick towels waiting for us. The beach attendants were helpful with positioning our chairs and beach umbrellas as the sun revolved. Drinks were of high quality (grey goose, herradura, etc.) and plentiful. Often times we would be the last to leave the beach club and they had \"spotters\" on the path to assist us with finding the way back to our villa on our bicycles. The spa is incredible. We had several treatments and all were first rate. The actual treatment lasted as long as advertised. The rain forest is an experience. If you indulge in the Valentine's special (3 hrs. of bliss with your companion) it's a private session there. The exercise room has very nice equipment but is on the small and warm side. This is one of the few recommendations that I would have for Banyan Tree Mayakoba. Enlarge the space and install fans. The golf course was gorgeous. It is hosting a PGA event later this month. Price was reasonable and the head pro very friendly. Having stayed at Las Ventanas in Cabo is a close comparison. Accommodation wise, BTM has the most luxurious villas in the market.

The beds are super comfy with great linens. The bathrooms spacious and superbly appointed. The villa pool was beautiful, if cold (villa pools are not heated so in Dec., Jan., Feb. they can be quite chilly). And even the large outdoor space was very, very private.

The short bike ride to the beach (along the golf course) was no problem - enjoyable, even. The beach club seems a bit small for the property size, especially considering the large (and largely unused) pool by the main building. The staff at the beach club, as throughout the property, were great. In the mornings it was perfect: quiet and calm. In the afternoon, the pool area got a bit crowded, so we went down to the beach on some lounges and we were fine. Every so often, the staff would check on us and they were always available if you needed something. The hotels in Mayakoba all have charging privileges with each other. One night we wanted seafood, so we took the complimentary shuttle to the Fairmont and had a nice meal outside on their patio. The breakfast buffet is very nice.

The villas are lovely and spacious; everything you would hope for and expect. The hotel is immaculate. The spa is excellent. The beach is also very nice. The breakfast is outstanding. Clearly it is a hotel for couples, but even so they were very accommodating for families with babies, they had excellent babysitters, high chairs, and even a small kids club. Despite everything we had a lovely week at the Banyan tree. The achilles heel of the hotel is its service. We had an issue on the first night when to cut a long story short we thought the first villa smelled of damp and it took 2.5 hours to change villa even though there were other villas available. It was irritating because we had a small baby who needed to go to sleep, and by the time we moved we had to wake him because the hotel had no more cots. To cap it off, when we finally moved room and were getting ready for bed, semi-undressed, a security guard walked in without knocking on the door. At 11pm someone called to discuss (in Spanish) the do not disturb sign that I had reported broken an hour earlier. Irritation turned to insult when the manager was unavailable to speak to us at the time, or the next day, or the next. Does the hotel even have a general manager? All customer communications are delegated to the hotel hostesses who are not much more than perma-smiley receptionists. They left the standard plate of truffles in our room which according to earlier reviews seems to be the standard compensation. We didn't even realise it was intended as an apology as we had just come from a hotel that cost less than half that left truffles in our room every night. We started to question if we were being unreasonable, but for nearly $1k per night for the cheapest room we expect excellence. Eventually the very capable rooms manager found us on the beach, said and did all the right things, and redeemed the hotel. The problem is that the hotel has a chronic service problem. The staff are very helpful and eager to please and I almost feel guilty writing this. If you ask for a buggy, or some ice, to be sent to the room, sometimes it arrives immediately, but more often it takes up to an hour. If you ask for tea with cold milk at breakfast, it may come with no milk, hot milk, or sometimes you get a cappuccino. Only once in 7 attempts did they manage to bring it correctly. We were told restaurants were closed only to find that they were open. Waiters in the restaurants didn't even have a passing knowledge of the menu, if you asked a question about a dish it was as if they were hearing about it for the first time. You get the picture.

I will do my best to recollect - but it was honestly so dreamlike!!! We chose Mexico for our honeymoon (Aug 17 - 22, 2010) since it was convenient location-wise. We wanted to find the best-of-the-best resort... and we DEFINITELY did. Banyan Tree Mayakoba is by far the most exquisite, relaxing, amazing, private, romantic place I have ever been. It would rank 6 stars on a 5 star scale. We rented a car from Cancun airport (to save some money and have some freedom) and drove ourselves to the resort. It was an easy to find and no hassle drive and Banyan parked our car for free. Upon arrival we were greeted with fresh towels and delicious exotic juice. Our host, Marian, was the sweetest and most helpful person!!!! She answered all or our questions and even went out of her way on occasion to find us at breakfast and inquire of how our stay was going. After our tour of the resort and our villa (we were upgraded to the Courtyard Villa!!) we unpacked in our spacious modern-style villa and then rented our bikes to explore. (I highly recommend renting the bikes as it is both fun and exercise :) Otherwise you can opt to be driven by golfcart). The beach was a short ride away - including a restaurant, beach drink service and infinity pool... you are all set! Each villa has it's own pool and or hot tub, so you can swim privately or at the wonderful public reflections pool. Each night, we received a romantic turn-down service. When we would return from dinner our room would be prepared for a restful and romantic nights sleep. During our stay here, we ate at all restaurants... ALL AMAZING!!! We even splurged and booked Itchel, the private boat tour w/ private chef. It was one of the most incredible meals I have EVER tasted. The chef was both personable and informative and even gave us privacy at the end for a moonlit tour of the lagoons. I definitely recommend getting the daily breakfast at the Orient - the variety left us stunned each morning. They have the freshest and most unique options! We mainly meandered between our villa and the beach most days. We also booked a couples massage that was wonderful! However - if you are looking for nightlife all day everyday... I would suggest another resort. Banyan was very private and quite empty during our stay (which is Exactly what we wanted). We did take 2 day trips- 1. Playa del Carmen 2. Tour of Mayan Ruins & Ceynotes Staff Experience: World Class, 110% attentive and left us 110% statisfied Ivan waited on us a few nights (Sands & Tamarind)- he was so helpful, nice and gave great meal recommendations. Montserrat at La Copa was so pleasant when serving us drinks and appetizers. She always remembered our reservations and asked if we enjoyed them the day after! Amondo at the reflections pool was so fun and care free - we even signed up for his Cocktail Making class.

We could not have picked a more perfect resort. Not only is the resort stunning, but the service was impeccable. There's a host/hostess available to you 24-hrs a day, a buggy on-call at your disposal, and all the waiters/servers are kind and trained to the utmost of standards. The villas themselves were spectacular. We stayed in a courtyard villa which has its own separate breakfast nook with TV, bar, dinner table, large sofa, etc. Outside we had our own pool and jacuzzi. The pool was sometimes chilly (not heated), and the jacuzzi sometimes hot (but they would always send someone to adjust it), but we just preferred the beach and the resort pool anyway. The bedrooms in the villa have a cathedral ceiling, huge bathroom for two, walk-in closet, massive shower, and outdoor bath. The food at the resort was divine. We ate at Saffron first when we arrived for our stay. They greet the women with flowers for their hair, and sat us at the special table at the end of the dock, overlooking the mangroves. Tamarind was also delicious and quite eclectic downstairs from the lobby. Sands (at the beach club) had a great barbecue night and served Mexican food in Oriente (which was closed for dinner during our stay because of 'low-season'). Breakfast every morning was at Oriente and believe us, you've never seen breakfast buffets like this. Think sushi bar, yogurt bar, fruit bar, bread bar, juice bar, pastry bar, omelet/egg bar, and hot stations. If you have the chance, the 24-hr in-villa dining is actually really good and the presentation is impressive. The resort has a bar in the lobby, at the pool, and at the beach. The bar at the pool was closed during our stay (again, 'low-season'), but the staff around the pool was happy to order us drinks and bring them down from the lobby. You can get around the resort in the buggy, rent a bike, or walking in most cases from the villas to the lobby. The beach is a bit further and can't be walked to easily, but you can take the buggy/a bike and they do have a boat that leaves from the lobby which makes a really nice trip to the beach club. Definitely take the short eco boat trip which takes you around the mangroves to see the local wildlife. Last, but not least, the spa. We spent two mornings in the spa. The first was a massage in our private spa villa with a bathroom, shower, and a seat for tea/water before/after the treatment. Really professional staff who are experts in their treatments. The second morning was the 'Rainforest Indulgence' which included an abbreviated 'Rainforest Experience' session followed by another massage in the villas. The 'Rainforest' portion included a cold/hot shower, steam room, full body scrub and shower, salt steam room (brine room), and then a tropical shower, followed by time in the vitality pool. While staying in Riviera Maya, definitely put a few days aside to make a trip to Chichen Itza and to Tulum. We piggy-backed our trip to Tulum to also go zip-lining, snorkel in two cenotes (a must-do) and eat lunch at a local restaurant. And after Chichen Itza we went through Valladolid, a Spanish Colonial town, for a nice lunch in the most charming hotel, El Meson del Marques. We spent three days following our trip in Cozumel. While we were anxious to get into a more festive, social environment, we were quickly missing Banyan Tree. We will absolutely look into additional Banyan Tree resorts for our future vacations.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - But Not For Everyone....\u201d", "Author": "SIMONandCARO", "ReviewID": "UR91639403", "Content": "The preceding reviews of this hotel are fairly accurate. The Villas are excellent, the Spa is fantastic and the level of service is very high. But rather than repeat what others have already said, let me make a few observations about the hotel and the surrounding area based on my 14 night stay, which you may find relevant: LOCATION: The hotel is located in a private resort about 30 minutes away from Playa del Carmen. While the Banyan Tree is a peaceful, quiet and serene environment, Playa del Carmen is a cheap, touristy, dirty and run down place. On 5th Avenue (the major tourist thoroughfare), you will find very poor quality shops, bars and restaurants and streets littered with trash and dead animals (today a dog). Although some people will enjoy the delights of \"Playa\", it's hard to imagine that anyone who enjoys the Banyan Tree, will enjoy it's neighbouring town. DINING: Having conveyed my views on Playa, it should be clear that any decent dining options lay in the hotel itself, or in the restaurants of the surrounding 5* hotels. In the Banyan Tree, the dining options are extremely limited. This is problematic given how unappealing it is to leave the resort. \"Saffron\" the signature restaurant of the Banyan Tree is a perfectly good Thai restaurant set in the most romantic setting within the hotel on a series of piers overlooking the lagoon. The food here is nice, but not spectacular, and my palette generally struggles with Thai any more than once a week. The next option is \"Tamarind\", the hotels fine dining restaurant. This restaurant is located in the somewhat sterile lobby building and the food is far too complicated and over-engineered to be a regular dining option. And while the food in here is ok, you probably won't want to eat there twice - think Nouvelle Cuisine with large portions and just a few too many flavours going on on one plate. That leaves \"Oriente\", which is the main hotel restaurant where an excellent breakfast is served. In the evening however, Oriente normally serves a buffet, which in my experience is exceptionally poor and overpriced. Furthermore the atmosphere is one of a canteen, which at $65 per person for the buffet is unacceptable. In short then, dining options outside the hotel are very limited, while the hotels own dining options are not adequate to carry the burden. The in-villa BBQ dining is well worth doing however and restaurants at the nearby Mandarin and Rosewood, can help to fill the voids. ATMOSPHERE: the hotel is tranquil, calm and relaxing. As a consequence, do not expect any night life, energy or vibrancy in the hotel in the evening. BEACH: my experience of beach and poolside service was very good. The beach is nice, but the sea bed is covered in a green algae which feels unpleasant underfoot. TENNIS: the hotel shares 2 tennis courts with the adjoining Fairmont and Rosewood (around 800 guests max) which is inadequate for a resort of this size and booking a court is difficult. CONCIERGE: the concierge function at the hotel is not strong. There is little understanding of the quality / type of travel and dinning arrangements that guests require outside of the hotel. Notwithstanding the above comments, we loved our stay at the Banyan Tree and enjoyed the environment of the Mayakoba Resort. The hotel also proved a good base to explore Tulum, Chitchen Itza and Cozumel - on the latter place, the scuba/snorkelling here is fantastic and the beaches are nice, but the rest of the place is a total dump, so I would advise against taking the 40 minute boat unless you want to explore the reef. In summary then, the Banyan Tree is a great hotel to relax, unwind and enjoy the sun. As ling as that's all you are looking for, you will not go wrong at the Banyan Tree.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Rooms, service a bit unpolished.\u201d", "Author": "Pumkin2000", "ReviewID": "UR91622361", "Content": "First of all, this hotel is amazingly beautiful. If I give it 3 stars, it is because I am not sure it was worth the money it asked from us. Money aside, this is without doubt a 5 star venue. It is the curse of the super exclusive resort that every little blemish gets overblown exponentially by the demanding guest. I am aware of this and will try to avoid giving the wrong impression that this resort is terrible. It is not, it is very nice. However: Biggest problem: Service. Very friendly, but perhaps a bit over-motivated? When we moved in we asked for a couple of extras. \"Yes yes, we will check\" was the answer to everythying and then I never heard from them again. There was always a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. It extended to the restaurants as well, for example, they would say \"ok we will serve the spice and coriander separate from the soup\" and then everything was mixed together anyways. Or, they would ask \"are you allergic to any foods\" and then what do they actually do with that information? Nothing. My wife has lactose intolerance. They still recommended all kinds of cheese and milk dishes. It is nice you ask, but what do you actually do with it? My wife and I have stayed at much more exclusive and expensive resorts in the past (e.g. six senses) where they ask the same things, but they actually do work with that information. Unlike Banyan Tree, they also make sure your special requests are handled correctly. For example, we asked for late check out and were surprised to hear, a couple days later, that our request had actually not been entered. We also asked for a copy of the menus from all the restaurants so we could plan our dinners, asked twice (!), and never got them. Was that a difficult request? I asked for a cable to connect my MP3 player to the stereo, was told \"I will check for you\" and never heard back. Not to mention the buggy that never came to pick us up on our first night. On the last night I offloaded my frustration over all these things on the poor guy who takes the guests phone calls. Maybe I overreacted, but thinking about the level of service we experienced in other resorts I really do believe I had a point there. Minor thing: My wife and I have different last names. Hotel staff kept addressing me with my wife's name. They did take my credit card and passport when I checked in, so they should have known I have my own name. Then my wife got hurt when the hammock crashed down because it was not tied properly. No serious injury, and we are not Americans who sue for millions in damages for emotional trauma. But she does have a chronic back problem and this was potentially dangerous! The staff did not immediately understand the problem and it felt a bit as if they did not believe us. They sent chocolates, this is nice, but also a bit lame. If my wife had dislocated the disc in her back, our vacation would have been over. When the hotel repaired the hammock, they used what sailors call a Palstek type knot, but it was not done right and I had to correct it. It felt as though they did not (want) to get out of their way to make us feel better about this incident. I suspect they did not really believe us. Another thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the Wifi. There was no signal in our villa. We had to go to the garden to get a signal, but it was so weak that the connection was very slow. Same applies to cell phone coverage. I wanted to make some business calls and actually had to hike up to the lobby to get a good signal. The food: I did not think the restaurants were very good. I mean, really expensive and really average. The so-called christmas dinner was very average and very overpriced. Speaking of Xmas: Did it actually happen? There was not a trace of Xmas in the hotel. Why? The Thai restaurant was outstanding, not because of the food, but because of the owner (I guess he was the owner, the thai guy). He made us feel very special and gave us the best and most romantic table in the whole restaurant, overlooking the water. This is the kind of service and attention to the customer that I had been expecting from everybody there. Perhaps I am a bit spoiled from having stayed at more expensive resorts. But I really thought that Banyan Tree was playing in a similar league.

We did have an issue when we arrived though. On the first day, they brought us to our villa, which was amazing, but it was hot. They said to give it 30 minutes to cool down. So we went and got some drinks/snacks at the bar. Went back to our villa about an hour later, and it was still hot. The A/C appeared to be broken, which isn't good when you're in Mexico in August. So we called the front desk. They came and looked at it, I'm not sure if they did anything, but they said to wait 45 more minutes and it should be working. The room stayed hot. Now at this point, it was just getting ridiculous. This was our first day there, they knew it was our honeymoon, and for the price of this place, I would have expected them to either fix the A/C ASAP or move us to a new villa ASAP. So I was getting really annoyed that they were wasting our time with this. We called the front desk back and they came back to the villa. They said that the A/C was broken and they were going to upgrade our room now. Oh thanks a lot, after this whole ordeal took 4 hours out of our first day here. So we had a rocky start. But everything after that first day was great. I would recommend swimming with the whale sharks. That was an unforgettable experience but I think it's a seasonal excusion. We visited the other hotels, Rosewood and Fairmont and both had great food. Also, the Rosewood acknowledged our honeymoon with a dessert :) The food and drinks at the Banyan Tree were good too. As everyone stated below, be ready to pay a premium price for EVERYTHING. We prepared for that beforehand but it's still difficult to order an $18 drink and try to enjoy it.

The Banyan Tree Mayakoba was as wonderful as it was in 2009 with the most subtle of changes. - Bikes now cost $5 each per day although it didn't bother us one bit. We got along just fine with outstanding buggy service, and occasionally chose the water taxi from the beach back to the main pavilion which is a beautiful choice, but not if you're in a rush. - The absolutely essential \"Rainforest Walk\" has decreased in price to $39.99 each over last year, although I would easily pay double that for the experience. In short, it's a private tour of a beautiful spa facility consisting of different sauna's, steam rooms, etc. The final stage is my personal favorite, a serene pool area with jacuzzi's and different pools to get lost in. The whole experience lasts more like 90 minutes vs. the advertised 60, and your personal assistant can't wait to describe each stage, hand you fresh water or a cool washcloth. If you don't make a reservation while at the Banyan Tree...Shame on you! There's too much to cover about the stay although it's the breakfast buffet that is for someone that truly appreciates fresh food, nearly an emotional experience. I dare Tom Colicchio and Padma Lakshmi to come up with a reason to give the buffet experience less than a 10. If you like to hold yourselves hostage on the resort grounds for the week as my wife and I did though, you may find yourselves looking for some alternatives for lunch and dinner by day 4. The Thai influenced \"Saffron\" is a wonderful experience but I would give it 4 out of 4 dollar signs for pricing, an experience that leaves your wallet asking you \"Did you just take me to NYC's Le Bernardin for a chef's tasting?\" All told though, we made it work with a combination of huge breakfasts, light lunches at the beach and \"In Villa Dining\" 3 times during the week. Don't you dare refer to the \"In Villa Dining\" as room service as it doesn't compare. Portions can be a tad stingy (I'm being nice as I'm so in love with the Banyan Tree) although the service is as attentive as some five star restaurants here in NY. Bottom line: Cash in your JetBlue credits now, fly to Cancun and take the 35-40 minute ride to the Banyan Tree Mayakoba, at which point you will forget that the rest of the world exists, at least for the week.

The rooms and the surroundings are gorgeous. The service is very good. There are only a few issues that I would point out. Although there are multiple restaurants, they are not all open for all meals. For example, the only really viable options for lunch would be room service or the Sands which is near the beach and a bit of a hike. One day we were at the pool near the main hotel and we asked for food to be brought over poolside from the Sands. It nearly took an act of God for this to happen. The Oriente and Tamarind were always closed at lunch time. The only really great food was at Saffron and the breakfasst buffet. Lunch at the Sands was very good. Tamarind was a bit disappointing so we only went there once. This is important because you are likely to have most of your meals at the resort. Bottom line is that the service and food isn't quite up to the surroundings. The worst problem I had was at checkout. There were several incorrect charges. Obviously if I caught 3 errors on my bill, this must happen there quite often. The front desk staff was very reluctant to remove a 15 dollar incorrect charge despite the fact that I spent 7 thousand dollars there in one week. I had to insist that I would not pay for it before they finally agreed to remove the charge. They should have been apologizing repeatedly for these errors rather than hassling me about this. This is the kind of thing you wouldn't expect at a top of the line luxury property. Leaving under those circumstances left a bad taste in my mouth. Make sure you keep track of everything you purchase or charge at the property to make sure they don't pad the bill. Finally, the spa was great. Wonderful massages.

The base level room/villas only have the pool-no hot tub so do yourself a favor and pay a little more for the hot tub!! :) We stayed for 5 nights 6 days and got to eat at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba quite a bit. We enjoyed our room service as our first meal of the trip as we were starved for lunch when we arrived in the resort! We also enjoyed Saffron on one evening although it rained slightly that night so we didnt get to eat outside. They have great food and the best Tom kai Gai. We also enjoyed Tamarind another night which was Thanksgiving holiday. It was a nice touch that they included a Thanksgiving menu on top of their normal menu for that day. Our Waiter ----- was great and recommended the sashumi for part of my meal which was exellent! The breakfast buffet is not too be missed! They have it all and serve it till noon which is nice since you dont have to rush out of bed to eat. We spent a majority of our time in the beach area. The pool is nice at the beach and is heated. We really enjoyed the staff there and they all did a great job. They all knew me by name after a day or so and are a great bunch of guys. Alejandro and the rest know how to fix a drink! We also enjoyed the rainforest spa treatment as it had a good variety of tempreatures and pressures and is one of the only things that is not expensive there. My fiance also enjoyed an additional spa treatment another day. The only bad things I could say were one day there was seaweed on the beach but that was the only time i remember seeing that for the entire week. Another one is we had the privacy light on and the house keeping still came into the villa which was a slight intrusion. Finally the hot tub button got stuck so within 15 minutes the repair person was there to fix the button fast. Also it is very expensive but you get what you pay for! I will not let those minor things keep me from staying there again.

Splendid Resort Hotel entrance without names, behind acres of bush, through the many paths. At the end an equally impressive hotel entrance with a water lily pond and flares at night. Ca. 130 villas of different categories (from the Terrace Apartments to Three-bedroom Beachfront Villa), all with pool in various sizes. The main part of the hotel is in an area with a man-made lagoons, which have been milled from the landscape, but they have been preserved their original form. Many animals you can see (alligators to be evacuated if they become too large). State simply dazzling, well maintained, there was obviously nothing to save. About cleanliness I do not have to write here. In the complex an 18-hole PGA golf course is integrated! I recommend to include breakfast in the booking, if it is offered (usually $ 30 per person excluding tips). The guest structure is hardly discernible, because the few customers run into the area, the beach and the villas of languages can be heard in English and Spanish. Location Sunset Beach Front and / Estuate-Villas on the beach, the rest about 1 km away (transfer smoothly and promptly by golf cart or romantically by electrical Jetty through the lagoons). Cancun about 70 kilometers (about 40 minutes), Playa del Carmen 15 (17 $ taxi). The hotel has a small shop with accessories from the hotel rooms, soaps, scented stuff, art items, clothing. A jeweler. Service Absolutely flawless. Staff always friendly and correct, best manners, courteous. Complaint (faulty IR receiver on the TV) has been fixed within 20 minutes (!) y technicians. Clothing of staff stylish Asian-inspired. On the whole, the impression is always a mixture of Mexican and Asian influences. Buggy service within minutes, perfect service in the restaurant. It must be said: something we have never experienced on holiday, it also excels all German hotels. Housekeeping with two or three people, all will be polished from scratch. Even toiletries are draped over an extra-handkerchief. The turn-down service repeats the service, if needed. Gastronomy Four restaurants, many of them two or three dinners in rotation. Two bars, plus \"wine cellar\" for private functions upon request. Room service (very professional and punctual delivery order) 24 hours. Private dinner in a gondola with live music? Barbeque in your own villa? No problem! The rule is: anything goes. Evening \"Saffron\" (Asian), \"Oriente\" (barbecue and Mexican), \"Tamarind\" (according to hotel eclectic, but rather international). How was the food? Absolute gourmet level. Eat fish fillets to kneel down, vegetables, as it should be, interesting and tasty soups and salads. Simply, perfect. The restaurants are partially open, partially closed. Diner on a wooden pier in Saffron (slightly dark), romantic tete a tete for us by torchlight at Tamarind, Breakfast in the sunshine or in shadow - it was extraordinary. The amounts can be said that the starters were usually quite abundant, the main courses less. Among the desserts this and that (by the way the scoop: cake chocolate mousse). The room service here, for \"in villa dining,\" conveyed that, actually a little feast that is as tasty as the rest (Recommended: pizza and hamburger with Kobe beef). Price, yes ... the prices are, as you can imagine, at the higher end. Steep, but not bold, and in my opinion for what is appropriate and proportionate. Examples: appetizers $ 15-30, main courses $ 20-50, desserts $ 10-20. To the prices on a map add about 25 percent tax and service charge to - and tip, if you want to. We ate for $ 100, but also supplied $ 350 per night (but then 3 courses and wine). Among the drinks then prices are heavy, and upwards, there is hardly a limit. Ah yes, the cocktails were not that great. Sports Entertainment Internet available for free via Wi-Fi and a quick line in the whole resort. Entertainment and sport is not to mention. Bicycles can be rented ($ 5 / day). The beach is not a jewel in the crown. Rather narrow, clean (daily cleaning), only small stones. Better it is where the golf course runs along the beach, you should therefore seek about 50 meters to the north. Chairs (comfortable) and umbrellas are set up by the staff. Rooms A dream that for us through a free upgrade (from Courtyard Pool Suite to 2-Bedroom Pool Villa near the beach) was even better. Even the small villas offer more than 200 m\u00b2 detached area, where you can make to the larger villas are then 300 and more square meters, including a large air-conditioned \"Entertainment Pavilion\" (mini-bar, wine refrigeration, espresso machine, flat screen, DVD player , dining table, large sofa to slouch for several people), a heated jacuzzi, an outdoor bathtub and shower. Large terrace with sun loungers, umbrella and a pool, terraces with further additional, even larger beds. The villa itself consists of a hallway (desk), bedroom (mini bar, sideboard) with king-size bed and couch. Flat screen TV, Bose stereo with iPod docking station. Large bathroom with two sinks, large mirror in between, toilet and shower (some with steam function). Another Docking Station (both wirking with iPod V). Sliding doors separate walk-in closet (safe, iron / board, umbrellas, raincoats, mosquito means, flashlight). A total of 3 phones.

Probably nothing, but I'll give it a shot. This will be a long review, for those that can\u2019t stand it my one word summary of this resort is \u2018amazing\u2019. Or \u2018relaxing\u2019. First, coming from Dallas, this place is just a 2hr ride away. We stayed as Las Brisas (Acapulco) earlier this year, but that means hubbing through Mexico City, and adding 5hrs to the journey. Compared to Las Brisas, which is also a great resort, Banyan Tree Mayakoba is superior in every way (including the price, of course, but you get what you pay for). On arrival, I had opted to use Cancun Shuttle for the private transfer, which worked out to around $100 less that using the hotel service. It\u2019s only a ~30 minute ride, but the vans they use are fairly tatty, I\u2019m fairly sure ours had over 300,000km on the clock, which is impressive, but not ideal. As others have said, it\u2019s chaos outside of Cancun airport, and there\u2019s other companies wearing (much brighter) orange vests, so you need to look hard to find them. However, once we finally arrived, none of that mattered. The hotel has an amazing ability to just make you feel relaxed as soon as you arrive. Obviously, that\u2019s mostly due to the surroundings and amazing staff, but overall it just works. Staying in October means that the occupancy rate is fairly low, I would guess 35%, and it was so quiet. This trip was an elaborate set-up to propose to my (now) fianc\u00e9. This required a ridiculous amount of subterfuge and planning, and my main accomplice was Michele, the Experience Concierge. Over the course of about a month, and countless emails, we hatched a plan that was romantic, surprising, and just plain cool! More on this later. The Check-in process was a breeze, and Karla, our resort Host, was very helpful, and rode with us to our room, which was upgraded to a 2 Bedroom pool villa, a mere (!) 5500 sq foot. The rooms are spectacular, huge, and very, very private. The housekeeping staff always respected the privacy sign (controlled by a bed-side switch), and did a great job of keeping everything tidy. The Bose system by the bed has an iPod connector, as does the speaker dock in the bathroom (though ours wouldn\u2019t work with either iPhone 3GS or 4). The in-room wifi is good, and reasonably fast. There\u2019s complimentary water in the room, as well as mosquito room and body spray. The pool, being October, was a bit chilly, I would guess a water temperature of around 82f/28c, which made it more of a dare, than a pleasure, to take a dip, though after a couple of minutes it\u2019s fine. The hot-tub made up for it though. If I\u2019m being picky (and I will, it\u2019s in my nature!), there were a couple of minor snags with the room. When we arrived, most of the landscape lights didn\u2019t work (this was fixed the same evening). The expresso maker gave out some good electric shocks when trying to use the steam. I was told this was fixed as well, but I didn\u2019t feel like trying it again! The keycard holder, which activates a lot of the room features, was loose, and would hang out of the wall \u2013 this is an obvious defect that housekeeping should have reported. Finally, they use re-fillable toiletries, which is a good thing, but the little pumps on the bottles are constantly getting stuck. Honestly, these are all minor, trivial points, but for a hotel that\u2019s not yet 2 years old, I would suggest focusing on some of the smaller details, to ensure it ages gracefully. The only other criticism is the cost of dining. I know this is an exclusive hotel, with excellent chefs, and great food, but nevertheless, some of the prices are very high. I think a (small) slice of New York Style Cheese cake from room service was $14. It was good, but not that good! For a full meal for 2, plan on $200 minimum, and add more if you have wine. On the upside, the breakfast at Oriente is included in the price, and is as good as everyone describes. If you cannot find anything you like here, then you must be a robot (they have oil, too!) Each day we had a very leisurely breakfast, the staff plied us with whatever the daily sparkling cocktail was, and generally turned it into a brunch, so saving a bit of money by not needing lunch. Ceasar was our main waiter, and was great, just like ALL the staff. Federico, the restaurant Manager, was also exceptionally attentive and friendly. I know it\u2019s their job to greet the guests, and appear happy, but they genuinely seem to enjoy what they do, I can\u2019t even pretend to be that happy about my job :-) Our first meal was at Tamarind, which I guess is a contemporary Mexican cuisine. For me, it was disappointing. The menu was quite limited (Saffron was closed on our first night), and in the end I had a piece of grilled chicken, which was nice, but absolutely not worth the $28. Later in the vacation we tried the Punta Bonita at the Rosewood, which was good, closer to the Texmex I\u2019m used to, and half the price. The rest of the time we mostly ate Thai, served by Saffron, though the location varied due to a short visit from Hurricane Paula. We only got to eat at the actual Saffron restaurant once, but it\u2019s a great location, with fantastic service, as always. Thai is our favorite food, and the benchmark dish we use to compare restaurants is the Tom Ka Gai. Here it was amazing, as was the rest of the food. We also opted to do the (free) Thai cooking class, with Jakkree as our patient teacher, who was great. It was a LOT of fun, plus you get to eat what you make \u2013 it\u2019s well worth doing. The engagement was planned around the Rainforest Spa, which is a series of different sensations (ice, steam, heat etc), finishing at the hydrotherapy pool where there\u2019s bubble beds, hot tubs and some amazingly powerful neck/back waterfalls. The playlist I\u2019d sent over started right on cue, and as the ring floated into the pool, I proposed. It was the perfect surprise. Later that day I\u2019d arranged for a special meal at Saffron, but due to the weather was relocated to a private room at Oriente, and while that was happening the room was being covered with rose petals, scented oils and a hot bath with wine. Despite the complicated plan and the weather trying to disrupt things, it all flowed faultlessly. It seemed like every member of staff knew about the plan, and did everything they could to make it as memorable as it now is. There\u2019s so much more to say, but to keep it short: - Beach \u2013 nice, good for walking along, to go see the neighboring hotels (Fairmont & Rosewood), but not amazing. - Hotel grounds \u2013 very nice. We walked everywhere, didn\u2019t really see the need to rent a bike, the beach is only a 10 minute walk away. - Spa \u2013 we had a Swedish (couples) massage, which really was excellent. Expensive, but worth it. - Pool \u2013 We stayed in our room most of the time, but the main pool is very nice, and when we were there, we had it all to ourselves. So, in closing, although the hotel is fantastic in its own right, it\u2019s the staff that make this place truly special. I spent hours and hours reading reviews on many hotels, trying to find the right place for my proposal, and I\u2019m delighted to say that I did, and I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing. This is THE place to come if you seek relaxation, privacy, great accommodations and amazing, unpretentious service. I can only remember a few of the staff\u2019s names, but, without exception, everyone was excellent.

In fact, it is hard to imagine this resort property every really feeling \"crowded\". It is spacious and has many external rooms and spots to relax and enjoy. We were able to enjoy both our own private villa space and the public spaces on the resort - and loved it all. From the moment we stepped out of the car at reception, we were treated really well. The resort made every effort to make us feel celebrated, comfortable, and pampered during our stay. We were upgraded to a 2-Bedroom Sunset Pool Villa at the beach and took a beautiful and peaceful boatride from the main lobby of the hotel - what a wonderful contrast to airlines, and mass travel in the outside world. In this oasis, they had the right music, scents, scenery and vibe set at all times. The villa is well-designed, beautifully and simply furnished, and remarkably spacious and private. We felt like we were in a private home - complete with pool, jacuzzi, two separate lounge areas - and that's just what's on the outside. The inside was comfortable and equally impressive - living room pavillion, outdoor soaking tub and shower, and a bathroom you wish you could pack in your luggage and take home. While you could spend the whole vacation in seclusion in your private oasis, venturing out is a good thing too. Being by the beach club and Sands Restaurant was fantastic. We were able to spend time on the beach, in the pool, at the swim-up pool bar and in the restaurant - with great ease - and again with great service. Friendly, eager to please, and gentle approach all characterized the service from every staff person on the property, regardless of role. It was remarkable to feel so welcomed and looked after - all with great sincerity and interest in the quality of our experience. The food and restuarants at this resort (and at the neighboring Fairmount and Rosewood) are very high quality. The breakfast buffet at Oriente in the main building is a perfect reason to get out of bed in the morning and to leave the comfort of your own villa. The spread was bountiful, beautiful, and delicious - with nice variety each day. The dinner at Saffron and Tamarind was great, and we really enjoyed the Mexican BBQ at Sands (but served on a patio overlooking the main Reflections Pool area. This BBQ can be ordered into your villa for a private dinner - which we didn't do this time - but will likely try on our next visit. The spa area and services are wonderful. It is an further oasis within an oasis and we loved the space, the atmosphere, and the expert service provided by the massage therapists (from Thailand) and the Rainforest Experience. Really lovely. Overall, this was one of the best hotel/service experiences we've had in our travels. We were treated really well, loved relaxing in our private pool villa, and we thrilled to be able to relax on the beautiful sands and waters of the Caribbean sea. All this - and to feel nothing but warmth and sincerity from the staff - as we are a same-sex couple recently married in Connecticut and chose to spend our honeymoon hear, not 100% sure what to expect.

I usually find these vacations quite boring and prefer instead visiting the mountains or a big city. Add to the fact that I wasn't really interested in visiting Mexico either - I know, sounds terrible. However, the convenience of getting to our destination, and direct from the U.S. prompted me to take a leap of faith. I am very glad I did!! The level of service and the amazing set up of each villa and the layout of the resort is absolutely incredible. I have traveled extensively around the world but I must admit that this particular hotel is unique. The Banyan Tree's layout permits one to completely escape and feel like you are the only patrons visiting the resort, yet at the same time - should you choose to be more active there are many options. Before arriving, I was also not initially thrilled about going to a beach resort and then not being able to stay directly on the beach. Yet again, I was surprised because the privacy and sheer square footage and luxuriousness of the villas prompted us to spend a lot more time in our room than originally planned!! Mode of transportation to get around was probably one of my favorite parts - Since most of the resort is surrounded by canals/lagoons you can travel by boat, bike or golf cart. These type of daily excursions added to the unique feeling of the property. The staff was very courteous, friendly and over-eager to please - almost to the point of ridiculous. Any concerns about security in Mexico? Don't be at all - again this was over-the-top. I ran around the resort and nearby resorts in the Mayakoba area and I swear I saw a staff/security person at least every 1/4 mile. They were all communicating and constantly making sure resort guests were happy and knew were to go. The food was great! We loved Saffron and absolutely pigged out at the breakfast buffet. The spa was first rate and you could literally spend a week of being pampered should you desire. My only negative might be that we didn't visit Tamarind because the menu did not look appetizing.

It really was the best honeymoon I could have asked for. I'll say the downsides first since there are very few: It was quite pricey, dinners out in the restaurants ran about $200 a night and even a burger and a small pizza in the villa were a good $60. Cocktails were $15 and up so I would do what another reviewer said and bring a bottle from the duty free shop to enjoy in your room and just get a nice cocktail or two on the beach. That being said all the food is delicious and I would definitely eat at Saffron even with that price tag again. We went to a bbq by the pool since Tamarind was closed on Sunday and that was good but I think it was too expensive and wouldn't recommend it if you are on a budget. We did the romantic bath which was nice but we paid for the mud bath which was double the price of the regular romantic bath, we were disappointed with the two tiny bowls of mud that came with the bath that made it a \"mud bath\" I still recommend doing a romantic bath if you're on your honeymoon but I recommend getting one of the other less expensive baths. The beach is nice and very empty so it felt romantic to be just the two fo us out there sometimes but the water and sand was not as nice as it was in Cancun. Now the good: EVERYTHING was amazing and felt very luxurious. Since we were on our honeymoon everyone was insanely nice to us and made us feel very special. We were upgraded to a huge villa by the beach and got a free spa treatment which was the best I ever had(we spent the 2nd half of our honeymoon at Le Blanc in Cancun which in comparison to Banyan tree was awful for a honeymoon and the spa treatment was not very good). The spa packages are really expensive and I'm glad they gave it to us for free b/c I would not have done it otherwise but if you have trouble with your back and really like massages I would not skip it it was amazing my back has never felt so rested even places I didn't know hurt felt relieved. I will be getting another one on the return anniversary trip we're planning. At Saffron the thai restaurant they sat us by ourselves on the candlelit pier and did a special thai tradition at the end of the night for our honeymoon and brought us free desserts. I was wearing a dress and Saffron is outside so they brought a shawl out without me even saying anything about the weather. The food was really delicious and I would not skip this restaurant if you're there. It definitely felt out of this world and after seeing the room and eating here my husband thanked me for planning the most amazing honeymoon he could have imagined, and that was before we got back to our room where they had put a giant rose petal heart on the bed, set the mood lighting and music, and left a free bottle of wine and a sign that said happy honeymoon. The whole atmosphere there just exudes romance. There may have been other honeymooners there but we had no idea b/c they treated us like we were their VIPs. I had read all of the amazing Banyan Tree reviews and was still blown away by them. One of the people that served us on the beach (Manuel) for one reason or another never got a tip(1st day we couldnt find him when we were leaving, 2nd day we ran out of change and when we came back he'd left) yet everytime he would be really nice and it did not feel like their employees were just waiting for their tip to decide whether or not to keep being nice. As I mentioned earlier we went to Le Blanc for the 2nd half of the honeymoon based on tripadvisors reviews, but it totally burst my romantic honeymoon bubble going from Banyan Tree where everyone was so nice and made us feel so special. Just to compare when we got to Le Blanc and I told them we were on our honeymoon(which I had informed them of prior to the trip) instead of a congratulations they said \"we will have to verify that with our public relations manager.\" My fiancee and I will definitely be going back to Banyan Tree for our anniversary even if you can only afford 2 or 3 nights there just do it it is so amazing and special!", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cSimply magnificent\u201d", "Author": "marvento", "ReviewID": "UR83182669", "Content": "I would like to recognize this hotel as the most romantic hotel I have ever stayed at.

Thanks for that! My wife and I just spent 6 days at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba over the U.S. Labor Day holiday and I hope prospective travelers find my review helpful. Playa Del Carmen While Mayakoba is no doubt a beautiful complex unfortunately Playa, in fact the entire stretch from Cancun to Playa, feels like a high end (and not so high end in most cases) hotel strip mall with the Banyan Tree and the Rosewood being the Bergdorf and Barneys. If you are into all inclusive hotels then this is possibly your Mecca, but if you are looking for a charming and relatively remote Gulf/Caribbean paradise this is definitely NOT it. The Riviera Maya is overdeveloped and overcrowded and the beach is strewn with very large, unaesthetic hotels. The town of Playa may have been charming 20 years ago but now just resembles a cheesy tourist trap. It is unfortunate that the Mexican tourism authority has not been able to develop an otherwise beautiful area in a more protected and less commercial fashion. The Banyan Tree Property The entire Mayakoba complex has been meticulously constructed to preserve its ecological surroundings and the Banyan Tree is its star. The hotel is beautiful and dramatic in design while maintaining an element of subtlety and very effective touches of Asian architecture and design that let it blend seamlessly into the mangrove that is Mayakoba. Truly stellar. I must add that the Rosewood, which we visited for dinner one evening, is also very beautiful and perhaps more dramatic but in a contemporary, modern, South Beach sort of way. We preferred the design of the Banyan Tree. The Beach The sand is white and soft but that\u2019s all I liked about it. The beach is very narrow and it is quite rocky in some parts and has large pebbles in most other parts. You will feel them almost cutting into your feet within 10 yards of getting into the water. I love swimming in the ocean and if there are big waves I\u2019ll be body surfing for hours on end and the only reason I\u2019d probably even get in the pool is to get a drink from the swim up bar. I\u2019ll give even odds that you will rip your torso on large pebbles within 5 minutes of trying to body surf on this beach, if you were lucky enough to find a big wave. But it\u2019s a beach off of a very large reef and that\u2019s to be expected. What is not to be expected or accepted is how disgustingly dirty some parts of the beach are. We walked the entire stretch of the beach from the Grand Velas resort which lies to the right of Banyan Tree all the way to the Mandarin Oriental which is on the other end of the Mayakoba Beach. Here is what I thought was ridiculous: The hotels clean the beach area only immediately in front of their property, but walk another 5 or 10 yards to either side and it is littered, in fact clustered , with plastic bottles, metal cans and other garbage. Every beach segment in between each of the hotels is in the same condition. This was truly saddening. I find it downright hypocritical of the Banyan Tree and other such resorts that pride and market themselves as eco friendly green hotels to not even bother to clean the areas immediately contiguous to their own property. They spend large amounts of money to maintain their own properties but will not take on the relatively inexpensive exercise of keeping the entire beach clean. Shameful. I\u2019ve been swimming in the ocean since I was 5 yrs old and I can confidently say that I know beaches well. I would give the Mayakoba beach a 4/10 max. The Rooms Score. I don\u2019t think anything in the area compares to these rooms. We were in a courtyard suite and the pool, jacuzzi combo is unbeatable. You can do laps in this pool. Seriously. Clothing optional! It makes the plunge pool concept feel like you got downgraded. The rest of the room, lounge, bathroom is spectacular too. Very earthy and very aesthetic. Many other reviews discuss the rooms in detail so I\u2019ll keep it short. We loved it. Service They definitely make you feel warm and welcome from the minute you get there. Very courteous and always with a smile. Almost perfect on the surface but when you scratch below it the service is lacking in depth at times. This is best explained by the following service lapses we experienced. - We rented 2 bikes at $5 per bike per day for the duration of our stay. The hotel provides these at a cost. Both bikes had the seats set pretty low and we had to ask 4 times for them to be raised. 2 days later \u2026. Nothing! On the 3rd day they replaced my bike with another one \u2026. Which was broken. The chain was literally falling off the bike. They didn\u2019t even bother to check what they were replacing my bike with?? I complained again and they replaced it successfully this time. My wife\u2019s bike was never fixed or replaced and we just got tired of complaining about it. The rental fee is small so we didn\u2019t care but they never bothered to credit us for it. - We did a tennis lesson one evening and were dropped off in the hotel car at the courts which are part of the Fairmont. The phone at the tennis courts was not working and the courts are not attended so I asked the driver to pick us up in exactly one hour as we would have no way of getting in touch with the hotel (going over it 3 times to make sure I was clear). The courts are a good 15 \u2013 20 minute walk from the Banyan Tree and there are no other buildings anywhere near it. One and a half hours later there was no sign of the hotel car to pick us up and we walked back. It\u2019s a pleasant enough walk to be honest but not pleasant to know that they just forgot about us knowing we had no way of getting in touch with the hotel. I did complain about this to the front desk and they left us some strawberries and chocolates in our room that evening with an apology note. - The front desk recommended a Mexican restaurant in Playa del Carmen for us to try out. It was one of their top two picks. The food was poor at best and even the guacamole and margheritas were substandard. I\u2019m hard pressed to believe that restaurant could have been anywhere close to the best Mexican food in Playa. - The concierge was only slightly helpful when giving us diving options in the area. I think they called one dive shop that was closed on Saturday, the day we wanted to dive. I was able to find 3 other options online quite easily. Kinda half assed attempt on their part. - The package that we booked included a $150 room credit which did not appear in our check-in info for some reason. I had to bring it up with the front desk twice to have it rectified and I was assured that this was going to be included at the time of check out. Of course it was not credited on my final bill at check out and I had to remind them yet again. Basically we had to request for some things several times before they were addressed and we found this to be quite annoying. The Food The breakfast was marvelous and included in our room rate. They have a huge selection and it is truly top notch. Tamarind is mediocre and completely overpriced. Don\u2019t bother. Saffron is good Thai food but not amazing and again completely overpriced. I\u2019ve lived in NYC for the last 10 years and eat out very often at some of the best restaurants. Saffron would probably not get away charging those prices here. I find it in very poor taste when hotels charge ridiculous prices for mediocre food knowing that its guests are at least partially captive to the on property restaurants. The best meal we had down there was at the pool/beachside restaurant at the Rosewood, Punta Bonita. Very good Mexican fare and service at half the prices of the restaurants at the Banyan Tree. I strongly recommend dining there. The Spa I thought it was amazing. Possibly the best spa I have been to. The staff are just too polite! Everything the reviews say about how good the therapies are is absolutely true. Each massage session is conducted in a separate over water villa with a private toilet, steam and shower. Definitely take advantage of the rainforest experience, either on its own or as a combo package with one of the massage therapies. I did the 3 hour rainforest indulgence. I was so relaxed I think I fell asleep twice. My wife also thought it was very good but was not as impressed as I was. Maybe women just have higher spa standards. Overall Impression A very luxurious and beautiful resort but the shortcomings I\u2019ve mentioned above make this less than a perfect resort. If you claim to be among the best and charge accordingly, then you need to be held to a much higher standard. I will add that if the beach and location (Playa) were better (put another way: this hotel on a nice beach on an idyllic Caribbean island) I\u2019m pretty sure I would visit often. However, if you don\u2019t care much about the beach or the surrounding area outside the hotel then the Banyan Tree offers great value and enough to keep your mind and body occupied for several days without leaving the property.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cHospitality at it's finest...\u201d", "Author": "borabunny", "ReviewID": "UR76885694", "Content": "Hopefully, there will be more Banyan Trees in our future... we've been ruined. This was truly hospitality at it's finest. We stayed for 6 days at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba in August and were blown away by the staff, the place, and the amenities. From the moment we stepped out of the car, we knew that this place was special. Beautiful, airy, modern, romantic and luxe, we found our garden villa to me more than complete with it's private pool, swinging hammock, outdoor bathtub, view of the lagoon, and uber comfortable bed. We were steps from the fabulous breakfast at the Oriente (included in our reservation and generally one of the many highlights of our day) the quiet Reflections pool, and the top of the line spa. Whatever you do, try the rainforest walk!! When we were there, the spa was having a special- $20 per person for a 60 minute walk through. You go from rainforest shower, to sauna, to steam room, back to shower, to another sauna, to an ice rub... it was a bit like going through a human car wash, but so much fun! We took advantage of most of the complimentary activities, all of which I would highly recommend, including the Mexican cooking class, the tequila tasting, the wine and tapas tasting (generous portions!), and the one hour long eco tour by boat through the lagoons with a naturalist guide. We did take two day trips- one to Cozumel for snorkeling, and another to Coba, the Mayan ruins, which included zip-lining, rappelling and swimming in a cenote. We enjoyed all of the activities, but it was always a little bit wistful to leave the Banyan Tree! It was pretty amazing that most of the staff knew our names by the second day that we were there. From Zuleyka's friendly welcome and beautiful smile, to Alejandro, our waiter who bent over backwards to make our breakfasts phenomenal experiences every single day, to the attentiveness of Erik and Federico, the two managers at Tamarind and Oriente respectively, to Mariel's exquisite knowledge of tequilas, Rubi's gentle, sweet greeting as she watched me swim laps around the main pool before breakfast and Samuel's cheerful \"whistle while you work attitude\" as he transported us from one part of the resort to another, we felt like no stone had been left unturned. It wasn't just that these people are really good at what they do, it actually seemed like they loved it. In fact, Samuel actually told us that he will often take over the shifts of his colleagues because he loves work so much that he never wants to leave! I can't imagine never wanting to leave work. From all accounts, it does seem like the Banyan Tree Company treats it's employees well, providing good housing options, multiple meals a day, and training locals in the art of hospitality, so that they can develop skills and build careers. At the same time, we were impressed by all of the efforts the resort put into re-developing the surrounding nature preserve, educating it's staff in protecting the environment, and utilizing a green philosophy within the resort. On the night of our anniversary, we had a delicious dinner at Tamarind, and returned to our villa to find candles aglow, rose petals strewn across the bed to spell \"Happy Anniversary,\" and a bottle of Chilean wine chilling on ice!

We were there for 5 nights, which was a perfect get-away. We read all the reviews on TripAdvisor, and had high expectations. Banyan Tree certainly lived up to and surpassed the reviews we read online. Transportation - we used cancunshuttle.com for transportation from the airport to the hotel. There are many options on the website, but we selected the VIP private car service. We drove in a very comfortable Suburan SUV, they provided bottled water, and drove very safely. Not sure the VIP upgrade was necessary, but it cost around $165 round trip (not bad!). Take advantage of complimentary hotel activities - but sign up early. My husband took a tequila tasting class (I am pregnant so couldn't participate, but had a great time watching). We took a cooking class - and had a delicious lunch. We missed out on the wine and tapas, but heard it was great. Spa - AMAZING! I had 2 spa treatments and they were out of this world - even if your treatment is 60 minutes - they provide an additional half hour of relaxation (but they're actually massaging you; so it's equivalent to a 90 minute treatment)! My husband did the rainforest walk and LOVED it (he's not typically a spa-goer). Pools - besides our private pool (every villa has a private pool), we spent most of our time at the pool near the beach. My husband and I are \"pool\" people, but we like to be near the water - so this worked out perfectly for us. It's either a 10-15 minute walk from the lobby/breakfast, 5 minute golf car ride, 5 minute bike ride or 10 minute boat ride. After eating such large breakfasts every day - we opted to walk to the pool/beach. Lunch - almost every day we had lunch by the pool/beach. There were lots of options, but I really like the veggie burger and fries (had it 2 times). Dinners - we ate at all the Banyan Tree restaurants. They were all exceptional!! The food was fantastic and service was great. My husband and I didn't want to try Saffron (We like Thai food - but really wanted Mexican food since we were in Mexico). As a result - we saved Saffron for our last night, and we were both so happy we experienced it! We did the tasting menu - way too much food (only 1 person needs to get the tasting menu, the other person should order 1 entree). It looked like we barely touched a thing. I really wanted fajitas one night (at The Sands), and the chef was kind enough to make them for me (even though they weren't on the menu). Fantastic dinner! We also went to Rosewood one night, and had a delicious dinner at their casual pool restaurant (I think it's called Punta Bonita). For future travelers - this hotel is highly recommended!

We spent the first 4 days at Zoetry Paraiso de la Bonita in Puerto Morelos which is also incredibly nice and you can read our review of that hotel under that name. The good thing about spending time at both first class resorts is that it really allowed us to get good comparisons of both. When we arrived at the Banyan Tree, we were totally floored of how beautiful and certainly how different it was from our previous resort. Upon arriving, we were shown a quick tour of the lobby area and quickly taken to our spa courtyard villa in one of the buggy\u2019s, so basically we just had to sign a form in the lobby and that was the only check in process. We had seen man pictures of the rooms from the website/tripadvisor but it really didn\u2019t compare to the beautiful view upon entering our villa. Everything was perfect, the bedroom, the wonderful and luxurioius bathroom, walk in closets (plus for my wife), the outdoor private tub. The kicker was the villa pool/hot tub and the attached living room/media room. There is no way to describe the whole villa arrangement and the vibe of the whole villa and resort. It was so tranquil and Zen-like, we felt at peace the moment we arrived. The beds were probably the most comfortable we have ever slept on, really they were that comfortable. The breakfast buffet as many mention is incredibly delicious and totally first class. If you can\u2019t find something to satisfy you here, then you simply weren\u2019t meant to eat. The fruit, the pasteries, the eggs, the juices, the daily specialties, coffees and Mexican treats are unbelievably delicious and everything is super fresh. The only thing we didn\u2019t try was the sushi but everything else was delicious. In addition, you can ask the waiter or the cooks to make you anything you could imagine and very likely you will have it on your table within 10 minutes. The boat ride to the beach is simply beautiful and well worth it. While it takes 10 minutes longer than the Buggy to the beach, it is such a beautiful ride through the mangroves and such a special treat and part of the individuality of the resort, that I think you are missing a big part of the experience if you don\u2019t try at least the boat ride once. We took it every time we wanted to go to the beach. The beach area is great, you come right onto the Sands building which like all other buildings at this resort is very Zen, beautiful and clean. The workers tend to you right away and set you up with beach chairs or pool chairs, whatever you prefert. The waiters will come by during the day with small free samples of the food at the Sands restaurant and the food there was fantastic. The Vuelve La Vida cocktail was the best I have ever had and my wife tried the fish tacos and the club sandwich during our stay which were also delicious. The pool is also very nice but we mostly laid out by the beach, there is some very good snorkeling about 200 meters out from the beach, I took the resorts kayak and the lifeguard told me where to go and had a beautiful snorkel session out there. Walking on the beach, you can see the other resorts such as the Starwood, Gran Velas, etc which all look fabulous as well. The beach and the sands here are incredibly soft and beautiful so I feel no beach connoisseur will be disappointed. We also enjoyed one day at the upper pool by the lobby (forgot the name) which was really nice. This pool is much nicer/larger with plenty of little curves and alcoves to hang out in and also has a swim up bar. We were able to get chairs that are half in the pool and thoroughly enjoyed our day there, it was very quiet as only one other couple was there so we basically had this large area all to ourselves, with the bar tender and the pool help tending to us very nicely. At dinner, we ate at Saffron and really enjoyed our meal, it was probably the best Thai we have ever eaten and the wine was really nice that they served us. The dessert was also great and although we ate outside and got bit a little by the bugs at the end, the outdoor ambiance and romantic lighting was truly a joy. However, hands down the highlight of our meals and of our stay was our in Villa Mexican Barbeque which we arranged for to celebrate our 10th Anniversary. Although there was a slight hiccup from the maids that day (which Banyan Tree made up for by comping us a bottle of wine for dinner) the whole set up was amazing. The lights in the Villa, the metal barbeque (hard to describe) the table set up, the complimentary cocktails, and specifically our waiter who both cooked the 5 course meal and also served us was amazing. We literally did nothing except walk into our villa at the appointed time and sat to have one of the best and most romantic dinners we have ever enjoyed. I STRONGLY recommend getting this in- villa dining experience, you will not be disappointed. We also did a Spa session, my wife got the tender touch pregnancy massage and I had the Balinese massage, both in the same room and we both agreed it was the best massage we have ever had. The whole experience and set up was wonderful, but like other reviewers, I did miss a place to relax/hang out afterwards like other Spa\u2019s seem to have. I would think they would allow you to enjoy a hot tub or steam/sauna but they don\u2019t have this option, however we thoroughly enjoyed our spa and would definitely do it again. We went into Playa del Carmen twice but sadly this is not the same Playa we have learned to love. It has officially been over commercialized and the small little delicious restaurants and high class Mexican souvenirs/art stores have sadly been replaced by tourist traps and stores selling mostly tourist junk. While we still enjoyed ourselves, I fear the Playa of old is long gone and the commercial reaches of Cancun have crept in. Which actually made our stay in our Villa and at Banyan Tree even better, as we felt everytime we returned to our villa that we were returning to our sanctuary and used every bit of our villa. I cant say enough about the resort, the beauty, the villas. We were very satisfied with the Banyan Tree, will definatlely be recommending it to our friends and look forward to going back in the future.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London,England", "Title": "\u201cIt was so good, Ive booked to go back in December !\u201d", "Author": "Travelking997", "ReviewID": "UR76104339", "Content": "I don't need to repeat what the majority of reviews say, it really is as good as that.

Our package included four nights in a Garden Pool Villa (we were upgraded to a Courtyard Villa at check in), buffet breakfast (which would cost $63 US for two), bottle of vino and fresh fruit, and TWO 90-minute spa treatments. All taxes and gratuities included. We arranged for a VIP pick up from Cancunshutte.com at $135 US, in comparison to the BT pick up was $275. Only difference was BT used an Escalade, and CS used a Suburban. My feeling is that the BT should include the pick up or lower the price. One and Only in Los Cabos includes this. We were met immediately by happy Senor Freddy (our driver) after exiting the terminal, we ventured off for the 45 minute ride to the BT. The ride included cold water, and sodas..no cervezas. Gracias Freddy! The entrance to the Mayakoba is very sleek, and impressive. We were met at the entrance by Ana who supplied cold towels, and fresh juice. She explained the layout of the property, and escorted us to our room #212 for final check in. We were upgraded to a Courtyard Villa which was absolutely awesome. Two rooms (bedroom/living) separated by a gorgeous pool, and hot tub. The asian inspired motif was blended flawlessly with mexican accents. Truly beautiful. Two flat screen tv's, fully stocked bar, with mulitple mini-fridges, and wine fridge. Huge bathroom, with an outdoor tub (bathroom could use some better lighting, and a better hair dryer). Our included spa treatments (balinese and thai massages) were sooo good, we went back on our last day for another round. Two swedish massages will set you back about $400 with tax and gratuity. Our therapists Fon and Landa made our massage experience unforgettable four times! Gracias Ladies. The treatment rooms are separated into individual villas. A few caveats were: that there is no dedicated pool and outdoor lounge area, and the dressing rooms are a bit small, and not fully stocked with all of the usual spa essentials. It would have been awesome just to relax in an secluded outdoor area after the massage, oh well. We also did the Rainforest Tour for $20 US a piece. It was a very relaxing experience which I highly recommend. Thank you Jay for your excellent service. All of the dining choices at the BT are very good, with Saffron being our favorite. The buffet breakfast at Oriente is fully loaded with everything from bagels to sushi. Hot dishes changed everyday, and was mixed with mexican, and thai favorites. There was the usual staples of bacon and sausage and full pastry selection. I can't remember the last time I had grouper, and a tamale for breakfast. Yummy! Overall, a silver medal!...no one beats the breakfast buffet at the Shangi-La in Shanghai. Our best dining experience was at Saffron. Senor Sompong and his staff (Manuel, Tania et al.) introduced us to the Tamarind Margarita, and after the first sip we were hooked! We dined on the appetizer sampler, Garlic pepper Tiger Shrimp, and Curry beef short ribs....among other perfectly prepared Thai classics. Saffron has two great outdoor dock seating areas, and a smaller A/C indoor area. We choose to sit indoors on both occasions, because the mexican mosquitos are very fast and stealthy. If you dine outdoors, prepare yourself with ample bug spray before arriving. Senor Sompong from Thailand was a most wonderful host, very funny, and smart a true gentle soul. Sands was also a very good choice. Located at the pool/beach area it served up the mexican dinner menu from Oriente. Ivan and Jose were fantastic, to the point where they brought out the chef Daniel Camacho who had printed out some recipes for us just because we mentioned how wonderful our dish tasted. Try the tortilla soup, Shrimp aquadila, and lobster tails! Since it was low season, usually two of the four restaurants were open for dinner. Crazy as it sounds, I recommend making reservations for dinner since the BT gets a lot of visitors from the Fairmont, Rosewood, and MO who want to experience how the other half lives. Lol! Gracias Ivan for the Clase Azul! I recommend taking some of the free classes offered by the BT. Tequila tasting, wine/appetizer tastings, and variety of cooking classes will enhance your BT experience. We rented a car for a short day trip to Tulum which was very nice. Hertz will deliver your car from the Fairmont, small car was $60 bucks for the day. **IMO, an added nice touch would be for the doormen to offer you cold bottled water if your leaving for a day trip. Thank you Guadalupe at the front desk for hooking up our car. The BT Mayakoba is a sprawling resort, although they offer bikes we opted for the golf cart transportation which was fast and efficient (you are on vacation). Ask for Francisco to pick you up, he is just full of life and laughter. He made our shorts jaunts around the property most memorable. The beach was very nice, water calm and soft sand. An addition to the beach service could be supplying cold bottled water immediately on arrival. Overall, I give the BT Mayakoba a well deserved five star rating. We always felt well attended too in a very genuine way. I can't tell you how many times we were asked is \"everything ok?\" \"can I get something for you?\" Our short stay was wonderful initiation to the Banyan Tree brand, and we look forward to returning very soon.

It actually felt quite intimate and almost private (while being huge), at most we saw another family of four there, mot of the time it was us and some other couple at the other end of the pool. Once of the reasons we came to the pool was the excellent pool bar. Armando, I believe, was the name of the bartender. We ended up talking to him quite a bit, he learned what we liked and we would just ask him to make something nice, not to be ever disappointed. Restaurants are of good quality but that is what you would expect, we were not blown away but did enjoy them, especially the Thai one. We participated in the cooking classes and we loved it. (again the one in Saffron was more interesting), then we were served the food we cooked :) the only downside of the hotel is that the beach is not great, it is very rock and I did not spend much time in the ocean, like I normally do.

My wife and I typically stay at Marriott and Hilton with an occasional splurge at Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton. They all live up to their reputation but THIS was amazing. Banyan Tree is new to the Western Hemisphere with two new resorts in Mexico. We stayed at the Mayakoba, south of Cancun (some big names have stayed there). We spent the big bucks on transportation between the airport and hotel as we aren\u2019t comfortable with all the unsolicited \u201cservice\u201d usually forced upon tourists at the airport. Best to say, \u201cNo gracias\u201d unless you have fun with that stuff. Anyway, air conditioned luxury in a Cadillac Escalade with bottled water, thick cool washcloths, and a very professional driver to the Banyan Tree. Upon arrival we were greeted by Fernanda (the bags simply disappeared to our villa) who escorted us to the outdoor reception area with a mini tour along the way. After we sat down, she disappeared briefly, returning with more refreshing washcloths and a very refreshing and healthy green fruit juice concoction. After completing check in, she gave us a more extensive tour (we wanted that) which concluded with us boarding an almost silent electric motor boat (with a canopy) for the 15 minute strolling cruise to the beach area where our villa was located (there is also buggy service which is much faster). Bottled water, fresh fruit and more cool washcloths were supplied on the boat. Upon arrival we were greeted by a fruity adult beverage and Sarah, the very warm and friendly hostess in charge of the beach area. Our spa pool villa was a very short walk from the dock and Fernanda escorted us, giving us a tour which included how to utilize everything. (See the website for floor plans and photos of the villas.) Daily breakfast was an experience in itself. The food was incredible and the staff outstanding. With each passing day, we looked forward to the familiar faces each morning. Across the board I have not experienced a more professional and sincerely friendly staff. Buggy service (golf carts) between the beach villas and the main resort was always prompt. The resort restaurants were outstanding with Saffron especially excelling in service as well as the exquisite Chef\u2019s creations at Tamarind. The gals at the open air La Copa Bar were great to interact with and The Sands (beach front restaurant and bar) was very convenient to our villa with good food, drinks, and great hospitality. A signature event at the Banyan Tree is the Rain Forest Spa and exceptional graciousness of the massage experts from Thailand. I don\u2019t want to spoil the effect by giving away the little details, but from reception to conclusion, you\u2019d be amiss to not take advantage of this unique Thai experience. The main swimming pool was very nice. Armando, the bar tender was fun and offered us an authentic Mexican cocktail not on the menu, El Toro (start with a chili rimmed glass, no salt\u2026). The pool service was exceptional, as the friendly attendant set up our lounges and kept us supplied with bottled water and cool refreshing washcloths, scented with mint. Incredible. I wish I could remember the names of so many others that took such good care of us; the buggy drivers, restaurant staff, housekeeping, bar tenders\u2026the management has mastered the art of hiring. There was an especially unique experience at La Copa Bar when I was having trouble lighting a premium hand rolled cigar because of the wind. Out of no-where, a splendid Mexican Caballero appeared, rugged and donned in black trousers with silver studs down the legs (right out of a Clint Eastwood western, the only thing missing was a trumpet and Spanish guitar).

As has already been mentioned in many prior reviews, this hotel is outstanding overall. The inside of Courtyard Villa was beautiful as was the private pool. The friendliness and warmth of the staff working at this hotel is unparalleled. In particular, Cesar at Oriente, Sarah at the Beach club, and Marian at reception were outstanding. I have never met a nicer hotel staff at the premiere hotels in which I have stayed. Only have two complaints: The first involves the many lizards seen throughout the hotel. We have traveled to tropical regions many times before and have seen many lizards on the grounds of hotels. However, never have we seen so many lizards INSIDE our bedroom. We found 9 lizards in our bedroom and courtyard villa. The sizes ranged from 4inches to over half a foot long. Given that we paid $800 per night to stay in this hotel, this is not acceptable. Again, we have stayed at other elite hotels such as One and Only, other Rosewoods, Fairmont, etc, in locations where lizards are endemic. However, never have we seen lizards INSIDE the rooms. We ended up repacking all our belongings and moving to a different Courtyard villa after finding 3 lizards in the first 36hrs. of our stay. The second room was pre-sprayed with \"lizard deterrent\" prior to us moving but had the same problem. We found another 6 lizards. One of them even fell off the ceiling onto my wife's head. My 2.5yr old son who was sleeping on a cot on the floor had nightmares of lizards crawling on his bed (one of them nearly did). Because of these experiences, both were afraid to spend time much time in our courtyard villa and bedroom -- definitely a huge waste. He ended up being afraid of sleeping in his cot and spent most nights sleeping with us. Again, this is not acceptable for a hotel that charges this amount. To compensate us for this, we were were given just a $40 discount off a massage at the Spa -- somewhat sad given the small proportional value compared to the $800 per night rate. Lastly, the food at this hotel is very good but not great. The highlight of the food is the Oriente buffet breakfast. We ate at all the restaurants at the hotel and were not particularly impressed. We ended up eating 3 dinners at the Rosewood Mayakoba which has better food. As an aside, the service provided by the In-Villa dining is superb. Overall, the hotel appearance, ambiance, gracious and friendly staff, and service was great. However, because of the experience with the lizards I must warn all those who are not in-touch with nature to consider this prior to booking. One might argue that our experience is an anomaly, but we did have this experience in two different villas, one of which was pre-sprayed with deterrent.

While I can\u2019t speak to price / value, I did want to share my comments and photos, as this place really left an impression. The two bedroom villa was incredible. A private pool and Jacuzzi, a separate relaxation hut and space (that we used for drink preparation), the most unbelievably beautiful bathrooms you\u2019ll ever see, and tasteful modern furnishings. The beds / pillows (with pillow menu) were extremely comfortable, and with the fantastic air conditioning, we had a sound night\u2019s sleep. The accommodations are true 5-star.

If you have any doubts about staying here like I did, don't worry it WILL live up to your expectations. The pictures on their website and Tripadvisor really do it no justice - the entire experience from the luxuriousness of the property, to the ultra attentive staff and the serene nature of the environment make for an amazing getaway. My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights at the Banyan Tree and we were so relaxed by the time we left that we felt like we had been there for days. Yes, it is VERY expensive, but it is worth it. I have stayed at many luxury collection hotels around the world and am so glad to have this one so close to home (NYC). Although there were a few hiccups along the way none of it would deter us from coming again. We went over Memorial Day Weekend which was perfect because it was low season without the hurricanes and few mosquitos - we felt like we had the place to ourselves. Checkin - our hostess Mariana greeted us with some juice, cold towels and flowers. She sat us down at the lobby, gave us an opportunity to relax while she checked to see if our villa was ready. We arrived a few hours before checkin but our villa was ready within 20 minutes. Villa - We had a Courtyard villa (#204) which was HUGE. One building housed the bedroom, the bathroom with his and hers sinks, the outdoor bath, a large rainshower that overlooked the outdoor bath and a walk in closet. In response to one of the other reviewer's comments about the air conditioner - i am particularly sensitive to cold and it was not a problem. The best part of the villa was the ability to just open the door and jump into your own pool. The pool was not heated but at 85 degrees outside, mother nature took care of that. Next to the pool was a hot jacuzzi, a hammock and a pool bed. The way the villas are laid out ensured privacy - no one can look into your villa or pool area and there is a privacy sign outside to let the staff know when you don't want to be disturbed. The turn down service was really exceptionally. The staff draws all of the curtains, cleans up any mess you have (they even folded our dirty clothes), sets the music and lightening to make for a restful and romantic return. Bikes (problem) - The beach is a bit far away from the villas but we are big bikers and rented a bike to get us to the beach which was a great experience. One thing we would recommend is better signs for the bike path to the beach. We got lost initially and the second time we had an aggravated encounter with a golfer who said we were not suppose to be on the path. This could have been avoided by clearer signs of which paths to take particularly at intersections. If you are not a biker, they have a boat and buggy that can take you to the beach. Beach and Pool - The beach was amazing. The sand was extremely soft, no rocks and the Gulf water was warm. When you arrive at the beach, the staff sets up your beach chairs and they come by every so often to see if you want anything. The only problem that I had was that I had to ask for water 3 times before someone got it for me which was a small annoyance given how perfect the rest of the service was. We did not use the pools because we had one in our own villa but there are 2 pools - one heated and one unheated. Food - The breakfast buffet at the Oriente had alot of wonderful healthy options. I would have liked to see more savory options because there were a ton of sweets. We had lunch and one dinner at Sands (the menus were different) - they serve traditional Mexican food which was very good. We also had dinner at Saffron which was amazing. The restaurant is the most romantic restaurant that I have ever been to and I HIGHLY recommend going there. We had the 7 course meal which was $65 a person - definitely worth it to try all of their signature dishes. ALSO we had a special lemongrass ice tea which was delicious and refreshing particularly with spicy food - DEFINITELY ask them to make it. Eco Tour - Everyday at 11am they have an eco tour by boat where they take you to see a ton of animals. It also passed by the Rosewood and Fairmont and there is no question that the Banyan is nicer. Service - Overall the service was impeccable. The staff greeted you wherever you went. I had a minor spider bite accident and they even sent a get well dessert dish to my villa and Mariana asked how I was doing every day.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cMose exquisite AND relaxing vacation we've ever been on.\u201d", "Author": "foxycoxy8", "ReviewID": "UR65438633", "Content": "We can't say enough about this resort. Absolutely everything was wonderful. The price to stay here is definitely out of our normal price range, but we splurged and it was well worth it. The resort is beautiful, and the food is spectacular, but the STAFF is actually the best part. We've never experienced anything like it. They are so incredibly nice - they literally wait on you hand and foot and seem very happy to do so - to the point that it's almost embarrassing. We actually had an out of the ordinary thing happen to us while we were there. I had a biking accident that required me to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. It was a whirlwind of a night, but the staff was amazing. Pedro, the head of food services, drove us back to our villa and stayed with us until the ambulance came. Then he, along with our host Eduardo (sorry if I misspelled the name!), came to the hospital! And Eduardo stayed the whole time, which was 3-4 hours...way past the end of his shift. He personal drove us back to the villa, and even stopped at a pharmacy on the way home to help my husband get my prescriptions. When we arrived back at the villa around midnight, Pedro had dinner waiting for us there since we hadn't been able to eat beforehand. There was also a gorgeous bouquet of flowers with a card signed by a fair amount of the staff. The rest of the week many of the staff members checked in on me, especially Eduardo and Pedro. We still can't believe the staff did so much for us. They are all truly wonderful people, and we would gladly give them our business time and time again. Also, the resort really is gorgeous, and there weren't many people there at all, so it was very private. We actually spent a lot of time at our villa, since it was so nice and we had a pool and hot tub all to ourselves, but the \"public\" pools and beach were great as well. The beach was especially nice (and the pool right by it) because wait staff come by sometimes with little hors d'oeuvres and drinks compliments of the chef (there is a restaurant right there). The resort offers a free Eco Tour a couple of times a week, and we would highly recommend that if you are at all into nature. I think it's about an hour long, and we saw all kinds of animal life, exotic birds up close, etc. It was great! The only slightly negative thing I could say is that the cab ride to go into Play del Carmen is a little high. I think it was $17 plus tip each way, so we only went into town a couple of nights.

It was quiet, intimate, private and romantic. This resort is for those who want the privacy of staying in a private vacation villa isolated from neighbors but also want the benefits of having hotel amenities to take advantage of. We booked a Spa Pool Villa which is an incredible choice for couples. The villa is outfitted with more romantic options than you could possibly expect. we never left to make use of any of the common areas because we felt like we were in a private peice of paradise. This hotel pays attention to a lot of details. the staff ratio to guests is very high and all staff express a warmth and serenity when thye greet and communicate with you. villa was beautifully maintained, housekeeping was FANTASTIC and kept the exterior and interior immaculate. breakfast was included with our package and was at the Oriente restaurant. Terrific and fresh choices. More of a brunch rather than just breakfast items. Food was always at temp which I have rarely run into at buffets in other resorts(even very expensive ones). lots of fruit, yogurt and healthy options as well as indulgent options. gym was outfitted VERY well. small, but there was never an issue getting on equipment that you wanted. they even left fruit, water and these fantastic homemade granola bars that i became addicted to. As far as food went, I would not say that the restaurants were the best i've ever been to.I thought the food didnt quite stand up to the standard of the rest of the resort with the exception of Saffron which was by far and away the best Thai food I have ever had. We love thai food. I had asked the waiter if they had my favorite thai dish as i didnt see it on the menu, and even though we ordered the tasting menu he had spoken to the chef and it arrived with our main courses. The chef even took the time to spend almost half an hour with us at our table discussig thai cuisine and how to make our favorite dishes. He gave us his card in case i had more questions. Exceptional food and service that evening!! Tamarind was a real let down for us. Food was average and lacking in taste. Service was still very good, and that is a common theme everywhere in the resort. Room service was hit and miss. Never order a salad because the two times I did it arrived so soggy it was inedible. (caesar salad and cobb salad) We took a taxi into Playa Del Carmen and ate in town 4 nights and had a little entertainemnt and some very nice meals. surprisingly the best restaurants on 5th ave are the italian ones. If you get the spa pool villa, make sure you take advantage of the top floor of your villa and have the spa service done invilla. Fantastic experience!! Great massages!! I have only one complaint about the entire resort and it unfortunately came right at check in. Our villa was not ready when we arrived which was slightly before the posted check in time, which kind of stinks when you are that tired after a long flight but we were escorted down to the beach restaurant where we had lunch and waited for them to tell us it was ready. About 90mins later we were told it was ready and a resort host accompanied us to the villa. As we were walking through with her I immediately started to notice that it didnt seem like the pictures I had seen on the virtual tour I had done. then when we sat down to sign the check in sheet, my husband had gone up to look at the spa level and he said that it was just a bedroom with two single beds. The check in sheet and the resort host then said we had been \"upgraded to a 2 bedroom villa\" . This was ridiculous and had my blood pressure going through the roof!! Thsi is not what I had booked or paid for. I dont know about you but two single beds is NOT an upgrade for a couple. we specifically had booked for the spa pool villa so that we could take advantage of the shaded sitting area upstairs and the in villa spa services. at first the host said that no spa pool villas were available and then I think she must have noticed the steam coming out of my ears because she picked up the phone and called someone. we were told it would take a few hours but that we could be moved either in the morning or a few hours later. I opted for that day, because i didnt want to unpack, repack in the morning and then unpack again. when we did get into the villa we were EXHAUSTED and i must say that experience did taint the beginning of what was upposed to be a dream holiday. The resort offered us a trip through the rain forest as an apology which is varying differnt degree pools and water therapy. we never did use it. I think it would have been a nicer touch to send some champage and dessert or something to that effect. we are not big on scheduling things on holidays. I truly wish this had not happened because i could then have given this resort a PERFECT 10.

However, upon arrival, I soon realized that the hotel would only exceed our expectations. Having stayed at high end resorts like One and Only Palmilla, Four Seasons, and the Peninsula, I can only say that the service at this hotel matched if not exceeded all of my previous hotel experiences. There was not enough there that the friendly staff could not do for you or would not do for you. The spa was the best spa experience I have ever had to date. Literally, I could go on and on....but I don't want to spoil any surprises. Like others have mentioned on this forum, if you are considering going....GO!!! Mayakoba is a wonderful complex to stay in but after seeing the other hotels and eating at the Rosewood, I am happy we stayed at the Banyan Tree as truly nothing else compares. We even checked on the Mandarin Oriental and we were not impressed. The food was delicious too and we found many unique choices were at Tamarind and Saffron. The room had amazing amenities. Throughout the entire trip we felt truly relaxed and at peace. The only problem was on the last two days. It breaks my heart to say anything negative about my beloved Banyan Tree but I am only posting this as a suggestion to future travelers to consider as well as the hotel management to be aware of these issues. On the last two days a large business group of rather rowdy people infiltrated the hotel. I realize that as a hotel the Banyan Tree has to keep rooms filled to generate business, but when a large amount of people are there (approx 30 or more) that KNOW ONE ANOTHER it takes away from the atmosphere that the staff work so hard to create. On our last full day at the beach club pool, we had to leave the area as the group started drinking and being loud and obnoxious. And why wouldn't they be....they were staying at a hotel they would probably never stay at except for the fact that the business was footing the bill or at least a portion of the bill. We moved to the \"quiet\" pool near the hotel and then had to leave that area eventually as well once the group moved in on that area. At least we could take refuge in our private pool at the villa. At breakfast, the usually over attentive servers were spread thin as this large group all came to breakfast at once. Our drinks came late and were never refilled until we flagged someone down. I won't let these last two days shadow over the whole experience as it truly was unforgettable. However, you may want to make sure a large group isn't coming through when you book or the hotel should be a little more cautious about what type of groups they let in especially when others are paying a lot to come there. I have never experienced this \"group\" problem at other high end hotels and I don't think the Banyan Tree would want this to tarnish their well deserved reputation. My husband and I would go again in a heartbeat. We are even considering to try the property in Acapulco. You should RUN to this hotel.....

Before I get to the suggestions I would like to point out the truly wonderful aspects of the resort: Terrific villas with full private swimming pools and with the courtyard villa like we had, an outdoor jacuzzi. Marvelous breakfast buffet with everything imaginable. Excellent food all around - we ate at the Tamarind and Saffron. Great ecological boat tour - very interesting and informative. Like being on the Amazon, but right at the resort. Perfect spa - very atmospheric and great treatments. Well attended at beach with assistance in setting up beach chairs and gettng occasional snacks. Enjoyable set up with the other two resorts at Mayakoba where each would provide transportation to any resort you would like to explore. Particularly enjoyed the Rosewood's Casa Del Lago restaurant which had a chef from Barcelona and great food. Friendly staff at the Banyan Tree. Certain individuals really stood out - Chaba, a therapist at the Spa; Pedro the general restaurant manager; and Federico, the manager of the Oriente restaurant. Now the suggestions: The resort has a mosquito problem at night (at least during the time we were there). We attempted to eat at the Tamarind Restaurant which has really good food, but were attacked by an army of mosquitos. Although the staff provided bug spray, it was of little consequence. The meal would have been a total disaster except for the intervention of Pedro, the restaurant manager, who moved us inside the air-conditioned Oriente to enjoy our entrees and who also gave us a complimentary dessert. For some odd reason, the Banyan Tree had closed its air-conditioned restaurant Oriente for dinner in favor of two outdoor restaurants, Tamarind and the Sands. Would strongly recommend that the Banyan Tree enclose the Tamarind to keep the mosquitos out or move the Tamarind to the Oriente which is already air-conditioned. We returned to the Casa Del Lago at the Rosewood not only for the food but because it had air-conditioning. Another recommendation has to do with the service at the breakfast. Service is excellent, but some staff tend to try much too hard to strike up conversations with you while you are talking to your spouse. They need to look at body language and sometimes refrain from talking. Lastly, a minor recommendation. Since the resort is sprawling, the buggies should be at your beck and call almost immediately. Generally they were, but on our first night we waited 40 minutes - not a good start to our vacation.

We never post reviews on any site, but this trip was so unforgettable, that we wanted to share our experience. 1) Service: The best and most attentive service we have ever experienced(and we have stayed in some of the nicest hotels/resorts in the world). From the moment we arrived, my wife and I felt as if we were the only people at the resort. We had a personal resort host(Fernanda, who was fantastic), who took care of all our needs, as well as showing us around. 2) Villas- We stayed in a Courtyard Pool Villa, which was immaculate, beautiful, enormous, etc. I could not believe how gorgeous the villas were, as well as the wonderful plunge pool that overlooked the lagoons of Mayakoba. Housekeeping was superb. I love the lounge area of the Villa as well. 3) Food-Breakfast Buffet is incredible. The food and service were great-Fernando was a great manager. Enough said. Dinner was wonderful at Saffron. However, a very special mention needs to be made about TAMARIND, which the staff at the resort dubbed as their fine-dining, \"eclectic\" restaurant. Because of the description, my wife and I almost didn't go, because eclectic signifies strange/different to us. However, because we decided to bail on dinner at the Rosewood(beautiful, but not nearly as great of a property in our opinion), we walked into Tamarind on a whim...WERE WE GLAD WE DID. The service and food were unsurpassed...better than any dining experience we've had anywhere-we are from New York, and Tamarind rivals some of the finest NYC restaurants we've been to. The whole staff, fantastic menu were unforgettable. It was so good, we went back the next night! Special mention to Manuel and Christian, who made us feel so welcome. 4)Grounds/Facilities/Spa: Grounds are immaculate and beautiful. Exquisitely maintained. Spa is second-to-none. You must visit and have an Island Dew massage. Pools were nice, but almost no need because of plunge pools. Still, if you feel the need with kids to go, the pools were lovely. Especially the swim-up bars. If going to the beach, make sure you take the boat from the main part of the resort to the beach area on the lagoon. What a peaceful, wonderful experience.

It took me days to choose between Banyan Tree, Rosewood and Esencia, eventually I opted for Banyan Tree purely based on the better reviews on tripadvisor. Mayakoba is a private estate by the beach about 5-6 kms before Playa del Carmen. When we first arrived, we were greeted at the entrance by the lovely Miss Colina who was our resort host, she gave us welcome drinks and a bracelet made out of some tropical fruits. As soon as we stepped foot into the place we knew that it was not going to disappoint. After a mini tour of the property we took a buggy to the villa, we were upgraded to a courtyard view villa since I'm a leaders club member. The villa was beautiful, the layout, the bathroom, the pool, the pavilion(lounge) area that was seperate from the bedroom, the outdoor bath tub and the jacuzzi, they were all perfect. What makes this hotel perfect is not just the incredible villas, the staff are unbelievably professional and kind and attentive, in the 6 days we were there we never came across a single staff member who didn't do their job perfectly. Housekeeping was amazing, the reception and concierge staff were great (Miss Fernanda and Zuleyka and our host Coleena are a few of the amazing ones I remember). The main pool is very dead but the one at the Beach club is busier and also nicer but it's quite small so if you're not a beach person, go to the main pool which is located right at the front of the property. The spa is also out of this world, the treatments are very good and the layout is also really nice. Miss Yo and Miss Dayana were both amazing masseurs. We rented bicycles to get to and back from the beach as it was about a 20 minute walk from our villa, I recommend that you do that. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants except for the Oriente for breakfast and in-room dining, both were fantastic. The golf course also looked beautiful but we didn't use it. If you're looking to get away from the world, then this is your place. You feel so relaxed and everything runs so smoothly that you really feel like you're in a different planet! We went to Banyan Tree to relax after 4 days at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun (also fantastic and i will write a review about that too). Playa del Carmen is a beautiful town, it's very cultured compared to Cancun and there are many good retaurants and bars are based around 5th Avenue. I'm a frequent traveller and have stayed in many good hotels but this one was one of the ones that stood out, It reminded me of the Four Seasons Jimbaran in Bali but it was better overall. I highly highly recommend this beautiful property.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sjbroadway", "Title": "\u201cBOOK NOW!!

The pictures on the website are exactly what you get! And the service from the second you drive into the resort is comparable to service you get at high end hotels in the USA (ie Ritz, Wynn Encore, Waldorf, W, etc) which after traveling Mexico, I know is hard to find, even when it's advertised...... GREETING- Smooth, Relaxing, Great! ROOM- Cannot say enough! HUGE room with doors that open on all sides for views of the Lagoon or the Pool, your PRIVATE pool that you can dangle your feet in from the Bedroom, while sipping a Margarita...unheard of. Bathroom great! LARGE, HUGE walk in closet! and outdoor soaking tub with gorgeous stone wall fitted with candles. Like nothing I've ever seen before! BEACH- Great! People always complain about beach conditions etc as if it is the hotels fault, but that's mother nature kids! The beach here is beautiful and the service is amazing. Tell them where you want to sit and they set up beach chairs and towels for you , then bring over iced water and cold towels. Throughout the day, they would bring amuse-bouches out that were refreshing!!!!!! FOOD- Breakfast buffet....Amazing! All restaurants were good, expensive, but good. Saffron is the best, sitting out over lagoon cannot be beat! We got bikes to get to and from the beach and it was great. A quick 5 minute ride over the bridge, through a jungle and there you are....in paradise at the beach! The grounds are amazing, clean, well kept, modern. Absolutely unbelievable!!!!!

You'll love BTM!\u201d", "Author": "metadata", "ReviewID": "UR60441536", "Content": "Villas: A We stayed in a Courtyard Villa. I would recommend this as the minimum room category for anyone staying at BTM during the colder winter months. The villa pools are not heated and were too cold for swimming except for a brave and quick dip in the water, so the hot tub was a nice addition. There are no hot tubs in the base category room, the Garden Villa. The other way this room differs from the Garden Villa is the addition of the pavilion. We enjoyed having this space for being able to quietly make coffee in the morning, as I tend to wake up earlier than my husband. It was also useful for in-villa dining, because the messy dishes were not left in your bedroom area. Food: B+ The breakfast buffet is amazing, and definitely on par with the one at the Ritz in Cancun. It's much larger than the buffet at the Rosewood Mayakoba, in terms of sheer quantity of selection. Other than breakfast at Oriente, we only ate at lunch and dinner at Sands, Saffron, or via in-villa dining. All of those places have plenty of vegetarian options, and I never got bored with the food even though we stayed for eight days. Our main challenge in terms of food was that dinner options seemed too fussy and formal for us. We were typically exhausted after a full day in the sun and we didn't feel like sitting through a multi-course fine dining experience. We often wished that we could just order a light meal or snack at the lobby bar. Also, I know it's Mexico (and not Italy), but the pizza needs to be reconsidered. It quite honestly looked and tasted like Lean Cuisine pizza. The Ritz in Cancun has amazing wood fired pizzas, and although that might not be possible in the BTM kitchens, there is certainly some room for improvement. Service: A Overall the service was great and what you would expect, although nobody brought us dry towels or some of the other things that I have read here. As much as I would like anticipation of my needs, I certainly don't expect it. If a five star resort can more or less offer me what I want, when I want (within reason), then I am happy. If I could make the service even better, I would do so by adding butler service to the villas so that there was one person to contact for any request. We sometimes didn't take advantage of the activities at the hotel because it was unclear who to ask or how to go about making a reservation - and the sun was shining, and the beach was calling! Quiet/Seclusion: C- Yikes! I am barely exaggerating when I tell you that children under the age of three outnumbered adult guests at the resort. Yes, I understand that we visited during a time when it was likely to be spring break somewhere. What was surprising to me was the number of infants and toddlers. One late afternoon when we were at the main pool (the only one that was heated), I looked over at the swim up bar and counted nine kids. I said to my husband, \"Look, it's Happy Hour for the under three feet tall crowd!\" Even when we spent the day at our villa pool we could hear children yelling and playing in nearby villas. And in case you were wondering, yes there were also kids in the beach pool. Breakfast was especially bad with kids running around, crying, yelling, and even one day - running through the restaurant with silverware in their hands! We often felt like we had to eat as fast as possible, because it was not a relaxing environment. Also, the one evening that we went to Saffron (which we adore - order a Ginger Lagoon - yum!) a table was seated near us with two kids young enough to need high chairs. For me, that was liking taking a baby to dinner at Top of the Hub, or whatever your town's \"go to\" romantic dining establishment might be. I know that kids will be kids and I do love kids, but I was just a little surprised at the sheer number of them especially since the majority of them were under the age of three, couldn't swim, and were too young to ever be able to remember that they had vacationed in Mexico. I left wishing that Disney would open a five star resort so that these families would have somewhere age appropriate to vacation! Summary As you might be able to infer from this review we're not billionaires and we don't have kids. We love traveling and staying in five star resorts, especially beach destinations. We're 30-somethings that work hard and when we're on vacation we like to relax, eat delicious food, and experience excellent service. BTM fits our criteria perfectly, but I think we may have stayed there during an off week. I would return to this resort, but probably only if we were traveling with a group of friends. If I was looking for a more quiet and intimate vacation I would probably choose a different resort. Of course, this is based only on my experience and it seems that our stay here was not typical.

On the top floor we had our smallish private pool, overlooking the golf course and a big lounging bed for sunbathing. Service could not have been friendlier, all the staff tried incredibly hard to please and succeeded almost all the time. The buffet breakfast was outstanding, perhaps the best I have ever had at a hotel, and the food at the 4 restaurants we tried was very good, albeit pretty fully priced.

Lots more kids than I would have thought for a Banyan Tree which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. But given that every villa has a pool and there is plenty of privacy to be had on the beach, if kids are not your thing you can get away from them. Also the Tamarind restaurant is kid free for dinner. Book the transportation from the airport through the hotel. Seamless and professional. By far the biggest impression that my wife and I were left with was the genuine kindness of the staff. Everyone from maids to maintenance to waitstaff to pool attendants always had a smile and a yes to any request. From a baby gate to guard the stairs of the villa to a frying pan to warm the baby's food and everything in between. The Banyan Tree training must be amazing because I have never seen a staff this well trained and responsive in the Caribbean. Only thing even close is the Four Seasons in Costa Rica. Food was consistently excellent. The Saffron thai restauraunt one of the best meals I can remember in a stunning outdoor setting. Imagine the bugs could get bad in summer so book one of the few inside tables in advance if bugs arent your thing. The beach restauraunt had a very interesting lunch menu and the Oriente breakfast buffet is fabulous with everything you could want for breakfast and then some very interesting mexican and thai additions. Tamarind for dinner was eclectic as advertised but overall a winner. I would eat at Saffron every night though. Management was ever present and always stopping by to make sure everything was ok. Only real beef I have with the whole stay is the 3 bed room villa. Like others have said there is a mustiness to the villa that may come from the limestone in the area but it is a nuisance that takes away from the experience. Also, the layout of the villa with all three bedrooms clustered downstairs makes it tough to have any privacy. Plus steep stairs are not very kid friendly and my pregnant wife struggled with them. No bathroom on the middle family room level is weird too. Upstairs pool area smaller than I imagined but my sister really enjoyed the privacy. Overall I think the 3 story villa is a good family option but you dont get the full benefit of the open pool centered layout of the other villas. Biking around the property was fun but my bike was a bit beat up and could have used a tune up. I am sure if I had said something another bike would have been there in minutes. Golf course was excellent. Only played front nine but conditioning was immaculate which again is very unusual for courses outside of the states. My wife and sister raved about the spa. Apparently is set up without a central locker room so the whole experience is very private and intimate with no waiting around naked in a robe waiting for your name to be called. Both said their treatments and overall spa experience were best they have had. Beach club is a bit of a ride from the main property but you get used to it. Buggies/carts are the price you pay at properties that dont just build vertically. Pool at beach small (as is main pool) but given that every room has its own pool it was never a problem getting a chair or service of any type. Great loungers at pool and on beach as comfortable as a bed. I walked down the beach and felt sorry for the folks at the Fairmont on crappy unpadded beach chairs. Boat ride was cool. Driver very kind to my infant daughter and had her smiling the whole way. No one ever on the boat so it is like a private little cruise and the drivers will take you to their spots for wildlife if you request. Saw a baby croc that was pretty cool.

The service was fantastic and anything you asked for they made happen, we had a few things we requested and at one point we had 5 staff at the villa busy meeting our demands - something that I had never seen at any resort before, they really do want to make your stay as fantastic as possible and there is no shortage of staff. On arrival we changed villas because we wanted a villa that had the sun later in the day, they either have villas that are sunrise or sunset, the villa we moved to 306 was a corner plot and was massive and really private you are not over-looked at all, which again is unheard at a resort and we had the sun until 4pm every day, moving villas wasn\u2019t a problem for the staff at all they wanted us to be happy. We hired bikes to get around as it was fun, but you don't need to you can easily walk or call up for the buggy service which we never waited more than 5 minutes for. The Beach club and pool is smaller than expected but perfect, the service was fantastic and the food good - although I would say that by the time they add 15% service charge and tax it is an expensive place to eat and drink - but then all resorts usually are but everything we got was of a very high standard and waiting time was minimum. The in-villa dining was something else and they made a real effort, all food was delivered within 30 minutes and again everything was hot and to a high standard. The breakfast was out of this world from fresh fruit to local Mexican, to American the choice is yours. I would say that this resort isn't the place to go if you like spending all your time at the beach, you pay the for money for the private pool and villa, unless you book a villa that is on the beach which is slightly less private but do have fantastic views of the sea and is a 30 second walk to the beach. The resort had a nice mixture of couples and families neither dominated the resort which made it a nice environment. I would recommend this hotel to couples and families something that I haven't done before because I usually stay clear of any resort or hotel that has a kids club but they have got the balance right here. It is 15 minutes into Playa from the hotel in a taxi which we did a couple of times, its nice to go off site, we had a great day while the rain was falling and tried out a one of the beach clubs on St Patricks Day which lively, a lot of fun but was nice to get back to our luxury villa. We also got taken on one of the boats around the lagoon which lasted about 45mins and we saw all sorts of wildlife including birds, crocs, turtles, they don't advertise this but really recommend you do this. It has free wi-fi all over the resort again a nice touch. There is a golf course on site - which looked fantastic but as a non golf player couldn't say more than that. We also took one of the house cars and went to the fairmont hotel for drinks and dinner one evening which was a nice experience and you can charge back to your room which makes it easy. Lastly I know there are a couple of comments about the temputure of the pools and they are a little on the chilly side even when its 27+ and although we used our pool all the time i could understand why this may be a problem if you have small children as i don't think any of them are heated. Overall we had a great week here and would recommend it as a real 5 star luxury resort and although it takes 10 hours to get to we would recommend it and intend to return in the future and can confirm that resort deserves it number 1 rating.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin", "Title": "\u201cheaven on earth\u201d", "Author": "vicaustin", "ReviewID": "UR59121288", "Content": "This is one of the finest and best hotels I have ever stayed in.

Our flight was delayed for several hours, yet regardless, the transfer service we ordered from the hotel was awaiting our arrival with a smile. The ride to Mayakoba is relatively short - 45 minutes. When you arrive at the gates to the development, it is what seems to be about another mile+ on gently lit, winding narrow cobble roads through the jungle. By now the sun had set, so we arrived at the entrance to the hotel in all it's night time glory, with the huge fire torches blazing away against the reflecting pools below. It's a stunning entrance, and the hotel lobby itself is no less impressive - the photos on the website do not begin to do the property justice. Upon arrival we were greeted by Claudia, who immediately made us feel welcome and comfortable by seating us and offering us a cool drink and towels, then proceeded to give us a brief tour of the property from the perspective of the lobby and then we were drive to our villa (303) in one of the roaming electic buggies. Again, since it was already night, we were greeted with a fully lit pool, spa and courtyard landscape. You can't help but be inspired at this point... The layout of the villa was ideal for us - I had the entire second floor, accessible via a separate stairway outside to a private entrance, which included a large full bath with tub, separate rainshower, etc, walk-in dressing room, and a large bedroom with 2 full beds. Sliders led out to a large deck with dining table and chairs, and another pair of sliders opened to a small balcony overlooking the courtyard. Take note of the clever architecture of the villas. They have been designed for total privacy - from your courtyard, you see nobody - you don't look across or laterally into any one else's space, and nobody has line of sight into yours (other than the occasional boat that floats by, or if you happen to be on the golf course). The layout of the villas is far more private than Rosewood, where you had very little privacy compartively. Even from the second floor decks and balconies, you don't look into anyone elses private space. I doubt this is sheer luck - but rather, is exemplary architectural design. The main bedroom on the ground floor had a larger bathroom with sitting area, and an additional outdoor tub and shower. Every detail imaginable was considered - even the individual water bottles were encased in signature batik-print cosies. Privacy is controlled via a switch from inside the bedroom, which illuminates a sign on the exterior of the villa indicating you wish not to be bothered. The heated jet-spa was big and powerful, with lots of nozzles at different heights that could be individually controlled for strength and aeration, as well as powerfull floor aearators that really made the whole tub powerfully \"erupt\" and boil. Seating is around the perimeter and on different levels so it's easy to find the perfect position for yourself. The ideal counterpoint was the pool - some people complain that they're not heated but really, they don't need to be. Slip over the side of the hot tub after soaking a few minutes and take a few refreshing laps through the pool, then back into the spa. It was absolutely perfect for me. Our villa also had a separate enclosed a/c pavilion with TV, an awesome Espresso machine (Francis Francis!) - the bar was always fully stocked with everything imaginable, and the full-wall pillow-laden deeeeeeeeeep lounger had enough room for several people to completely strecth out in and watch TV from...or nap (which is what I did). If you had kids you could easily make use of this lounging area as a place for them to sleep, and from what I understand that's exactly what some people do. I personally would have been perfectly comfortable sleeping in the pavilion. I've noted that some people complain that this is not a \"beach resort\" but I am not quite sure what they are talking about. There are 2 rows of villas right on the beach, so if you are opposed to what amounts to a 10 minute stroll from the main resort area through the wisely protected and ecologically important mangrove forest, then you can stay in one of those villas. There was absolutely no need for me to take a buggy - my 74 year old mom and I loved the walk, and got to see a lot of unusual wildlife along the way. (As others have mentioned, do not miss the eco-boat tour that takes you through the otherwise inaccessible estuaries and lagoons throughout Mayakoba). This hour long free tour turned out to be one of the big highlights of our stay. Dining at each of the three restaurants was excellent. Oriente was superb (try the Short-Ribs with Polenta and Mole with fried plantains), Tamarind was a bit more expensive and worth every penny for the 7-course tasting menu (the veal cheek...WOW!) and Saffron, their \"signature\" Thai restaurant, has the most ambience and atmosphere, but we were made a bit uncomfortable by the over-zealous servers that watched our every move like hawks - probably because there was only one other table occupied when we were there. Small point worth noting was that the brewed coffee served at the restaurants was uniformly excellent. I'm somewhat of a coffee snob and the coffee was always fresh, hot, strong, and full bodied. Breakfast was also a big calorie-busting carb and fat fest - if you wanted it to be, but they also had a great assortment of fresh fruits/melone/berries/grains etc for those health-conscious people (unlike myself) that don't eat like a pig when vacationing. The assortment of hot mexican dishes served alongside the more traditional breakfast choices were amazing in both quality and sheer variety. Our departing flight was late afternoon - we were asked at check-in what time we wanted to arrange for transport back to the airport. There was no mention of any check-out time - and we didn't leave our villa till almost 2PM on our last day which made our last day leisurely and not all pressure-filled feeling like we had to race to vacate. Our reservation included a 90-minute spa treatment. I think that if you are a spa aficionado you will be probably impressed with their treatments and facilities. I am by no means a spa guy expert, but Fon, my petite and friendly therapist ran over me like an all-benevolent steamroller for the full duration. She managed to zone right in on my 2 main trouble spots in my middle and lower back without a word of direction from me. I came out of the experience a new man. All the therapists are from Thailand. Also, Do NOT miss out on a journey through the \"rain forest\". The gym was perfect given the size of the resort. Besides univeral weight stations, there were state-of-the-art elliptical trainers and treadmills, and a selection of free-weights. It was never crowded. My only negative comment would be regarding the air-conditioning in the villa. It was on the loud side, and the upper level unit didn't seem to work as well as the downstairs one. Another surprising comment I've read from some reviews regarded upper management at the hotel. I have to say that during our stay, on more than one occasion we saw Sr. Llamas actively engaged in checking out hotel operations - in particular, we saw him show up at breakfast early one morning to observe and take note of how things were going. The guy is clearly engaged and personally involved in this operation, and it was evident to me that he is a real gentleman and that his staff really like him, if the warm greetings they all exchanged was any indication. In the reception area is a large format book of photos and bios of the resort staff - do yourself a favor, take a moment to flip through it, read their bios, and you'll be able to recognize some of the wonderful folks during your stay who make this place truly special. I'm sure many people who are considering Banyan Tree are also considering Rosewood - I've had the opportunity to stay at both, and for me the Banyan Tree gets the nod - Rosewood is more edgy and chic, and ironically a bit more family-friendly. Banyan Tree is all-zen and tranquil - and clearly less oriented towards families with young children, although they do seem to accomodate them well with their kids club. If for nothing else, the sheer size of the accomodations plus the huge bonus of having your own private swimming pool, Banyan Tree wins the prize. Overall, this is an auspicious entry into the American market for this brand, and they've set a new high bar on service and accomodation in the area.

Restaurants: Beyond amazing staff, polite, gracious and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is nice and the food is very good as well. Personally, I would stay away from their Italian inspired choices, they were not bad by any means, but not exceptional like some of the other food. Special Events: I planned a canapes, drinks, dinner and a bonfire. It was beautiful and well orchestrated. And the food ended up very good. We also had a BBQ and it was really great -- Ivan and Jefferson (I hope I am getting their names correct) prepared it for us and they were funny and great. The Resort: Serene and very nice. As others have mentioned, it is very annoying to get to the beach side. And you will wait for 15 or 20 mins for a buggy sometimes and you will always have to be sure you have the 5 dollars on hand to tip the driver. This is fine, but it is not relaxing. Honestly, I don't know how they would remedy this though, perhaps more boat stops? At least you would feel like you were waiting for something worthwhile. The Pools: All the Villa and Beach Pools are not heated. This is where the Banyan Tree Mayakoba loses me -- why are you heating only the kids pool in the center of the resort? And why not the gorgeous one with the swim up bar on the beach side -- which over our 6 days we never saw someone brave enough to risk hypothermia go in. I guess the Villa pools you can give a pass on not heating, because of the expense, but at the end of Feb. I can assure you that unless the weather is very warm (which it was for about half of our stay) the downright cold temp of the pool renders it unusable. In which case make sure you get one of the Villas with a Hot Tub. Perhaps in the summer this is not an issue. Spa: We did the Rainforest Walk and had a pedicure. The Rainforest Walk was nice and different and the pedicure was OK. For some reason my 90 minute pedicure lasted 60 mins -- but maybe they were including 30 mins for drying time? Not something I would do again, but it was fairly inexpensive, so it didn't really bother me. Other Items: We were there during a PGA event and it was really grating. You could not get from the main hotel to the beach club without being stopped for 10 mins (during which time you had to be in COMPLETE silence.) This is fully understandable and proper etiquette if you are actually there to watch the event, not just trying to get to get some lunch (you see, the only place open for lunch is on the beach side). Sometimes things would get so backed up that you would have to combine gold carts while waiting -- because only one could get through before the next player arrived and shut down the ONLY path to the beach. Overall Impression: The staff below management are excellent and kind. Some management on the other hand, needs to be retrained. Look below at management responses to each of the tripadvisor reviews which all start with \"Dear Value Guest\" -- A simple mistake, but not when it is done 75 times. We were spending pretty freely over our trip and couldn't help but feel that we were getting nickel and dimed on the strangest things -- so as people pay more than seriously discounted rates -- you will truly feel like a \"Value\" guest.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "al1eng", "Title": "\u201cIncredible place\u201d", "Author": "al1eng", "ReviewID": "UR57042398", "Content": "We stayed 4 days at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba in November.

Honestly both are great and I would recommend them to anyone, except not for families with small kids. Mayakoba is just not that kind of place. If the Banyan Tree has any advantage over Rosewood, it's the large private pool at each villa. The advantage the Rosewood has is the availability of beachside or overwater one-room villas. Otherwise amenities service and ambience are about the same. We booked with a half off opening special that's unfortunately over (I checked back), so rates are astronomical. Food at the restaurants at night was really good, but not great. Most villas are a long way from the beach or lobby /restaurant area, but they give you bikes or cart rides to get around. It's weird seeing all the guests buzzing around on bikes, but they do. The spa is 5-star. Service 5-star. The mosquitos at night were oppressive, so we never went out without mosquito spray.

They go out of their way to assist you in making your stay enjoyable. However, there is only so much that they can do. Upon our arrival at the Banyan Tree, we were escorted to our two-bedroom villa. What we learned was that the two bedrooms are located on separate levels, and in order to access the upstairs bedroom, you are required to walk outside, around a corner and up a flight of stairs. Obviously, this does not work when you are traveling with younger children. The resort website should be revised to better explain this room setup. While the two-bedroom villa was beautiful, this setup did not work for us. The resort moved us to a three-bedroom terrace room. While the bedrooms are all adjacent to one another, they are located in the ground level and you feel like you are living in a dungeon. You get little natural light in these rooms and are required to use a flashlight when trying to find something in your closet. These bedrooms are dark and musty. The pool for the three bedroom villa is located on the rooftop. There is no hot tub with these pools, so they are ice cold. Getting around this resort is difficult. You can request a \"buggy\". You sometimes have to wait fifteen minutes or longer for a buggy to arrive. Also, the odds of getting run over by a buggy or room service cart are quite high at this resort. My family and I were required to constantly step aside into the grass in order to allow these carts to get through. By the third day, you are tired of doing this. You could rent a bike. However, if your children are young, there are few, if any, small bikes for rent. Our kids are 9 and 11 and only our 11 year old could ride the adult bike provided (just barely though). The beach is located quite far from the villas. If you plan on going to the beach, it will be an all day venture as you will not want to go back and forth. Overall, the staff is quite friendly (especially Eduardo). However, this is not a resort for younger children. There is little for them to do and it is quite difficult to get around. Also, the villas simply do not work. If you are a honeymooner or a couple looking to get away, then this is the place for you.

This was our first trip to Mexico and we picked the Banyan Tree based on the reviews here on Trip Advisor. Congrats to the Trip Advisor family - the high ratings were right on target! We are an active couple with three children ages 10, 8 and 6. Overall, the Banyan Tree is as good or better than any resort we have stayed in (Four Seasons, Rtiz etc...). The resort is beautiful and is imbued with a zen like feeling that as you start to abosrb it over a few days, you begin to notice the flow and details. By far the biggest plus for the resort is a staff that is always looking for ways to make your stay a little bit better. This is a young, bright and eager staff of mostly locals that give you the feeling they truly enjoy helping you rather than just angling for a tip. Biggest Plusses: 1. Staff (see above) 2. Design - beautiful flow, scenery. Do the boat ride/eco tour that the resort offers. Its less than hour, and a fun view of the area from the canals. We saw a huge (6-8') croc sunning itself on the banks! 3. Food - the breakfast buffet is fantastic (and open until noon!). Make sure you get it included in your room rate. We filled up there every morning, enjoyed chatting with the staff, then had a light snack for a late lunch. Dinners were often back at the main restaurant, out in Playa Del Carmen, or \"in villa dining\". We had the in room barbecue on the roof of our villa one night which was a lot of fun. Overall food quality is exceptional - you can order from any of the restaurants for in villa dining, so while not actually eating in Saffron, we ordered from it and were delighted. Biggest Drawbacks 1. Sleeping in the dungeon. We were in a 3 bedroom terrace villa. The bedrooms are in the ground floor which feels like you are underground. There is a permanent damp, dank mustiness to it that might be nice in the heat of summer but is not pleasant at all in February. We would definitley not choose to stay in one of these again, despite the huge layout and ample space. We couldn't get the place to warm up or de-humidify. Yes, the rooftop pools are cold. To add insult to injury, all the bathrooms are on the bottom floor and we had a major plumbing problem where waste/sewer water was seeping up into the shower drains. The smell was pretty bad for a couple days, which mixed in with the natural musty smell to keep us upstairs for anything but sleep. To the resort's credit, they offered to move us, which we declined given the hassle. Lots of incense and candle oils helped to offset. 2. Beach access/layout. If you are looking for a true beach vacation, this is probably not the place to go. The beach is nice, but you have to plan to go. You can take a golf cart or bike to the beach very easily, just make sure you change before you go as there are no changing facilities there (we changed in the bathroom the first time as we were expecting a changing room at the \"beach club\"). Other resorts not in Mayakoba are right on the beach if that is what you are looking for. 3. Spa has no wating or recovery area. You have your tea after your treatment in the office were the ladies are typing! Also, made a reservation for a yoga class for wife and two daughters, and when we arrived, they were full with walk ins - so wife and only one daughter participated, with wife's feet hanging under the curtain practically out the door. This was the only staff member that we felt was a bit rude and unwilling to help. She seemed a bit put off that we were not happy that our reservation wouldn't be honored. Overall we give it 4 stars - would have been 5 easily if not for sleeping in the dungeon. The adventures we did from the resort were Xplor, Tulum and Xcaret. Xplor was fantastic, we wrote a separate review for it. We rented a car for a day and drove to Tulum. It's about an hour's drive and was very interesting (don't eat there - the food in the village area gave us a taste of Mexico that we are trying to forget!). The guide we hired at the gate was pretty lousy. You are better off with buying a book at the entrance and eavesdropping on all the other guides. Xcaret is huge amazing place - sort of a zoo, archeologic, water park, sea world all wrapped up in one. We had bad weater for our day there, so didn't do the water activities which was too bad. For those willing to, the dolphin experience and faux scuba diving looked great. We also spent some time in Playa del Carmen - walking 5th avenue is a lot of fun, with countless restaurants and shops and lots of street hawkers vying for your dollars.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mary Esther, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Escape\u201d", "Author": "carribeandreams", "ReviewID": "UR56372307", "Content": "I will strat by saying this was hands down the best vacation I have ever taken and I would return to Banyan Tree without hesitation however, there are a few areas I think could be improved on...The resorts seems to appear torn between being a family friendly resort or being a spa destination. In my opinion you can not be both as a a truely tranquil spa destination does not have small children and loud teenagers running about. There is a huge disparity in patrons at this resort. At one end of the spectrum you would find a well appointed Italian couple dropping Channel and at the other end an American group of 15 travelers complete with tatoos, camouflaged bathingsuit covers, and children who did not know how to cover their mouths when the coughed. Prior to taking this trip I reviewed the comments on this website and noted that one couple had given the resort 4 stars based on the quality of the food. I echo this sentiment. I have stayed at many resorts/hotels worlwide and the food is almost always lacking. The problem with the Banyan Tree is that there is no convenient alterative due to the secluded location. The resort host a few themed eating venues all priced in USD. We found the food some what lacking and after a few days bacame boring. The cerviche was excellent. The breakfast buffet was well appointed with foods from Mexico, pasteries, fresh fruits (which two days in a row there was mold on the raspberries) traditional American, as well as Scandanavian choices. The problem was that it was like a cattle call with children running about, babies crying, and loud parties of multi-famlies. The last morning the dining room was so packed that I felt rushed to eat. Not the most relaxing atmosphere. The staff spoke English very well but on numerous occasions request were lost in translation. On two occasions we ended up with other guest's orders and drinks were not prepared as advertised often missing garnishes. Our dinner reservations were also mixed up one evening. The staff always made a great effort to correct mistakes but it still seemed that eating was chaotic rather than a relaxing, enjoyable experience. The best meals were enjoyed in the privacy of our villa. On to the spa. The staff in the spa were amazing! The treatments were also very good; we found the rooms were a little cold. The before and after drinks were excellent and we enjoyed the free yoga. Our only complaint is that you had to pay to utilize the steam rooms etc. Having traveled to spa locations in areas of Europe use of such facilities is usually complimentary. At a minimum Banyan Tree should allow access to these areas for paying spa customers. The last area that I see could use improvement is the staff use of the golf carts (or buggies as they call them). On numerous occasions staff traveled much too fast considering that the golf carts share the same path as bicycles and pedestrians and there is barely enough room for the golf cart. We had to move off the path an into the grass to allow the carts to pass and we were almost hit one time as sevice staff was traveling in the dark and did not see us. The things we really enjoyed at the Banyan Tree....we arrived at Cancun airport only to wait in line for an hour to pass immigrations and customs. The private transfer was well worth the money and we suggest you try it. We arrived at the resort and were promptly greeted and taken on a quick tour and served refreshments. Our villa was perfect! The room was staged with soft music. Perhaps we were just lucky but we never heard another guest while inside our villa during the entire stay. This was the best part. I very much enjoyed the seclusion and privacy provided by our villa. I often have trouble sleeping when away from home due to noisy neighbors, street noise, and hard beds...not at the Banyan Tree....it was perfect! We relished in the tranquility of the villa; often the only noise heard was a signing bird. The villa also comes with complimentary espresso machine, coffee, and milk as well as fruit, water, and insence. There was an IPod docking station in the bathroom and several CDs in the room. The resort was also very clean. We live in a beach resort area and the birds will almost attack you at resturants on the beach; the Banyan Tree does an excellent job of keeping the wildlife out of the main resort area while ensure they are allowed to remain in the surrounding environment. We did not utilize the beach facility other than to eat light meals. The view was beautiful but again a very \"family\" oriented area of the resort with children running about. We do not play golf but the PGA tour was playing during our stay (which I think added to the chaotic nature at times) and the course looked amazing. All in all a great stay and I would recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for relaxation and a good spa.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cHighly impressed....\u201d", "Author": "db1337", "ReviewID": "UR56301120", "Content": "*Note* I resubmitted this review as it applies to the Courtyard Pool Villa. Not all villas have hot tubs as I had thought, so I wanted to resubmit and make a specific note, given the price of this place, be sure your room type has the amenities you are expecting. I have stayed in a lot of five star resorts and hotels around the world... I'm not talking about the faux-five-star all inclusive zoos but real five star properties and chains like the Four Seasons. I have to give the Banyan tree a massive thumbs up on all grounds. Food, service, property, everything is just superb. They have integrated their resort into its surroundings with minimal impact on the environment. The guests stay in surprisingly beautiful villas, mine is located on one of the lagoons and I wake up to cormorants swimming and catching fish, songbirds, and other waterfowl. The staff are well trained (ask someone for directions and they drop what they are doing and walk with you to be sure you get there... they do this happily, a sign of high staff to guest ratio), friendly and helpful. An example of the dining experience is that for the Thai restaurant on site, the chef and kitchen staff were brought in from the first Banyan Tree resort in Thailand. I was just a stone's throw away from that place in Thailand two weeks ago, and I can testify the food is authentic as you could ever want. No difference from eating in Thailand or eating here. The chef has been in residence since the resort opened and I believe the goal is to train local staff and then move on eventually to another resort. That the hotel has had them in residence for a year and will be in residence longer shows that the mentality of the organization is to Do Things Right and to take their time with expansion. For me it was a bit funny to come to Mexico from Thailand and get the occasional \"Sawatee Kaa\" from a Thai woman walking by! Villas come with a pool and a jacuzzi hottub. Everything is beautifully lit at night, and the architecture is very attractive and not overbearing. The location is only about 10 minutes from Playa del Carmen so you are close by if you want to spend your evenings in town. The Rosewood, Fairmont and Banyan Tree have a mutuality agreement and guests can make use of restaurants on all three properties and have it charged back to their mother resort. This expands your options nicely. Free WiFi always gets A++ marks from me. I hate it when you pay for a five star resort, a large bill, then they use the WiFi as a way of nickel and diming you out of a little bit more. Free WiFI here at Banyan Tree with good performance. There are two minibars (more like maxibars) in the villas. One in the study area which is not connected to the bedroom area (a garden inbetween, with the pool and hottub and view of the lagoon). They are stocked with 375 ml bottles of Belvedere, Bailey's, Johnnie Walker Black, etc., basically a full choice of superior spirits. There is also a wine cooler that has a selection of six bottles of wine. No doubt they are priced at minibar prices, but it is nice to have the option and such a well stocked bar. Espresso maker and coffee are here and complimentary as well as a selection of five excellent teas. Soundsystems in the villas are excellent and there is a selection of \"relaxing\" CD music to choose from (I prefer just to turn it off and listen to the birds). The closest I can get to criticism here is that it's hard to find a well located plug in the wall to run a laptop from, be nice to have one obvious and close to a table, but I am in the minority needing to run a laptop on a regular basis. Any small issues that came up otherwise were dealt with immediately. It is possible perhaps that the beach area is a bit crowded since this is a fairly large resort... and some guests may find the beach to be too far from the villas, however if one is to think about things like hurricanes and tsunamis, it is just another dose of foresight and minimal environmental impact. Many hotels in this area were built very close to the beach and the impact is usually that they have to dredge sand and rebuild beaches and/or evacuate guests during hurricanes. No real problem with that here, though there are a cluster of villas which are beachfront, the majority of the resort is set back from the beach in the lagoon area. I guess the fitness center too is a bit minimalistic. It's so nice outside in the villa that I slept outdoors one night. No issue with mosquitoes though that could be seasonal. Just saying, though you hear \"lagoon\" there is nothing really to worry about on that front. It was a bit chilly on this trip to Playa del Carmen and female guests were constantly offered silk shawls to wrap up in during the evening if they got caught outside with less than enough clothing. This is just a sign that this chain, their management, and staff, have really thought of everything and are prepared. Lastly the villas are very private, while staying though they are all obviously located nearby each other the other guests have zero impact on me. Privacy from staff is obtained by flipping a switch near the bed which means you will receive ZERO disturbance. Even if the privacy light is not lit outside, staff will first call before entering the villa for cleaning or turndown, to give you the benefit of the doubt. Again, just simply excellent. I am someone who is not afraid to criticize based on the fact that I am paying a lot of money, and if a chain or resort advertises it as five star they are claiming to be the pinnacle of excellence. I really have nothing negative to say. I could just keep gushing on the details, there are many more bright points to touch on but this review could last forever. They sell residential properties here and I'm feeling like buying one. Lastly there is a Greg Norman designed golf course on the Mayakoba property winding through the three resorts. It looks beautiful, I golf but the PGA tour will be here in two days so the course is closed to keep it fresh for the event.

I recently got back from my Bachelorette weekend at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to recreate the same magical experience I had in Thailand on this side of the globe in Mexico. We stayed in an amazing 2 bedroom villa (#301) that was so luxurious I felt like I was in Thailand. It was very spacious and great for a group of girls to share together for a weekend of relaxation and plenty of space to sprawl out to do your own thing or be a bit loud and not worry about your neighbors. We each had our own bike to ride to the main lobby/hotel area or to the beach area, which was only about a 5 minute ride - very peaceful. The resort has everything you need, no need to leave. The view from the beach was amazing! What a great idea to put the pool and restaurant right on the beach so you had the best of all worlds, not to mention the swim up bar at the pool. The menu was the best pool/beach menu I have ever experienced. 4 pages of anything you could imagine to pick from. I love that when I travel to a resort, that every day I can get something new and there isn't just 1 or 2 things on the menu that end up being edible. By far the best part about the beach/pool area was the service. Jorge and Alfonso took care of our every need each day. I hope my future husband will be so attentive. Speaking of food, the food at the rest of the resort was equally as amazing as the pool area. We ate at the buffet at Oriente Restaurant every day for breakfast and it was amazing. Anything you could imagine they had. 2nd best buffet breakfast I've ever had (second to The Setai hotel's in Miami beach.) Dinner at Oriente one night for Mexican fair was delicious and then 2 nights at Tamarind for more of an eclectic offering. The food was really good, but the Christian and his team were the highlight of the evening. You can tell he and they really take pride in their hotel and the service they provide. Fernando and Omar helped wait on us and did a great job. One last thing I must comment on is the Spa. You MUST book at least one appointment here. We each had a massage. Speaking for my personal experience (although my girlfriends too said the same) this was the best massage I've ever had. Some hotels claim to have a spa, but this place is above and beyond. Just like in Phuket, you get your own spa pavilion - extremely clean, the staff is super thorough and professional and everything about the experience exudes luxury. Sorry for the lengthy review, but this is the first Trip Advisor review I've ever left. I felt compelled to do so because I enjoyed my stay so much. I'm a VERY picky traveler, I only stay in 5 star hotels and have been to many of them around the world. Whoever you come with (group, family or a honeymoon) you will LOVE this place. I stayed at a few places in the Riviera Maya before and never really liked any of them, but this place has totally changed my opinion of the area.

Let\u2019s get straight to the negatives. They nickel and dime you for everything. Daily food and drink can easily be $200-300 per person/day. Rooms were nice and intimate. The main body of the resort is located inland about 1/2 mile. You can easily walk or take the \"buggy\" from your room to the beach; however, one of the best things about the Cancun area is the beauty of the water. Only the highest end 3-bedroom ($2,500/night) villa's are on the water. The staff at Banyan was great and always tried to take care of us. Food was good (not overly exceptional) given the prices. We went to Rosewood one night for dinner - skip it! We frequently travel to the Cancun region for a quick \"Sunshine Therapy\" every year. A better suggestion for great stay is Grand Velas Riviera Maya. While this IS an All-Inclusive, the quality of the food is amazing. Truely 5-Star. The staff is wonderful and attentive no request goes un-answered. Pools are heated. (All but 1 Banyan Tree Pools are not heated and were cold in February).

My husband and I visited this resort in November 2009 and unfortunately encountered rain during our entire stay due to Hurricane Ida. Since we did not get to enjoy the beach, pools and some of the restaurants which were all shut down due to the weather, we decided to make a return trip in order to experience the full potential of this resort. This time we traveled with our two young daughters (aged 1 and 3) and my parents. Fortunately, this time we escaped a huge blizzard that hit the mid-Atlantic and experienced sunny beautiful weather for the majority of our stay in Mexico. Accomodations: In November, we stayed in the courtyard villa and this time, we stayed in a Terrace Residence. Both types of villas were spacious, lovely and well appointed. The Terrace residences are well suited for families as they have 3 bedrooms, each with their own bathrooms, as well as an open main floor with family room, dining area, and kitchen (microwave, fridge, freezer). There was also an unheated rooftop pool overlooking the golf course. Plenty of space for the 6 of us. I agree that the bedrooms had a somewhat \"basement\" quality to them since they are located on the lower floor with poorer lighting but it didn't detract from my overall satisfaction with the villa (and I am pretty picky). The courtyard villas are very romantic and more suited for couples traveling alone. Their layouts have been well described already on this site and I agree that they are beyond belief with the outdoor bathtub, hottub, and private pool. I enjoyed both types of villas and would make your decision based on who your traveling companion(s) are. Dining: Breakfast buffet at Oriente is bountiful and varied, as stated by other reviewers. Great way to start the day-fresh juices, hot entrees that change daily, plenty of pastries, cook to order eggs. Our favorite dinner restaurant on both occasions was Saffron. The food is out of this world and the service is unbelievable. We had private tables overlooking the lagoon during both of our dinners (make sure to request the secret Garden table). Sampong, the Saffron manager, is the sweetest and friendliest man who went beyond the call of duty to make all of our meals very memorable. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary during our November trip and he set up a private table by the pool for us and surprised us with a special chocolate cake that he served to us as we relaxed on the pool loungers. The exceptional personal service that he provided was one of the main reasons that we decided to revisit the resort. We also had an early dinner at Sands which was also delicious (great tempura shrimp tacos). This was the only restaurant that we felt comfortable taking our kids. Otherwise, we ordered room service for them at night which was delicious, prompt and delivered with impeccable service. It would have been nice to have more family friendly dining options at night but fortunately, we were lucky to have my parents to babysit at night so we could enjoy some kid-free romantic dinners. Pools/beach: There was a large kiddie pool near the main lobby where my kids could roam freely. They had the pool to themselves each day as they were the only kids at the resort during our stay. We also enjoyed the main pool adjacent to the kiddie pool; although on most days, we felt like it could have been heated better. The pool/beach attendants provided the kids with plenty of sand toys and floatees. The beach had plenty of loungers and umbrellas-no fighting or saving chairs like other resorts. Crystal blue waters, white soft sand-absolutely no complaints. There is even a small Kids Club room next to the beach if the kids need a break from the sun or passsing rain shower. It was more than enough to keep our young kids entertained but older kids may be a bit bored. Spa: Had complimentary massages during both visits and while both were great, my second one was more memorable and relaxing. My husband and I did the unique Rainforest experience during our November stay which we both enjoyed. Overall, top of the line spa facilities and service. Service: As stated by other reviewers, this is the best aspect of the resort and what differentiates it from even other 5 star resorts I have been to (including the neighboring Rosewood and Fairmont Mayakoba). They make each guest feel like a VIP by anticipating your every need yet remaining unobtrusive and sincere. Each and every employee seemed genuinely happy to assist in any way possible, from front desk to pool/beach attendants to waiters to buggy drivers. The service also seemed to improve greatly from our first to second trip as our requests were met more promptly and consistently. During our first trip, we had to occasionally repeat our requests a couple of times before they were executed properly, if at all. Special thanks to Regina at the Kids Club for entertaining our 3 year old daughter...she loved making bracelets and sand castles with you! Negatives: Not many. As previously mentioned, the main pool could have been heated better, and even just one family friendly dining option for dinner would be appreciated for those traveling with little ones. There is no easily accessible tennis court and the resort no longer provides raquets and balls to their guests. We were so glad that we made a return trip to this resort and overjoyed to have great weather this time! We hope to visit again in the near future (with or without kids) as we cannot imagine another resort that could surpass this one.

Outstanding for couples, the ultimate in privacy. Each unit is its own villa with a courtyard, private pool, and outdoor, walled private bath, complete with candles in the wall. They've used trees, native plants, and walls to \"hide\" sightlines so that you cannot see into the courtyards of other units. Even the buildings themselves are partially hidden from the water by shrubs and trees, which makes the resort blend in with the surrounding landscape. Great for an anniversary or other special romantic celebration; we chose to celebrate our 25th anniversary there. Service was top notch; it's a great combination of the Mexican culture of hospitality and the Asian culture of unrelenting service and perfection. We are planning to return as soon as possible. Mayakoba security is tight; we had no concerns about our safety. The Mayakoba development is a gated community with a system of canals, a golf course and two more hotels - the Rosewood and Fairmont. While we didn't stay at the Rosewood or the Fairmont, I did note that the Banyan Tree is much more private than the other two resorts. That's not to say anything against the other two resorts, but it did make me appreciate the feeling of utmost privacy that the Banyan Tree provides. Here are some tips if you choose to stay at the Banyan Tree: - Make your wishes known. The staff waits on you hand and foot, and they will make adjustments if you will make your desires known. For example, we noted that our villa had an unusual smell, and within 15 minutes the staff delivered a dehumidifier that took care of the issue. - Use the tripadvisor website to find good deals on stays of three nights or more. We were able to find a stay three nights get two free deal with daily breakfast buffet, massage and $200 resort credit thrown in. - Ask for a bike when you check in. It's a handy way to get around on the property. - Food was superb, but very rich. My wife and I would each order an appetizer or salad and then split an entree. We would eat late morning and then in the evening, and we didn't get hungry. While as you might imagine the food is expensive, our breakfast was included in the package we bought, and sharing our entrees at dinner helped us manage our cost. Long story short, you get what you pay for, and we didn't mind paying for quality. - When you find a good waiter or waitress at a particular restaurant, ask to be seated at their table when you return. They will learn your names and preferences and will be better able to make food recommendations and otherwise serve you. - We enjoyed the boat tour, which they do twice a week. It's a good way to see the canals and wildlife and the other two resorts. - When you want to experience a great end to a truly romantic evening, ask the staff to have your outside bath drawn while you are at dinner. There's nothing quite like returning from a sumptuous dinner only to soak in a warm bubble bath outside while you gaze at the stars with the one you love. - Bring your vitamins; you'll need them!", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWOW\u201d", "Author": "Chitown40", "ReviewID": "UR54621419", "Content": "I just returned home from the Banyan Tree and have to say it was the best hotel experience that I have ever had.

It was our second time here. We came during the height of the Swine Flu scare last April - empty plane, quiet hotel. But we were, and are, simply enchanted with this resort. First, the combination of the Asian/Mexican cultures translated into exquisite service and incredible warmth emanating from the staff. We stayed in a spa pool suite, which combined a separate building (pavilion) with a huge daybed, large flat screen TV. club table and chairs, and bar area. The bedroom in a separate building was beautiful, along with an incredible bathroom with double sinks, frosted glass large shower with steam, separate toilet, and an outside HUGE bathtub by a decorative rock wall with votive candles set in that the staff would light during turndown service. The turndown service was lovely. We came back to the room each night and the robes were laid out on the bed, fresh bottles of water by the bedside, a soothing spa-like CD on the Bose player. The bedding and pillows were lovely. In our compound, which included a jacuzzi, pool, and steam shower, there was an outdoor staircase that led to an area with 2 massage tables, an outdoor shower, a place to sit, and a sink. Our compound was completely private. A buffet breakfast came with our stay, which was both delicious and huge with American, Mexican, and Asian dishes. Of course, there was a cook to make your huevos rancheros to order, or egg whites, scrambled eggs, omelettes. Since breakfast lasted until noon, we worked out in the small but well-equipped gym every morning, showered, and then ate. The first day that we got there, we were by the pool waiting for our room to be ready, and asked if we could have guacamole with just avocados, lime juice, and salt. No problem. Grouper ceviche was on the menu, and we asked if they could make tuna ceviche - no problem. This pervasive willingness to please, and the over-riding warmth of the staff surpassed even the quiet luxury of Banyan Tree Mayakoba. The thousands of details in the beauty of the physical hotel from the lighting at night to the comfortable seating everywhere invites everyone to relax and luxuriate in its essence.

For the most part, I think the high ratings other reviewers have given this resort are warranted. The accommodations are very nice, the food is delicious, the service is good. There are a few minor issues that merit mentioning but overall, I give it very high marks. Every room is a private villa, with a pool, hot tub and separate pavilion. The rooms are nicely appointed and we were very pleased with the setting. One thing to remember-the pool, hot tub and deck are mostly, but not completely, private. Not really a big deal, as someone would have to be really trying to see you but something to remember if your expectations were for complete privacy. Also, don't be surprised to see workers in boats go by 1 or 2 times a day. We asked specifically when we checked in if any boats ever used the canal and were told no, only to see a boat go by twice the next day. Not a big deal but, again, be aware that it isn't complete and total privacy. If you really want that, book a spa villa with rooftop pool and lounge area and it won't be an issue. The bathrooms are great and very large. Ours had a very large shower, a (very private) outdoor bathtub (upon request, they staff will draw a bath for you and decorate your room with rose petals) and ample closet and dressing space. The food and service at all of the restaurants was excellent. Waiters and managers remembered our names and our food preferences. One slight drawback-there is no breakfast room service but the breakfast buffet is served until 12 noon, which should give even the latest sleepers ample time to eat. Speaking of breakfast, its served in a huge buffet with plenty of food from which to choose. Mexican, Asian and traditional American breakfast food is available. We usually ate a large, late breakfast and skipped lunch or just snacked. Our other dining experiences were all great; you won't go wrong at any of the restaurants. The flagship restaurant, Saffron, is Thai so if that isn't your thing, any of the others will have plenty of good choices. We spent most of our time laying by the pool in our villa and only occasionally ventured down the the beach. When we did, the service was good and we had no trouble getting towels, lounges and umbrellas. There was plenty of staff around and when we were ready for food or drink, they quickly accommodated us. We didn't visit the main pool but walked by it on our way to and from breakfast and it looked nice, clean and well staffed. My wife and I each had a massage in the spa and everything, from the spa facilities, to our spa therapists, were great. Treatments were a little pricey but that's probably to be expected. My only complaint with the spa is that workers with leaf blowers were right outside my window for about 20 minutes. Overall, we had a great time and can easily recommend Banyan Tree Mayakoba. Just a few things that I think merit a mention: 1) We were surprised at how many families we saw during our stay. For some reason, we expected that there would be more couples and fewer families. This isn't a knock against the hotel, just an observation. 2) When we checked in, our resort host told us all of the restaurants except the Beach Club were booked up that night. Turns out, that wasn't the case and I'm not sure if he was misinformed or just wanted us to eat at the Beach Club. I've seen this same issue addressed in other reviews. My suggestion is to make your dining arrangements for your first night in advance (try Tamarind) and make reservations for your remaining meals soon after you arrive. Don't wait until 5 pm and expect to get a reservation for that night. 3) The resort is laid out in such a way that every villa (or at least most of them) back up to a canal (with the exception of the 12 or so 3 bedroom villas actually at the beach). This means that you have to walk all the way around the villas in order to get anywhere. You can call for a golf cart to pick you up but that can take some time, especially during peak periods. You can also request bicycles but, as a number of other reviews have noted, you may or may not get any and when you do, it may be the night before you check out, as was the case with us. There is a charge for the bicycles, which I think is ridiculous. The resort would do well to buy more bikes and make them available for no charge. 4) Our resort host guided us through check in, took us to our room and after that, we never saw him again. We got along fine without him but during the check in process, he led us to believe that he would be available to us during the rest of our stay. The resort may want to re-think how they want the resort hosts to interact with the guests. None of these issues ruined our stay nor would they make us not want to recommend the hotel to friends and family. I understand that its still a new property and some issues just take a while to work out. Overall, we had a great time and were treated very well.

The architecture is astounding, with a spare-no-expense attention to detail, from the interior design, to the fixtures, to the horticulture. The rooms are actually villas with private swimming pools, a yard and gazebo, a spacious bedroom, and killer bathrooms with outdoor bathtubs. Interior design is ultra-sleek with a zen-like elegance. The place is quite spread out with cenote streams surrounding the villas, and pathways that circle the property. One can boat from the hotel to the beach, or ride bikes along the many pathways that connect the hotel to the beach and to the other 5 star hotels and golf course in Mayakoba. This makes for a lot of fun, exploring this enormous and idyllic property. The staff here is beyond belief. They clearly have been hand picked to be the most genial,enthusiastic and lovely staff I have encountered in my travels. I swear that the staff outnumbers the guests. I was shocked after dinner the night before my birthday, when the wonderful staff at Saffron brought me out a birthday cake and sang to me. I was perplexed at how they knew it was my birthday. To cap it off, when I got back to the villa, a hot bubble bath had been drawn for me with numerous candles surrounding it. Allessandra, our hostess, apparently had noticed upon check-in that I was having a birthday during the trip and arranged for it all. Unfortunately for us, we had the bad timing of being here during the longest cold spell in memory. I can only imagine how much better this trip would have been were we able to enjoy all the facilities! In light of this event, my only criticism is that all the pools except one are not heated, and that one hasn't been heated enough for the inclement temperature. Nevertheless, I would come back here in the blink of an eye- but I think somewhat regretfully, that word of mouth will spread about this amazing destination, and this hidden gem will become a difficult reservation to book!", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ar3enalfan", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to recharge\u201d", "Author": "Ar3enalfan", "ReviewID": "UR53177809", "Content": "The staff, rooms, service and architecture are tremendous. My wife and I stayed at the end of December and our expectations were very much exceeded. This place is special. We are returning for a second time in March 2010. A lot of thought has gone into making sure that your stay goes beyond what the competition can offer. There are 4 restaurants that each offer very different culinary experiences -- Mexican, Thai, seafood, and hybrid/modern. Each restaurant was extremely good -- and the chef of each restaurant makes a point of visiting the table to check on your eating experience. We didn't get tired of the food like we usually do when dining at the same hotel for several days. The restaurant managers do an excellent job -- service was prompt and the staff couldn't do enough to make sure you get what you want. The commitment to high-end service is found throughout this hotel. My wife and I travel a lot for business and pleasure, and this hotel has found the ideal blend of luxury -- the staff anticipate your next move and steer you into the relaxation zone. The management team has trained the staff wonderfully. The architecture of the hotel is beautiful. The modern Asian-inspired facility blends well with the mangroves and beach area. The rooms (really should be called villas) and common areas have high-end, modern fixtures everywhere -- no cost spared. The property is large -- an 18-hole golf course wraps around the whole property. Electric buggies and an electric boat (to save on environment and keep noise low) transport you around the property -- alternatively you can request bikes. To jog around the property takes 30 minutes -- which is very cool as you get to see the sea, mangroves, bridges, wild life, the golf course, etc. You never feel crowded -- we went at a time when there was high occupancy -- but you would never know -- quite the contrary. My wife and I have stayed in the region before -- we stayed at Maroma Spa & Resort. This facility is a two star resort when compared to the five star Banyan Tree. The rooms are very basic and the hotel needs a serious overall upgrade, whereas Banyan Tree goes beyond your expectations.

One difference in my views from earlier ones may be that I went during Christmas when rates are about $1,500 minimum a room per night when you include tax and service, and many of the earlier reviews were for promotional rates. While the resort may eventually be included in the list of the best, it has substantial room for improvement, despite the world class staff. Service is the strength of the resort, as in that area I agree with the opinions that the staff was the best I ever encountered. They were friendly, attentive, and adaptive to our needs. They also managed to keep the proper distance to respect privacy. The only minor suggestion I would give would be for the housekeepers to try to work around guests belongings rather than deciding to reorganize them; we had a daily game of guessing where they had relocated a brush, magazine, lotion, eye shades, etc. The facilities are beautiful, but seem limited if you are going to be staying more than a few days. I appreciate a very comfortable lounge chair down by a beautiful beach as much as anyone, but for just so long before feeling \"beached\". A problem is that there isn't a lot to do at the resort except lounge by the beach/pool. By the way, I know the weather is great usually, but the pools were not used, probably because all but one are not heated; we never got for than a foot into the one in our villa. The resort shares 1 golf course and two very average tennis courts with all the other hotels at Mayakoba and the Mandarin Oriental. The resort gym is minuscule, and unattended. It was impossible to get on one of the very few pieces of equipment or even find room to even stretch if there were more than 4 people at the facility. There is also no real general locker facility; no shower, nor lockers, sauna, steam room, so be prepared to walk around in your sweaty clothes should you be lucky enough to get the use of an aerobics machine. If you decide to take a massage or other treatment (these were very good, btw), you're met in the Spa lobby and walked across outside through a part of the hotel to a private room with a shower and separate bathroom. That essentially is it for exercise and sports facilities. In this way the resort pales behind anything you would find at a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton. It makes staying here for more than 3 or 4 days difficult, especially if you're active. I can't talk about the rooms except about ours, which was a three bedroom \"Terrace Residence\". It's a 3 level building. the top floor being a small (cold) pool with a table and places to lie down with direct views of and from the golf course. The main floor has a nice living/dining room, but has no bathroom. All the bathrooms and the bedrooms are downstairs which has somewhat of a basement feeling. The Master Bedroom is large, but the Master Bathroom is part of the room and separated by sticky sliding \"walls\" which are difficult to close. The toilet is not in a separate W.C., which with the difficult sliding walls takes a lot away from what I guess could be a romantic setting. Then there's the TV/closet dilemma; there's a nice flat screen TV on a cart that sits in front of the single closet where you can put your empty suitcases; the problem is that the cables to the TV are so short that you can't open the closet at all, and the TV can't quite face the bed. Btw, that's also the only TV in any of the bedrooms, which makes for a potential issues if you're there with a family or another couple.The hotel manager did lengthen the cords on the master TV plus add one to the second bedroom when I asked; like everything, they tried to do anything they could to make your stay best. The second bedroom has a king bed but the room is half the size of the master, and the bathroom (while it does have a door) is very small. The third bedroom is maybe 10'-13', and has two single beds and a small bathroom that also opens to the hall. All the bedrooms are very poorly lighted, which when added to the hard walls and floors contribute to the basement feeling of the entire bedroom level. Also, the showers are more confusing than they should be; the knobs have to be turned towards the 8 o'clock position for hot (wait, it'll go from freezing to hot after a while). There's a patio outside each of the bedrooms, but no furniture of any sort...not even to lay a wet bathing suit. There are no washer or dryers available except through the hotel laundry, which is surprising considering they are commonplace at many other 5 star resorts we have stayed at. Nothing dries inside, and the housekeeping staff keeps bringing your damp clothes in as part of their reorganization drill. The Restaurant Saffron is excellent, and the breakfast buffet fine (btw,at $25 plus the 25% tip on everything there, it's not as badly priced as we had been led to believe). Lunches at the beach are good (luckily, since getting from the beach to the lobby or your villa is a 20+ minute effort usually). We ate dinner in Playa del Carmen three nights, which was a fun trip (170 pesos each way fixed price). If not for Playa del Carmen, I think we would have gone a bit stir crazy. The resort provide basic bikes which are a nice touch and could help to get around; only problem is that they were in short supply during Christmas, and they wear very poorly because of the weather and shoddy construction. The one I got (after a couple of days on a waiting list) had a chain which fell off as well as the entire pedal crank falling apart; both times the staff came running to help and returned them to my villa in whatever was the best condition possible. Sorry to ramble; by adding my thoughts I don't want to accidentally insult the incredible staff as they try their hardest and would move heaven and earth for the guests. My issues are with the people who designed the resort; my hope is that they will add the necessary facilities to make this resort be what it could be. I can think of several resorts which currently are better than Banyan Tree Mayakoba, but none with the level of service.

There is not a detail that has been overlooked. The staff was courteous, helpful and eager to please. The food was delicious. The breakfast buffet at Orient has everything you can image from sushi, to pastries, to cereal, to bbq pork, to bacon, to salad, to fruit and vegetables, you name it and it's on the buffet. Room service was prompt and delicious as were all of the other restaurants. The villas are amazing; the outdoor bathtub is especially romantic. I was a little worried at first that it might be difficult or time consuming to get to the beach, but we really enjoyed having the bicycles to ride around the resort and everything is within an easy distance. Whenever we needed a buggy it was just a short phone call away. The beach was beautiful, the service wonderful and the beach chairs (which are more like little mattresses you can lay on) were so comfortable we never wanted to leave. We even enjoyed a \"stretch class\" (basically yoga) on the beach on day. We are already planning to return some time in the next year.

We had booked a \"courtyard villa\" and -- even though we had booked through Expedia and thus were already paying a bargain rate -- we were upgraded to a \"spa villa,\" which was far more spacious and luxurious than any hotel accomodation we had ever been in. The \"room\" -- the term hardly does it justice -- consisted of the following: a large courtyard containing a grassy area, patio, L-shaped swimming pool, separate hot tub and double lounger with umbrella; a pavillion building off to the left containing a mini-bar and fridge, flat screen tv, dining table and chairs, and the largest pillow-surrounded couch I've ever seen; a main building off to the right which contained a king bed, another flat screen tv, direct access doors to both the hammock area and the swimming pool (jump right in if you wanted); an adjoining bath with separate his and her vessel sinks, walk-in clothes closet, steam shower, and separate privacy-walled outside tub area; and a rooftop deck overlooking the golf course with twin massage tables, a sink and bar area and yet another outside shower. All furnished in an exquisite blend of contemporary, Thai and Mexican elements. The service was was in many ways equal to the surroundings: twice daily room cleanings and turn down/towel replenishment; a small gift left every evening with candles lit, evening robes and slippers laid out and incense set up when we returned to the room following dinner or visits to Playa del Carmen; bicycles left at our door for our use to get around the property throughout the week; an ipod full of music to be played in either our bathroom or bedroom docking stations; and a hostess/concierge (Jadira) who made clear that whatever we needed she and the hotel were there to provide. I will mention also the breakfast buffet which was, again, unequalled in our experience of similar provisions at other comparable hotels: platters of fresh fruits constantly refreshed; five or six varieites of cereals and granolas; cold seafood including salmon, sushi and other asian delights; a dozen different varieites of cheeses; an omelette/eggs to order station; at least a half dozen hot dishes every day including pancakes and waffles, bacon, suasages and ham, mexican chicken dishes, Thai/asian based seafood pots, muffins, croissants, bagels, at least a half-dozen different fresh baked and self-slicing breads, and a whole separate station of Mexican sweet cookies and pastries -- and more. The dinner restaurants were also excellent: Saffron was our favorite, for Thai cuisine, and its outside setting was especially tranquil and remorely beautiful; we also enjoyed Tamarind (eclectic Mediterranean, I guess), and Oriente, which I guess I would call fusion. All had novel menus, fresh ingredients, and truly outstanding settings, service and amenities, including complimentary tastings premeal and after dessert. We also had room service in our pavillion one night, and that was a fine experience as well, including personalized service while we relaxed with the tv on. So, was everything perfect? Well, in a sense, yes. Because at a beautiful property where everyone goes out of their way to cated to your every whim, and where your bargain rate already has gotten you more than you might imagine, plus an unpgrade to even greater indulgence, to point out any of the truly minor things that might be deemed less than 5-star ideal, would seem to me the height of ingratitude. But a few things for others to note (none of which, as I say, detracted in any way from our week-in-paridise feeling): the breakfast buffet is expensive (about $40/person including service and taxes) and there really is no alternative, so if at all possible get a package which includes that in your rate; the main part of the hotel is not directly on the beach, but about a 15 minute walk or 5 minute bike ride away and the beach area is fairly narrow, though it has an exquisite pool and beach club; and the fitness facility is surprisingly small, with only 4 pieces of aerobic equipment -- 2 treadmills and 2 cross trainers and no bikes or ellipticals. That, I could imagine, might be a problem in the late afternoons when the place is more full of guests desperate to burn a few of the 2,000 or so calories they put away at breakfast. But, it was never a problem while we were there, so maybe Banyan Tree knows its guests better than I do. One other thing to note -- the staff is trained to react to the slightest suggestion of disappointment, so be careful of what you say and how you say it. One night in Oriente I ordered the Tortilla Soup. My wife found it excellent and finished every drop but I found it just a little too spicy for my palate and so only ate half the bowl. Our waiter of course noticed, and asked if there was something wrong. I said no, just that the soup was a bit spicy for me. He then asked if he could bring me a different appetizer. I said that no, I was fine. Then after our our main dishes had come the restaurant manager came over and again apologized for the soup and offered to treat us to a complimentary after dinner drink or coffee, which we declined. Then, a few minutes later the manager brought the chef over and introduced him, and the chef apologized for my soup and said that please whatever our needs and wants were for our food, we should just make them known and they would do everything they could to accomodate them in any way possible. Which, in a way, sums up our week at Banyan Tree Mayakoba -- a place that does a pretty fantastic job of anticipating your every sybaritic desire and then goes the extra mile just to be sure it has hit all the right notes.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAn Amazing Place\u201d", "Author": "AnthonyDLG", "ReviewID": "UR51526830", "Content": "I am writing this review after having returned home this morning from the Banyan Tree and I already miss it.

For a new hotel, there are really very few kinks. Everything runs smoothly, and all of the staff members appear to be very well-trained. From bellmen to waiters to the beach attendants, everyone is gracious, friendly, and willing to help with anything, and they do it in a manner that is neither obtrusive nor obsequious. The front office management has done an incredible job with their employees. The rooms are beyond beautiful, and perfectly designed. Spacious, airy, and well appointed, they far exceeded our lofty expectations. We were in a two bedroom villa and could have easily not left it for our entire vacation. Situated on a lagoon, our villa featured a gigantic pool (this is not the soaking tub that a lot of places try to pass off as a pool- this is a swimming pool, four and a half feet deep and long enough to actually swim) a separate pavilion room with the most comfortable couch/day bed ever,a flat screen tv, dining table, bar area and coffee machine (this was the ONE PROBLEM with the hotel, if I had to site something wrong- it was a huge pain to work). Our bedroom was huge... Two walls of sliding doors open onto both the pool and a patio with a hammock; the bathroom featured a gigantic outdoor tub and shower as well as a very nice indoor one; walk-in closets, ipod docks everywhere...and the turndown service was beyond belief. Every night a crew would show up for an hour, lighting candles, burning scented oils, turning on relaxing new age music... Coming back to the room after dinner was like walking into a spa. Which brings me to the spa. Best. Massage. Ever. The beach was beautiful and incredibly well maintained ,down to the crew who would cart off seaweed that washed ashore. The beach staff went above and beyond- in particular, the main attendants Jorge and Alex, and the waiters Alejandro and Carlos. They're all great and deserve a special shout-out... We thought that we might be bummed out to not have a room directly on the beach, but golf carts were available to pick us up with not much more than a three minute wait... The restaurants were all very good- particularly the decadent breakfast buffet, which was more of a breakfast/brunch/lunch buffet which could fill you up until dinner.

One of the employees told us that he has become much more aware of environmental issues and even carried his training home (he now recycles, for example). They do not import any food; we were told that all the food served at the hotel comes from local producers. We didn't get to go on the Eco tour but we saw lots of wonderful wildlife around us and the efforts on behalf of the hotel to preserve the wildlife and it's habitat. Employees all seem to have a purpose--this is far more than a job for them. They enjoy the training and education they receive and are committed to creating an incredible experience for the guests. They all demonstrate a stake in the success of the hotel as well. They know the occupancy rate, the check in's and check out's, the issues of yesterday, and goals of today. We were very, very impressed with how the operations of the hotel are managed, much much more impressive than any other five star resort in which we have stayed.

The service was excellent from the moment that we stepped off the plane at the airport. The car service provided by the hotel was excellent. I strongly recommed this as the taxi drivers at the Cancun airport are comically solicitous and it is a fair ride to the Mayakoba Reserve. We were provided with cold towels and ice water on arrival which was a nice touch as it was well into the 90's when we arrived. The check in process was very relaxing. We were provided with refreshments in the lounge as we waited for about all of 2 minutes for the staff to take care of the arrangements. We were given a quick tour of the main building to familiarize ourselves with the main part of the hotel before we were driven by golf cart to our room. Some people have mentioned that they have had issues with the buggy service but we were there for 10 days and were about as far away as you could get from the main building and there was only one time where we had to wait for more than 5 minutes from the moment we made the call to the desk and we used that service multiple times every day to go to breakfast and dinner. The bikes are a great touch. The Food: Our biggest concern with having our wedding at any hotel was the quality of the food. The food at the hotel was excellent. Saffron was especially good and the food at Tamarind stacks up to places in NY as well. The sea bass was excellent at Tamarind. Also the breakfast spread was better than any comparable hotel with a nice mix of Asian and Mexican dishes that vary every day. There is also standard breakfast fare as well (omlette station, waffles, bagels, lox, etc.) The Service: Impeccable. period. The Property: Excellent layout of the property overall. An actual comment was \"you cannot take a bad picture here\" There are a lot of mentions of mosquitos and personally I never get bit so they really don't bother me but my wife gets killed by them NY let alone in the middle of an ecological park in Mexico but they didn't bother her any more than on any tropical location we have been too, so not really a big deal and they are only an issue at all for an hour at dusk. Anyway, if you don't like mosquitos a beach location anywhere in the Caribbean is probably not a good choice for you. I would suggest skiing in Colorado, the mosquito population there is pretty sparse in the winter. Rooms: Let's see, 2Bdr, Infinity pool with jacuzzi: check, separate living room/ bar area: check, outdoor bath and shower: check, excellent design: check. Yep, that works. Spa: \"Better than NYC\" A big compliment comming from a person that to this day insists that the best pizza in the world just happens to be the on on the corner of her block where she grew up in NYC. (It's actually Little City Pizza in Simsbury, CT) Value: Worth every penny Sercive: Clearly a very well trained staff. They went to extraordinary levels to accommodate absolutely anything we needed. First rate. Every single person went far above and beyond what could have been asked. First of all, thank you for such a great time Pancho, Peter, (Jenny, Flo says sorry and she hopes Yoga went well), Mari Lu, Arturo, Raphael, Miguel, Abraham at the pool bar and let's see........ Yvonne!! With all of the great things said above about this hotel there is one thing that stands out above all the others. That is Yvonne. Even with the excellent reviews on the web site, the pictures, the reputation of Banyan Tree in general, we would never have not had our wedding at the Banyan Tree if it was not for Yvonne. For comparison's sake we also looked at the Ritz in Grand Cayman and Amanyara in Turks and Caicos. We had visited the Ritz prior and my Sister and Brother in law checked out Amanyara in person. Due to Yvonne's unmatched professionalism and the fact that she was an absolute pleasure to deal with we decided on the Banyan Tree sight unseen. We were so glad that we did. We could not have asked for a better experience for our wedding. Everything was perfect, even the timing of the weather. (Yvonne, I'm sure you had something to do with that as well so, thank you.) We did not have a lot of time to dedicate to minor details like how many rose petals should be on a place setting or which direction the beach should be raked. As such, we really asked Yvonne to do a lot and she more than delivered. Need a photographer? done. entertainment? all set. Can you serve this specific type of tea that only grows above 9,000 ft in the Himalayas? \"We'll send someone right over, he'll be back in 20 minutes\" (Kidding there, but you get the idea) Yvonne, above all thank you for taking the stress out of planning a wedding and making it an absolutely perfect day.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "norfolk", "Title": "\u201cpure luxury, could not fault a thing, trip of a life time\u201d", "Author": "mrsmorley", "ReviewID": "UR51019224", "Content": "the service here was one in a million, the staff treat you like king and queen and would do anything to make your stay the best possible! the villa (we had a garden pool villa) was stunning, nothing can fault it, pure luxury!

This location is pretty secluded. It was a 10-15 minute taxi ride to Playa del Carmen which we found to be neither too far, nor too close. Accomodations: For our short 3night stay here, we were going to be gone for most of the day, therefore we opted for the courtyard villa - the most basic villa. Wow, were we surprised. The villas were beautifully decorated, clean and very spacious. We honestly felt like we were the only guests on the property. The yard area was maintained very well and the pool was really clean. Our only slight disappointment was that the pool was very cold. We were also given bikes which we used to go throughout the property. We used the bikes mostly to go the beach every morning and to get to the main lobby. Serivce: Excellent! Alejandra was our designated person for our stay. Whenever we needed anything, she just told her. She definately went above and beyond our requests (mostly small things). Everyone at the resort was extremely friendly and attentive.

Just by way of comparison, the Banyan Tree feels much larger, a sprawling resort, and is more modern and less intimate in style than Maroma. Some of the pros and cons follow. Pros: The staff to guest ratio nevertheless was very high and the service was extremely attentive. We really loved the large and modern rooms, the high ceilings and the private plunge pool and private courtyard/sitting area. The closet and bathroom at the Banyan Tree felt as large as the main area of our room at the Maroma. We also loved the spa services, the thai massages, classes etc. The workout facility was nice though not exceptional. Everything had a \"newness\" about it which is not surprising given the hotel's relatively recent opening. We enjoyed just the laid-back feel of the resort, just riding the resort bikes around the grounds was a pleasure. Cons. There were a few cons, though not many. The resort like many in the area is long and narrow with only a small beach area. As others have noted, this means that many of the rooms are quite distant from the beach, requiring a (enjoyable, in our case) bike or \"buggie\" ride to get there. The restaurants were expensive though the food was good, not great, but good.

It was amazing! I would recommend this resort to anyone. Best for couples as it is very romantic, and even though there were some families there I suggest do not go with children. The Rooms: The villas are spectacular, each has its own pool and they are very private. You will never hear another person around you as soon as you enter your villas space. They are VERY spacious. The A/C is great and keeps the room very cool. There are ipod docks in the room and in the bathroom and feel free to blast the music as we asked our neighbors if they could hear it and they said no. The pools are immaculate and clean and huge, they are no splash pool but almost a normal size pool. There are loungers and outdoor beds. A great table and chairs is also provided for in villa dining outside. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The lighting in the rooms is very \"zen\" and romantic. The outdoor bathtubs are so great, they are huge, and the bath salts, bubbles, and oils are a great addition along with the wall of candles. Everything about the room is great, one suggestion keep your safe closed and all of your belongings in there. If you leave it open and any \"valuables\" are left out in the room the maid service will put it in the safe and change the code on you. This means they will be in your safe touching your belongings so just a reminder keep it all locked up. The Food The food is amazing from the in room dining to the Sands at the beach for lunch to Saffron which was the absolute best Thai food I have ever eaten. The service at Saffron is spot on and I do not know what they could do to make it any better. Everything we ate there we kept saying \"Oh my god this is so good! Amazing! MMMM\" You must go here, we ate indoors and it was very romantic, but there is tons of outdoor seating which looked very romantic but we had enough of all the mosquitos. You will not be disappointed by any of the food at this hotel. All fabulous! The Service Sometimes slow when asking for ice to the room or trying to get a buggy to take you around but always pleasant and very helpful. No one ever had any kind of attitude and they are willing to do anything for you. The beach help is very nice and bring you tons of water cold towels and special drinks. Everyone is great. The Spa The spa will blow you away its like being in a different world I had a Balinese massage and it was so relaxing definitely reccommend having lots of treatments done. If i knew how great it was may have gone for more. Overall the hotel is fabulous we are already planning on going back hopefully soon.

We have been to the Cancun/Riviera Maya several times and enjoy the people, the scenery and the culture. After reading the glowing reviews praising the Mayakoba , I was so looking forward to tsurprising my wife for our get away for five nights. However, I began to have some reservations upon entering the place. I almost hate to criticize because the staff was really good at \"service recovery\" and were well trained in customer service. It's not that the hotel grounds aren't beautiful; it is very isolated located in a wetlands that surrounds the area. (This property, while it has it's charm, is a haven for mosquitos and early evenings we were driven inside by the biting.) Our check in was flawed and for much of the stay, the staff seemed to be in recovery mode...fixing situations that should have been handled in advance. We arrived at about 1:00 P.M. Our villa wasn't ready because the AC unit wasn't working properly. When you travel over 8 hours to get someplace and you have communicated when you will be there, you'd like to drop your bags, put on something casual like a bathing suit and relax....we had to wait well over an hour for our room to be ready without the offer of a good alternative....given that the place was well below capacity you might think there would have been options... The villas are very private well appointed; very comfortable bed; nice pool and jacuzzi. We could have used more hangars and a better layout to spread out our clothes. We were given an upgrade with a pavilion which is a separate building that has a table, couch, TV, Coffee maker, etc. If we were with a group it would have been a fun place to have a drink but with just two of us, we didn't feel the need to use very often. The beach is fine and well raked and cleaned. Like many of the beaches in the area hit by hurricanes, they are losing sand and the beach has narrowed. We love the beach and the best part of the Mayakoba for us was the beach crew. My thanks to Jorge and the crew at the Sands for the excellent service and making our stay relaxing. The restaurants were just OK. We did enjoy Saffron. The chef and team were very friendly and the food was authentic and service top notch. The Tamarind was terrible, really. We waited for forty minutes for a salad and scallops and were laughing about how mediocre it was...and the place was empty... Service in general was very spotty at the hotel. The Oriente breakfast was excellent with fresh fruits and a great selection. Service was just OK.. to serve someone, there should be more attention at the table; less focus on opening the doors for you...we had to ask for napkins at breakfast; often the coffee/tea was forgotten...again the staff would be in service recovery mode apologizing rather than getting it right the first time. We had plans to have dinner one night at the Sands for the barbeque at 7:30 P.M. We arrived at 7:00 P.M. to have a glass of wine at the bar and were unable to get a drink because there was no bartender. W don't mind the fact that the resort is spread out. We like to walk and bike but wondered if many would find annoying the dependancy on waiting for rides, either a boat or golf cart to get around. We enjoy playing tennis and were dismayed that we couldn't walk or bike to a tennis court...you couldn't even take a golf cart but had to be taken by car instead to a remote spot where the tennis court is located. We come to Mexico because we like the people, the weather, the beach and the culture. While we enjoy private time, we like more action than was available at the Mayakoba. We would go the bar and find it empty. We enjoy Mexican music. While the music on the CDs for your room was soothing enough, the music in the public parts of the hotel (restaurants, etc. was...I really don't know how to describe the music...new age maybe...was not what we were looking for. This is a hotel that has hired many good people(Sarah, Jorge, Pedro, Cesar, Ivan, Alex...) and I am sure will continue to work to get it right.

This was our first real vacation in 10 years and this place lived up to our expectations of a high-end, private, relaxing, pampering vacation. If you are looking for a party, lots of people, nightly entertainment I'd go somewhere else. I love and appreciate architecture and design and absolutely refused to stay somewhere with the vegas style jacuzzi tubs in the room. If you are picky about rooms (I hate most!), then you will absolutely love BTM! The whole resort is a asian/mayan experience. Every detail has been designed, even down to the incense and oil burners, scented cold towels, to the lighting, bathrooms and the incredible smell of the lotions and bath gels. (I agree with another reviewer-I would have spent an insane amount of money to purchase the lotions, bath gels and incense/oils that were not available in the gift shop. They were also out of bathrobes I was hoping to purchase to remember our vacation. I went to the online gift shop to purchase a robe but shipping was terribly expensive - $65 for a $45 robe) Upon check-in, you get a welcoming drink and cold scented towel. They take your luggage to your villa and is already in the room when your arrive via buggy. We stayed in a Courtyard Villa. My husband and I couldn't stop grinning as our hostess gave us a tour of our villa. This Villa has a private courtyard with a very large pool and hot tub. They were all finished with amazing blue glass tiles. Two large loungers, table and hammock as well. The bedroom was on one side of the courtyard and the living room was on the opposite side. The bedrooms are large, very comfortable with large flat panel tv, cd player with ipod docking, satellite tv with an okay amount of channels, stocked mini bar, huge sun filled bathroom with double vessel sinks, seperate toilet and giant shower and huge walk in closet and another ipod docking station. There is also a large private outdoor tub with a wall of candles. The living room has a large sofa, another flat panel tv, cd/dvd player, fresh fruit (delicious!), coffee and tea bar and dining table. Each morning our villa was cleaned and refreshed with towels and fresh fruit. Each evening our room was turned down, robes and slippers set out. Before our trip my husband was very concerned about our room not being on the beach. Well he apologized to me over and over, this place is so incredible and it was fun riding our bikes two minutes to the beach each day it was not an issue at all! There are a few options for getting around the resort . Call for a buggy \"boogey\", take an electric boat (very cool!) or ride your bike. The buggy never took more than 5 minutes to arrive after our request. You can take a boat tour of the whole property on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The breakfast at the Oriente was also incredible! A huge selection of hot dishes (authentic mexican), breads, cereals, fresh fruits, sushi, cheeses, pastries, and eggs made to order. I also loved our late lunch at the Sands Beach Club. I wish they were open all day, they had a great selection of less fussy food. The Saffron was romantic, the food was good but I don't see eating there 5 or 6 nights. Because of the high quality of the food, the menus were more limited than we were used to but we were still able to find something we liked at each restaurant. Be prepared, the food is pricey, but you have to expect it at someplace so incredible! We had absolutely NO problems with mosquitos. I think I only saw one! Even though the resort is in the middle of mangroves they must do an excellent job fighting them off. We booked a couples swedish massage. Definitely the best, most relaxing massages we've ever had. The girls are from Thailand and of course are the best. This resort is paradise, but without the friendly, helpful staff it would be nothing! Each staff member went over and above in order to take care of us and serve us. From the hostess, buggy drivers, room service, housekeepers and turndown service, waiters....every person there was eager to help and so nice! The first couple of days my husband rode a girls bike. He mentioned this to Juan, and within 20 minutes his bike was replaced with a \"man bike\" and Juan wrote his name on it! Gabriel and the hard working staff at the beach club never made us wait for a drink. We felt like we had the whole resort to ourselves, it was a completely relaxing vacation. The grounds are immaculate and beautiful. And the beach is SO clean, no rocks, fine white powdered sand and very private, not crowded at all. If you decide to tear yourself from your room and this wonderful resort, Playa del Carmen is a 10 minute $17 taxi ride. Shopping on 5th Ave is okay for a couple of hours (street vendors wear on you after a while), and take the ferry to Cozumel. The whole time I was in Playa, I wished we were back at the resort.

I spent over four hours on the phone with Continental only to find out they were charging us a huge fee to change our flight even though they couldn't fly into Cancun due to the weather. It was really disappointing but what can you do? The staff at Banyan Tree Mayakoba on the other hand, went out of their way to accomodate our changes. Due to difficulties with the airline, we had to call the resort multiple times with questions on dates and availability. Each time they were patient and accomodating. I spoke to Claudia and then another wonderful lady, I believe her name was Alisa.

I went to book via their website and once I typed in the dates we wanted in October, the website told me that the courtyard villas were not available for those dates tho' a garden pool villa was. I therefore proceeded to book. On arrival at the hotel, I was told that our booking did not include the dinner plus pre-dinner drinks for 2 which I was surprised at, as I had assumed that we had booked the offer as per the website with the only difference being that we had been allocated a garden villa instead of a courtyard villa . However as I had nothing in writing to confirm that we were expecting to have dinner on one night included - there was nothing I could do. I found this misleading and it was pointed out to management. That said, we were not disappointed with the garden villa. It was spacious (as others have noted) and in all honesty we would not have needed any more space inside or out. The pool was great - big enough to swim in and the water was a nice temperature so it was pleasant to be in - which is so often not the case with private hotel pools. I loved the peace and quiet of the place. No car sounds - no dogs barking in the distance - no noisy neighbours. Just silence. The first day we just lazed around in our private garden and sunbathed on the large comfortable loungers or headed to the large shaded day bed if it was too hot. For lunch we cycled down to the Sands beach bar. Great to have the bikes. We asked for them as soon as we arrived the first evening and we were told there was a waiting list - but two bikes were waiting for us when we headed off to breakfast the first morning. Cocktails and lunch at Sands were lovely. Mexican food, salads or club sandwiches with fries - all nice. In the afternoon, a well located hammock outside our bedroom door offered a delightful spot to read/doze. It was very hot the second day so we cycled down to the beach again in the morning and got loungers around the pool. the sea breeze made it very pleasant. Service around the pool was excellent. We ate at Tamarind the first and last nights. Food was nice. Seats at tables were wrong height for me so had to sit on a couple of cushions to be at comfortable height for eating. Service was great first night but a bit Faulty Towers the last night. On the second evening we ate at Saffron and that was very enjoyable. Dark and romantic setting - good service and nice menu. As others have raved - breakfast here is wonderful. Fabulous choice and everything looked and tasted delicous - only wish I could have eaten more! The free 90 minute massage was very good indeed. I thought it would only last 1 hour plus extra time for pre/post relaxing but it did last the full 90 minutes. The masseuse was delightful and even tho' I wasn't in the slightest stressed - I left the spa feeling so much more relaxed. They have definitely got just about everything right here. The Garden Villa we were in was really amazing value for the space, privacy and quality. Some of the service was a little erratic (tho' incredibly polite and and pleasant) and maybe a little more training needs to be done re the wine pourers (we had to wrestle the red wine off a waiter who wanted to put it in the wine chiller with the water!). But I must stress these are very minor points. ( My only other niggle was the cereal spoons at breakfast which were very trendy but not very practical for putting in your mouth and extracting food from them!) To sum up - I would happily go back to BT and would certainly have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. I am so glad we stayed there.

Sounding too effusive is going to be my problem, but I assure you, every word is earned and justified. My husband and I travel the world looking for incredible experiences, and we found the best one right in our backyard. We live in Isla Mujeres, a quick trip up the coast, and go to Banyan Tree for every \"special occasion\" we can rightfully drum up. From the instant you enter the Mayakoba complex, you know that you have landed on a special planet. The rest of the world simply melts away. Winding along an elaborately gorgeous cobblestone road through dense jungle, you glimpse occasional slices of a blinding green golf course meandering softly towards the oceanfront: golfers will be beside themselves. Pulling up to the front of Banyan Tree is a magical experience within itself: I must stress that the staff of this hotel is beyond amazing, unlike any we have ever encountered. Not dutiful, but instead full of personality, individuality, class and warmth. Friendly smiles walk you inside to a view that will take your breath away: an open lobby complex feels more like the (large and crazy) home of your dreams, finished to perfection with sculpture and tastefully appointed furniture which is straight-up Architectural Digest-meets-the-Yucatan, mosaic-tile floors, soft perfect music (often a live acoustic trio), and an African Queen-inspired electric boat waiting to whisk you to your villa. Oh, the villas..... we have stayed in both 301 and 702. Try to reserve one with a pavilion, which is like an unattached den, connected to the main bedroom by a covered walkway, divided by the pool. The rooms.... WOW. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook your private pool and exotic private garden. Sliding doors from your bedroom lead you right into the pool. Slate floors are warmed by thick, comfy tibetan wool runners. The bathroom, arranged in a circular formation, features a steam shower, his-and-hers vanities divided by a giant round mirror, a tiled outdoor bathtub backed by a wall of candles (lit for you, of course, magically by the invisible staff when you go to dinner), and yummy toiletries. I am a big sound/smell girl, and two of my favorite aspects of the rooms are the house CDs (four of them) which are playing softly every time you enter the room (there are also three iPod docks), and the zen-like combo of Banyan Tree's incense and essential oil lamps (they are always sold out at the gift shop if that tells you anything). Every last detail has been thought through in the rooms. When you can manage the heartbreak of leaving your room, hop on your bicycle and meander to the beach, for a truly luxurious (but always down-to-earth and warm) treatment at the beach club. Order the grouper ceviche and shrimp tacos along with whatever kind of exotic cocktail they've dreamed up that day. The restaurants at Banyan Tree do not disappoint: they combine a harmonious marriage of Yucatan cuisine and Thai/asian yumminess. Definitely eat at Saffron, and - as tacky as this may sound - bring your camera to take pictures of the breakfast spread in the main pavilion, as no one will ever believe you if you try to describe it. More about the staff: they remember us when we return, they sit down and converse with us, and they TRULY LOVE their jobs. Every last one of them says something to the effect of, \"working here is not like work.\" Whoever hires the staff here is a genius at choosing people who are at once attentive and laid-back in the most complimentary, perfect sense. Last time we arrived by helicopter and landed on the beach without telling anyone we were going to do it. It caused quite a scene, but one of bemusement and heartfelt welcome, as if they see that kind of thing daily. I just about cry every time I leave Banyan Tree. Every time we leave we are plotting our next trip. I am in love with this place like no other. A few other cosas: - this is, in spite of being ridiculously romantic, quite a nice place to bring kids. The layout of villas and public space is so private, you can hear a pin drop. But we are planning to bring our son soon, as it is extremely welcoming to families. - the staff all knew that it was our anniversary on our last visit and never ceased to surprise us with rose-petal greetings on our bed, complimentary desserts, and well-wishes - if you are after extreme privacy, this is your place. If I were the most famous celebrity, this is where I would escape. People here are cool and respectful. -the spa is simply world-class. They are #1 in the world. Be sure to find out why. It's too much to try to explain in words. This is my love letter to my favorite hotel. Nothing is left to say. Go, go, go.

Driving down in a rush from the airport in Cancun we were welcomed to the hotel with cool towels and a refreshing juice to start our stay. Immediately you could feel the stress leave your body. The rooms are actually 3100+ sq ft villas that contain a private garden with your own infinity pool, shaded and unshaded lounge areas and a table and chairs which in our case overlooked a lagoon. Inside you were greeted to a large bedroom with 20 ft ceilings, large walk in closet and bathroom complex. Opening out from there was a private outdoor soaking tub bordered by a wall with recessed candles that could be lit for nighttime bathing, a definite must do experience. Dining was wonderful. The breakfast buffet which was included in our stay is like nothing I've ever seen. Choices were endless and ranged from fresh papaya to chocolate croissants to sushi and everything that you could imagine in between. Dinner is available at several restaurants. We dined at the Tamarind which is billed as International/Mediterranean. Service as in the entire resort was impeccable. Friendly and efficient without being intrusive. I had a Mayan tasting which was delicious. Be forewarned though, dinner is expensive. We spent $160 for two with only 1 glass of wine a piece! The other nights we went to Playa del Carmen, about a 15 minute drive, and had excellent meals in the range of $40-70 US a couple. The spa treatments are to die for! A 90 minute massage was included in our package and we decided to spring for another one. The \"basic\" Thai massage is a 90 minute affair given by a master Thai masseuse. It starts with a foot bath followed by a top to bottom massage and ends with fragrant tea and fruits. There is a whole range of spa services including a 3 hour ayurvedic massage. We played golf on premises. El Camaleon is an 18 hole PGA championship golf course that winds through the Mayakoba complex which includes the Banyan Tree, Rosewood and Fairmont hotels. Stunning vistas of the ocean, lagoons and mangrove preserves abound. There is even a cenote (water filled limestone cave) on the course! The course itself is challenging but fair but again is expensive ($250/round). However if you play in the afternoon as we did, twilight rates are reasonable. The beach was about a 10 minute bike (they provide bikes at no charge), 15-20 minute walk and about 20-30 water taxi ride on the lagoon from our villa. As you would expect, it is a sugar sand strip (but not very wide) which you can walk on for several miles in either direction. The beach club area has a nice pool, restaurant and again wonderful service. They cover your chairs on arrival and provide bottled water and occasionally little treats (like watermelon sherbet) free of charge. The pool area is right next to the beach. As others have said already, the service is the star of this hotel.

Turndown service every night was a lovely component to our stay. The food was also a strong point. We ate at the Saffron Restaurant and had truly spectaular (though very pricey) Thai food. The morning buffet was also a delicious, beautiful spread and it offered different choices daily. If you want to be a little more active, request the use of a couple of bicycles and then ride around the resort grounds--it's a great alternative to the use of the buggies they typically use to ferry you between the different parts of the resort, though those were at the ready immediately whenever we requested them. We chose to eat dinner one night at the Fairmont next door and one night at the Rosewood. This was easily arranged by the hotel and they even let us charge the meals back to our room at Banyan Tree.

Its is the best travel deal going and the word is getting out. After 5 glorious days I can tell you I'll be happy just to get a reservation in the future. I think of myself as a critical reviewer as I believe vacation time is a precious thing and we deerve the best at leisure time.....we are paying for it after all. But, its hard to not to gush as others have about this amazing resort. I've attached pictures of the villa, which is the most amazing thing about BTMK, but her goes: For those of us who don't get a chance to travel to Asia to experience some of these amazing resorts, I think the Banyan Tree and hopefully the Viceroy; coming next door at this location on the Mexican Riveiera, will raise the bar to this level of accomodation. Accomodations: Stayed 2 nights in a Courtyard Pool Villa and 2 nights in a Spa Villa. The villa: Sick. The website and review don't do justice the size. I saw them all. Even the Garden Villa has the same size pool.... The asian design assures privacy, the lighting inside and outside is sleek, there's a lot of room: in the seperate dining area w/flat screen there's a large lounge couch....outside two large plushy beach beds and an outdoor dining table. I would probably not recommend this vacation solo....the villa is made for romance, At night the pool, jacuzzi--a well made one with multiple jets mind you--and entire villa light up. You have an outdoor sunken tub with a wall of candles, and in the Spa Villa's- outdoor showers--one below next to the tub and upstairs. The only difference between Spa and Courtyard is there's an upstairs --a Spa station upstairs for a private massage, a steam shower downstairs--the bathroom is slightly smaller in the Spa Villa btw. The summer months a private message would have to be done very early or late in the day...cause you'll fry. So, I say the Courtyard Villa--which is part of the Best Of BTMK special...even better! The bathroom is huge, the shower is huge, and the bedroom opens up to the outside so you can step right into the pool. The Bed is superplush--heavenly bed plus! 42 in. flatscreen and decent cable. Music is everywhere though--all rooms have I pod-CD players--a great touch. I believe they are using there own brand of soaps....incenses and cintronella burners are also in all rooms and are luxirously created by the Banyan Tree brand. You get your own Illy cappacino maker and tea service with Forte' teas. The amenities are just tremendous...part of what makes this a Five Star. ---------- Dining I fell in love with Saffron. True Thai, done gourmet. I live in Denver Colorado and love Thai--nuff said. This is Banyan Tree's Signature restarurant at all or most resorts. Its devine. Everything is so fresh and bold. Also part of the \"best deal\" A beautiful looking restaurant as well...with dining inside and out--Romantic lighting everywhere. We were outside both times. Absolutely top notch service--as much as you want-as little as you want. The restaurant overlooks the lagoon. The breakfast buffet--I overhead another guest say this and I agree: \" Very similar to the full on buffet you see at The Wynn in Vegas--of The Four in Maui .\" We had room service from Saffron--took about 15 min extra--still awesome. Lunch at The Beach, and regular room service. Killer cheesburger! And yeah, its like $26..but oh did I mention most of the dining and services are pricey--but c'mon you really have to expect it. I did not go to Tamarind at the main building. For the wine lover. A fully stocked cellar--you can bring your own and have it stored I imagine-- Beach/Pool Unique free form lagoon type pool with the latest craze in pools. The sun area ledge--tan faster! A sexy pool with deck chairs arranged at different levels for more privacy. Its very large and acoompanied by a smaller lagoon pool for families or just sunning mainly. The Beach Club is Cool-- Also spread out very nicely with a good size pool beyond the dining area---then down to Mexican Riviera--I've been to many spots around the beaches on Playa and this is nice soft sand area--the ocean can still be a little rough at time, but the service and beach cabana's or lounge chairs on the beach are first class. Did not see any solicitors on the beach....only a few jet ski's lookin for riders. Spa We did the Rain forest and if you're a water lover and you have a companion do this! Relaxing, invogorating different water showers, steam. sauna and mud. It all ends up with a large pool with powerful jacuzzi's a water neck message and water jacuzzi bed. Just another special amenitiy that makes BTMK that much better. We did not do the message. Workout room/Business Center: top of the line machines for jogging, stepping, lifting. Free weights, all the extras you'd expect--towels, water a plenty, fruit. Air condidtioned properly. Computers that work, printers, faxes--private and comfortable if you need em. Other Aesthetics and comments: For us travel buffs who've read about Banyan Tree resorts for years but did not have the time or resources to get to Asia this was a real special vacation. The archetecture, use of lighting, the landscaping--The Golf Course was amazing--I did not play it, but will next time. This is finest resort I've ever been to in my life for a romantic vacation for two. The service is 5-star--this staff is top notch--friendly, not imposing, professional and accomodating. The BTMK is large---much larger than I thought and you can call for a buggy or get a bicycle---thats a nice touch--you ride your bike to the pool or beach... If I had to be Super Critical and look for something that you might not dig about the Banyan Tree I would have to say if you were looking for an \"on the beach resort.\" Like Pink Sands in the Bahamas, you may not love the view from your room. The layout of your room maximizes privacy so you can't have it both ways to get these super incredible rooms. The Lagoon itself adds to the aesthetics of the resort, and a boat can take you around the resort, but its au natural and isn't a Disney moat-- It can be a little buggy--I've read the bug comments--but just as you might say this resort is too pricey--remember where you are --on both accounts. My Spanish isn't up to par and I did occasionally not communicate clearly enough--They are trained to deal mostly with us Americans--are we a tad more impatient? :) But, I would say knowing some Spanish in Mexico--duh. I believe the resort was at around 20% capacity. We had the Beach Pool, Lagoon Pool, and Rainforest all to ourselves. That just added to the experience for us. The economy and H1N1 scare our giving us a rare opportunity to get to BTMK at a deal before the rest of the America's finds out. If your discimnating about the best--this truly is. In over 50 reviews: This is my first and only Five Star reccomendation.

The Banyan Tree Mayakoba is the first western hotel of this Asian group. It combines the best of Asia and Mexico in its decor, food, and hospitality. Our large, private villa included a high-ceilinged bedroom, a large light-filled bathroom, a walk-in closet. The usual amenities are available plus an espresso machine and fresh milk, mosquito spray, incense, candles. In addition, we had an outdoor bathtub and our own swimming pool. The room was cleaned twice a day. Each evening the staff left a small gift. From the moment we arrived, the staff was helpful, attentive, and generous. Every staff member we met smiled and introduced him/herself and called us by name. They truly cannot do enough for you. The grounds are large and bikes are available for recreation and transportation. In addition, there are staff to chauffeur you in golf carts. Call and they arrive within minutes. The hotel has a lagoon running through the grounds. You can take a boat along the lagoon to the beach. Twice weekly, you can take this boat with an expert for a tour to learn about the birds, animals, and plants on the hotel grounds. The beach is pristine. Staff will make up the lounges with fresh towels, bring you cold cloths, and take your food and drink orders. They are attentive, but not intrusive. The spa is beautiful, with treatment rooms built over the lagoon. The Rainforest Treatment is unlike anything I've seen anywhere in my travels. Both Saffron Restaurant (Thai cuisine with chefs brought from Phuket) and Tamarind Restaurant (Mediterranean Mexican) are excellent with service to match. The breakfast runs until noon (wonderful for us late sleepers) and includes a complete egg menu plus a buffet of fresh fruits and juices, baked goods, cheeses, cold cuts, and Asian and Mexican hot dishes--congee to chilaquiles. Every morning there were new choices. When I enquired about the recipe for one of the sauces, I was introduced to the chef and taken on a tour of the kitchen, given the recipe, and on my last day, given some of the sauce to take home!

We booked a Spa Villa- room 702, which had a wonderful view of the mangroves and blew away our expectations. The room was impeccably clean each day, with spa scents from lotions, soaps & incense left in your rooms relaxing you each time you walk in the door. Your entire bedroom has floor to ceiling window that open up into the pool on both sides. In the morning you can hear the birds chirping- I kept forgetting I was in mexico as it really reminded us of our trips to Bali. After staying at many high end resorts all over the world (including aman, four seasons), we were stunned by the level of service. The service at Bayan tree made Four Seasons service look like that of the Holiday Inn. While the resort itself is flawless-what made our experience is the staff. Never before had we had such attentive personal service. Obviously the manager has hired individuals at the top of their profession & I would encourage guests to get to know these wonderful people during your stay. The staff made our experience what it was. Our personal hosts- Yurita & Guadalupe (Maria) greated us on arrival & followed up on our experiences/needs each day (and night). These hosts were so gracious and attentive, handling our every wish and any issues we had encountered. My husband lost a small bag at the airport, they called found it and had it waiting for us on our return- and even offered to have it sent to the hotel. We lost one of our bikes, they had another sent to our room immediately. We didn't have to ask for a buggy to be sent to our villa prior to each of our touring departures. It seemed like every concern we could have had was already thought of and addressed without our asking. The food- was far superior to other resorts we have stayed. Breakfast every morning is included and was incredible. It is served in the Oriente restaurant- the manager otto greeted us everymorning & noted our likes/dislikes. They offer mexican foods, thai foods, sushi, a variety of fruits, grains, pastries, eggs, juices. The servers are attentive & flawless. Thanks to the manager Otto- who subtlely noticed our preverences and often brought special things to table for us to try. My husband and I sadly miss our relaxing morning breakfasts, reading the paper, overlooking the banyan tree pool. Saffron is excellent (we ate there twice and is the hotel's signature restaurant). I recommend the soups (coconut chicken soup) & the chilean sea bass. It is pricey, but if you share smaller things is reasonable. The sometimes overlooked mediterranean restaurant Tamarind is a must. Fernando (chef) and Fernando (waiter) created a lovely dinner for us- a must try is the mushroom ravioli & rack of lamb. Musicians played music during our dinner. Many guests don't go to Tamarind because they want mexican or thai- but this is a hidden gem at Banyan tree and chef Fernando needs a bigger audience! They also so offer some mayan quisine on the menu. Prior to dinner each night, I would highly recommend having drinks at La Copa while the sun sets. It has a beautiful view overlooking the resort and the stars. Javier and Maricel took good care of us, sometimes bringing up small things from chef (creative appetizers). Lovely people, lovely conversation. Two of the nicest & attentive people I have met. We spent several days at the beach pool (Sands) where Jorge (pool manager) & Manuel greated us when we walked in & took care of us. Each time when we got out of the pool we found the towels on our chairs were refreshed. The staff frequently offers small complementary apptetizers/drinks from the chef or bar. Jorge and Manuel worked non-stop and maintained this level of attentiveness even when the resort was very busy toward the end of our stay. Little things they noticed- like once my bike was a little wobbly- they heard me telling my husband and told me they were going to get me a new bike. They were incredible. Top notch. It is a must to get to know both of these people if you head to Sands. Thank you Jorge & Manuel. My husband and I did a lot of diving during our week stay- we would recommend Dive Mexico- which handled our dives in playa del carmen, cozumel, and to the cenotes. Our highlight was the cenotes dives, which were beyond our expectations. Another must is the whale shark snorkling. The negatives: while they were few- here were a few things we did note. First- the resort needs an ATM (for getting into playa del carmen or tipping). Second- the food is sometimes a little high priced. I expect as the resort reaches higher capacity they will offer some lower priced items on their menus. I hope this review was helpful- the other reviews of the rooms & resort were dead on as far as the quality of the rooms & service. This resort is very romantic- perfect for a weekend getaway. If you love asia & bali- it will bring you there without the distance. Thanks again to the entire staff- even the people who remained namelss as they kept up the resort.

Don't be surpised though in the coming months to learn a hotelier new to North America, Banyan Tree, has risen to become the pinnacle property in the Americas and Carribean with the opening of Banyan Tree Mayakoba. Our recent 15 day vacation included 11 nights at Banyan Tree and 4 nights at Rosewood. Rosewood is very nice, but we shortend our stay there as my wife and kids (ages 6 and 3) could not wait to get back to Banyan Tree. The service of every staff member from arrival to departure was friendly, courteous, and professional. Our resort host, Ana, ensured every wish was accounted for in a curated manner. Adrian, the boat captain, is emblematic of a gracious Mexican host. Eduardo, the recreation manager, I'm sure will be invited to my daughter's wedding in twenty or so years. The food was very good, especially at the signature restaurant Saffron. Chef Prasong and manager Sompong made each of our eight dinners memorable. Roberto and Alberto provided service with pleasure each evening and host Maria was a wonderful companion for our kids when their patience ran out. Prasong has two young children as well and prepared child-friendly meals each night that our kids loved. The spa features Thai therapists from Banyan Tree Phuket who are alone worth the vist to Mayakoba. Many of the beautiful treatment rooms are located over the lagoon and are wonderful settings. We highly recommend the Classic Thai and Balinese massages. The villas are among the finest we have had the opportunity to experience. Our first five nights were in a very private lagoon view two bedroom villa that had a 500sf pool, hot tub, and detached air conditioned living/dining pavilion. The rooms are well appointed, generous, and feature a bath with an enclosed outdoor asian garden with shower and soaking tub. The second six nights we enjoyed a three bedroom beach front villa. This was similar to the two bedroom villa with an addtional bedroom suite attached to the pavilion, and provided an incredible view of the azure sea. When we departed, Ana, Ed the suave F/B manager, our bell friends, and General Manger Pancho Llamas all were there to waive goodbye.

We could not be more pleased with our decision. The bedroom and bathroom is in one pavilion, while the living area is in the other pavilion with a courtyard/pool/spa/garden that separates the two pavilions. We truly enjoy the fact that each villa has it's own privacy. Even though it's facing the lagoon and we have an unobstructed view of the mangroves, we got used to walking around in our birthday suite without fearing that anyone else will see us. jSorry for the mental image, believe me, you'll be tempted to do the same thing! Having the luxury of swimming at any hour in the privacy of our own villa is priceless. We also enjoyed free wi-fi and the free bike rentals (highly recommend). Each morning we would bike around the complex, to the beach and around the golf course to work up an appetite for the free daily buffet. Occupancy was only around 30% and we definitely felt that the resort's staffs out-numbered the guests. Bottom line, we felt we were being treated as royalties, staffs greeted us by name. I would come back in a heartbeat! Here are some other tips/advise: Transportation - This is our 3rd time in the area, having a rental is really the best way to go. We rented form Avis + full insurance coverage + pre-paid gas for around $ 40 a day. Driving in Mexico is not that bad. Unlike Hawaii, Mexico is not known for car thefts, but as with any tourist destination, you don't want to leave valuables in the car. Getting to the resort from the airport - the resort is off the main highway about 30 minutes south of the airport. The resort is south of the \"Tres Rios\" and \"Mandarin Oriental\" resort. So if youa re seeing signs for these two, you are less than a minute away. If you see the \"Grand Velas resort,\" you've gone too far. And if that's the case, just find the next \"retorno\" and do a U turn. You'll see a big \"Mayakoba Golf Course\" sign on your right, and on your immediate left, you'll see a grand entrance with shiny big sign that says \"Mayakoba.\" Turn left to enter the gate. Please note - you will not see a sign for Banyan tree until you've made a left passed the gate. Mayakoba has 3 other resorts (BT, Fairmont & Rosewood) all sharing the same grand entrance. Once you've passed the gate, follow signs to BT on a small tree-lined one lane road (5mph), it'll take you 5 minutes to get to the hotel lobby from the gate. Security is tight. Check in - You are assigned a hostess that will greet you, offer you cold towels, welcome drink and so forth. Your hostess will escort you in a golf cart directly into your villa to continue with the check in process. I really like not having to wait in line behind some jerk who leans over the counter & takes his time with too many questions. Sounds familiar? I love how we bypassed all that non-sense. Restaurants - The daily buffet is complimentary and we were NOT disappointed. Since it's complimentary, we thought it would be continental breakfast, but it was not. See my pictures, it's a full buffet. There is an egg station, cooked food station, salad/cheese station, fruit area, and pastries. The selection was very good. We also dined at Saffron, which was very expensive and since we are Asians living in LA and have traveled to Thailand, we thought Saffron was not authentic and overly priced. But it's what we expected anyways. With that said, we did enjoyed the dining experience. We did most of our dining in the Playa del Carmen & Cancun area. We asked the hotel staffs for places that \"they go to,\" not places for tourists. Ecological boat tour - since the resort is located on a lagoon, the resort offers free boat tours around the lagoon. It'll show you the different types of vegetations, you'll go through mangroves, be able to see the other resorts (Rosewood, Fairmont...) and your guide will point out different birds/animals along the way. Please note - we intended on doing this tour on our last day, but was very disappointed to find out that the tours do not operate daily. So if you are interested in doing this (I don't know if it's free), please be sure you check out the schedule. Currently, we were told it's only Tues/Thurs. 90 Minute massage - I had this done my last day. It's really a 60 minute massage, and the other 30 minutes is check in, walking to the treatment room, drinking tea, selecting music & incense. Unlike other spas, you do not need to arrive early to enjoy the steam/sauna/jacuzzi. Those are NOT included in your complimentary 90 minute massage. If you want to use those facilities, you'll need to purchase it as an add on, or purchase other packages that includes the use of those facilities. I was a little disappointed with that since I was under the impression that I'll spend about 2 to 3 hours pampering myself. Other guests - Because the hotel was only about 30% occupied, and each villa has it's own pool, we really felt like we were the only guests at the hotel. The only time we ran into other guests were during breakfast. Most guests would be around 30s and 40s, mainly couples. We didn't run into noisy children or crying babies (Yay!). Overall - book this hotel if you are considering. I did a lot of research between Mandarin Oriental, Fairmont and Rosewood. I also emailed other travelers who has been to some of these resorts and concluded that BT was the place to blow our money.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "spurg", "ReviewID": "UR38778479", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from a great 2 night stay at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba. We stayed under the Best of the Banyan Tree rate \u2013 an amazing deal if you can get it. After reading the other reviews at trip advisor, we upgraded to a spa room villa. We never toured the courtyard villa but were blown away by the space, the beauty and the luxury of our Spa Villa--number 706. We did not rent a car and took the cadillac escallade transfer option and were very glad we did. Security at the hotel is very tight. We stayed at the Rosewood Mayakoba last year and there is much more security present at the Banyan Tree. When we arrived, we were taken to our room \u2013 pretty and spacious. The courtyard houses a pool and Jacuzzi along with two separate pavilions \u2013 the king bedroom and large bathroom with outdoor tub on the left, and a separate eating/lounging pavilion on the right. We were traveling alone, but the separate pavilion seems like an large enough for a child traveling. There\u2019s also a large deck upstairs with an outdoor shower, sink, couch and two massage tables. The deck is somewhat covered by a slanted roof of large twigs, but it does not have enough coverage to block out the sun and heat present most of the day. I had a massage included in the package, but was encouraged to take my treatment in the spa due to the heat/sun. There are 8 spa villas, all completely private facing only a body of water so you can walk around in the buff. All 8 Spa Villas are much the same but 701 has a view of the golf course (And the players may have view of you!) NIght time star gazing is possible off the rooftop deck of the Spa Villa and this feature alone makes the Spa VIlla a worthwhile upgrade. Bikes: The hotel will provide bicycles if you ask for them \u2013 make sure to request them as soon as you check in. We asked, but it took several phone calls and we received them by 11am the following morning--they are in demand and currently in short supply. The bikes make getting around the grounds much easier. Who wants to wait for a buggy when you can pedal to the beach in half the time? I also used the bike to get to the golf clubhouse and to the golf range. I expect the Mandarin and Rosewood will start offering bikes to their guests since this is such a popular feature of the Banyan tree property. The food: We had great food during our stay--superior to the offerings at the Rosewood Mayakoba next door. The buffet breakfasts at Oriente were plentiful and delicious. We ate our breakfast at 11:30 each morning so we could skip lunch and save room for dinners. The first night we checked in we wanted to eat light, so we ordered the tortilla soup and the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp from the in villa dining. The menu for in room dining is quite limited but we were both very happy with our selections. Dinner for two at Saffron was included in our rate and it was a set, 4 course meal. The food was some of the best Thai food I\u2019ve ever had. The chicken dip with saffron bread was amazing, as was the thai crab cake. The dinner is served family style and we were stuffed trying to finish everything they served us. The service: When we had one small issue and it was immediately addressed by tthe resident manager Peter who took care of the problem right away and removed the charge from our bill. He also went out of his way to come find us at breakfast, to thank us for bringing the problem to his attention and to make sure we were satisfied with the results. The service at both Oriente and Saffron was friendly, very attentive and helpful. The Beach attendants are very quick to bring you towels, water, ice towels and take your drink orders. They all got to know us by name. There were plenty of beach chairs so no need to wake up early and reserve. The Spa: I had a choice of a 90 minute treatment, included in our rate. I chose the Balinese massage, which is similar to a deep tissue massage. The massage is actually a 60 minute service\u2013 the 90 minute experience includes being taken to a private room, given a foot bath while you choose the type of incense you would like during your treatment and the music you would like played. The massage was wonderful and I was able to take a shower in the room afterwards before enjoying my ginger tea, melon and carrots while looking out at the lagoon. There were two types of rooms for treatments \u2013 mine was a standard pavilion which housed two massage beds. The deluxe rooms are for scrubs and for combination treatments. The Beach: The beaches in this area are some of the prettiest in the world. We have spent a lot of time in Hawaii, Fiji and the Carribean but there\u2019s something about the soft white sand and the warm, clear water in Playa del Carmen that keeps us coming back. The water temperature had to be in the high 80s \u2013 lovely and warmer than any of the swimming pools on the property. There is a nice pool at the beach (SANDS) and restaurant, but we never ate at that restaurant. We staked out one of the palapas on the beach and travelled between the ocean, the outdoor showers and the pool for most of our stay. Make sure to use ample sunscreen. We did and still came back a bit red, but loved every minute of being in the water. The water is definitely calmer in the morning, so we\u2019d recommend any snorkeling trips or boating early in the day. Eduardo at the Beach Club was particularly outstanding , arranging for a tour of one of the three bedroom beach villas after we inquired about the rooms. At the Banyan Tree, the only rooms on the water are the 3 Bedroom Beach Villa. Just note that they do not have the privacy of the Spa Villas, since they are set in a semicircle around the beach view, there is not total privacy. We took a tour of the beach villa (812) and while quite lovely and spacious, we were happy with the privacy that the spa rooms had. One warning though \u2013 while I enjoyed a short tanning session without my suit, I did look up to see a boat tour slowly passing by our room! I was surprised, given that I had been told that no boats travelled by the spa rooms, but live and learn\u2026 I really wanted to stay a third night and given the 20% occupancy, the room was available but sadly the flights were not. We are already planning our next trip back and can\u2019t wait to experience more of the wonderful service the Banyan Tree has to offer. Golf While I rarely golf while on holiday, I took the opportunity to play the back nine of the course for an after 4pm rate of 77$. It is a beautiful course with a lovely par 3 (#15) right on the water. I shot a 50 and lost 6 balls so I am cured of playing golf for awhile. Overall, the Banyan Tree Mayakoba blew away the Rosewood Mayakoba. Since it just opened in March, the staff is trying really hard to get everything right and they go the extra distance. They were extremely friendly and were never expecting any additional tips--they never had their hand out.

The last time we came here, we stayed at the Rosewood (also in the Mayakoba) and we thought it couldn't get any better. We initially thought about staying at the Rosewood again, but decided to stay at the newly opened Banyan Tree to try something different. We really didn't think it could get much better than the Rosewood - boy were we wrong. Both resorts are 5-star and you can't go wrong staying at either place, but the Banyan Tree is just a step above. The villas - One of the main differences between the villas at the Rosewood and the Banyan Tree are the private pools that accompany each villa. The pool at the Rosewood is small and is not that inviting. The private pool with our villa was a HUGE endless pool that was surrounded by beautiful landscaping and several lounging areas. Some of the villas come with a hot tub which I would highly recommend you upgrade to. It's just nice to come home from dinner or a day at the beach and soak in the hot tub. The food at the Banyan Tree is excellent. The main restaurant, called Saffron, serves Thai food and they have actually staffed world class chefs, restaurant managers, waitresses from Thailand so it feels like a truly authentic experience. The restaurant itself is so beautiful and romantic. There are 3 main seating areas, 2 outdoor and 1 indoor if you would rather sit in air conditioning. I recommend sitting outdoor overtop the lagoon. It just creates an unforgettable dining experience. We couldn't get enough of the food from Tamarind, the hotel's other main restaurant. Our first night there, we had the pleasure of meeting Christian Roth, the Food and Beverage director of Tamarind and the hotel bar, La Copa. He set up a special tasting menu for us with fantastic wines from Mexico. We rated it as one of the top meals we have ever had (almost better than Laserre in Paris!). We loved it so much that we even had dinner at Tamarind a second night with Christian. We had friends in town so he set up a beautiful dinner for us in their private banquet room called La Cava (where they served the president of Mexico when he attended the opening of the hotel) which is room where they also store their wines. We were treated with a brand new tasting menu with specially selected wines from Christian. Needless to say, it was amazing! Spa - The spa at Rosewood doesn't even compare to the spa at the Banyan Tree. And before the Rosewood, I didn't think I could ever find a nicer spa. The service is unbelievable. We scheduled a swedish and balinese massage. In addition to our massages, they give you a footbath, facial massage, head massage, and refreshments. Our 60 minute massage was 90 minutes of absolute bliss. We were tempted to go back for a second round the next day but didn't have time. They also have this amazing facility called the Rain Forest. We didn't have time to experience it, but we heard it is a must. The staff - they remember who you are from the minute you walk in to the minute you walk out. Everywhere we went, we were greeted by name (they even remembered how to pronounce my name which no one ever does). They are above and beyond attentive. At one point while I was on the beach, I asked one of the attendants the time because I didn't have a watch and every time he saw me after, he would tell me the time. If they are that attentive about small things like this, imagine how they are about everything else. I could go on and on about all of things I loved about the resort (the bikes they have for guests to ride around, the fresh fruit in your room each day, the outdoor bath area, the cold towels on the beach, the concierge that flawlessly set up my scuba certification) but this would get too long. Unfortunately, we only spent 5 days at this resort. If you have the time, stay for as long as possible. You will not regret it!!

Few things that you should know however: Food inside the resort is very costly. Expect about $60-100 per person for decent meal with all charges & fees added. We opted to go out to town for dinners because of price in resort. If you can book a packaged deal that includes breakfast ($50 per person) and maybe some resort credits it may ease the shock. Unless you book a 2 or 3 bedroom villas ($$$$) on the beach most of the standard one bedroom villas are about 15 minute buggy ride away from the beach ... NOT a walking distance! If you are looking for a place where you can simply walk out onto the beach from your room you will be disappointed.

The BT has got a huge amount going for it, it also needs a bit more polish in one or two areas that if addressed will make the experience truely outstanding. We had booked two sunrise villas, and when I enquired about possible deals on offer I was unexpectedly offered upgrades to two sunset villas on the beach peninsula at no increase in costs. The hotel was only 20% occupied so you can shop for offers whilst they get over the combination of the Banking crisis (real issue) Swine flu(not an issue) and getting their name out there for a new property( I am sure next year will be different) Arrival and meet and greet was good , rooms are large and stylish , very private and well equipped. We particularly liked the large separate annexe room or as we called it the chill out room, as during the middle of the day at top temps it was a haven with a large day bed that all of us could lie on. The staff are absolutely fantastic and a real credit to BT and themselves, always willing always on hand, and some of the very best we have ever encountered, make sure you appreciate them as they do make the difference. The beach area is small but gets a great breeze off the ocean and when we were there was never crowded ( see above) however during peak times it will be a little cozy. The main pool is a good one and on a couple of days we were the only ones there so service was superb, and of course you have your own pools which are large and very private. Note the beach and beach villas are a good 10 mins from the main hotel, we ran one morning, but usually took the bikes to the Gym , cycled back and then all went to breakfast on the bikes again later- great fun and healthy!..alternatively book a buggy which never took more than 10 mins to come (again think about busy times) or the enjoyable boat , which takes 15 mins but was only running sporadicaly. Lots of wildlife, some rather too exotic and the whole area was very secure. We played golf three times on the local course, a great one and again the staff who are part of the Fairmont dropped us back to the hotel and were fantastic. We hired a couple of cars from the company at the BT, and they were good quality, low mileage premium cars. The area outside Mayakoba is a little desolate if you are looking for the real Mexico, we travelled to Tullum and further to see the real sites but a few days is enough to get the picture. The peninsula is pretty boring overall and as we were trying it as a replacement to the hurricane damaged carribean where we normally summer, I am afraid it was a little short of interest. So the areas that we think need some work: Spray for mosquitos, we faced into the mangroves and the property was protected from the onshore breeze and got very hot and humid. We were rich meat for the mozzies, and were also regularly bitten in the restaurants and attacked on the golf course at around 4pm. The gym need more aerobic kit, there are two step crosstrainers and two running machines , and a full weights cycle, however with four people in there unless you want to pump up your muscles it is very limited, also no earphones, cold towels or fresh juice which you would expect from a 5Star hotel. The restaurants were limited, the food was excellent but on some nights only Tamarind was open, so whilst the resort was quiet you really need to have more choice. The beach bar was great but shut at 5pm and would have made a good alternative at least one evening, and the Thai Saffron is superb. Room service was good but the menu is far too limited to make it a real attraction beyond a couple of days. The solution we found was to ask for food off the restaurant menus and room service, which they obliged us with, and although a little longer to arrive we did get a better choice, I would suggest the hotel incorporates this into the normal room service menu. So this resort has enormous potential, a quiet and modern haven once you are in the resort, staffed by superb , willing and attentive staff. I am sure it will be the next big thing on the world's top hotels carousel Enjoy whilst you can.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "RI", "Title": "\u201cIf a picture is worth 1,000 words, experiencing this resort is worth 10,000!\u201d", "Author": "TTeacher", "ReviewID": "UR35380072", "Content": "After reading all the detailed and helpful reviews here, we booked a spa pool villa at the promotional rate of $403+tax and service charge directly through the hotel with the helpful attention of Grecia and Brigitte. As we approached the hotel, we found the Asian inspired architecture and grounds with a Mayan twist to be simply spectacular. Claudia, our kind hostess, greeted us with a green drink and cool scented towel. She came with us to one of the 8 spa pool villas via an electric golf cart aka a buggy to check us in. We entered the gated enclosed villa to find a long pool, an in ground hot tub, and a 2 person chaise lounge with umbrella. Past the chaise lounge was a table and chairs that overlook a garden area that backs up to a lagoon. On either side of the pool are two separate living areas. One side is 2 levels. A spacious king bedroom with a large flat screen TV, desk area and cd/dvd player is within view as you open the door. A hallway leads to a circular vanity with 2 black and white floral designed sinks. Men and women\u2019s toiletries are kept in matching black and white bags next to the sinks. A nice selection of liquid soap, bath gel, bath oil, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion are in matching cream-colored ceramic dispensers on the counters. A large circular mirror is in the center of the vanity and there is a floor to ceiling wall mirror as well. You'll find an Ipod docking station in the bathroom, too. Off the bathroom is a walk in closet equipped with a safe, four robes and slippers and the most comfortable pair of beach flip-flops we\u2019ve ever worn. One drawer of four holds matching black and white designed bags for the beach or pool. The closet has a counter and seat with a make up mirror and hairdryer. Bug spray and a flashlight were kept in a basket here. We didn't use the bug spray while we were there but we did avoid being outdoors at dusk. In the bathroom a separate tiled room has a toilet, and behind another glass door is a tiled steam shower. Sliding glass doors open to the outdoors to another completely private large soaking tub. Around the corner from the tub is an outdoor shower. Back at the gated entry are steps to the second level. There's a lounge area, with a couch, 2 massage tables for spa treatments, another outdoor shower and a sink. Views of the surroundings are a sight to see on the second level but somehow the design maintains the private oasis of your villa and the surrounding villas, too. Across from the bedroom is your living area with another big screen TV, and a dvd/cd player. There\u2019s a table with 4 chairs, a wine refrigerator and mini-bar. There\u2019s an espresso machine with Illy coffee and Tea Forte teas. Water and fruit are complimentary. There\u2019s a comfortable couch as deep as a bed with throw pillows. Our only suggestion for the living space here would be to add easy outlet access to plug in a computer. My husband commented how much he relaxed and actually enjoyed working out of this room. The spa pool villa is \u2018sensational. \u2019 As visually pleasing as the spa pool villa design and d\u00e9cor is with it\u2019s contrast of light and dark, there is incense to burn, and aromatic oils wafting in your living space while soothing music is playing in the background. This \u2018sensationalism\u2019 carries over to the spa, restaurants, beach, and in fact, the entire resort! Housekeeping did an exceptional job keeping the villa in tip-top shape. We enjoyed talking to Eric who was so accommodating. Lee, when she found our bathing suits and cover-ups draped on the outdoor tub, went and brought back some extra hangers and hung up the wet clothes to dry. Turndown service was reliable and I enjoyed seeing what little gift we would discover when we returned to our villa at night. Breakfast was included with our rate and we ate at a bountiful breakfast buffet at the Oriente. What\u2019s not at the buffet can be ordered off a menu. Lorena, Moises, Elena, Raphael, and Jorge were some of our excellent servers. The manager, Otto, greeted us everyday and even carried our plates from the buffet to our table. Dinner our first evening was at Saffron, Banyan Tree's signature Thai restaurant that overlooks the lagoon. We enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and service so much we returned night after night. Nadia was our waitress the first night and was so gracious. She, and the other staff, Alberto, Bernardino, the Thai chefs, the resort manager, Mr. Peter, in fact all the employees we met there made for an exceptional dining experience. Saffron is about as perfect an example of what attentive yet unobtrusive service is all about. Ramon, Ricardo, and every driver we encountered offered a friendly greeting and asked about our day. The resort seemed so spread out riding the buggy around. After we figured our way around we found out how close we actually were to the spa and restaurants. Trek bikes were a lot of fun to ride around the resort. The security guards along the paths are great to keep you from making a wrong turn and help you find your way to the beach. There\u2019s a scenic boat ride you can take from the lobby through the canals to the beach. We smiled when music was played even on the boat as we departed from the dock. One of the highlights of our stay was a couple\u2019s Bali massage in the spa. One 90-minute massage was included with our hotel stay. Ping and Seen, from Thailand, gave us one of the best massages we\u2019ve ever had. I had a birthday while at Mayakoba. If you get the chance, your birthday will be made into an enjoyable day! Thank you, Fernando, at Sands for the prize-winning melon drink created in a melon carriage! Thank you, to the staff at Saffron for the delicious birthday cake. That cake alone was worth the trip! Every single employee we came across at the resort offered us exceptional service. We wish we had written down all their names to acknowledge them all. The luxury we experienced at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba is memorable and is now one of our all time favorite vacations.

I wasn't sure what to make of an Asian resort in Mexico, but it turns out that the fusion of Mayan architecture and aesthetics with Thai ambience and service is a natural and wonderful combination. The result is something very special. Here are the highlights: 1. The Villas--It doesn't get much better than this. They are beautifully appointed and have huge infinity pools. The blend of indoor and outdoor space makes for a private oasis. I traveled with my parents and we stayed near the beach, first in a two bedroom that was very secluded and private, and then we were upgraded to a beach front. The turquoise waters of the Caribbean greeted us every morning. I have stayed at other Banyan Trees, almost all the Aman resorts, and many other deluxe resorts and these villas top the list. Every night they leave a little gift with the turn down service--a coin purse or a Mayan sachet--my Mom loved it. 2. The Restaurants--We loved the food! The breakfast buffet in Oriente was perfect. A broad selection always fresh and beautifully presented was complimented by delicious a la carte selections. The service was so friendly and prompt. I don't think I've ever been to a place where quite so many staff immediately new my name and were tuned into our days plan, etc. Very attentive. If there were even the slightest hiccup, it was corrected immediately and so effectively that I can't recall it. Saffron was the best Thai food I've had outside Thailand. The setting is really quite magical as if you're having dinner in a Thai boat on the water of a canal. Tamarind has healthy fare presented in a warm setting. We found a great deal of variety at the resort and felt that we had plenty of options for the week. The President of Mexico stopped by during our stay and it impeded things a bit and required them to close some venues. At the slightest suggestion of an inconvenience they agreed to specially open Sands at the Beach Club for dinner--problem solved before it even occurred. We loved lunch at Sands--great ceviche, quesadillas, salads, salmon. My parents are somewhat picky eaters but always found something they liked. A review or two has critiqued in-villa dining. While the menu is not extensive, we had room service several times and actually found those meals to be some of our favorites. They serve a spinach and chicken wrap that I could have eaten every day. We had dinner at the Rosewood Resort one night and enjoyed it but felt that the Banyan Tree food was superior and the service at Rosewood was quite slow (and suffered from the problem of over promising--ie. your food will be here in five minutes when it took fifteen). Still, nice to have other options nearby in the same compound. 3. The Amenities--A small but very well-equipped gym. I'm a workout hound and found everything I needed. The boat tour through the canals was just charming and a nice way to get around the resort when we weren't in a hurry. The bikes were great fun, too. Still, when we needed to get around fast, a golf cart would appear almost before we could request it. The golf course is beautiful (though quite challenging) and we had two good rounds. 4. Tours--We had them arrange a deluxe tour to Chichen-Itza and it was perfect. We had a great driver and a separate guide in an Escalade. It was planned perfectly. We went early, so in-villa dining had prepared breakfasts for us in the car--delicious breakfast burritos, fruit, juices, etc. At every stop we had a cool towel and some new treat--little sandwiches, candies, etc. The guide was deeply knowledgeable but also sensed how to gauge our level of interest. When we asked to visit Tulum on the return since we were passing by it, they agreed immediately and did so at no additional charge. Very classy! OVERALL--This is a place I hope to visit many times. The General Manager, Pancho Llamas, was extraordinarily kind, and Ed Diluca, the Food and Beverage Manager, was ever attentive. They are well on their way to building one of the best resorts you can imagine after only a very few months of operation. I applaud them. Some comparisons to the competition. Candidly, when I booked the Banyan Tree I had an aching feeling that when I saw the Rosewood or the Mandarin Oriental that I would get that sense of regret. Quite the contrary, while both are quite nice, neither meets the standard of the Banyan Tree. The Rosewood Villas are not true suites, but more junior suites and their plunge pools are very small relative to Banyan Tree. It is also more contemporary and doesn't quite fit the place with no real connection to the Yucatan or Mayan Culture. The Mandarin Oriental is also beautiful, but even more contemporary and actually quite cold (and I'm usually drawn to the more modern). It is long and narrow and outside of the Mayakoba compound which seems to be a real disadvantage.

(courtyard villas 201-204). Our concern was promptly addressed. We were a bit surprised when a few services failed us and have concerns about how service will hold up when the hotel is full (it was only 19% occupancy while we were there). The turn-down service was twice not completed during the 90 min interval in which we requested it be done, and also a wake up call did not materialize. Food is a bit limited. Saffron here is more authentic Thai than fusion as in other BTs. Menus in both Tamarind, Sands & Saffron are not extensive (and there is no Thai beer), but what they do have is done well. Room service menu also limited, but again, well done. Beware of the in-house tour desk, Maritour. For scuba & whaleshark snorkeling tours, they contacted only 2 possible operators and gave us incorrect information about what is available. Had we not gone out to Playa del Carmen ourselves to seek out other such operators, we would have not been able to do anything we had planned for this trip. Spa is also up to BT standards. The Yoga massage is unparalleled - and non-existent in any other spas in the Americas. The facials using natural ingredients as well. Service in the spa is impecable. The crowd tends to be trendy/ look-at-me types, but they're avoidable for the most part since everyone has their own villas.

My wife and I were craving a taste of Asia but could not bear the thought of an 18 hour flight to get there. However my wife had read about a promotion that the new Banyan Tree Mayakoba was offering, but we went to the web site to check the rates the system was down and was showing the hotel booked for the month of July. A bit frustrated, we looked at other resorts in the area. We considered both the Mandarin Oriental and the Rosewood, but we finally settled on the Rosewood. We were ready to book when I decided to e-mail the Banyan tree directly to see if there was any chance of a promotional rate ( I assumed that with such great rates the hotel was full). We received a quick reply from Grecia with unbelievable rates for our dates (the best villa at the Banyan Tree was being offered to us for the same rate as the lowest villa at Rosewood and for a 1/4 of what the Mandarin was offering). After reading every review on Trip Advisor it was a no brainer for us and we booked a spa suite villa for 7 nights with breakfast and 2- 90 minute spa treatments. Our Stay: Airport to Villa We took the option of having the hotel pick us up at the airport and were very happy to have done so, we were greeted by a BTMK driver and quickly escorted to a spotless Cadillac Escalade and whisked away to the resort. The experience started in the SUV, we were given cold scented towels and chilled water served in a BT Batik cloth holder, the SUV had a DVD playing that entertained us on the way to the resort. The driver spoke perfect English and was very informative along the way. $225 round trip may seem like a lot of money to get to and from the resort but it is worth it! When we arrived at the gates of Mayakoba we realized that this is going to be a special property, the shiny stainless steel Mayakoba sign is a beautiful contrast to the dark wood and white stone only to be complimented by impeccably planted Agave Azul plants ( Tequila) the gate is shared by the Rosewood, Fairmont and Banyan Tree ( there will be one more property managed by Viceroy but we were told that the construction had been stopped) Once through the gates you begin your journey through the jungle to the resort, they have done a fantastic job in damaging as little of the jungle to make room for the road. This area is also up lit at night. There are several security guards along the way giving you a sense that your safety is being well looked after. When we arrived at the resort we were overwhelmed with the beauty of the lobby area, you feel as though you are on a private island. The furnishings, art and lighting are sublime. We were greeted by Claudia who gave us another cold towel and a chilled cucumber juice (delicious) while she explained a bit about the resort; we were quickly taken to our villa in a golf cart and did the check in when we arrived. The Villa: The villas are actually a small compound consisting of a courtyard pool area, living pavilion, a separate building with the bedroom and bathroom and a roof top terrace. The d\u00e9cor is a fusion of Asian and Mayan with black slate floors, dark wood furniture accented by Mayan colored fabrics and deep wool carpet runners. Courtyard: This is the reason to take the Spa Pool Villa; once you enter through the gate you are overwhelmed with the size of the pool and Jacuzzi! The area faces the canal but is elevated and landscaped for privacy. The pool is stunning with cobalt blue mosaic tiles and an infinity edge; you can enter the pool via stairs from the courtyard or from the bedroom veranda. There is an oversized double sun lounger with a market umbrella there is also an outdoor table and chairs for eating but we never used it once as there is a slight mosquito problem in the evening. The pool and Jacuzzi are very private and were well used during our visit. (This sun lounger can use a cover as it rained the first 2 days that we were at the resort and the cushions were still wet 2 days later) Pavilion: The Pavilion is a 14\u2019x20\u2019 Asian inspired tea house with glass on 2 sides that opens to the courtyard and swimming pool areas. The amenities in the Pavilion are endless: Dining table with 4 chairs Extra large day bed with a sea of pillows and cushions (really comfortable, but could use some throws as the A/C can leave the room chilly when watching TV) 37\u201d Samsung flat screen TV, Phillips CD/DVD player Well stocked mini bar and a separate wine fridge stocked with a good selection of wines The BEST coffee and teas service ever! There is a Francis/Francis coffee machine with Illy coffee, and a separate water boiler to prepare the Tea Forte (one of my favorite teas) I wake up earlier than my wife and the Pavilion served as a great place to do my e-mails in the morning and a REALLY comfortable place to watch T/V in the evening Bedroom: The bedroom is very large with a King Sized bed topped with a featherbed mattress and lots of pillows of all densities! There is a large desk area suitable for a suite like this and an additional TV, we would have used a DVD player at night had there been one as the pay per view movies were just ok. The bedroom has glass on 2 sides that opens to the pool or a veranda overlooking the canal with a hammock. Bathroom: The bathroom is large but not too big; it has a round island area with 2 surface mounted Mexican sinks and a huge mirror that separates the two. There is a separate toilet room, shower with steam, a very large outdoor bath tub and a separate dressing room. The bathroom is well equipped with his and hers amenity bags, beach towels, beach bags, lightweight robes and heavier terry cloth robes, bedroom slippers, beach sandals, flashlight, and mosquito repellant. Roof top deck: The space is very nice and outfitted well but we never used it as it was too hot to have massages up there and we were happy to sit by the pool or in the Pavilion. The Senses: I think it is important to comment on how this resort has addressed the senses, the sights, smells and sounds have all been addressed and are without fault, everything from the furnishings to the staff uniforms are visually prefect, everywhere the sounds have been chosen carefully, the beach club has upbeat lounge music, the villas have tranquil Asian music that is playing when you arrive and after they do the turndown service. EVERYWHERE you go your sense of smell is stimulated, the cold towels, the resort restrooms, the gift shops, the oil burners in the bedroom and pavilion all have a scent of the day! This resort is Asian and has not missed a beat in keeping to the details! The Spa : The Spa at BTMK is unlike others as it is spread out over 3 separate areas, the Spa lobby is located on the lower area of the main building, and it is a large beautiful reception area but other than booking your treatments and checking in for them the area is really not used. The changing rooms are located in a separate building which is also where the rainforest is, and the treatment rooms are several separate pavilions located a short walk away along the canal. Our package included 2- 90 minute massages and I opted for the rainforest experience before one of them. The rainforest is a great experience and completely unique to the Banyan Tree resorts but in my opinion not worth the time or money, with the exception of the Aroma Steam and the Vitality pool it is just a series of showers and lights ( very beautifully done) and I felt completely water logged at the end. After the rainforest I had a 90 minute Balinese massage, I say 90 minutes but the actual massage is 60 minutes with a foot bath, tea and relaxing time making up the remainder of the time ( a bit misleading). Had this not been part of our package and I was paying $160 for a 60 minute massage I would feel slighted. Overall the spa and services are the tops but VERY expensive, one would think that if you are spending $160 on a 60 minute massage that the rainforest would be included as a pre or post spa treatment experience. One thing that I did find interesting is unlike other spas I was not pressured into buying overpriced product that I don\u2019t need! The Beach/Pool: The beach and pool at BTMK is absolutely stunning! We visited several resorts during our stay and none could even begin to compare with BTMK. The overall design is just beautiful ,everything is top quality and well thought out; the service is the best that we have ever had. They come by about every 15 minutes (not obtrusively) with cold towels, drink samples and little nibbles. When you leave your lounger to go in the pool or to go to lunch the pool attendant quickly changes your towels and freshens up the area. The little pillows for your head are a really nice touch. The pool is the nicest in the area, it is large and beautiful and the water seems to be the perfect temperature. The beach is much nicer and bigger than others in the area. Service; By the time we arrived the resort I think there were some cutbacks with the staff but I can say that everyone that we dealt with was very polite and willing to bend over backwards to make us happy or more comfortable. One of the buggy drivers said that he had worked at other resorts but never had the extensive training that Banyan Tree has offered; he mentioned that people came from Asia to train the local staff and this is apparent and well noted! We were in the villa one day when housekeeping was cleaning and they left no surface untouched they even mopped the stone under the sun loungers. Shopping: Unless you want typical touristy knick knacks don\u2019t waste your time going to Play del Carmen, the one street (5th Ave) is just one shop after the other selling the same junk. We also found the gift shop at the hotel to be a waste of space, 99% of the items for sale are the Banyan Tree items used throughout the resort. We had hoped that we could find some nice art and gifts like what is used throughout the resort but there was none to be found. Mexico is known for its arts and crafts and this was a big letdown. Service charges and taxes; I am always a big tipper especially for good service but I found myself a bit frustrated with the service charge policy. If you choose to add 15% to everything purchased at the resort (including the breakfast and spa treatments that come with the package) you should not feel like you need to leave more unless you receive exceptional service. Every bill that you get includes the service charge but also has a place for an additional gratuity which makes you feel like if you don\u2019t leave more you are being cheap. Food: I left this until last as this is where the Banyan Tree has failed (for the moment I hope) this is the type of resort that you can come to and never leave but we felt driven to leave just to find a better variety of restaurants. Saffron: We ate at Saffron the first and last night night and it was fantastic, the d\u00e9cor, food and service were all tops, but 2 times in 1 week is plenty for gourmet Thai food. Tamarind; We never ate at Tamarind as we just couldn\u2019t get it, the restaurant does not know what it is the menu is just a Hodge Podge of items with none of them exciting us enough to visit. Why they are serving Maine lobster in the Caribbean I will never know. The atmosphere is more lobby bar than resort restaurant. Oriente: Due to low occupancy this restaurant is only open for breakfast, as the breakfast was included in our package we took advantage of it. The buffet is beautiful and offers a great selection of fruit, juices, yogurts, cereals and breakfast breads. However the cooked breakfast was a letdown, the Mexican dishes were presented well but were not authentic. I love chiliquillas but these were just tortilla chips smothered in sauce served in a corn husk bowl. This really needs work, if we had paid the $47 pp ++ for breakfast I would have been very disappointed. In room dining: I can sum this up with 2 words \u201cdon\u2019t bother\u201d this was such a huge disappointment for us. Usually at other villa style hotels the in room dining menu is usually comparable with the restaurants, this menu is just plain boring and $35 ++ for a chicken wrap is ridiculous! We were offered the menu from Tamarind but we were not excited about that menu either. This needs a lot of work Sands: This is the resorts best dining option after Saffron but it is only open for lunch. The Mexican Pizza, Ceviche, Shrimp Tempura Tacos and Beef Tacos are all outstanding but there are only so many times that you can have this in one week. Food Overview: We spoke with several of the staff about the food and the menus and they seem to have heard this before and said that the menus are being reviewed based on guest\u2019s comments and will hopefully change. We found ourselves craving real Mexican food and fresh fish and seafood. We ate at the beach restaurants at both the Rosewood and the Mandarin Oriental and they were both very good but we had wished that we didn\u2019t have to leave the property to find a good selection of food. General Overview If you are looking for a high end villa resort with impeccable service I highly recommend you to stay at the BTMK, even if we were paying the full rate I feel the villas are levels above both the Rosewood and Mandarin Oriental resorts. However we would like to come back but only if we learn that the food issues are resolved. I hope that the comments about the food are taken as constructive criticism, if they sort this out there is no reason to stay anywhere else or to leave the resort during your stay. As much as we love the resort we will not return until we are assured that these issues are resolved", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cBanyan Tree Mayakoba is a dream come true!\u201d", "Author": "farfalla1", "ReviewID": "UR33400853", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 week and cannot get the Banyan Tree out of our minds! They had only a 15% occupancy level (i imagine it was due to the swine flu and low season) so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. They even upgraded our villa to show their appreciation for us being there. There was an amazing attention to detail in not only the cleanliness, decor, and landscaping, but also in the service as well. Everyone always asked how our stay was going and offered assistance with any minor difficulty. The staff was the most pleasant group of people in the world and I don't recall anywhere I've stayed where there was the same genuine, gracious hospitality. Just a few examples: upon our arrival, we were offered a refreshing cucumber drink, and were given a personal tour of the resort and our villa; the chef at Tamarind did not speak much English but made it a point to greet each guest after their meal. Another staff member offered us towels before we left the resort for an outdoor activity - a minor detail we hadn't thought of, but he fortunately was paying attention for us :) The Sands Beach Club staff was extremely accommodating, and always offering complimentary special drinks and snacks on the beach throughout the day. (and after taking a walk on the beach, my boyfriend and I agreed that it was the nicest beach club on the beach!) The villa we stayed in was immaculate, comfortable, and romantic. Having our own jacuzzi and pool in front of the lagoon was wonderful - we really felt at home (and wish we could live there). If you are thinking of booking Banyan Tree, don't hesitate!

I have fallen in love with the resort and the lovely people who work there. It has been a long time since I have been \u201cwowed\u201d by a property. My husband and I used to travel a lot, taking every opportunity to visit a Four Seasons property or a luxurious game lodge in Africa. Now that we have kids, we try to choose special destinations for the rare moments that we get away on our own. To say that we hit the jackpot on our tenth anniversary is an understatement. I knew we had arrived somewhere special before we opened our car doors--the fragrance of the day greeted us, taking me back to wonderful holidays in Thailand and Bali. The resort lobby is beautiful and sets the scene for a relaxing holiday with beautiful architecture, gorgeous light fixtures, furniture, and artwork, and a welcoming hostess. The entrance at the beach club is equally beautiful, but also offers that first glimpse of the cerulean sea\u2014it\u2019s breathtaking. Our room, the Spa Pool Villa, set the stage for a romantic and relaxing getaway. While the room is set away from the beach, we had a perfect location on a cenote (canal) that offered us many opportunities to see beautiful birds in a natural environment. The villa was centrally located, giving us easy walking or cycling access to all of the restaurants, spa, main pool, and other guest services. Getting to the beach from our villa was also very easy\u2014we either called for a cart, which always arrived promptly, or we took a boat from the main lobby (the boat is so fun and relaxing, allowing for a leisurely tour of the property). The bed had wonderful linens, the villa pool was the perfect temperature, the Jacuzzi and steam shower were optimal for relieving stress, and the outdoor tub and wall of candles\u2014sensual. Those were just the extravagant things that made the room extraordinary. Practically speaking, the two large flat screen televisions, the iPod dock, the couch/bed and the Francis Francis espresso maker with Illy coffee made me absolutely giddy. Breakfast at Oriente was a perfect way to start the day. The coffee was delicious. They offered a lovely selection of hot and cold items, everything delectable and flavorful. Most of all, the service was outstanding, with multiple servers making sure you always had a beverage or providing you with a helping hand to take your dishes to the table. We spent most of our days on the beach. It was hard to resist the mesmerizing ocean, sun and cloud-filled sky, and comfy lounge chairs. Service at the beach and beach pool was amazing. We were treated like special guests and wanted for nothing. We both loved having lunch on the beach: tacos, ceviche, guacamole, papas fritas\u2014all delicious. If it wasn\u2019t on the menu, they would do their best to get it for you. One afternoon, I wanted an iced coffee (not on the menu). Our server said, \u201cNo problem. I can make that for you.\u201d He brought me a delicious frozen coffee beverage that made me very happy. Saffron was our favorite restaurant on the property. I am half Thai so I appreciated having my comfort food so readily available. We ate there twice and found both meals perfect, and especially enjoyed the crispy grouper with green mango and the green curry with eggplant and heart of palm. We had fun and informative dinner conversations with the restaurant manager and enjoyed speaking with the servers and the chef. Service was excellent. A trip to the Banyan Tree cannot be mentioned without discussing the spa. This was truly a heavenly experience. The morning after our arrival, we had a couples treatment in a beautiful, private pavillion. What a great way to start a vacation. The body scrub, the steam shower, the massage itself--fantastic. I loved how we were treated and I felt great afterward. A visit to the spa is a must! The Banyan Tree Mayakoba is one of the most beautiful and serene resorts I have ever visited. The people who work there are extraordinary. If you want to relax and unwind\u2014this is the perfect place. I can\u2019t wait to get back there\u2026", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWas it all just a dream?\u201d", "Author": "TyRyIzzie", "ReviewID": "UR32188810", "Content": "Oh where to begin...Let me just start by saying this is one of the most fabulous resorts we have ever had the pleasure of visiting. We could go on and on for days describing the utter beauty the Banyan Tree Mayakoba exudes through it's supreme level of service, breathtaking architecture & exotic grounds. This place is special. No detail is spared down to the sounds and scents in your private villa. We enjoyed our stay so much we extended our trip twice totaling our time at the Banyan Tree to almost 3 weeks. Because of our extended stay we were able to sample 3 types of villas: The Courtyard, Spa and 3br Ocean Front. Every one of these villas exceeded our expectations ten fold and each possessed it's own charm and uniqueness. There is not an undesirable room on campus. The Courtyard villa is equipped with a spacious master suite/bath including an outdoor bathtub and shower. There were bath oils, salts and foam available outside as well as a wall filled with candles that when lit created a scenic backdrop. There is a separate pavilion on the opposite side of the outdoor pool, hot tub and lounge area. The pavilion included a large lounging sofa, TV, CD/iPod player, coffee station and dining table. The pool & lounge area were spacious, immaculately clean and the view of the lagoon was serene. The Spa villa included everything the Courtyard villa had but was slightly larger with an upper level terrace that included 2 massage tables. The view of the lagoon was more private than the courtyard villa because there were only mangrove trees across the water. The Ocean Front villa was spectacular, the beach was just a few steps away from the private infinity pool. Each of the 3 brs had it's own outdoor entrance, full bath and ocean view. The 2nd br located above the master was the equivalent of an addional master suite with a huge private balcony and the 3rd bedroom is located in the pavilion building. We were pleasantly surprised that the service staff from Sands including Alberto, Martin, Manuel, Eduardo, Jorge & Edgar paid visits to us providing drinks, towels and lunch right from our terrace. The grounds are laid out in such a way to protect the natural environment of the mangroves. Villas, pathways and wooden bridges naturally wind around the lagoons which are loaded with tropical fish, turtles and birds. We really got the feeling that we were lodging in the middle of an unspoiled rain forest...with uber luxurious amenities that is. We are major beach people so we were a little concerned with the distance of the beach from the interior villas prior to our arrival, we soon realized that our worries were completely unfounded. When venturing to the beach we had 2 convenient options, buggy or bike. Affectionately the staff pronounces buggy as \"boogy\". A quick call to guest services had a \"boogy\" at your villa door in less than five minutes, the same time frame applied when your days at Sands beach house had come to a close. We had many nice conversations with Rafaelle, Miguel and Efren on these trips. Each had wonderful recommendations for attractions and day trips as well as infinite knowledge of the resorts history and wildlife. Riding the bikes to the beach was a delightful and relaxing mode of transportation as well. Our bikes were always right outside of our villa door and never had to be locked up, even at the beach. If you collected too many shells to ride your bike back to the villa, a buggy would pick you up and the staff would return your bikes to your doorstep within minutes. The service level at the beach was incomparable. There were always 3 or 4 people waiting on us at all times. Our beach butler Jorge spoiled us with cold facial towels, ice water, and light conversation. Jorge was the hardest worker at the resort always making sure that everyone was enjoying themselves to the highest level. Somehow he always noticed when we were swimming, allowing him to place a fresh towel for us to dry off with once exiting the ocean or pool. Lunches at Sands were tasty with many options to choose from and the bartenders Efren & Allejandro were quite talented. Try the Sands Passion tropical drink, it's the cats meow. Our favorite restaurant on site was the Banyan Trees' signature Saffron. Tableside visits from Chef and Manager really made us feel special. The Thai food was some of the best we have ever had, the staff actually went to the extent of growing their own herbs used in food preparation. Every dish was fresh and cooked with affection. Try the Tom Yum soup or the chicken curry, you will not be disappointed. Breakfast at Oriente was one of our favorite meals of the day. The lovely Lorena elegantly greeted us every morning and provided us with freshly squeezed juices and a warm smile. Moises the service assistant treated us with tableside origami artwork which he ingeniously created during his down time, and the various servers were like old friends of ours by the end of our stay. Tamarind's spa food was also delicious, we particularly enjoyed the tabouleh and pancetta ravioli soup. It would be sacrilegious to visit a Banyan Tree and pass up the spa services. We each enjoyed three hour massage & body treatments in addition to an hour in the rainforest hydrotherapy rooms. The spa is definitely a splurge but lets put it this way...out of body experiences are priceless. We were spoiled so much at the Banyan Tree that we almost don't feel right leaving any negative comments. But being loyal Tripadvisor readers we feel we must mention that meals are very pricy at the resort. The quality is high and the food is well worth the price but financially you need to account for this extra cost because it does add up. I can't depart with out mentioning our resort hosts Ana Ruth, Sarah, Daphne & Claudia. Anything we needed they provided with enthusiasm and extreme professionalism. We had an incident with a credit card which caused us to have to have a new card Fed Exed from Chicago. Our card was held up in customs and the hotel actually went to Cancun and picked it up for us. This saved us immeasurable time and allowed us to avoid a potentially stressful situation. We also needed a lot of assistance rebooking our flights, making dinner reservations and organizing taxi rides. I know we were a handfull and these women went the extra mile giving 150% to make sure our vacation was something we would remember and treasure forever. All in all we can not wait to return to the Banyan Tree Mayakoba. We are engaged, have a honeymoon to plan and we can't fathom how to top this location. I guess we will have to try Banyan Tree Phuket.

The property itself is amazing but what sets the Bayan Tree Mayakoba apart from any other places we have been to is the exemplary service. To me, what differentiates good service from great service is what happens when a staff is presented with a request or opportunity that falls outside of the norm. Let me give you an example, we had decided to go for an impromptu swim in front of the Sands Beach Club. I removed my sandals about 3 meters away from the water line. When we came out, one of the staff had placed a table near my sandals with towels for us to dry ourselves off. As we headed back to our villa, the same person came out with cold hand towels for us to wipe our face and hands. On another occasion, my niece had to pay a visit to the hospital and Pedro from the Bayan Tree rode in his motorcycle behind the ambulance, in the rain to provide his assistance at the hospital. He then helped to chase down medicine at different pharmacies and did not leave till everyone was back in the resort\u2026at 3am! He was my personal hero that day. I won\u2019t spoil it for people by going into details but there are many surprises to be had. Make sure you take the boat ride along the river at least once. Make sure you ride the bikes that are provided. It was so much fun and it\u2019s a great way to discover the resort. Make sure you eat at the Safron at least once. I disagree with the reviewer that said that it is like any other Thai restaurant. I have spent a bit of time in Thailand and the Safron is one of the best. Try the Chilean Sea Bass. And if you do decide to get marry there, Yvonne is simply amazing. I don\u2019t know how she does it but she is has an eye for detail and was on top of everything. I would love to have her on my team managing projects. And she has such a great energy about her. On our last day, everyone was actually depressed that they had to leave. It was bizarre.
