The room was spacious. The staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating--the best we had in Europe!!! The breakfast was delicious. The pool was refreshing. We had access to the Internet in the lobby. The bad: It was far from Rome using public transportation--about 1 1/2 hours total. It was cheap, but a bit complex the first time. Anecdote: We were about to miss our train to Venice, so the hotel brought our luggage to the train station.

Our room was roomy and clean. The hotel ground was nicely landscaped and staff was quite helpful. The breakfast, which was included in the room charge, was very good. There is no Internet in the room. You would have to go to the hotel lobby and use it. The only complaint I have is that the hotel is too far away from the metro station. The hotel staff dropped us off at the metro station in the morning and we had to catch a bus from the station back to hotel in the evening. The bus stops about two blocks from the hotel. Next time in Rome, I think I would want to stay near to the City Center.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cGood value accommodation for short break\u201d", "Author": "Jet2traveller", "ReviewID": "UR7710930", "Content": "Reading earlier reviews I had begun to wonder if the location would be a problem. However, the directions given by the hotel are accurate and we had a straightforward train journey from Fiumicino airport to Settebagni (5.5 euros). We telephoned the hotel from the station and they came to collect us within minutes. Whilst the hotel is close to the ring road its garden does provide a good screen. You do notice the traffic noise out at the pool but it is not so noticeable from the rooms. Our room was situated in the main part of the hotel and was large, clean and comfortable. The manager was very helpful and gave useful advice about transport and what to see. We made use of the courtesy car to Saxa Rubra each morning. It is then only a 15 min train journey into Flaminio station. From there you can walk to nearby attractions or take the underground to those that are further afield. We bought a Roma Pass (from Tourist Office) which includes a 3 day travel pass and free entry into 2 museums. You can use it at the Colliseum and bypass the long queues. To return to the hotel from Saxa Rubra you catch a 302 or 334 bus. They seem to connect quite well with the trains. When we asked if the hotel could take us to a nearby restaurant we were taken to one which was situated near a camp site at the other side of the ring road. It had a pleasant terraced area overlooking the river. There was plenty of choice and it was inexpensive. Apparently, you can get a lift back but we walked back to the hotel in 5 mins. Having eaten in Rome on our second night we readily returned to this restaurant on our final evening. After seeing how busy it was in central Rome we were quite glad that we had chosen a hotel that was a bit further out and felt it was a bonus having the pool after a long day's sightseeing! This hotel was very reasonably priced and really was good value. The hotel website is reasonably accurate but the park it refers to is simply the hotel garden.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "North England", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, Clean and Refreshing\u201d", "Author": "MattNickyUK", "ReviewID": "UR7474365", "Content": "If your like us and worry about the Hotel you have booked and if it is going to be up to scratch and Cleanliness is a big thing in my book as with most people then you do not need to worry. Eurogarden is spotless!!! However the location was the only downfall of our four day break. We arrived at the airport (CIA) and because it was so late at night we opted for a taxi. The taxi ran on a meter and the driver spoke very little English. He told us depending on traffic that it would be around 40 to 45 Euros that was after saying to us \u2018to you..60 to 70 Euros\u2019 I think he caught a glimps of my kind friendly British face change into a woman possessed through his mirror. Once at the Hotel, meter read 39.40. BEWARE.. our taxi driver kept a hotel member of staff talking without turning the meter off. He told us we owed him 42 of 45 Euros. Apparently they charge you one Euro extra for each piece of baggage they put in the back of the car. Journey time from airport with easy traffic about 20 mins. Hotel Staff Very Very friendly, manager speaks pretty good English. We asked if we could have a cottage and he was happy to oblige to no extra cost. Breakfast is Yummy. All set out at 7.30 until 10.am. Consists of Croissants and other goodies along with hot milk and coffee. Most enjoyable. The Hotel offers a free shuttle to the local train station. You can book yourself in for a time but they are very lenient. Brace yourselves.. A certain member of staff drives like a typical Italian. We felt like we were on a rollercoaster ride. So buckle up. Speak to the Hotel Manager about buses and trains and tubes. He is very helpful and he will give you maps and books. At the train station investing in a three day pass for 11 Euros would benefit you. (MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS TICKET STAMPED ON THE TRAIN. THERE IS A MACHINE ON TRAIN. IF YOU DO NOT THEY CAN CHARGE YOU FROM 50 TO A 100 EURO\u2019S. ONCE STAMPED YOU DO NOT NEED TO STAMP IT AGAIN.) I found the trains and tubes in Rome were much easier to understand and get about than London. On arriving back to go to Hotel you can catch the 302 and 334 bus back. Ask the Hotel where to get off because the drivers speak no English at all. You do not need to pay as long as you have your three day pass and they never asked to see ours. Eurogarden is surrounded by a vast park of greenery\u2026 if you find it let me know. Whilst on the bus you pass the sign for Eurogarden as your going right round in a circle before getting off at the bus stop. We could not see vast greenery. Before our bus stop we did see a bunch of prostitutes. That\u2019s where they stay, they come no where near the hotel area. When you get off the bus you have a 3min walk to the Hotel. Still looking for the vast park of greenery all we could see was other hotels, and an area not so pretty as our hotel grounds. On reaching the hotel you feel like you have stepped into another world and you forget about where it is situated. The Hotel grounds its self ARE surrounded by greenery, Very Very Beautiful. Hotel Pool lovely and very clean. There is no evening restaurant in the hotel and there are no shops to buy snacks. Infact there is nothing. The hotel does offer a free shuttle up till 10pm to a local restaurant that you would not be able to walk to so don\u2019t even try. The restruant is very nice but expensive. The staff there take you back anytime up until midnight. If you are a couple who are taking no children., and don\u2019t mind catching transportation in and out of Rome and want a nice clean tranquil place to chill out after walking around the city of Rome all day.. Then Eurogarden is the Hotel for you.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ystad", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "hotelbuster", "ReviewID": "UR5602854", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel located in the suburbes of Rome. It is not always that easy to get to the city centre, but it is not impossible with public transportations. There are two busses 302 and 334 that takes you to Saxa Rubra metro station. Note: Sometimes the busses goes according to the time table (every 15 min) but sometimes you can wait for an hour! The hotel has a service in the morning that takes the hotel guests to the metro. The last metro leaves Rome at 22.40. After that you have to use a cab to get to the hotel. But remember: many of the taxi drivers don't know the way to the hotel som be observant. The hotel has cards to decsribe the way! The rooms are very nice and the hotel staff is very helpful and friendly. The manager has some similarities to Basil Fowlty, but that is a bonus!

It is so easy to get to by Rome's transport. I read that review before I went and was nervous as to what I was to expect! But to get in and out of Rome (which I suggest is not done by car) you get a bus to the station (can buy a 3 day 11 euro ticket or 7 day 16 euro ticket) we did the latter. Then a 15 minute train ride in. Im certainly not one for public transport but this was so easy and so regular and the hotel gave us a handout with all the times of the buses and trains. The last train is 22.40 but you can get a taxi from the Termini station to the hotel. It was wonderful to stay in a hotel away from the centre and it was set in the most pretty setting, truly feels a home away from home and Rome can feel small and I felt lucky to be staying slighty away from the centre. The breakfast was so well done, plenty of choice and all of it tasted wonderful. The staff were so friendly and polite and the rooms were huge and well cared for!I will miss the Hotel Eurogarden and hope to go back there soon!!", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eurogarden", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d237187-Reviews-Eurogarden-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$94 - $129*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Salita del Castel Giubileo 197</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Grande Raccordo Anulare, Exit 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00138</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237187", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f2/4f/c2/eurogarden.jpg"}}
