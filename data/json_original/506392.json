The only plus point from staying in the Basilica S. paolo neighborhood is the very relaxed atmosphere, also good is that you pass by Piramide metro station on the way back from central Rome and there is an abundance of good food in the Testaccio vicinity. Da Felice, Augustrello, Da Bucatino and Volpetti for their deli goods. The room is alright, clean and functional, water is nice and hot and decent sized.

In fact, we kind of got lost trying to find it as we were roaming neighborhoods well outside the tourist hotspots. Also, it is about a 10 min walk from the closest metro. Oh, and it wasn't just us lost. Locals near the station weren't even aware of it so it really wasn't big by any means. All that said, once we found it and got settled in we were pretty happy. It's a nice walk to/from the metro once you know where you are headed. I kind of liked the charm of being in a quite part of town and just seeing people roaming about their normal day-to-day lives. Also, the hotel is cute, but very small. Nothing too fantastic really, pretty standard, but it was clean and I knew what I was getting into for the price/other reviews.

We arrived at Roma Termini railway station. From there it was a Metro ride (about 15-20 minutes) to Basillica San Paulo and from there a ten minute walk to the hotel. Check-in was good and the man at reception spoke good English and gave us a fantastic tourist map of Rome and highlighted the main tourist sites. We found that this map was more helpful than the guidebook that we had purchased before leaving home ! Our room was clean and located on the top floor (the 5th). The complaints we have about the room are 1) 1 pillow per person. This was quite flat and an additional pillow would have been welcome. 2) The hot air heater was sometimes not sufficient to keep the room warm. It was a choice of either having a noisy heater on all night or allowing the room to become somewhat chilly. I suppose, with hindsight, we should have asked for a blacket and extra pillows. Brekfast was very good. Lots of choice. Ham, cheese, eggs (hard boiled and scrambled) and sausages (hot dog type). Tea, coffee, lots of fresh fruit. Cakes, biscuits and much more ! Wi-Fi is in the hotel but is chargeable. There's a computer in the reception area that guests may use the internet free of charge - however they suggest no more than 15 minutes of use to allow other guest to access the service.

For three nights bed and breakfast it was very reasonably priced (including flights we paid \u00a3224 each for the holiday).

The Colosseum is only four stops away, and we found that from here you could walk to the majority of sites from here. However I would recommend buying a Roma pass for \u20ac25 which gives you 3 days free transport on all of the transport in Rome, as well as free entry to two museums or archaeological sites, and discounted entry after that. As we used ours for entry to the Colosseum and Roman Forum (which are \u20ac12 each) and used the metro about four times a day, we saved a lot of money with the Roma pass! As for the rooms in the hotel, they were very small, but there was everything you needed, including a large double bed (which is probably why the room seemed so small!) it was a clean, well decorated room, but to be honest all we needed was a bed, as most of the day was spent out exploring the city!

Hotels and b&bs in the centre of Rome tend to be overpriced and generally of a terrible quality. I read an extensive range of online Roman hotel reviews and from recommendations from Italian friends, Hotel Saint Paul seemed like an excellent option. \u2026. And boy was I happy with my selection! The hotel itself is around 8-10 mins walk from Basilica San Paolo station. When you have been walking around the entire city all day a short walk to the hotel from the station will not be an issue despite some reviews on this site. The station is also relevantly placed on Line B which during the engineering works (till 2012) remains open till late. The Hotel is situated in a quiet residential area close to the University, The area is not rough or dodgy, it just has the inner city charm that most residential areas do. There are a range of amenities close to the station including coffee shops, restaurants and Internet cafes. When looking for places to stay, I also recommend looking in the areas of Piarmide, San Paolo or Maglianne all on Line B and a max of 6 stops from the centre! The hotel is clean, tidy, and modern and feels really fresh. The hotel staffs were exceptionally professionally, helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet has a huge selection of continental food to set you up for the day, and on a Saturday served till 11am. The rooms are clean and tidy, could be a little more spacious (but you are in the middle of a inner city tower block). The only few down sides were the one single small window, so use this as an excuse to get out the room and explore the city! My partner and I were sharing two twin beds joined together, which during the night would shuffle apart. The TV channels only show Italian TV, again another excuse to get out and see Rome.

It was a good 15 minute walk from the metro station to the hotel, and in a sketchy neighbourhood. The first night we walked back from the metro station at about 11:30pm and there weren't many cars around the station as its not on a main road. When we got to main road we passed a hooker, and later a couple of men just hanging around the streets. For the remaining nights we had no problems as we took the number 170 bus back to the hotel at night, which took about half an hour from Capitaline museum. The bus dropped us off on the main road, and then it was about a 5 min walk to the hotel. The 170 bus also leaves from Termini and the Colosseum, roughly every 20 or 30 minutes. Being first time visitors to Rome it was hard to work out the bus schedules as we couldn't find a bus timetable, and even more difficult to locate the correct bus stop for the bus number.

Since the room was right behind the lobby and kitchen, we could hear every sound.It was raining when we arrived and you could hear the water cascading down. It was awful.

From Ciampino you have a few options of getting to the city and hotel. The best option we found was to take the direct shuttle bus service (\u20ac5) to Termini station (45 mins). The metro in Rome is basic but easy to follow as there are only 2 lines (A & B). Make sure to take the B line (blue) heading to Laurentina and get off at Marconi (15 mins). Tickets cost \u20ac1 for 75 mins, \u20ac4 for a day pass and \u20ac11 for 3 days. On exiting the metro station turn right and walk for 10 mins along the main road. The hotel is down a side street on the left just before the university block. Firstly the positives: Rooms are small but very clean with a great bathroom and shower. Small balcony with views of the west of Rome. Safe, mini bar and basic channel TV. Staff very helpful. Breakfast more than adequate. Negatives: Some may find the location a problem, we didn't. Also there are only a few snack bars nearby so eat in Rome. That's it!

The reviews on trip advisor, expedia etc were mixed (when aren't they), but overall positive; personally, I'd say the hotel was adequate, but not one that you'd have especially fond memories of. The location is 'interesting'; in among universtity buildings, there is a convenience store, basic-looking restaurant and a tyre and battery store(!) just across the main road, but not much else. For ATMs, bars/cafes, shops etc, the nearest are at St Pauls Basilica. This also the location of the nearest metro station. The walk between the hotel and metro/shops is between 5 and 10 minutes and along mainly residential type roads. We felt perfectly safe and unthreatened doing this walk at midnight, but I guess it depends on your own perspective/experiences. Trains from St Pauls are frequent, cost a euro and take about ten minutes to the colosseum metro station (Metro line B). The hotel itself is not what I would call 4*. It is more like a good 3*. Positives first; the staff were really good and very helpful. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean. Good showers, firm beds, nice towels, sheets etc. Generous breakfasts catering to most reasonable needs (although the coffee 'vending machine' was a bit naff). The negatives; the rooms? The first one we had was very small with a powerful smell of masked smoke. I asked if there was a room with more space and they changed it for us the next day without problems. The snag was we returned to a much larger room with no smell, but also very little light as it had only a tiny window!! I could/should have complained again, but just resigned myself to what we had. Looking at the floor plans, my guess is that the hotel has more 'duff' rooms than 'good' ones. There are three at the front on each of the five floors that have balconies, and althought they probably wouldn't have spectacular views, I am sure that if you had one of these your stay would be much more enjoyable. The other main snag with the hotel and what I think makes it more of a 3* was the lack of facilities; there is a small bar/coffee bar in the reception area, but no lounge, no restaurant, no outdoor area/terrace etc (unless you include the one bench outside the front door!). The problem with this of course is that if you do get one of the dodgy rooms, and we had two, there is nowhere really you can go and sit and relax and forget about it. As to the location, a positive or negative, depends if you only want to see the touristy bits or like taking a bit of a peek at some of the outside bits of the city.

As our stay was during the Roman holiday period, this actually proved to be an advantage as the surrounding area was very quiet. We are a reasonably young couple so the vicinity of the public transport network was not really a problem, however families with either young or elderly members may find the distance to the Metro station, approx quarter of a mile, a little offputting especially as you need to cross 3 main roads - if you`ve seen Roman driving you`ll understand what I mean!! For a day trip to the Vatican or any of the sights on the West of the City, the 23 bus stop is literally just around the corner and arrives every 15 mins or so. The hotel itself is a small hotel with friendly staff and nicely presented rooms containing everything you need if a little on the small side. The rooms are cleaned daily to an immaculate standard not the quick once around you sometimes find which I was personally very impressed with. The inclusive breakfast caters for all nationalities of travellers and features everything you could possibly wish for and plenty of it! Again the catering staff that set and reset the tables ( the food is self service) are very friendly and accomodating. I only have a couple of complaints, and believe me these would in no way stop me from staying at the hotel again. The services offered section of the hotel brochure in the room states that a snack bar is available however when we attempted to use the service, the hotel receptionist looked at us as if we were from Mars! It turns out that the only thing the hotel can offer is toasted sandwiches that are obviously kept in the bar freezer and they didn`t have any anyway. I know this sounds petty but when you realise that the nearest decent place to eat is a quarter of a mile walk away and it was late, this meant we had to then get ready especially - after a very long days sightseeing. The hotel states there is satellite tv in all rooms, however the channels consist of mostly italian programs, MTV and CNN news. Again a little petty but when I read sat tv, I normally expect a whole host of multi lingual channels. On the whole I would recommend this hotel to friends and family in a shot but would simply highlight a coulpe of points too.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, spotlessly clean, pity about the area it's in...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5436963", "Content": "Just returned from the Hotel Saint Paul in Rome and I came away with almost all fond memories. The hotel suggests using the metro from Rome Termini, where most of you will end up when arriving in this great City and to be honest this really is the only way to travel in Rome especially to a hotel which is quite abit away from Rome City centre. Using the metro line b (i think) 'Laurentina', stopping at the 'Marconi' stop is the easiest, fastiest and prettiest way to arrive at the hotel. The hotel suggests getting off at the stop before 'Marconi' which is called 'Basillica Sao Paulo' - This is a major mistake because the area surrounding this metro stop is disgusting. There are alot of dodgy people that seem to constantly loiter around this station, its best avoided. Uisng the metro the hotel is about 20 mins away from the centre of Rome, thats including a 7 min walk from the metro to the hotel. The area is abit run down, its close to a major and very busy road but its grand, we had no trouble whatsover. Myself and my girlfriend walked this road at 3am a few nights during our stay coming back from Rome and out of the few people on the road, none even raised their head. Its true that there are a few ladies of the night that operate close to the Marconi metro but they keep themselves to themselves and it seems to be ignored by the Romans, it seems the norm. The hotel itself is really quite nice, the staff are awesome, they really go out of their way to help. The rooms are quite small but adequate and they are the cleanest rooms i have ever stayed at. The breakfast is brilliant, the spread includes eggs, sausage, bacon, crossiants, toast, orange, tea, fruit, cold meats, cheese, yogurt...and so on. The perfect way to start the day. I admit as we walked from Basillica Sao Paulo metro in the evening before we had even arrived at the hotel my girlfriend and I were deciding what excuse to use when cancelling but we gave it a chance and in the light of day we realised that the hotel is lovely, the area is run down but safe and the metro is a god send. Priceless advice - Dont use the Basillica Sao Paulo metro stop, use the one after which is called 'Marconi'. As you leave the metro you are facing a big busy road, cross it and head to your right. You pass stalls selling fruit and drinks, keep walking for about 7mins max and the hotel is on your left hand side..i think its about the 5th turn on the left (you'll see the flags at the side of the hotel). And ask the shop keepers. They really appreciate an attempt at using Italian as well. If your going into Rome at night, the metro stops at 11.30pm so the only way back to the hotel is by night bus which runs from 12.30pm - 5.30am in the morning. Look for Bus no. 40 or 40N (and don't worry too much about a ticket, we didnt but a ticket once, no one seemed to lol). The bus stop is along the road side on your right as you face the termini station, set off from the rest of the bus stands. Ask police that are at the station or bus drivers for help. Its advisable to ask the driver to call you when close to the Marconi stop. They are really helpful that way. All in all a lovely hotel, pity about the location but using the metro and bus you can enjoy all Rome has to offer and come back to a very nice, clean, comfortable room at the end of your day. I would stay here again but I think next time i'm gonna try and experience staying at a hotel closer to the action. Goodluck ps. get a Colloseum/Palantine Hills tour for at most 20euro...alot better than checking it out on your own.", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNice, Clean, a little out of town\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5181127", "Content": "The hotel was nice, but we did have a problem when checking in, we had specified a room with balcony which was clearly stated in our booking print out.

The room was a nice size but the bathroom is really small - no tub only very small shower cubicle.

I probably would not stay here again because it was too far out of the main town attractions but it only costs 1 euro for a tram ticket, at night time though the cab cost can be high and cost us nearly 70 ish euro over 4 days. We booked tickets to the Rome Opera House and found that coming back to the hotel would be pointless, its far, its costly, and we would be rushing to see the sights and get to the Opera House on time - so couldnt nip in and take quick showers and instead had to carry a change of clothes - main disadvantage to this hotel.
