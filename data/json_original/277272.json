We had a family of five. Parents, husband and wife, and one other. We needed a room that could accommodate all of us. We booked a two floor suite that on the website showed a king size bed upstairs along with two single beds, and a pull out couch downstairs that slept two. Upon arrival, we found that there was not a couch downstairs, only a single bed. This destroyed our plan and caused for some very awkward sleeping arrangements. The hotel is supposed to be 'high tech.' This could not be any further from the truth. They do a great job of making everything look high tech, but it is quite the opposite. They do provide you with a computer in the room. However, this computer is completely worthless as it takes approximately 40 minutes just to turn it on. They did provide free wireless internet...good thing we actually brought a laptop. The room was an absolute mess. All of the walls were dirty and/or destroyed. The stairs in the room was extremely steep and this likely caused people to struggle while taking luggage up and down, thus causing holes to appear in the walls. We also had some minor graffiti on one of the walls in our bedroom. The location of the hotel is really great, however, the street that it is on is terrible. We had to navigate through unruly groups of youngsters on numerous evenings just to get to the hotel door. It seems that the street the hotel is on is a bit of a hang out for local kids and there is a gentleman's club across from the hotel, which also attracts some unsavory people. The beds were extremely uncomfortable. In fact, my wife was very disturbed when she found that her sheets were riddled with rips and tears. The final night that we were there the entire room smelled like cigarette smoke, and none of us are smokers. The one good thing about the hotel was the staff. They were all very friendly and very accommodating. They gave us great recommendations on food and made our stay as enjoyable as they could. While this area of Madrid is definitely the hot spot, there are plenty of hotels around and the High Tech Cliper should be off of your list as potential suitors.

We were in a family room, 1 queen size bed and 2 bunks. The beds were very comfortable. I would have been nervous if someone had needed to sleep on the top bunk though, as there was no railing. Our room faced the street so I was happy to find out that the windows blocked virtually all of the street noise. The room was small by American standards, but we only used the room to sleep, so the size was not a big deal. When we were at the hotel during the day, we found that the lounge area in the lower level of the hotel was very comfortable. There was at least one laptop available for internet access for hotel guests and a large TV. We did not attempt to use the safe, so I cannot speak to that issue. The room did have a mini fridge that we stocked with our own pop and juice. The bathroom was very nice - clean and modern. Regarding phone calls, I needed to make 2 emergency calls to the US. One lasted over 30 minutes so I was extremely worried what the eventual cost would be. I was \"pleasantly\" surprised at checkout to find that it only cost about 38 Euros. I was expecting far worse!

Our room was clean but a little too small even for European standards. The hotel staff was for the most part helpful. A couple, in fact were extremely helpful and friendly. We tended to wait for these staff members to come on duty to ask for help. Each room had a safe, but the funny thing was the safes were not bolted down. I was having problems with my safe and actually had to carry it down to the front desk to prove it did not work to one of the hotel staff members who kept trying to tell me that the problem was with the user, not the safe. The biggest problem, however, were the \"extremely\" thin walls between rooms. Madrid is a 24 hour city with people coming and going all hours of the night, especially on the weekends. And we heard everyone of them...sometimes even the conversations that were going on at the front desk four floors below us. For those needing a cheap place to stay before catching an early morning flight (we had a huge family of 30 kids and adults one evening that fell into this category), this hotel is probably a great value. If you are planning on spending more than a day or two, consider another hotel, maybe one in a quieter part of town. Also, regardless of the hotel, if they promote family rooms it doesn't mean you will be on a floor with families. It only means the rooms sleep more than two people which could mean you will be sleeping next to a group of teenagers or young mom's from Ireland who like to laugh and talk for hours. By the way, I hope the mom from Ireland's baby is feeling better.

We booked two adjoining rooms, one for me, my wife and two kids, the other for my in-laws. The two rooms were the same size but our room had bunk beds for the kids which made the room rather small. If you have kids I suggest you get a suite but one wasn't available when we booked. The rooms were very clean and reasonably quiet. Service was excellent. Everyone who worked at the hotel was lovely and really did their best for the guests. They were also very honest as when I left my credit card at the front desk the receptionist phoned my mobile to let me know not to worry! Breakfasts were very good and well worth the money and you can have free tea or coffee all day til 9pm and there are two computers on the internet for free. They have a secure room where you can leave luggage and this was very useful as our flight wasn't until the evening. A couple of gripes about the service though are that they were pretty hopeless at email communication, though excellent when rung and English speaking, and that they couldn't arrange us to be picked up by taxi from the airport, so we got ripped off.
