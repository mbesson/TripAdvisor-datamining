Luckily there was a ilft as the stairs looked a little daunting! I would recommend this little hotel. It's clean and tidy and not far from the centre. Get a train to the Amsterdam central. Tram 1,2,5 to Leidseplein, and the hotel is a short walk from there. Amsterdam it's self is a great city. You need to hire a bike! We hired from Mac bikes which was priced at approximately 15 euro per day, but the longer you had it the cheaper it is. The Red Light area is shocking! And a little sad. Anne Frank house; queue or order online to beat the queue. Everything is expensive, and the best place to drink is in little pubs in Jordaan, where you meet the locals for a friendly chat.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southport, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget choice in a great location, 10 minutes from Leidseplein.\u201d", "Author": "petejonno", "ReviewID": "UR125811384", "Content": "Stayed here with friends in a triple room in November 2011.

It is about a 20 to 30 minute walk to the centre and the red light district etc, but hotels I have stayed in which were closer to the center have always seemed to be a much lower standard than this, despite costing more. Nearby is a Lidl supermarket which was very handy and much cheaper for basic supplies than your averadge corner shop. There are gorgeous canals and parks close by and a general laid back feel to the area, away from most of the tourist traps. The hotel itself is a small, family run place and is quite basic, but very clean, and the owners were very polite and helpful and seemed happy to have you staying with them. The room was great and had everything we needed, and the bathroom was recently renovated and to a very high standard.

Within minutes of checking in I was treated to construction noise overhead which went on to 5:30pm with no sign of stopping. As I had hoped to get some rest in the afternoon I asked the receptionist what was happening & when it would stop. This is when the fun began. Turns out they were remodelling the room immediately overhead and the workers weren't leaving any time soon, and they were planning on starting again at 7am the next day. The receptionist didn't seem to understand that I wanted a quiet room & was completely unhelpful. After a lengthy and increasingly frustrating conversation he very grudgingly agreed to change my room - but only for 2 of the 3 nights I had booked. He had no solution for the 3rd night & didn't seem to care if I wound up sleeping on the street. While I was trying to figure out my options, I also discovered that the workers were smoking while they worked.

The room was small (to be expected of course!) and clean. It had everything we needed! The only downfall with this specific room (room 1) is the noise coming from the street/main entrance below. the window was old and didn't seal properly, so we could hear the smoker's conversations coming from outside at the front entrance, which really wasn't that much of an issue... The breakfast is good and simple: bread (toast), cheese, cold cuts, cereal, pastries, etc. Our second time around we were in room 3, which faces the back of the building. This room was very quiet, and the room (and washroom)was a little bigger than the first one we had stayed in. Again, this room was also very clean.
