This hotel has a very nice heated indoor pool, but we never used it. By choosing the Grand Victorian, we missed several hotels with lower rates, better locations and real honest to goodness hot breakfasts. The room was comfortable and clean. Gaudy Victorian furnishings and wallpaper fit the theme. Tea time between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. didn't interest us. Traffic was scary day and niight trying to get on highway 76 - we were never told about the back exit of the parking lot. And now the breakfast. We arrived on a Friday - they offered waffles (long line and we never got one), a watery mixture of scrambled eggs and ham. They ran out of doughnuts by 8:30 and never restocked. White bread for toast but no jams or jellies. Coffees were lukewarm. The orange juice dispenser suddenly went \"out of order\". A big pot of canned fruit cocktail was the centerpiece of the breakfast. Yum. Anyway, we figured maybe we'll get Waffles if we go early on Saturday. HA! No waffles on Saturday. Instead they offer more of the same fare as Friday, plus some tiny biscuits out of a bag. All in all, the hotel was clean, fairly quiet. Staff was seldom seen, but maybe thet's just as well.

The indoor pool had alot of chlorine and I wished I had told the front desk about it just so they would know and could fix it. The hot tub was in great need of a cleaning....there was brown stuff floating in the foam. I'm sure if notified the hotel would take care of it!! The staff was really friendly!

On the days we woke up in time (very late nights + very comfy beds + being away from home and work = sleeping in!), we enjoyed a warm breakfast - not just coffee and toast, but eggs, waffles, biscuits and gravy, yogurt, oatmeal, bagels, cappucino, juice...(and the coffee was brewing 24/7 - I know cuz I had some in the middle of the night on several occasions). We even met Hank Williams one morning at breakfast!

So a year or so later we set out from Onalaska, Wisconsin to drive to Branson Missouri. We finally were able to leave about 7:00 a.m.. I had to call and let the check-in and the Hotel know I was coming in late. As we finally got closer the weather looked bad, it was raining and I fally picked up a packet that was left for me and we drove to the hotel Grand Victorian. We were initially greeted by \"Bert\". I and my husband were exhausted from the drive, not to mention I brought everthiing, but the kitchen sink so we could have a nice celebration. Imagine my utter thanksgiving to God when she said oh your room is on this level and right around the corner. We were so please. Also a parking space right out front. Then we were tired and just wanted to eat and got to bed. bert and sam I think were nice enough to pull a map and designate all different kinds of food. I have some recent illnesses that preclude my eating certain types of food. We actually ende up going to Denny's next door. The accomodations in the room were perfect, no to mention a wonderful balcony for two with a view of the outdoor pool. The next day started with a late wake up, but in time for the quaint breakfast and reading of the newspaper. It was said that there would be rain but it turned out wonderful. We were back to the desk and by the time we got there, Bert was back and we asked about going to see the movies again a map and designations, we did end up going to the Branson Meadows Cinema, Oh by the way I forgot to tell you that we found out the car had not been cleaned that we rented and so there was some type of brown liquid in the console that needed to be cleaned out so we asked about a car wash as well. We were given directions. Lets get back to the movies. Not only did she give directions, but looked up the places which should have been in the paper and when she could not find them she looked up the numbers and then gave them to us. I wrote them down. We had the ducks ride and then dinner at Applebees. When we returned my husband wanted to open the special wine I had given him for his birthday. We had no wine glasses . One trip to the front desk and champaign glasses were borrowed. Then back to the room, oh no guesss we will take the glasses back no cork screw, back to the fron t desk and lo and behold a cork screw. What's even more wonderful is the attitude of those behind the desk. Bert and the other staff were so pleased to be able to help.

Also that the price I paid for my room was cheaper then then the actual cost. She DID offer to give the room I had wanted, but told her no since I didn't notify them right away and joked with her, told her that it would probably rain and the balcony would be of no use.

We are usually there in Feburary, and since that's the off season, the rates are very reasonable. We like to stay here for several reasons, one of which is the large common area on the second floor. It is set up like a huge living room with couches, chairs, tables and even a 'wet bar' type of area. We always have a local resturant deliver dinner one night while we are there and this space is a perfect place for us to eat together, visit, play games and just spend time together as a big group. Breakfast in the morning is nice. The choices include hot and cold items, always fresh and well stocked. Several choices, not just muffins and cereal. The basic rooms are nice, nothing too fancy, but are always perfectly maintained and very clean. Most rooms have a little balcony which is nice for morning coffee or relaxing at night. The last time we stayed there, 8 of us stayed in the family suite. It was very nice, with a full kitchen and nice little living room. The downside of the suite is it only had one bathroom, which would of been perfectly fine, except that it was located in one of the bedrooms, which meant whoever slept in there didn't have the most privcacy. The beds in the suite were WONDERFUL however. Hotel is located right in the middle of everything, so you are literally just minutes from shows, dining and outlet mall.

We asked since we we're traveling together if we could have the same rate and we were told they only reserve 3 rooms in the entire hotel for that rate and they were already booked... Oh well, you live and learn. The lobby is very nicely decorated but the rooms are extremely small especially the bathroom. I had to stoop down to rinse my head in the shower and I'm only 5'4\" my husband is 6' 2\" so it was very difficult for him. It was also very difficult to give my children a bath because the bathroom area itself was so small. So if you have children and they need assistance in the bathroom you may consider this. The continential breakfast was okay, it served eggs, cereals, breads, donuts, cottage cheese and peaches. It's pretty typical of all the hotels around Branson. Most rooms have a balcony but our view was horrible. We had to look at the back of a very large billboard the whole time. The rooms were clean and also have a fridge and microwave which is nice. The couple we traveled with did have some problems with their room. The staff was blaming them for having an ice chest in their room (which they didn't have) that leaked to the floor below dripping water on the pillows of the guests below. Come to find out the hotel had a leak inside the wall which caused their room and the one below to get soaked. I felt the staff could have handled the situation better instead of insinuating we were at fault. The housekeeping staff was friendly however, the front desk staff needs some customer service classes. They were rude!! Other than that the Grand Victorian Hotel is an okay place to stay.

The remainder of us were on the fifth floor, where the rooms we had do not have a balcony or windows that open (they are made that way) When we checked in, we were told there was a balcony and there wasn't. We had a room with an adjoining door that was with someone not in our group. The desk staff was extremely polite on the phone, when I made my reservation and they could charge my credit card, but not so much in person. Rarely did they look up and greet someone when they came in the. All of the ladies in the group and most of the men were disappointed with the hotel, the service and the staff. This hotel used to be very elegant. We stayed there in 2005 and 2006. Maybe the hotel was purchased by someone else. But is has definately gone down hill. It appears the only thing \"grand victorian\" is the name and the \"window dressing\" . The staff used to be very professional in their dress, must have been casual days, and their actions. I can most definately say it was not that way anymore. I don't think the table cloths were changed from Saturday to Sunday. The tables and chairs were moved in the dining area on Sat in the early afternoon and they were still sitting in the same way on Sunday morning at breakfast. The garbage can was being emptied Sunday morning around 6.30 am and the individual was snapping the bag in the air in order to get it opened up. I know that they were changing out mattresses, the dumpster was in the back by the pool and smelled just lovely, when we went to the pool on Sat and Sun night. But even that was a little bit much for me. The down hill for my stay was when I encountered a pizza deliver guy coming onto the elevator. With all that is going on in the world these days, I would think that this would not be allowed any more and delivers would have to stop at the desk for pick up by the hotel guest. Security is a huge thing to look at and this was the last thing for me. They need to upgrade also. One computer with interent access for the hotel, which is 5 floors...and you have to pay.

I told the reservationist twice that I wanted a room on the front with a view of the major street and that we had a small dog (7 lbs). The location of the room was very important to me. I called one week before our arrival to verify the reservation and once again, told her that I wanted a front room. We arrived at 2:00pm and were told there were no rooms ready and that official check-in time was 3:00pm. We drove around Branson for an hour. We returned at 3:00 and were told \"the room\" still wasn't ready. I asked if there were other cleaned rooms we could have. This is when I was informed that pets were allowed only on the bottom floor, on the back side of the hotel and in a limited number of rooms. I explained that I had explained precisely when making the reservation that I wanted a front room. She said those were the rules. Checking in was not the time to find out that I had been misled. We were put on the bottom floor in back of the hotel near an exit door and directly across the hall from a large room where the maids' supplies were kept and the hotel washing was done. The door was constantly being opened and closed from early morning until late afternoon with conversations and loud talking in the hallway. The bathroom tile in the room next to us was being repaired and there were hours of hammering sounds. The rooms directly above us were being recarpeted which added even more noise. This went on for five days and the hotel would not give us a different room. We travel extensively and have stayed in many hotels including 5-star hotels where they not only welcomed small pets but gave them gifts.

I know how that turns out sometimes--you know, you read great things and see great pictures, but then it turns out to be a total dump. Well, not for this place. The staff was friendly to us and gave us a great room. (I had read that if you want certain amenities in your room, you must ask for them in the reservations.) Everything I asked for was given to us, like a mini fridge, microwave and great view of the strip. Although the balconies are small and some are located at the base of the hill which the property is on, you can still get a good view of the infamous 76 strip. (We were on the second floor and our view was fine.) The rooms are kind of plain and there's nothing too special about them. But they're perfect for relaxing in at the end of the day. The main entrance to the hotel features a baby grand piano, winding staircase and luxurious decorations all around. It makes you feel like royalty. As for the continental breakfast, it totally rocks! On day one I did not wake up in time for the feast, so my dad brought me back a boatload of items. You can get anything you want at this place! The eating area is on the main floor and located just a few feet from the desk. It's decorated like a tea room, and tea is exactly what you can get any time of the day. On the second level, if you were to walk up the winding stairs, you'd immediately see a community computer, checkers, a snack bar and lots of comfy couches. It's an area for those who need to gather their parties or just get away from their rooms for awhile. It's rather quiet, so you could read a book or just nap for a few. (The computer is a pay by the hour.) Overall, our stay at the Grand Victorian Inn was pretty good. We didn't have any problems and the staff treated us very nicely. The room was clean, the building seemed in good repair and it was just a nice, relaxing place to come back to each night. One thing to be aware of: The hotel offers free Wi-Fi and this was definitely a mistake on my part, but while checking my Ebay account on their internet connection, my account was hacked into. Someone had set up an auction listing and charged my account $52! The matter was resolved, but I probably won't be taking my laptop on vacations anymore for this reason.

Traffic on Country Music Blvd in front of hotel is horrible but can be navigated around by taking Roark Valley Rd (Blue Route) and then either Forsythe or Wildwood. The hotel is located between the two streets. Then its a shorter drive in the stop and go traffic (mostly stop) Had a great time celebrating my moms 70th, enjoyed the shows.

It was out of the noise of the \"strip\" & very serene looking at the hill's.Sitting out on the balcony in the evening watching the sunset was awesome.Indoor & outdoor pools were very nice.Spa was REALLY nice after a long day shopping or sight seeing.

There were quite a few hairs left on the bathroom floor and in the tub from previous occupants. The pillows on the bed were quite thin, so we requested one extra pillow and were told there were none.

From a far it looks just gorgeous! But wait till you get inside. The minute you drive up closer you start to notice that it is not as great looking as you thought it was but then may think that it is the inside that is important. Well, once you step inside, this will be another bubble that will burst. The entire interior decoration is supposedly Victorian-style but actually looks like they bought all their furnishings at estate sales and added some tacky decorations as it was customary in the Victorian times. This hotel looked like an old Motel 6 after an overhaul. Wallpaper peeling off in several places, cracks in tiles, baseboards detaching from the walls, etc. The shower was very narrow (and I am really a small person) and the shower head is WAY too low for anybody over say 5'2\" (I am 5'8\"). The rooms have thick curtains and they are there for a reason. On both sides of the hotel will be flashing neon signs ALL night, so intense that you think you are in Las Vegas! The views are either onto those neon signs (i.e. the Ride The Ducks attraction and a fast food restaurant) or onto a shopping center/outlet mall. The personnel is aweful, no matter how nice you are. They seemed bothered whenever we approached the front desk and despite the fact that the hotel was almost empty the same front desk coordinator who we originally checked in with asked us if we had a reservation EVERY time we approached her without even giving us time to ask what we needed to ask first (we wanted to ask about show tickets and about directions on another occasion). The advertised free internet service was down during our entire stay, the free continental breakfast reminded us again that you should not expect anything if something is free (they offered stale doughnuts and bagels even though Krispy Kreme is right next door!). The free coffee was bitter both times I tried it. As much as I am trying to be fair and look at it from a different perspective, I cannot honestly say much good about this hotel. My recommendation would be to find a different place to stay at.", "Date": "February 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA very nice place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4104367", "Content": "We have been going to Branson for nine years, usually 4-5 days per trip.
