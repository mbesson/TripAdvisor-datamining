During our stay the metro line was down, and this made it impossible to stay out past 7 or 8pm because we just wouldn't have been able to get back to the hotel without getting an expensive cab. The area the hotel is in is fairly nice, but it's VERY suburban (which was nice to see) but it's just too far from everything you come to Rome to see! However, we did like the hotel. The staff were friendly, the place was clean and the breakfast was pretty good.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tauranga, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cNice but hard to find\u201d", "Author": "Kylee181", "ReviewID": "UR118417980", "Content": "Very nice and clean, nice and friendly staff. Good breakfast which consists of yoghurts, meat, crossiants, pastries, juices coffee etc. HOWEVER... if you are using public transport don't bother. It is a nightmare to find and is extremely out of the way of the centre of Rome. The directions when you book seem easy enough and it is up until you have to catch the Bus. The number 998 or 998L bus that you are supposed to catch is very hard to find and if you do find it it doesn't take you right to the palace and also does not come often. We stayed two nights at the palace and both times it took us 4 hours to find it, even after the hotel staff explained it to us. The staff clearly have not done the bus trip before and appear to be incorrect in their advice. They even made the comment that almost everyone has trouble finding it. Taxis in the area are also hard to come by and are pricey, good luck if you attempt to get there via public transport, its not even on the map you are given. The only reason we made it their was by luck and the help of some friendly locals and bus drivers, although most of them had never heard of the area or street that the palace is located in.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cLight years\u201d", "Author": "roger d", "ReviewID": "UR118389666", "Content": "The good = this place is light years ahead of every establishment we visited in Rome, in terms of service and value The bad = this place is light years away from every establishment we visited in Rome Yeah, \"light years away\" is an exaggeration. It's reasonably (but not quite walkably) close to one of Rome's commuter rail lines, FR3. FR3 links up with Rome's Metro lines but it still adds up a journey: walk from hotel to Palmarola bus stop, take bus to FR3 station, ride FR3 to Metro, take Metro to your tourist destination (ex. Colosseum). But, if you're a tolerant tourist, it's not without its rewards. It's situated in a squarely middle-class, but quite tourist-friendly, enclave on Rome's beltway road. You'll catch a good glimpse of contemporary Italian life making your way into Rome, and find great values on food and supplies. The area is not the nicest place on earth, but we never felt unsafe at all. Other than the time to get into Rome, the other downside to the remote location is getting home from Rome, especially after the railways stop running at 11 PM or whenever. You have to take a taxi to get home, and no taxi driver will know where Via Gorlago is, and your best bet is to tell them to take you to the Palmarola bus stop (Fermata Palmarola). This ride costs ~20 Euro, which is not bad, but the taxi drivers, perhaps a bit miffed at having to drive so far out of the city, will drive very fast and aggressively (even by Rome standards) and have you kissing the pavement when you finally arrive safely at your destination. Then again, if you're an adrenalin junkie, even this aspect of the hotel can be a plus for you. But, the hotel itself is very nice, if a tad small, light on acoustic insulation between rooms, and limp-wristed about their no-smoking policy. Most importantly, the staff is 100% top-notch, and they are very very serious about their job, which is making your stay there comfortable and enjoyable. I have only seen such dedicated service once or twice before, and I've stayed at a lot of hotels; yes, they're that good. Our room had AC and heat, satellite TV (though we didn't use it), and an extremely posh bathroom. The breakfast was delicious, and would have easily cost 10+ euros at a cafe. As long as you understand the logistics of this hotel's location, I would highly highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cWhat a bargain\u201d", "Author": "Roddanz", "ReviewID": "UR117451854", "Content": "We had just off a long haul flight and made our way to Hotel Palace Nardo to be greeted by friendly folks and the experience just kept getting better over the four days we stayed.
