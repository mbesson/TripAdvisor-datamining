Room was adequate and obviously fairly recently refurbished but not clean (hairs on bathroom floor, toilet not clean) Also the soundproofing was poor (would hope for better in an airport hotel where guests arrive at all hours) and the television was an old style one with a loose cable that would suddenly go off for no reason. Wifi signal only available in one corner of the room and we had to phone and ask for the wifi code: surely scribbling it on the room card as a matter of course would be better service? would save waiting until the receptionist answered the phone, which took a while as presumably they were busy.

A very pleasant summer evening here, before flying out early the next morning. The reception staff were great, especially the manager who knew more and was very professional. The young female receptionist was under training and didn't really have much of a clue at the time - we requested to pay the bill on arrival instead of at 4.30 a.m. as it was an early flight - she clearly wasn't used to such questions!! Nonetheless she didn't serve us badly after checking with the manager. Room medium-sized with comfortable double bed as requested - not those separate twins which they always seem to give you unless otherwise requested. General stay very good indeed - the local square with its various restaurants, bars and typical mid-20th Century 'Madrileno' architecture is particularly recommended for am evening stroll and drink or light meal. I recommend 'La Plaza' for its choice, relatively reasonable prices (for Madrid) and the service from its most amenable young waiter. All in all: much more enjoyable than some anonymous plastic brick cube on the outlying parts of an airport. Visit this 'barrio' - you should enjoy it! Just one (and only one) complaint - not enough coffee at the early breakfast; most pots were empty or nearly empty. Could have been organised and staffed better, but there again it was quite early, and what does one expect in the middle of a recession... Would go back any time if the deal was as good as the one we found on 'atrapalo'.

I received a prompt response from an employee, who informed me that the information desk at the airport would be able to contact the hotel for me upon my arrival so the shuttle could meet me. When my flight arrived an hour late (at 12:30 AM), I inquired at the information desk about calling the hotel for the shuttle. The information desk told me that they would not make any calls, and directed me to a pay phone. When I called the hotel, they informed me that it was not possible for the shuttle to come and meet me - as service stops at 1 AM. When I pointed out that it was 12:40 AM and the shuttle should operate for another 20 minutes, the employee of Clement Barajas said that since the driver would likely not return to the hotel by 1 AM, it was not possible for him to come and meet me and that I was on my own to find transportation to the hotel. I understand that the shuttle does not operate 24 hours per day - but if the service is advertised until 1 AM, it should run until that time. The hotel itself was fine - the location was very convenient and the room was perfect for my needs. However, it would serve the hotel to clarify their policies regarding the shuttle and make them more efficient to eliminate stress from guests coming to their hotel. I had no problems with the hotel, but unfortunately my experience with the employee of Clement Barajas and the shuttle will prevent me from staying there again.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yellow Springs, Ohio", "Title": "\u201call around great\u201d", "Author": "greengrad", "ReviewID": "UR137158853", "Content": "Is it weird to be so enthusiastic about what is basically an airport hotel?

No LCD, no wifi in that room (there is free wired and wireless Internet in the hotel but the signal was not strong enough in my room so a network cable is required).

The room was not very clean. If someone from the hotel has another opinion I come with some photos. 3. the staff is not good prepared to give clear information. I was with a 3 year old child. I asked if the child should pay for the breakfast. The receptionist lady said: no idea you should ask a waiter :(( Ok I ask a waiter (who didn't speak good English at all) and she said: yes, he pays half, 4 Euro. This is not normal, a kid that stays with his parents in a double room shouldn't pay for the breakfast. No hotel in the word charge for that. The second day at the breakfast the child was not charged (as it is natural and normal). But there is no rule for that, it depends on the waiter. 4. no glass in the room. If you want to drink a bear or a wine in the room there is a problem. 5. The breakfast is good, but I consider it a minus because of the child incident described earlier and because of the fact that there is NO vegetable (tomato, cucumber etc).

They are about a 7 minute walk to the Metro, and it takes you where ever you want to go. We were up and walking around Down Town Madrid before 9 am, on our first morning there. We booked the Hotel using their own website, and got a good deal, with buffet breakfast included. Hotel rooms are clean, and beds are great! The WIFI works awesome, you just need to ask the front desk for the log in password.

In point of fact, I actually stayed at Clement Barajas on the recommendations of fellow trip advisiors. Such is the power, and value of this site. I arrived at Barajas after a long flight from Australia. What happened to me is, I suppose to some extent commercial reality. I finally located the slip lane that is allocated for small hotel buses. Note it is located to the RIGHT as you walk out the main exit. Surprisingly, the porters and others that I asked did not seem to know its location ( yet it was less than 100 metres away). Maybe they want you to use taxis or alternate transport. In any case I had real problems when phoning the hotels as the phone was always engaged. Finally, i asked a Green Airport guide to try and they got through ( not straight away). After waiting more than half an hour the transport arrived and I arrived at the hotel which is just a short distance from the airport. Taxis do NOT want to take you as it is not worth their while. The Hotel desk was manned by ONE person and so iwaited my turn. I watched carefully for the phone to ring. After a short time it rang, but was left unanswered on several occasions. Are you getting my drift.?? But when you actually read the hotel guidelines \" transport is provided when they are able to do so. So this does NOT mean when it is when you require it. ### To be fair, as i always try to be it is a SMALL hotel by Spanish standards. The front counter service was efficient, friendly and my questions about transport OUT the next day were answered. Naturally, I wanted to be certain of a bus the next day which met MY deadlines. I had no problems. My deal included breakfast which was the full deal. Absolutely top hole, everything you could want, well presented, with fresh fruit and plenty of it. The room was as has been described by others. Double bed, modern s/c bathroom. I would use this hotel again when i go to Spain. My mark would be high say 8.5. It does have the limitations I mentioned. This must be balanced against the reasonable price, the proximity to the airport, great breakfast etc. Catalanvisitor", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cThe choice in Madrid!\u201d", "Author": "Fortaleza_7", "ReviewID": "UR46411922", "Content": "You cannot go wrong with this hotel.

Our selection was partly based on reviews here on TA. By and large we were happy with our choice. Most of the positive aspects discussed in previous reviews were accurate. However the one thing that bugged me was that it was impossible to iron (press) a shirt without sending it to the hotel laundry, which cost in the region of EUR 5 per shirt. This is probably not an issue at all for many customers of the hotel who may be passing through on a one or two night stay / during a holiday. However, staying at the hotel for a week and wanting to look professional for work each day it becomes an issue. I stay at many hotels all around the world and this is the first time in quite some years when I have not been able to iron shirts myself. Most often the room comes equipped with an iron and ironing board, or at least room service can provide one, usually for the duration of the stay. Worst case scenario is that you are provided with access to an ironing room or facility elsewhere in the hotel. However, with the Clement Hotel this was not possible and the only solution was to have the shirt pressed by housekeeping. I regard this as poor business practice, especially for a hotel that is clearly pitching itself at the local convention market. We are scheduling to conduct another course near Barajas soon and will be reviewing our choice of hotel. If you don't need or care about ironing, the Clement is a very good airport hotel, and the town of Barajas, while not overly attractive, has some good options for eating and drinking within easy walk of the hotel. I would particularly recommend restaurant Al Traste, a fun and inexpensive eating house with friendly staff about 100 meters to the left after exiting the hotel.

I was however a bit disappointed over because with a TripAdvisor ranking of 9th in Madrid I was expecting a great hotel. I selected this hotel as I had an early flight the next day to Latin America. I thought that staying near the airport was a good idea. The first problem I encountered was that the taxi drivers at the airport won't take you on the relatively short distance to the hotel, unless they charge you an exorbitant fare that is. I was quoted 30 euro for a fare that should have been between 5 and 10 euro. I naturally declined this offer and went with Plan B - the hotel shuttle. I called the hotel and they told me that the van would be there in 10-15 minutes. Half an hour later I called again and was told the same thing. 40 minutes after my initial call, the van finally arrived and brought me to the hotel in 10 minutes. The hotel room was OK but nothing special. For 117 euro a night I expected something special. I have stayed in other hotels (e.g. some NH Hotels) in the centre of Madrid for little more than half this amount. Most of the other reviewers seemed to like the Barajas neighbourhood and to be happy that an airport hotel had some life beside it. My goal was to spend time in the city centre. As I was already an hour later than I had hoped to be on check in, I took a taxi to the centre and one back again which cost me over 50 euro total. In the morning I was told that I would have to wait for an hour for the shuttle to the airport as I hadn't booked a seat on it. Instead I took a taxi which cost me 10 euro. The hotel is full of signs and disclaimers saying that the shuttle service is offered as an \"extra\" and that guests don't have a right to a seat on the shuttle, must book in advance, etc., etc. All of that is fair enough. But what is the point of this hotel?? Do the management really think that people want to spend time in the Barajas area? If it wasn't beside the airport no one would stay in this hotel. Therefore easy transit to and from the airport must be the priority. I have a suggestion for the hotel management: instead of applying rules, regulations and disclaimers, why not buy a second shuttle and improve the service? Personally I wouldn't stay here again. I prefer to take the metro to some other hotel close to the city centre.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tangier, Morocco", "Title": "\u201cCan't beat location\u201d", "Author": "Livingabroad1", "ReviewID": "UR15842268", "Content": "You can't beat this hotel for location.

Had a look around whilst there, however, and Hotel Melia Barajas looked ok (very spacious) and appeared to be another and alternative good option.

Restaurant (American style) Al Traste ('Fun and Food'): left out of the hotel about 150yds. Good atmosphere, yummy nachos and ribs.

We were enroute to Israel but decided to stop in Madrid for 2 days, to do a little sightseeing. We wanted an airport hotel, rather than one in downtown Madrid, because we didn't want to drag all of our bags from the airport to downtown and then back. An airport hotel with accesss to a train was a better idea. The only problem we had was figuring out how to call them from the airport. Before we left the U.S. we were told that after baggage claim there will be a desk we can go to and they'll call for us. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it and was misdirected repeatedly. Finally someone at another desk was kind enough to call the hotel for us and the van arrived within 15 minutes. But from the moment the van arrived it was smooth sailing. The driver was great and the ride was under 10 minutes. The lobby was attractive and the staff at reception was wonderful. We received our room key and went upstairs in under 5 minutes. The room was lovely. Modern, stylish and welcoming decor; nice and rather large bathroom. The room was large enough for our needs (two adults and a 2 year old). Someone else wrote that it was too small for an American's taste, but really, how large does it need to be? We had enough room to walk around comfortably, and the baby had room to play. There was lots of closet space and the safe was very easy to figure out. After freshening up we went downstairs to \"hit the town\". Elena at the front desk was especially helpful. She provided us with subway maps and detailed directions about how to walk to the subway station (about 12 mins walk from hotel) and which trains to take in order to get to downtown Madrid. On the way to the train we discovered a playground for the baby, so we stopped to let her run around. Upon our return in the evening there was a delicious, all-you-can-eat dinner buffet for 8 Euros. The only thing is that dinner doesn't even begin until 8:30 pm so we were very hungry. But there was lots of food to choose from. The next morning Elena was helpful again in directing us to a local mall where we could buy some items we needed. She also told us how to get back on track and continue on to Madrid when we finished at the mall. Later that night we enjoyed the dinner buffet again and told the front desk what time we'd need the airport shuttle in the morning. Everything about this hotel was absolutely wonderful, including the courteous and attractive English-speaking staff. We would definitely stay there again if we needed a lovely hotel near the Madrid airport.
