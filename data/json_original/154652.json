Service from staff was horrible. I arrived around 6am, I was not welcome by the front desk and not even a bellman help me or my daughter with our luggages. even though he was standing right next to us. You need a key to open the minibar, which I though it was ridiculous since they have your cc on file. My mother had to place her medication on the refrigerator at the front desk because they couldnt even give us a key for the refrigerator from the minibar. ON top of that they will charge you for the minibar even though you dont take anything from it. I requested to check my bill during my stay and I only received atitude from the front desk agent (Miriam). I questioned one charge and with an attitude she inform me with the receipt \"this is your signature, right\". I was leaving one day earlier and decided to paid for all my incidentals, I gave cash to the front desk agent (Patricia) but forgot to asked her for the receipt with the zero balance. When I approach the front desk an hour later to ask for a copy, they inform me that they dont have any record that I paid for the total amount. After 15 minutes of the front desk just checking her computer I told them to check the camera and they panic. A few seconds later I got the receipt with the zero balance. I took a taxi to the airport and he noticed that I was upset, when I told him about my experience on the service he mention that I was not the only one and named me the two front desk agents that I encounter. How weird was that. I will go back to the hotel, but if these two front desk agents are no longer working there. I work in the hotel industry and I didnt feel like I was welcome at all, I am very disappointment about the service.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent clean hotel and good location\u201d", "Author": "Smudgey28", "ReviewID": "UR118255853", "Content": "An excellent hotel with attentive staff although some could not speak fluent English. We were a family of 3 adults, we were given a spacious bedroom with 2 large double beds. The bedroom was a generous size without any feeling of being cramped and the bathroom was pretty large too. The breakfast menu was the same each day, with minor varieties each day. The hotel is located next to the Revolution Monument, with many activities held each day. Just remember you\u2019ll often hear a lot of band music and noise through the day as people congregate at the Monument centre. Pick up a city tour bus next to the Revolution centre, it is worth a trip. We managed to identify our places of interest via the bus tour and later took the metro to these sites. The hotel is a 5 min walk to many metros. The city centre is a 10 minute walk through the city park, but first make a stop at the local outdoor eateries, brilliant cheap, local foods a must try! You\u2019ll find many Mexican artefacts on sale in the City park, remember to bargain for everything you purchase. Food in the City centre is expensive; if you don\u2019t speak Spanish you will have a problem with your orders. The hotel tourist centre is helpful just don\u2019t listen to their advice of areas of the City being dangerous. We took the local buses, the metro to the entire city and never had any problems, of course be mindful of your handbags and money. The metro is extremely cheap, the way it works is to purchase a 1 way ticket to your destination, there is no concept of a return ticket. Each location you wish to travel will mean purchase of a new ticket. In the metros, you\u2019ll find vendors selling cheap, cheap things, my best purchase was the hair cutting scissors for 25 pence or 39 cents. The hotel has cab services, we had one person who took us around the city and the many famous locations at cheap rates. What we liked most about the cab was having the ability to stop where we liked without the bus tour time restrictions. Also take the hotel cab to the airport as these are cheaper than the conventional city cabs.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Service but little else\u201d", "Author": "nicksim", "ReviewID": "UR117465226", "Content": "Friendly helpful desk staff, but things at this hotel failed to work so often that it was really frustrating.

No security concerns in the area as we were out and about all around the area well after 10pm nightly. We paid 550$ for two people for 8 nights taxes in which is unbelievable value for the money. Never ate at the hotel but found amazing taco spot right behind it called El Caminiero which was up there with some of the best we ate the whole trip. In addition, there are plenty of street food stalls around the hotel and the Colon monument that are top notch as well. Beds are fine, yes maybe hard compared to North American standards but pretty much par for the course in mexico. The so called 'hawkers' and taxi guys aren't nearly as bad as mentioned in other reviews just give them a smile and a no gracias and go on your way.

After reading the other reviews, we were optimistic about this hotel. However, upon our arrival we were quickly disappointed. The front desk was consistently unhelpful and frequently appeared annoyed when we asked questions. We booked this hotel through Expedia and when we arrived, they did not have our reservations and we were placed in a smaller room than what we had reserved. The room we were given faced the traffic and we were (un)fortunate enough to audibly experience the all night festival that was happening near the hotel. Further, the air conditioning was non-existent and we awoke to a very warm and bright room (as the room was directly in the path of the morning sun). We asked if it was possible to be moved to a different room as we were supposed to stay for two nights, but were told that the hotel (~200+ rooms) was entirely booked. Upon hearing that, we were quite suprised when the hotel bar never openend for the day as we expected they'd want to cash in on the \"big\" crowd that was staying with them. We did head up to the rooftop pool but had to share it with a local family who were quite friendly with the hotel staff (and receiving a good deal of attention from the staff) and obviously not guests of the hotel. Finally, though the hotel appeared clean, we had another surprise in store when we turned down the bed and discovered that the sheets were not clean. I'll spare you the full details, but the evidence was much more unpleasant than a stray piece of hair and involved stains. We also had difficulty using our calling cards as the hotel is not well versed in dialing 800 numbers. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The staff could care less, the bed was unclean, the room was uncomfortable, and the price can be beat. It wasn't until we decided to leave the hotel that someone finally offered to move us to a new room - apparently the hotel was no longer full.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood Mid-Priced Hotel Option\u201d", "Author": "goldmanm", "ReviewID": "UR4352338", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights in late December and found Hotel Casa Blanca to be a great hotel for us.

The location is great, walking distance to 2 subway stations as well as the zocalo (about 20 minute walk to the zocalo). Our room was extremely quiet, although the fact that the hotel was relatively empty when we stayed probably helped in that regard.

I did some research on the Internet and decided that the Casa Blanca Hotel had the location and amenities that we were looking for. I would have to say that the property exceeded my expectations, so much so, that we decided to extend our stay from 3 nights to 7 nights (we were spoiled!) We stayed in a 2-room suite with 1 1/2 baths and 2 televisions (which was great for the kids). The rooms and bathrooms were extremely spacious and nicely appointed. The bathrooms were all marble and the full bath had a tub/shower, bidette and double sink. There were 2 queen beds, a twin size sleep sofa and a huge dining table. The room had a safe, 2 closets and plenty of dressers and storage space. The highest nightly rate that we paid for this elegant suite was $115 (USD) and some nights were less. We ate quite a few of our meals in the room, since the room service menu had a good selection and was reasonably priced. The food was great, as was the food in the dining room. (They also have a more formal Mexican Restaurant, but we didn't try it.) There is a roof top pool which has a spectacular view of the City. Off the pool area is a Lounge and full bar that you can hang around in while you swim. One end of the pool is shallow enough to sit in (the water is clean and as warm as bathwater!)and the other end is maybe about 4' deep. The Hotel has a gift shop where we could pick up any of the incidentals that we forgot to pack (there is also a Sanborn's store across the street) and they have computers with Internet access. There is also a cocktail lounge with entertainment on the first floor. The staff was extremely hospitable and friendly. There was always someone on the Front Desk who spoke English. They had 24-hour money exchange and were very helpful in assisting us in arranging tours and transportation. The housekeeping staff was excellent - the rooms and common areas were very clean. I felt very safe staying here as there is always a doorman on duty and plenty of staff roaming around. Although I have read other's comments that their taxis were somewhat expensive, they generally arrange for you to have registered tour guides, rather than regular taxi drivers. The only time that we were dissappointed was when they arranged one of our trips with a regular taxi driver. He drove very fast and aggressive and did not speak English. (He had a license plate that started with \"L\" and our AAA Guidebook warns against using taxis that have plates that begin with \"L\".) Also, some of the taxi drivers are open to dealing on their rate (the price of the tours, however, seem to be non-negotiable). Our favorite tour guide/taxi driver was named \"George\". He was very personable and spoke great English. His car wasn't the greatest, but he was very informative and drove safely. I was sick on the tour, so he extended it by an hour and didn't charge us any additional money. The tour (to the Pyramids, the Shrine of Guadeloupe and the Plaza of the 3 Cultures) cost about $85 (USD). It was supposed to be 6 hours long, so that only works out to about $14 per hour, which is not bad, considering that you have a personal tour guide. Ask for George if you go there...you will not be disappointed. If I did this vacation again, the only thing that I would have done differently, would be to take the Turibus tour (double-decker bus) on the first day. This is an excellent way to get acclimated to the area and to figure out which sites you would like to visit. The rates for this 2 1/2 hour tour are about $10 (USD) and about $13.50 on Sundays. There is a bus stop about a block away, in front of the Fiesta Americana Hotel. We also took the regular bus transportation for shorter trips and found them very convenient.
