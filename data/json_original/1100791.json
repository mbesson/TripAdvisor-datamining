This is not a spot for somebody wanting to save on their expense report! A beer for $10. Coffee was priced normally - I think because of the Starbucks next door! Issues with the hotel were a TV that I had to reboot and would take 15 seconds just to start up at near full volume and another 15 seconds to get off the main page. The pool was closed one day too.

But getting to parts of Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica was a mission. Especially with LA traffic. The hotel lobby is big, modern and great. They have an Illy espresso bar, a wine bar and a place for breakfast. If you prefer Starbucks there's one right next to the hotel in the LA live complex. I will say that the complex was very busy the entire time were there with an NCAA basketball tournament, a Lakers Game, a Clippers Game and the premier of the Hunger Games. It was exciting but there were a lot of people in and around the hotel lobby at all times. We did have dinner at WP 24 which is at the Ritz Carlton next door.

I was working on an event being held in the hotel itself, so I spent almost all of my time inside the hotel, only going out into the surrounding area for a couple of meals and some basics (water, snacks). The hotel is enormous, and attached to the convention centre. Brand new, and impeccably clean, the hotel staff was friendly and always ready to help. Room service and food service staff were a pleasure to chat with, and always professional. The business centre was also very helpful with friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are nicely furnished, contemporary-feeling, with large walk-in shower (no tub), with some nice toiletries. Housekeeping was great and respectful of my things. I ordered room service on several nights when I worked very late, the portions are quite large, always thoughtfully plated, made me feel taken care of after some very long days. You have climate control in each room, and a large armchair and couch, tv with lots of clothes storage space (wardrobe and large dressers). My favourite part of the furnishings was the desk/table on small wheels that you could drag to wherever you needed it in your room. When I'd finally get to my room at night, I could order room service, pull the desk to the side of the bed, and eat in bed comfortably, while watching some trashy tv before crashing. Small things like that make me very happy. Outside of the hotel, you walk right into LA Live -- where there is an array of restaurants. My favourite, I went twice during my 1 week stay, was Katsuya. Try their seafood sampler, or crispy tuna rice dish. AMAZING.

This is a luxury hotel and you pay what you get for. This is the most I have ever paid for a room. We booked a junior suite for 3 nights - the price difference between a room and a junior suite was not great so we upgraded. The hotel booked up very quickly after the Grammy nominations were announced - we booked that very night - more than 2 months ahead of time. I did research for other attendees and the price at the JW was in line with other nearby hotels. The room itself was great - I joked that if you jumped out the window you would land on the Staples Center. We were that close. The view - facing the Staples Center was spectacular. The junior suite we had was a corner room on the 12th floor with windows on two sides. The layout didn't make the most use of space but it felt very spacious. Upon entering, you step into a space about the size of a small hotel room that has a couch in it and a bar. Then, a small hall leads to the main room with the bathroom on the right (large step in shower - a bathtub would have been nice but not a huge issue) and big sink area. We could have used a little more closet space but again not a major issue. The bed was super comfy and at the far end was a couch with two large chairs and a coffee table - we were able to comfortably entertain guests in our room (the only issue was getting them up since all floors are key carded - great for safety but not great for having people come up - you either leave a list at the front desk or come down and get them). We had two little issues - one was lousy internet signal which we paid $12.95 a day for (we received a refund when I requested it - the front desk said the hotel was full and that was the reason - we had to use the hot spot on my phone) and the only room service we ordered (breakfast on the day of the Grammys for 2 which cost $60 and was nothing super fancy) came 45 minutes late and we had to gulp it down. Also requested and got a refund for that. Overall, I would stay here again despite the little issues. The staff was very attentive and met all of our needs and was eager to help when we had issues - the request to refund met with no argument.

I live in LA, and trust me, to find nice people that are so accommodating, is hard. They have done an excellent job of finding a great staff. 1 - CLEAN - When you walk in, it's clean enough to walk on the carpet without your shoes on. I know, a rare thought in a hotel room. But it's kept clean to a very high standard, and you do have that comfort level. 1 - Ultra modern. Very modern furnishing, and all still appear to be in good condition and new. 1 - Bed - the bed is so comfortable.

On another window, we had the views of Hollywood hills and the Hollywood sign. The room is very large and has a retro modern look. It was one of the biggest showers i have seen with one of those big elephant wash shower heads. We actually left the blinds open for most of the night because the lights, and light reflections, looked warm and romantic. We did have to shut them early morning to get sleep.

That saved us $80 on this trip. I did peek into one of the non-junior suite rooms when the maid was in it, and they looked pretty nice too.

I was told that I would be given a high-floor city view that was supposed to satisfy me. I asked for a supervisor and someone named Stephanie came and apologized and offered nothing else more than free internet. She claimed that a paid deposit (with a guaranteed charge of one night if I was a no-show) was not really a guaranteed reservation, because it was at a special convention rate. In other words, they were guaranteeing to charge me for a King room for the night, but they were not guaranteeing that they would actually provide it! She sauntered off and the nasty desk clerk tosses me a room key-card for the 7th floor with a view of a Pepsi sign out the window, NOT the high city-view. It works out bad for you if you complain to management here. Most high-end hotels will provide an upgrade for inconvenience, not down-grade and treat you like trash. As an aside, I walked by the front desk early the next morning and there was Stephanie. She was smiling as her eyes wondered toward mine and, upon looking at me, her smile dropped from her face like a ton of bricks. Real nice. She either works very long hours or has very little time off between shifts. This might explain the hotel staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than adequate treatment of their guests.

On a Monday evening we went to the mixing lounge and sat at a table (the bar was full but the seating area only had 8 people seated) and waited for approximately 10 minutes to order. There were 2 waitresses working but seemed to be more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. I finally went to the bar and ordered. In the hour I was seated at a table not 1 of the staff asked if I would like anything else or even approached me. this is unacceptable particularly when you are paying top $$ for cocktails. The lobby bar is not much better. I was also really disappointed in the housekeeping service. I left my room at approx. 1 PM and saw that housekeeping was servicing the adjacent room. I returned to my room at 5PM and the room had not been cleaned. I spoke with the front desk and they acted like it was no big deal and they would have someone service it.

The room was great, but the service was not on par with other JW properties. I arrived about 30 minutes after the published check-in time, waited in line for 15+ minutes, but the room was not ready. I was instructed to wait nearby and they would call my cell phone when it was ready (was told 15 minutes). After a 40 minute with no call I returned to desk and was given a key immediately so I guess the call was forgotten. The suite was very well furnished however the coffee table was wobbly and seemed cheap. While there was a full size fridge with ice maker in the kitchen, the icemaker did not work. Also, there was no glassware, or dishes or even a wine opener in the kitchen. The master bathroom was the highlight of this room. The biggest jetted tub I have seen in a hotel room ever (bath salts provided)! It also had a large glass shower that miraculously did not leak all over the floor. Room service was fast and of high quality. The breakfast at LA Market was decent but nothing special. Valet service was good but you must know to drop off at front door but pick up at subterranean level P2 which was only made known to me after waiting around the front for 5 minutes. Finally, upon checkout my bill was incorrect and it took 10-15 minutes of the clerk walking away to a back room to resolve the issue. All in all this is a nice new property in LA.

Location to where we needed to be was awesome, the valet and staff service very good. The problem started after we checked in to our room, then went down to find a restaurant for dinner. There are many dining choices right outside the back entrance, which opens onto LA Live. What we were not aware of is that the hotel was being used to film a 'flash mob' scene for a tv show. The lobby was full of people, including some that seemed to have come in from the street just to hang out. My husband was wearing a hat from the local university, where the first football game was being played that weekend. It caught the attention of someone who started going on, very loudly and with a lot of profanity, about how the team better win because he had a lot of money bet on the game. Sat down next to us and made us a little nervous....to the point of others moving away. Getting through the lobby was a little tough, with the flash mob participants everywhere, practicing. No eating at the hotel, or having a drink at the bar; it had been rented out for the television show. Found a great restaurant in the LA Live area, then tried to get back to our room. Security wouldn't allow us back in the door, as the show was being filmed. We weren't allowed to stand and watch, as they had to keep people moving for 'fire safety reasons'. So we walked back and forth for 40 minutes, entertained for a while because of the flash mob dancers, but were tired and just wanted to go back to our room. My husband told the security officer that we just wanted to get back into the hotel, and was told, very rudely, that we weren't allowed to go back in the way we came out, that we would have to walk around the building and go in through the front entrance. Finally, the filming is wrapping up and we are allowed to go back into the hotel. Went to the front desk to complain - apparantly we weren't the first, as the manager said that she was going to talk to the people in charge of the show, as it was not supposed to take over the hotel and impact the guests as much as it had. Offered to buy us a drink, or breakfast, which we could not take advantage of because of our early schedule the next morning. The next evening, we were told from a waitress that the hotel is rented out quite often for filming crews and different events. Overall, the hotel and room are nice, the location great, but we were very unhappy that no one told us a show would be taking over the hotel that day and night. JW Marriott's first responsibility is to the guests they book into the hotel, not the television shows or other events they 'sublet' the hotel to without informing the guests beforehand.

Saying all that, i still wouldn't stay there again if you (ironically....you'll see my point next) paid me. The hotel took over $1,100 from me \"by mistake\" on top of the final hotel bill. It took four phone calls to four different people to get the money back. It is now a week since I made the first complaint that they had taken all this money without authorisation and I am still waiting for the remaining $500 to be returned to me. As a tourist on holiday from England I have saved up this money and they have taken it from me and only after speaking to four different people has it been returned to me. It has never been fully explained to me why this money was taken or for what purpose.

As soon as we pull up, $40 charge for parking and having access to your car during your stay to take it in and out. Upon check in, we're told we have to pay a $50 deposit for the room, even though we spoke to the hotel numerous times about the total costs, nobody mentioned this. But we completely understood and we were told the money would be returned immediately after check-out. We make our way to the room and as soon as we get there, a group right behind us, that had just checked in as well, had been given the same room. We're then reassigned to a room that wasn't nearly as nice, but we didn't complain. We then learn about the $15 dollar charge for WiFi, but definitely remembered the hotel offering free internet for their guests on their website. Then, check-out. Complete disaster. Since it was a few of us staying together, I paid for the deposit and one paid for the room. Apparently when we checked in, the $50 was a charge instead of a hold. So on the other card they had charged the remainder of the costs. Which screwed the plan my friends and I had. They try to fix it, and they charge the full amount on the intended card, and tell me it may be a week before I get my $50 back. EVEN THOUGH WE WERE TOLD I COULD GET IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER CHECK-OUT. Our group is obviously irritated at this point, but their employees did little to nothing to help the situation or explain what they were doing with all these charges. They tell me that I can get my $50 back if I call my bank and tell them to release the money to my account, which I shortly did after, but the bank tells me I'm pretty much SOL because the Marriott needs to handle this first. I go online to check what the status of this charge was, and learn that another $47 charge from the Marriott has been made. I called the Marriott several times trying to resolve the issue, but everybody was just telling me they don't know why certain charges were made but they assured me it was being credited the money back and it was just my bank that needed to release the money. My bank again, tells me they have no control over the money and suggest I wait a few days for the money. The $47 was deposited back into my account the next day, but not the $50. Again, I call the Marriott to find out what's going on and they tell me THE SAME THING, that they've released the money. So I figure I would wait a little longer. Then today the $47 is taken out from account..... I'm soo done trying to figure out what the hell this place is doing.

Thus, quite a bit of light crept in and the room was not fully dark. That may not be an issue for some people, but I feel it's worth a mention. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of what I mentioned above about the lighting - AND - I do not consider this hotel to be a 5 star property (like the Four Seasons or Ritz), and I also did not utilize amenities such as bar, restaurant, swimming pool, concierge, etc. We paid right about $200 - I consider that to be a decent price for the quality of this property - I believe the rooms sometimes go for in excess of $300+ at which point I would probably stay at the Ritz because I don't believe this hotel warrants a rate of over $300 per night.

The first time was during a trip to the Emmy's. The hotel was very new and the service was lack luster at best. I was concerned that the hotel had adopted a stance that they were a LA destination property and that if you were staying at the Marriott and not the adjacent Ritz Carlton, you did not need good service. I did not write a review of the property though, as I figured with the Emmy's going on next door and the hotel being newly opened, I would give them a pass. On my second visit, this past week for the Espy's, I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of the sharpness I experienced at the hotel last time was replaced with a very professional tone. Also as an added bonus, a lot of the tenant space that had been mostly vacant has filled in, although the surrounding area is still mostly vacant. The parking is not very secure (open to the public), but unless you are worried about that... valet is not required. The parking is located beneath the hotel and very close (I Valet). I can not see my self staying at this property if I was not attending an event at LA Live or at the hotel, as you are not near any other LA attractions, but it is very convenient to the interstate if you can get a good rate and have a car. The hotel is on par with the adjacent Ritz. I have stayed at both properties and although the Ritz is clearly a step up. It is not worth the additional 200 a night. I was able to easily secure a nightly rate of $189.00, when booking in advance. This property tends to nail you, when you do not plan in advance, even if the hotel is empty.

Unfortunately it was anything but. While the \"exquisite architectural detail\" was ok, the service was one of the worst experiences I've had in a 5 star hotel. Let me list the issues: 1. We arrived late at night and I was standing with my wife and children and a large amount of luggage for about 12 minutes as no one from the hotel actually came and asked if we needed help with our bags (there was no one else on the driveway!). When they finally arrived by the time I checked in and got to the room it was close to 45 minutes. 2. As I was arriving very late to a suite with my family I had specifically requested that a cot to be set up prior to my arrival so I could quickly get my youngest to sleep - nope. When I asked at check-in a vacant stare was my response. I had to book and chase three times before they came - with a roll away bed and NOT a cot?!?! 3. They have a bar fridge with nothing in it. Ok, this is fairly standard for the US hotels, but when I ordered room service they got it wrong. First, the bottle of wine I ordered was changed because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they are changing their wine list\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the second time they left off an order 4. I went to breakfast and I was standing at the entrance waiting for someone to seat me in case this was the requirement (there is no sign by the way). After about 5 minutes I went and sat down. A lady came over to me and I asked to order and she said something to the effect, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sitting there, you walked straight past me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . 5. They have some funky pool thing going on for non-hotel guests. My wife went for a swim about 10:30 am and there were a bunch of drunk idiots jumping into the pool fully clothed multiple times and the staff did nothing about it. Then another time a bunch of near naked FAT people down from the pool were standing in the reception area being very loud (as they were drunk) and treating the small water/biscuit bar (that JW Marriott has there for convenience) as a buffet lunch?!? 6. They forgot one day to service my room?!? And had the gall to tell me \"oh, you must have left the \"do not disturb\" sign on your door\"!?!?

I took photos of the bite marks and sent them to their administration. I had initial conversation with their reps, but after that, I was essentially disregarded by them, not getting return phone calls despite repeated efforts. They showed little interest in the matter and didn't follow it up at all. My dermatologist friend confirmed that the bite marks are typical of bed bugs. I don't understand how a relatively new hotel could already have bed bugs. And if they did have bed bugs, how they could show such little concern about the matter. This place cannot be trusted when it comes to health matters.

Live area for an annual convention over the 4th of July weekend, and chose this hotel for it's proximity to all of the events in the area (saw the construction progress with each convention starting in 2008, so I was naturally curious about staying there). Excellent experience from check-in to check-out. My room partner had a problem hooking up his laptop to the in-room television monitor, and two maintenece men showed up promptly (one to diagnose the problem, the other to bring the missing cable that the in-room instructions said was needed to do the hook-up). The bathroom had to have been the largest, space-wise, I've ever experience (stayed at several hotels in the L.A. Live area for the conventions over the past 4 years). My room partners really like the free wireless internet in the lobby area (great atmosphere and comfortable surroundings). The concierge (Joy) was very helpful in arranging our return airport shuttle, and when it didn't show up on our July 5th departure day, the concierge on duty that morning got on phone and hooked us up with a new one (the original driver apparently missed all his L.A. Live hotel runs that morning). On the minor quibbles side, there didn't seem to be a fan to vent the bathroom and since there was a large LCD screen on the front of the Ritz Carlton Tower, the Marriott rooms facing South (toward the Staples and L.A. Convention Center) got a nightly light show, whether they wanted it or not (a lot of BLADE RUNNER jokes were made). The curtains didn't do a good job of keeping all the light out, so eye-masks were necessary for those who were sensitive to such things (I personally slept like a log). Also, there was a dance party going on at the Pool Level on Friday evening that got a little noisy for for those of us on the 15th floor, but it was only for a couple of hours. Due to the convention event schedule, I didn't have time to use the Spa or Swimming Pool, so I couldn't rate those. Plenty of food options nearby at L.A.

The Bad: Checking in Friday night was a MESS because there were at least 2 conventions going on with people staying in that hotel, and we arrived just behind 2 buses of bicyclists who all had to check in. We also didn't get the type of room we requested, even though we booked through the Marriott website. I would expect that if we had booked through Expedia or something. They said they'd send up a roll away. No real apology for the super long wait or the room, but ok. LA Live has a lot of great restaurants! Ate at the Yard House which was delish and never disappoints. Room service was frankly not worth the price. I ordered the All-American breakfast. The \"eggs\" were clearly not real egg and weren't cooked how I had asked. Sausage was like that weird, hard, English sausage. Bacon was the 2 smallest pieces of bacon I've ever seen. The potatoes were good. My friend had eggs benedict, which she did enjoy, but wasn't as hot as she would have liked. There is a Ralph's within walking distance from the hotel (also has free parking w/ validation below if you'd like to drive), so I would suggest stopping there and getting something to eat. Also, overnight parking is $40 a night. Expedia and the Marriott sometimes offer packages for about $20 extra a night that include parking and a resort credit, so keep an eye out for that. Only bad part of the pool is that about 4pm ish the sun starts to dip behind the building so you have to move to the spa because you will freeze in the pool. The Good: Saturday we spent most of the day at the pool which was surprisingly not crowded. The Marriott has a salt water pool which is so much gentler on your skin. Really great. My new favorite bartender is Jos (like Jose without the e), who made me a delicious watermelon margarita with real watermelon. Oddly, the pool bar doesn't have a blender, so daquiris and the like weren't an option. If you go to the bar, make sure you talk to Jos! He is SO AWESOME! He'll take the time to find you a drink you like. The rooms are super comfortable and spacious. Rooms look exactly like they do on the website and the standard rooms are more spacious than I expected. They also have this cool feature where if you bring a laptop and a HDMI cable, you can plug it into the desk and watch movies on TV. The rooms are also equipped with an iHome which I love for plugging in my iPod and playing dj. The standard feather pillows are a bit too nice and soft for me. So if you like a little height, I'd suggest calling housekeeping for a non-feather pillow. Otherwise, the beds are great! We didn't visit on this trip, but the burgers at the LA Market Restaurant in the lobby are pricey but TO DIE FOR! And the pretzel bread they serve while you wait is SO GOOD. Overall- This hotel is PRICEY. Expect to spend some money. To cut costs, venture out of the LA Live area. There are some really great restaurants and bars around.

Even though I was travelling on business, had a confirmed (and paid for) room, I was unable to check in without a credit card. After much dancing I got it arranged but corporate has no flexibility and no mercy - all for the sake of 'possible incidental charges' (there were none, I used none of the additional services, thanks Marriott!). The room, on entry seemed clean enough but on close inspection I found long black hairs in the bathroom sink (I have photos) and curly brown (pubic??) hairs on the shower soap dish. YUCK. Housekeeping eventually (1 hour+) showed up to reclean the bathroom, no apology from the non-english-speaking staff. While I waited I tried to get a snack and a drink. Drinks you can get - that's the ONLY vending there is in the entire building. $1.25 bottle of Coke in hand I checked the room service menu - $14.95 was the cheapest item, club sandwich. Nearly $15 for a SANDWICH? Unless it's delivered by a naked dancing girl that's too much. No, dancing girls not available. Attempted to have pizza delivered - only Pizza Hut apparently pays the kickback and is allowed to deliver there. $15 got a large pepperoni delivered (and was quite good). Tried to call home - cordless phone handset dead, despite 'charge' light. Corded phone would not reach desk area - also had a ring loud enough to startle me and no obvious control to turn down. Cheap and flimsy set to boot. Cinema-size television had extremely weak and very directional remote (cheap) that took several seconds per channel change (television signal obviously delivered via house computer network) and dropped out / broke up / went dark a LOT. Nice robe in closet for use in spa - size far too small for average guy like me, unless I wanted to flash the other guests, so no spa for you. I decided to try and get some work done - wireless NOT free (don't buy the dodge about 'free wireless in the lobby' - you get one hour and your machine is locked out by MAC address, contrary to staff's hopeful fibs, besides I paid for a ROOM to work in). Not willing to cough up $15 a night (!) for likely awful service I resorted to local Starbucks for my email and web support. After the event I worked, our team gathered for a drink in the bar - their 'best' single-malt scotch? Glenlivet. Waiter had no idea what any of the other truly good malts were - and took 15 mins to deliver one drink with the lounge virtually empty. Motivation obviously pretty low despite the tony ambiance. The lobby was filled with ear-hurtingly-loud boom-boom disco music even in the morning... not sure what that says about the place. My guess is the manager was on vacation. Combine that with the must-have-room-card-to-access-elevator (for every single guest - some trips took nearly five minutes to go through the foolishness of card-in/punch floor) and the 1960s style (ie hideous) furniture with lots of sharp corners (ow) and I felt very unwelcome.

That last tag refers to the hotel's location in the new restaurant and entertainment complex connected with the Staples Center and the LA Convention Center. It is only a few hundred feet out the back door of the hotel to the Staples Center and a bit further to the convention center. On week days the hotel was primarily occupied by convention goers with name badges. This upscale hotel is very nice and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I had an executive king on the 17th floor. This room category is somewhat larger than a standard room. On the two days when the air was clear I had a spectacular 180-degree view all the way to Santa Monica, including the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory. On the two hazy days the view lost its special appeal. Below was the I-110 freeway which I, surprisingly, never tired of looking at. The Santa Monica freeway was visible in the distance so I could judge how free-flowing or clogged the freeways were. The room was well insulated for sound and the freeway noise was only a low hum which was not objectionable and seldom noticed. There were two large view windows in the main room and a third large view window in the bath. Because there are no nearby buildings I left the blinds up except to sleep. The bath is large with a very large shower. There is no tub. There was lots of storage space and closet space. The room came with a safe and a robe, but no slippers. The TV is 42-inch. There was a large desk facing one of the windows which provided a pleasant place to work night or day. Room lighting was excellent and some lights had dimmers. There was a fairly comfortable lounge chair. The restaurant was good for breakfast. I found ordering from the menu was cheaper than having the buffet. I ate one dinner in the restaurant and found it fine. There are many other restaurants within one block. Everything looks relatively new. The hotel decor is modern. The public spaces are loud, but my room was quiet except for the freeway hum. Valet parking is $40 per night which is steep. The valet service was very good. Internet access is $12.95 per day.

I was taking my wife to an early Christmas present; the Mark & Brian (local KLOS radio personalities) Christmas Show at the Nokia Theater. We live 40 miles away but decided that since we had not been to the L.A. Live area since it opened, we would stay in town to explore and to avoid the midnight commute home. I did not realize this hotel had only opened in February 2010. I did not know it was connected by plaza to the Nokia Theater (and right across the street from Staples Center). I was not aware of all of the restaurants available in the plaza (Fleming's, The Yard House, ESPN Zone, Trader Vic's). I was very impressed. But not nearly as much as I was by the hospitality at the J. W. Marriott. The reception was prompt and efficient. The room was pristine and clean. The amenities were better than most. The experience was exceptional. HIGH POINTS: Good value for the dollar in an exceptional location for any event at Staples Center, the Nokia Theater or L.A. Live. Staff is efficient yet when it was time to go to our room, they walked us to the elevator. The rooms are as clean as a whistle. The valet parking was easy. To pick up your car you have to go to a basement level...again, very efficient. LOW POINTS: When their informal restaurant closes from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, they direct you to their lobby bar. We ordered a couple drinks and a hummus plate. After waiting half an hour (and while others were served) my wife went back to the room to get ready for the evening and I insisted my waitress bring me the bill, absent the charge for food we never received. She had to get a manager to approve that....another couple minutes went by. The manager finally appeared, apologized, and explained someone had failed to show up for their shift. She thanked me for my patience. I felt that was not enough. Absent that underwhelming experience, our stay at the J. W. Marriott was a pleasant one. After my wife was all dolled up we used the interior passage in the hotel to go through to the adjoining Ritz Carlton and took their elevator to the WP24 Lounge. The \"WP\" stands for Wolfgang Puck and the \"24\" stands for the 24th floor.

You're a 5-minute drive into the traditional downtown (we spent one evening at the rooftop bar at the Downtown Standard), 10-15 minutes to Dodger Stadium, and the hotel sits right near the I-10 and the I-110, so it's easy to connect to just about any freeway. The other bonus about the location: it sits next to the surprisingly vibrant LA Live development. In addition to the Staples Center (booo), the Nokia Theater is right there and there are a slew of bars and restaurants (we saw Don Mattingly at the YardHouse one afternoon).

Our very modern room was fairly big, had a nice TV, two comfortable beds, etc. The bathroom didn't have a lock, true, but no other coplaints. The staff seemed friendly. It's a touch pricey, but we didn't notice because we had two free nights thanks to my brother's Marriott points. We spent one afternoon in the pool (it's atop the 4th floor), which also features an outdoor bar and lounge. It hosted a private party one day, which drew a big crowd, but you couldn't hear the music from the rooms. The lobby is huge and cool, though the bar was really overpriced. One legit negative: the valet parking is $38, and there's almost no way to avoid it. All of the lots and garages nearby charge at least that for overnight parking, and there didn't seem to be any legal street spaces. And, obviously, you need a car in LA. That aside, we had a great stay and would certainly return.

Overall, not bad, but a little sterile, i.e., could use some art on the walls in the guestroom floors, better signage in the elevators as to what was on each floor, etc. I was upgraded to a corner king junior suite on the 21st floor (top of the JW side but the attached Ritz-Carlton starts on the higher floors and probably goes up at least 20 more). Stunning views of the freeways, downtown LA, and if the day was clear, you could probably have seen all the way to the Pacific. Executive lounge is on the 4th floor, adjacent to the pool area. Nice space, evening food selections so-so (cheese, crackers, crudit\u00c3\u00a9 and two hot items) but enough to make dinner out of. Wine selection great - 3 choices for white and two for red (in most Marriott and even JW Marriott properties there are usually only two wine choices - red or white :-) and pricing is relatively reasonable ($9.00/glass for white, $12.00/glass for red). I went out in search of ice and at the elevator lobby on my floor saw a directional sign pointing to the \"Ice & Vending\" area (pic #1). Walked that direction and at the next turn saw a sign (pic #2) pointing towards guest rooms to the right and left, but couldn't find the ice machine to save my life. Went back to the elevator lobby and picked up the house phone which rang immediately to the \"At Your Service\" folks and was answered within two rings. Was told that the nearest ice machine was on the 18th floor (pic #3), so I ventured down three levels and by golly I found it (pic #4)! But why the sign on the 21st floor pointing to the non-existent ice machine??? I'll write that off to \"newness\" but I wonder if they have plans to install a vending area on floor 21 or if the sign is wrong (incidentally, you'll notice that pic #1 mentions room 2144, yet it isn't mentioned on pic #2 - that's because it doesn't exist - the highest room number on 21 is 2142 :-). Gym is nice - my judgment of a good hotel gym is if they have the large inflated exercise balls (they have three), and all of the standard equipment. Plenty of treadmills but only two bikes. Overall, I think this is a nice hotel, just needs a little time to be broken in, but it's one of the best hotels to open in downtown LA in years.

Check in was good. I was appropriately recognized as a Platinum Premier elite member of Marriott Rewards (maybe just as a Platinum on the first visit; I don't recall, and it really doesn't matter). The first stay I was directed to the various features of the hotel. On the second stay I was upgraded to the Vice Presidential Suite on the 15th floor. The room decor is nice (the standard room better than the suite). One thing I dislike about most hotel suites is that the bedroom is often much smaller than in a normal room. While the bedroom in this room was larger than in most suites, it was nevertheless smaller. TV actually has some channels in HD, but I was disappointed there was no My13 (I like to fall asleep watching Seinfeld at 10pm when I'm in LA). There is a media port on the side of the desk; although I did not use this, it would come in handy to stream video or watch DVDs from your laptop (assuming you bring appropriate cables). The air conditioning was inadequate in both rooms. While I love the nice thick duvet, I could not get the rooms cool enough to sleep comfortably. Also, I think the beds are a bit firmer than the Marriott beds in other properties, but perhaps they're just newer. The shower at first seemed nice, but the water pressure is woefully inadequate. I think I still have soap in my belly button. I'm sure the hotel would blame the A/C and shower issues on being \"green\" - I hope business that take \"green\" to this extent win enough additional business to offset my loss of business. The check-in agent on my first visit did point out that I had free internet access as a Platinum Elite member (per Marriott's new policy in response to Starwood's new benefit), but I did not use the service on either of my stays. Although the Concierge Lounge was great the first stay, it was closed the second stay; they said it was closed for renovation, but that's perplexing since this is a new hotel. The morning Concierge Lounge attendant was absolutely wonderful. In the Concierge Lounge Hot items varied each day and the fruit selection was quite nice. Having San Pellegrino in the lounge is also a plus in my books. A couple of hot appetizers, hard Italian cheeses, and deserts are offered in the lounge in the evenings. On the second stay, I was offered a free breakfast buffet each day as a Platinum Marriott Rewards member. Service was more leisure than accommodating; it would have been better had daily coupons been offered that could have just been left at the table instead of having each person wait on the check. Also, no Concierge Lounge on the second stay meant no extra water or soft beverages than what came in the room. I really like the gym, but depending on what else is going on at the hotel, it can be VERY crowded in the mornings. The machines are all new and modern, and they include HD TVs (although the HD signal is poor on many of the machines and often pixelate so much that the local channels are unwatchable). Like the rooms, the gym is also very warm. Too bad the machines don't have the little built-in fans like at the Marriott Downtown. One thing I really hate about this hotel is that they do not put hotel receipts under the door. You have to go down and get the receipts from the front desk - a complete waste of time for the business traveler. Too bad Marriott doesn't post receipts online like Hilton. And while I also get receipts emailed to me, I find this to sometimes be unreliable (and one college doesn't ever get them even though he is signed up for this service). I did not use room service, but other colleagues found the service extremely slow and inaccurate. However, if you complain about issues, the hotel does seem to throw free stuff your way (free beer and bottled water with room service, bonus Marriott Rewards points for other problems). There just seems to be a lot of employees standing around at this hotel but no one really doing anything. We experienced this at the hotel restaurant for breakfast needing drinks and bills without our waitress in sight, but plenty of others were standing around doing nothing. Same for the valet pickup. And speaking of valet parking, you have to go down to the bowels of the garage to get your car and snake out of the maze that is the LA Live garage. The location and the logistics are really a hassle. I may stay here occasionally, but it's just too much of a hassle to stay here regularly.

Hubby and I stayed here for 2 nights the weekend before Memorial Day. The Lakers were in the play-offs, but not at home, so the hotel was busy, but not completely full. After spending a week in another (awful) hotel just a few miles away for business, this was a welcome treat! Friday afternoon LA traffic was horrible -- not surprisingly. We pulled up to the hotel and the valet were quick to whisk the car away. We knew it was going to be $38 a night for parking there (with in and out privilege -- and be sure to ask for the valet extension and call ahead, so you don't have to wait for your car when you do want to leave). If I had not gotten a bargain on the rental car (full-size, less than $20 per day with taxes and fees), we may have opted for using taxis. In the end, we were happy to have the convenience of a car so that we could come and go as we pleased. The lobby is huge. Or, the ceiling is so high, it definitely SEEMS huge! I've noticed other reviewers weren't \"sure\" where check-in was, but when you walk in, there's 3 or 4 \"counters\" or check-in desks straight in front of you -- what else would they be? There are also a number of folks in \"uniform\" -- well, tan Marriott-issued suits with hot pink ties that match the decor (especially some of the lighting -- above and to the right) to guide you. It was mere seconds before someone offered to help us with our luggage and to check us in. I, personally, like the open feeling and not being \"smushed\" up against a wall to check in. One of the first things you'll notice is that the hotel is not your typical Marriott. The decor is a cross between Euro/60s modern/70s colors/80s flair/Japanese Zen -- and somehow, it works. (see pictures) It seems modern and retro, lively and serene, all at the same time. Being platinum with Marriott Rewards we got upgraded to a corner, executive King room on the 13th floor (26 floors, I think) and free internet. The room was huge with picture windows on two sides to the east and to the south overlooking Nokia theatre and Staples Center, as well as the LA Live! district. The daytime views were spectacular -- including Catalina Island in the distance. The nighttime views with the search-lights and neon was almost as pretty. Even the bathroom had a huge \"picture\" window overlooking Staples Center and the LA convention center, as well as the 4th floor rooftop pool, below. Again, the decor was eclectic -- and while not my preference in color choice (orange?) -- it somehow works. The windows had sheers, as well as room-darking drapes that worked; the bathroom had a room darkening roman shade for nighttime, too. The room was VERY quiet and quite large. The only \"noise\" I heard was 2 neighbors' doors slamming at 2:30 in the morning on the 2nd night. I probably heard them because everything else was so quiet. And they're are the kind of self-closing doors that slam shut if you let them. And people are lazy -- especially at 2:30 in the morning. The bathroom was huge. No, there was no bathtub -- but seriously, I have not taken a bath in well over 10 years and never missed it. I loved the walk-in shower (big enough for two, but could use a shower head at both ends to make that work) -- and with it not being a bathtub, it's much easier and safer to get in and out of... The water pressure does seem low -- but I believe that's a result of the \"low flow\" faucets in all of the new or redone hotels in the area. I rather enjoyed it as it was very relaxing and it took maybe 10 seconds longer to rinse my hair (and I'm a woman). The toiletries were very nice and the sink area is huge with a nice shelf below to store things, too. We asked for extra pillows -- I have a bad knee and like to elevate it -- and they were delivered in less than 10 minutes. On the second night, one of the managers I had been engaging in conversation sent us dessert to our room. This was a surprise, and we were more surprised when we got a phone call stating that room service was outside our door with a delivery and we had a \"do not disturb\" sign out... Hmm. Last I checked \"Do Not Disturb\" meant we didn't want to be disturbed... Hubby got up and obligingly let them in -- they did come bearing chocolate-covered strawberries, after all... However, if it had been 20 or 30 minutes earlier -- I would have been VERY upset as it would have been a very unwelcome interruption. I probably should have mentioned this at check-out, but forgot. The concierge lounge was closed for the weekend -- this is nothing new. Most close at noon on Friday and re-open at noon on Sunday. However, it's hit or miss as to whether you can get still get breakfast coupons -- we did not, here. We had drinks and appetizers (or \"small plates\") in the \"Glance\" bar. The service was excellent and so was the food. We both had 2 glasses of wine. The prices were no higher than the other hotel I was at in the same area, earlier in the week, where the service was non-existent and the food was horrible. Saturday, it was quite busy in the hotel lobby as there was a professional bicycle race passing through town and stopping at LA Live for the day. We went to the Farm of Beverly Hills for brunch at L.A. Live! -- excellent food and Bloody Mary's were on special -- even better! Even though hubby and I used to live in Long Beach, we spent the day playing \"tourist\". Everything we wanted to do and see was within 20-30 mins of the hotel. We went to Griffith Park and the Observatory, drove as close as we could get to the Hollywood sign, and then spent time in Hollywood on the Blvd and Sunset. We had had a busy day and decided to have dinner at the Hotel; although the L.A. Live! complex has choices such as the Yard House, Conga Line, Flemings, and more. Dinner was VERY good -- I had meatloaf that was superb and hubby had a lobster linguine dish that looked divine (I'm allergic). Service was good and prices were not too far out of line and the food quality was excellent. It was so good we decided to have breakfast there the next morning. It was too late for the buffet, so we ordered off the breakfast/lunch menu. Service was 180 degrees from the evening before -- taking forever just to get water or our drinks brought to the table. The food was good, but if we were on any kind of time schedule, we would have had to leave before getting our food. Breakfast, even lunch, usually doesn't take over an hour. This did. Because of the delay, I asked for a late check-out time and was granted 2:30. I think we could've even stayed longer if we had needed. We went to the pool and jacuzzi. It was windy -- and too cool for swimming in the pool -- but the jacuzzi was very nice. Big. Clean. Deep. Nice jets with interesting movements. After that, we walked to the movie theaters and took in a matin\u00c3\u00a9e before leaving for the airport. My one area of complaint would be the concierge staff. I needed to print something and as I noted, the \"concierge\" lounge is closed on weekends. As a Marriott platinum elite, I'm used to being able to print anything at any time -- for free. I called and asked about the business center and was told it, too, was closed, with a \"but\". I was told that there were computers and printers outside the business center available 24/7. Cool. Not. These computers/printers required a credit card to use! The concierge on the phone had not mentioned this. So I went to the concierge desk and he offered to let me use his computer and printer as I had to access a password protected website. Nice gesture, but he should have been more attentive to what I was asking for in the first place -- I told him on the phone I was platinum and was used to NOT paying to print anything! Maybe he was having a bad day -- but he certainly did nothing to make mine any better! That was Saturday. On Sunday, when it was time to leave, I asked the young lady working the concierge desk if she could call and have the valet ready our car and handed her the claim check. She tells me I need to go \"downstairs\" -- when you needed your car you went down into the parking garage to pick it up from the valet. I said, \"Great! Can you please tell me the extension to call to have them ready my car and where a house phone is that I can call them from!\" She looked at me like I was from another planet. My hubby was approaching, then, with our luggage. She just stared at him. I said to him, \"All I asked is for her to call the valet to get our car ready and I guess they don't do that here.\" Just then she says, \"Oh -- I can do that!\" In a very snotty tone of voice. If we weren't leaving, I would have brought that up to management -- but we needed to get on the road. (Very odd that both my experiences with the concierge desk personnel were bad. Everything else had gone so nice at the hotel. I get the impression that neither were very experienced in their positions.) All in all, I would return to the JW Marriott L.A. Live! We had a \"new opening\" rate of $209 a night and the location could not be beat for what we wanted to do. Would love to return and take in a show at the Nokia -- it's supposed to be quite nice. I like the upscale, yet unpretentious feel of the hotel and the staff was mostly very attentive and accommodating.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington", "Title": "\u201cMade me like LA\u201d", "Author": "ptOmi", "ReviewID": "UR65855048", "Content": "JW Marriott Los Angeles at LA LIVE is a brand new hotel.

I have to admit I was not looking forward to staying here. We had to stay downtown because of a convention and I know that downtown LA is pretty bleak. However, this hotel is really a bright oasis despite its not fantastic location in terms of things to walk to easily. The furnishings are are bright and elegant. I am sitting in an aqua butterfly chair next to a golden rod, retro-mod loveseat. We have a nice view of the mountains but I think the rooms on the freeway side of the building actually offer the best view.Rooms are almost silent from noise and the hotel feels very booked. The JW toiletries are great and the bathroom is large although no tub in our room. Coffeemaker and small fridge without minibar clutter make this a great room. The thing that really impressed me so far is the staff. The check in team was wonderful. Bright smiles. Very eager to make our stay terrific. Here is how I know this is a great hotel. The real sign of a fantastic hotel is shown when things go wrong. Yesterday the valet smashed the rear end of our rental car. We got a call from Rick the manager and he told us what happened and he did absolutely everything to make sure this did not disrupt our trip in any way. He swaped out the car with our rental company and gave us the use of the garage's car service. We were the first accident the garage has had since it opened so they were very apologetic and quick to make things right. Truthfully, it did mess up our day somewhat but everyone's attitude was so accomodating that we were able to get past it. My only criticism is the fee for Internet at $12.95 a day per computer. I wish these chains would wake up to the fact that free internet is essential for all travelers. I don't want to be charged for something that is not a luxury! Overall, very pleased with the experience here and if you must stay downtown this is the absolute best option.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cThe Un-Marriott\u201d", "Author": "MisstheDogs", "ReviewID": "UR64096703", "Content": "The JW at LA Live is more like a \"W\" hotel than your standard Marriott, which may be a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective. It's clearly trying to be hip and trendy and, for the most part, it succeeds. On the outside: the hotel is right next door/on top of LA Live, including the Staples Center, Nokia Theater, etc. Thus, it's walking distance to many restaurants. It is not close to othe LA attractions. Hotel parking is very expensive at $38/day; there is parking at LA Live for $25. Consider whether you need to park a car as there is a Hertz desk inside the hotel. On the inside -- public areas: It's all very modern. As others have said, none of the desks (registration, concierge) are marked but there are plenty of people to direct you. There was never a long wait. There is a lobby bar but, the one time I tried it, it was impossible to find a seat. The tables and chairs are grouped such that, if one person sits down alone, it means that about 5 seats are out of service unless you want to be up close and personal with a total stranger. And, in one of the bars 1/2 of the tables were \"reserved,\" although no one was sitting at them. I gave up and went to my room. The rooms: I had a high floor room with a wonderful view. Decor is quite modern (\"sofa\" looked nice but wasn't very functional) and not at all reminiscent of most Marriotts at which I've stayed -- lots of black and earth tones and light wood. Bed was fine, TV was a large flat screen, robe was a nice touch. I don't believe there was a mini-bar but I never actually checked. The bathroom has a huge shower only, no tub. I found the \"rainfall\" shower annoying as it was hard to get shampoo out of your hair w/o spending about 5 mins to do it -- not much water pressure. The room was very quiet -- not sure if that holds true for low floor rooms. Towels were plush but that could be because they, like the hotel, are new. Miscellaneous notes: Elevators were quite prompt for such a large hotel. Internet service is $12.95 for 24 hrs. Restaurant choices are somewhat limited for such a large hotel but, as noted, you're steps away from many great choices. When there is a large convention in the hotel, it gets noisy and crowded in the public areas and you start to feel like a number despite the best efforts of the staff to make things personable. Summary: The JW is expensive; you're really paying for location. If you don't need to be in the heart of LA Live, you can probably do as well at other hotels in terms of what you get for the money. If you need to be here for business or pleasure, the Marriott delivers a good product, albeit at a price.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, California", "Title": "\u201cA top deluxe hotel?

The hotel is beautiful, clean and contemporary. Still smells brand new. The front desk were fine and friendly. Dinner in the hotel was lovely - fresh food, but it was a full restaurant the night we were there and it took us 45 mins to get our meal, no apologies. Our meal cost around $130, including a couple of largers. We ask about conceirge lounge, it isnt finished yet we are told. We ask about vouchers for breakfast - something Marriotts will offer if the lounge is closed, they say after consultation that we can have free breakfast. We then get a call telling us they will give us free breakfast, great. We have breakfast , have to ask twice for coffee. We tell the staff about the voucher situ and they say thats fine and we get $20 each so covers the buffet) we get a bill, we write on the bill that we are members. We are planning to extend our stay as one of the children is ill. We book the room again, go to see front desk, they have a bill so far including breakfast charge $67. After a bit of discussion they say they will take the charge off but that we were only entitled to the adults getting complimentary breakfast($42), which is fine but someone has to tell us surely??We eat breakfast one more day (we each only have cereal and toast (milk a day out of date and coffee once again doesnt arrive till we have finished eating, the waitress only charges cereal and one continental about $23), and then the rest of the time we go to starbucks - just less hassle eventhough it costs us. The room was great, spacious and fresh, decor different, we liked it but think it will date very quickly. Bathroom a good space - lovely and clean, lots of towels.Toilet a bit annoying, got blocked a few times. The sliding door on the bathroom didnt give a lot of privacy - ok for us but maybe not so good if you were with a friend. Our room was high and we could hear the noise from the Staples didnt bother us but might be worse lower down. Location good for the Staples and Noikia centers, and not bad for travelling around from - near a few main freeways etc. We didn't walk about in the evenings though as didnt feel that safe out of the immediate vacinity. Advertised as pool, spa coffee bar etc, none of these are yet finished / open, the children were disappointed about the pool area being closed - it was too cold anyway but they still like to go in the tub. The coffee shop wasnt open, and there was no shop. Fitness center well equipped - great. We stayed for a variety of rates from $174 to $239 plus of course the $38 per day parking, really makes it expensive, and will be more so I imagine once all finished.

They also charge $12.95 a day for Internet, which is really unreasonable, but I was told you can get one hour free in the lobby. The rooms are spacious. Ours had two double beds (which was guaranteed on our reservation) and a small sofa. It also had a lat screen TV, empty refrigerator (noisy), safe, and a one-cup coffee maker.
