Some of the things I have to say about the hotel may soon be irrelevant. But for now - a nice, moderately priced hotel for business travelers in a good location, away from the tourist hustle bustle but still convenient to the Condado and Old San Juan. I stayed in room 905 which I think is one of the best lines (ie, rooms ending in 05) - they are quite a bit larger than most other rooms, and the other large rooms are close the elevator which is pretty noisy. The room has new, fairly attractive furniture but without any bells and whistles (see pictures). It was comfortable, clean, quiet, and had a nice view of the lagoon and the Condado. The hotel has 2 restaurants - Augusto's which is an expensive European restaurant which gets good reviews and which I did not try, and a more casual French bistro right off the lobby that has an authentic bistro menu and quite good food. However, breakfast served in the bistro was quite basic and service left ALOT to be desired. Upon entering in the morning on 2 of 4 mornings, tables from the night before had not been cleared and it took a while just to get a table. The continental breakfast was either 2 pieces of toast or a few slices from a baguette with toast and jam, plus coffee and juice. I was surprised by the few choices for breakfast, and especially, by the somewhat surly service. That was my biggest gripe about the hotel. Otherwise, the service was good and staff friendly. My room came with few amenities - there were a couple of bars of soap in the bathroom but no shampoos, shower caps, writing pads, etc. I imagine this will all change once the Marriott imprimatur is complete. I also noticed a couple of small shops about to open. There is also free Wi-Fi in the lobby. While I was there, the gym and the business center were both undergoing renovation and were closed. I did take a look at the pool which was small and hemmed in by walls - not very inviting and I would not come here with children as a result. The street is on a humdrum busines strip close to a few fast food restaurants, a Marshall's, the post office, and a bank. Besides the fast food joints, I did not see other nice dining options that were walking distance, but cabs are always parked outside the hotel. All in all, a decent, professionally run place and obviously getting better. I'd stay again if business brought me to San Juan.", "Date": "January 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hutchinson, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWhat You Pay For\u201d", "Author": "patsyterrell", "ReviewID": "UR3691711", "Content": "I stayed in room 404 of the Excelsior on Tuesday, July 12 and Wednesday, July 13, 2005. The Excelsior Hotel in San Juan Puerto Rico is continually recommended as a business class hotel. Reviews written by people who've stayed there were useless because they were so conflicting. Why no one has taken the very simple step of taking a few snap shots so people can just for themselves, I don't know. But, here they are. I have posted more on my personal site http://www.patsyterrell.com/excelsior/index.htm. My own assessment is that if you're a Cruise Ship person - meaning you want that level of accomodation, then hell no you're not going to be happy here. If you're a traveler who expects what you pay for, then you'll be happy here. It's basic, but clean and OK. It has the \"niceties\" you expect from a more upscale hotel, but it's a bit worn around the edges. The carpet needs to be replaced. It could stand some updating. But the bed was firm and clean. The bathroom was clean. The air-conditioning was cold and the water hot. The walls were paper thin and that would have been a problem if I'd had noisy neighbors but I was fortunate. And, to top it off, if you're planning to stay there for a vacation, you can walk a very easy block and a half and you're at a bus stop. For a quarter on the A5 or fifty cents on the Express Bus 1, you can go to Old San Juan and be there in about 5 minutes. There has been much mention of the construction noise. Yes, there's construction. Yes, construction makes noise. I'm not sure what you would expect the hotel to do about it. I was there two mornings - one morning construction started about 9 and the noisy part ended about 11. The next morning there was no construction noise as they were doing other things. The staff is excellent! Very helpful. Augusto's restaurant, on premises, and supposedly one of the best on the island, has excellent food but - like most such places for me - overpriced and pretentious. I guess I just don't like paying to have my --- kissed. I'd rather pay 2/3 as much and have \"normal\" - not \"--- kissing included\" service. I didn't go to the pool so can't speak about that. The location seems wonderful to me and location is what I'm generally after. I left here and went to the Westin Rio Mar near the rain forest for a convention. It is very upscale, 27 acres with private beach, more than twice the price, and I felt like a prisoner - nowhere to eat except on their site, a taxi ride to the town of San Juan was about $60 and took an hour. So, it all boils down to what kind of travel you like. But don't think you're getting a resort experience for $80 a night. Please. Get real. But, at least you can see for yourself what the Excelsior looks like and make your own decision.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "chillaxing", "ReviewID": "UR3661296", "Content": "Good if all you want is a room to sleep in.

There is a bus stop not even 1 block away that will take you to Condado beach or Old San Juan for just 25 cents. Once you get to Old San Juan there is a trolley which will take you all around Old San Juan for FREE. I recommended renting a car and venturing away from San Juan.

One wrong turn and it could take a while to figure your way back. I took another persons advice and I visited the facilities at the Caribe Hilton.

I got this hotel through Priceline, at $110.00 per night. Believe you me it's not worth $50.00 a night. Thankfully it was a pre-cruise (one night) hotel, March 19, 2005, unitl we sailed away into the sunset the next day. When we arrived at the hotel, I knew immediately that we were not in a good neighborhood. The hotel is a total mess with construction going on inside and outside. We waited about 20 minutes to check-in. The time was 2:40 P.M. Check-in time was 3:00 P.M. They would not allow us to check-in 20 minutes before the 3:00 P.M. check-in time. We wanted to have lunch, so we asked if they could hold our luggage until we came back from lunch, no problem there. Went to lunch, about a block away from the hotel, sleezy neighborhood. After lunch, we decided to go into a souveneir store that was about 2 doors away from \"Subway\", we had to be buzzed into the store, after being checked out by the lady behind the counter, now doesn't that tell you something? Went back to the hotel, now it's after 3:00 P.M. After waiting another 20 minutes to retrieve our luggage from the basement, we finally settled into the room. The room was clean. Check-out the next day was another disaster. After 3 phone calls to the front desk, it took one hour and five minutes for the bell guy to come and get our luggage. Don't waste your money on this place, stay at any other hotel. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Never again.

When we got there I was only thinking of the reviews and people concerns about this Hotel. Our first concern was where we're going to find a parking, cause there's no place for you to park the car! And we ask one of the guys that worked there and we told us that he will park the car for us, until we booked our room. When we got in the ladies in the front desk who took care of us were very friendly and helpful!!! I asked them to gives us a room away from the elevators, cause I read in a couple of reviews that they were complaining that the elevators makes too much noise....But of course I didn't mention that to them! So then, we were on our way to see the rooms. The rooms that we had one of them had a rug \"which it was a plus for me\", the other one had tiles and a small kitchen \"which I didn't had but didn't care cause I wasn't planning to cook in there\", both of them had a two Queen Beds, the room had already the air condition on \"so it was nice and cool\", the bathroom were clean and so was the entire room! So we were all thinking \"Is not that bad so far...\"Then we asked for extra towels and blankets and they provided that to us in a timely matter. The night came and there weren't people making noises. In the next morning I noticed that they were constructing a building or a parking lot next to the Hotel, but again I didn't here any loud noise or had any inconvenience... It was very good and the price was not that bad at all! To get the best price for that place go to hotels, that's where we found this place and very cheap!!! The beach is just a few miles away, restaurant are close, parks, gas station and a mini markets for your needs is around the corner from there! If you are looking for something \"Fancy\" or \"Modern Rooms\" then get something else, this place wouldn't be for you!

Need I say more. We had an awesome time and would reccommend this hotel for those family oriented vacations. Not alot of \"hoopla\" around the Hotel- Quiet and peaceful. Pool was also very well kept and we enjoyed out stay.
