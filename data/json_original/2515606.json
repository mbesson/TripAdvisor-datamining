They are affordable and usually clean and they have a loyalty program through the Wyndham chain that encourages return stays. This trip we pre-booked most of our motels through the Wyndham website and were very pleased with the one that we stayed at in Las Vegas. It was a newly renovated property and new member of the Super 8 chain. It was freshly painted and very obviously clean. The rooms were a cut above the usual budget motel with their headboard and new linens. Even the way the beds were made up, looked more like a luxury hotel rather than just a budget. And the price was the lowest of the Wyndham chains. We changed our plans on our trip and came back to Las Vegas early and had to find a motel again for our last night. We returned to the same location and they extended the same 20% off when paid in advance price that we had booked on-line. Comments: Pros \u2022 Fresh and clean property \u2022 Staff that we dealt with were personable and good at their jobs \u2022 Very well priced \u2022 A certain higher level from the staff and property Cons \u2022 No fridge or coffee maker in the room Definitely a budget property that I can recommend and not, \u201cwould return to,\u201d we actually did return to it\u2026\u2026. and the price is the best of the other Wyndham properties. It is really, as the saying is, \u201ca no brainer\u201d Just a note to comment on our stay in the Super 8 in Las Vegas. It is newly renovated and new member of the Wyndham chain and we booked it off the Wyndham website sight unseen, of course. It was hard to find because they are apparently waiting approval for their new sign but what a surprise being there. It is obviously being managed by someone with a higher than average \u2026..something\u2026. perhaps professionalism. The property is clean because it is new but the rooms/beds were made up a cut above what we expected and have experienced in other Super 8 properties.

We checked out Tripadvisor, our trusted source, and found the Continental Suites, at the time sitting at #9 for all hotels in Las Vegas. At $29 per night for 2 nights, and $49 per night for the other two, we figured we would take a chance. We've been to Las Vegas a half dozen times before, and never went the \"cheapest hotel we could find\" route, so we thought we'd experiment. Pros: We had booked a balcony room, and ours overlooked the chapel next door, so it was entertaining to watch the weddings, especially on Halloween. We also asked for and got a fridge for our entire stay, so that was good. Parking was never a problem, it was available on both sides of the building. Free internet was a bonus in this town that is notorious for charging for it all along the strip. Cons: Overall the hotel is a bit run down with stained carpets in the hallway and a non-functioning ice machine (not that I was going to get any anyway). The towels are hit and miss, the tv only has about a dozen channels, and the bed is not at all comfortable. I realized after this trip that I really do need a few more comforts when I travel, and a nice bed is at the top of my list. We also skipped the breakfast. I personally would not choose to stay here again, but I can't completely bash the place at $29 and $49 per night.

After reading the reviews and then staying there, I'm thinking that they're either dilusional or they're talking about a different hotel. The prices on tripadvisor were accurate but there is NO WAY this hotel should be rated #9. It was so gross. The towels and washcloths had multiple long black hairs in them.

Very clean place next to a charming wedding chapel. Friendly, professional service. Granite counters and a safe are definite pluses. For the price you could do a lot worse with other motels in the area. I recommend this place if your budget is tight.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cvery nice good price\u201d", "Author": "tony v", "ReviewID": "UR118741279", "Content": "it was very nice and good service ,its look like a new hotel the staff was very good and friendly. the hotel is in avery good area close to all the main things . they have very good breakfast and its free,and the rooms are very clean. evrything was working for us internet ,parking ,good food and good service. the price was very good for the service, i was realy worry befour we got ther and i was so happey when we left . overall i strongly reccomended we will be back.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cfabulous Hotel\u201d", "Author": "shamell25", "ReviewID": "UR118658969", "Content": "first i want to say when you walk into the hotel lobby the staff is very welcoming.

Few frills but great value. The hotel is basic but clean. Our room looked like they had recently removed one of two beds, but left everything else in place making for an awkward arrangement. The bathroom had nice tile floor and marble counters, making it a little fancier than I was expecting. It didn't quite go with the rest of the hotel, which was so basic that their complimentary shampoo + conditioner came in foil packets like ketchup. One nice add-on: free wifi. Few hotels in the area offer free wifi, charging anywhere from $9.99 to $13.99, so this was a good perk. Nothing fancy, but it wasn't bad either. If you just need a place to sleep and shower this will suit your needs just fine at a great price. Tip: This hotel apparently just reopened under the name Continental Suites, so there's not much signage. Make sure not to blink or you'll miss it - look for the giant neon \"Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel\" sign and make that turn.
