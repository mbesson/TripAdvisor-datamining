Breakfast place is small for the number of hotel guests they accomodate, hence guests would need to squeeze to have their breakfast or even queue to wait for their turn to be sitted.

Overall it was a good experience. We were looking for an inexpensive hotel, which is hard to find in Venice. The Hotel Florida is 1 alley away from the train station, and for us was a great location. We didn't have to drag our luggage too far and the vaparettos and water taxis stop a 1/2 block away. The area is fairly congested though. The hotel is in an old building, no elevator for luggage. So getting our bags up and down those narrow stairs was a bit of a work out, but we'd expected that. The front desk is manned 24 hours which is great. The free wi fi worked well on the 2nd floor which we all appreciated. We were a group of 8, 2 rooms of 3 and 1 double. The rooms are a bit small, but clean and the bathrooms I saw had been re-tiled recently. They had nice showers and plenty of hot water. It was HOT in Sept but the a/c worked so we left the windows closed. Not much of a view on the back side of the hotel, but that was OK. The breakfast room is really tiny, and though it was included in the cost of the room, we only had breakfast there once. (Though we did stop there a couple of afternoons an buy a cold beer.)The coffee was pretty terrible and breakfast was just a roll & yogurt. We ended up going around the corner to Restaurant Brek for cappuchino & fresh crossants most mornings. The have a crossant with sprinkles on it that is filled with Nutella...mmmm! The lady at the front desk was helpful getting us an early taxi the morning we departed. We had to be at the airport by 6 am. We wanted a water taxi but couldn't get anyone to agree to pick us up at 5:30 am. So we ended up with a van. Though the driver had an arrangement with someone who works at the train station. He drove over in this little electric buggy and pick up all our luggage. Then we followed him through a back gate behind the train station to where the taxi waited for us, so we didn't have to drag out luggage up over the bridge into the taxi parking lot.

During breakfast the next day, we heard other guest complaining that their AC's were not working either and their rooms were uncomfortably hot. We complained to the person at the front desk, and they offered a different room, but we refused because everyone else was complaining about their rooms, too. One lady in particular was rude, saying that our AC not working is not that bad, that \"WAR IS TERRIBLE, this is not terrible!\" When I tried to sit in the breakfast room to cool off, they made me get out (I do not know why...) Anyways, when we came back that evening, they had left a card in the wall to keep the AC running and it had cooled off a bit, much better than it had been.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so easy to get to, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no crossing bridges with heavy luggage, no battling with cobblestone, etc. That is a definite bonus. We were in Room 7 and were there for 4 days in August. When you leave the hotel, you leave your key at the front, there is always someone there. The room has no alarm clock, but they have wake up calls. No big deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none of the rooms we stayed in during our trip had alarm clocks. The hotel is located right on top of a seafood restaurant. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing that depending on which direction your room faces, this may or may not affect you. If you face the laneway, this very much affects you. This VERY much affected us. Every night we could hear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very clearly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c conversations, dishes clanging, etc. After the restaurant closed, they would drag their heavy tables and chairs along the pavement inside and close up shop. Once that was quiet, we heard only the noises of loud teenagers that often walk up this alleyway to go wherever it is they all hang out. The windows of this hotel do absolutely nothing to block out any noise at all, it was like sleeping with them open. Once it is quiet enough for you to sleep \u00e2\u20ac\u201c around 1am, you fall asleep for a few hours, only to be awoken at 7am by the bells of the church next door. They were SO loud. And it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a quick chime, everybody up and in church. No, it rang 200+ times. We counted one morning. Why not, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t busy sleeping. We were so frustrated and fed up with this room after our first night, I considered switching hotels. As for the room, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very tiny. My suitcase sat atop the luggage rack. The only place for boyfriends was in front of the door. Handy, should we need to leave. There were no English channels on TV other than the BBC. Not a big deal I know, but when we are spending some down time in our room, it would be nice to have CNN to watch to know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in North America. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter either way, we may not have heard the TV over the noise from the restaurant. The shower curtain did nothing to stop water from getting on the floor. We gave up and just let it, soaking the bath mats until they were replaced. The bed was comfortable. What little sleep we did get, at least we had that. The breakfast room was very small, often there was a lineup of people waiting for a table. And there was only one poor girl working the whole room. The selection wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very good. They had cereal, croissants, coffee and yoghurt that they placed underneath a lamp every morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made no sense, it was like a heat lamp. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yoghurt supposed to be cold?? They have a computer in the breakfast room that guests can use for free for 30 minutes per day per room. As long as no one else is waiting to use it though, you can stay on longer and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say much. We left for the airport at 6am, and the one guy at the front desk, Emmanuelle, was a total sweetheart. He packed us a breakfast to take with us. It was such a sweet gesture. He should be working in a 5 star, not in a little dive like this place. I would not recommend this hotel and I would not stay here again. If you are visiting Venice, you are surely interested in the Gondolas. Here was our experience and why I will never speak kindly of them: There were 4 of us and we agreed we would do 80 euro for 25-30 minutes. We asked a couple gondoliers and finally found one who agreed to 25 minutes for 80 euro. He pointed out things here and there, commentated a little bit and seemed to be a nice guy. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a bad vibe from him, though after the fact, some in my group said they did. We were smart enough to check our watches when we left so when he returned us to his dock after 18 minutes, we said you owe us another 7 minutes. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI told you 20-25 minutes.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Ok a) you said 25 and b) even if you had said 20-25, it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been either. None of us enjoy being ripped off and were being sticklers, we had every right to be if he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to keep up his end of the deal. He got an attitude real quick so we got one right back. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe how arrogant and rude he was. At one point he said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a motor boat.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Then he said fine, you want 5 minutes? and proceeded to pull back out of his docking area and sit right down on his deck and look at us. I think he realized though he would get in trouble if anyone saw him so he stood up and kept us in place in the middle of the river while big boats went right by us. He was being totally lazy and trying to rip us off, but it took more effort for him to maintain and keep us steady just sitting there in the middle of the river. Look at the attached photo, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in this guys gondolier, if you must do the gondolas at all. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was worth it at all, even if the guy wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rude, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a tourist trap.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cOnly thing good about this hotel is the location\u201d", "Author": "MandWS-MN", "ReviewID": "UR117677982", "Content": "This is an older, basic property with almost no amenities.

We had read previouis reviews so were our expections were not high, but we really chose this hotel for the location and price given the high prices of hotels in this city. We were not dissappointed on this score as the hotel is literally around the corner from the train station and across the canal bridge from the bus station (10 minutes walk). The room we had was on the first floor overlooking the alleyway. Our first thought was to ask for a room at the back of the hotel but changed our minds as it was the only room with a little balcony and it had a nice feel to it. This proved to be a big mistake, as we discovered that this alleyway is a very busy walk through at night and early morning. A lot of high heeled ladies dragging suitcases. Also, the bells of the church chime at 7.15 and 8.15 each a.m. We had read about the bells in previous reviews and wore ear plugs and to be honest it didn't bother us as much as the noisy people outside, so the tip is to get a room at the back of the hotel. Contrary to other people's views we found the staff at reception more than helpful and advised us on a trip to Verona for a day which is a great idea. An hour and half there a back, well worth a visit. Breakfast is very, very basic, tea/coffee, yogurt, cheese slices, packet toast or white bread rolls, stale croisants and jam. For the price it could have been better and the breakfast area is very cramped. Otherwise, the room was very clean, shower and toilet adequate and plenty of wardrobe space. Pillows were thin but we had no problem getting extra ones. The water bus is only minutes away but we found that walking all the way to St. Marks square and getting lost a few times over little bridges was the best way to see Venice especially if you are snaphappy like my husband, stopping off for coffee and cakes on the way.

Since we have two small kids we wanted beds to sleep all four of us, not just one big bed that we'd all cram into. They aren't big enough to warrant renting two rooms yet. When we arrived we found the hotel quite quickly - it's very close to the train station and arriving by bus is just a bit further down the canal. It's down a small alleyway that has a few restaurants and other small hotels. Also for those travelling with small kids, there is a playground not too far away. Keep going down the alley, make a right and keep walking. Our room was a good size with two twins pushed together to make a king-sized bed, and two twin trundle beds pushed up against the opposite wall for the kids. The bathroom had a toilet, shower stall, bidet and sink. One complaint was that the shower did not drain too well and even after asking a few times for it to be somehow unclogged we still had to take the fastest showers of our lives to keep the floor from flooding. There were two windows in the room which opened onto the alleyway and they had the real wood shutters that we could open and close easily to give us almost complete darkness at night, which was nice. The heater was off when we arrived and it took a while to figure out that there was a circuit 3/4 of the way up one wall that we needed to flip in order for the heater to actually heat the room. But once we switched it on, the heater was adequate for the size of the room. The room was very clean - the parquet floors were in good shape and I couldn't find any dust. They had some area rugs thrown down to soften the bare floors, but without any non-slip pads underneath I just picked them up and folded them while we were there due to them sliding around whenever anyone walked on them. There was a very very small TV up on a corner stand that we didn't even bother to turn on since it would have all been in Italian anyway. Breakfast was served from 7am and it consisted of rolls, croissants, toasts, jam, yogurt, cheese slices, and coffee. You could order cappucinos, coffee and tea, and they'd bring them to you at your table but otherwise it was self-serve. There were several water shuttle stops very close to the hotel, which we utilized a ton. Note - if you can possibly take the #2 wait the extra few minutes vs. getting on the #1 (the local...). The front desk woman who was almost always there was friendly and spoke English. We were able to check in right at 1:00pm, the earliest they list on their site as check in time. The housecleaning service did a good job each day, and we had no noisy neighbors. Only the 120+ bells that tolled at dawn every day except Sunday interrupted our sleep. All in all it was the best hotel I could find for the price. We spent 430 Euros for 4 nights on a quadruple room with private bath. All of the others I priced out were in the 500 Euro range so I was happy to save some money, which was then spent during the trip instead.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne,Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "dcrop", "ReviewID": "UR12339924", "Content": "Stayed with our 2 boys aged 13 & 8 all in one room so was a little squashed but expected that of most Venice hotels.

One thing about the tub. It is a semi-split level tub which means it is extremely slippery . Then the bathroom door kept on opening up.
