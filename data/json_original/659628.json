{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent value! Amazing value! Only two downfalls: Small room and some rooms allow smoking (you can smell the smoke throughout the hotel). Our room was non-smoking but the two rooms sharing our wing of the hallway were smoking.Room had average quality beds, great water pressure and temperature in the shower and a nice big window to keep open for fresh air. Our room was newly renovated - nicely done but definitely done on a budget. Breakfast buffet is awesome!We walked everywhere in Frankfurt on our 3 day stay. The Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof is only a short 15 minute walk. It doesn't seem there's a lot to do in Frankfurt for holiday-goers. The Christmas market kept us busy most of the time, but we also took the time to see an Opera at the Frankfurt Oper.The Christmas market was amazing! Such a beautiful sight and a wonderful cultural experience. A walk on the Rhine River was a nice touch.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR801921699", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Sunshine_in_Calgary"}, {"Content": "Great value, clean room, good breakfast My husband and I stayed here so we could make it to FRA on time for my flight. The staff speaks english very well, and the rooms, thought a bit small, are very nice. However, if I had to stay there more than a few days, I would start feeling cramped.We had some duct tape on our shower and the doors didn't slide together, which didn't bother us because we didn't use it. Also, they asked 8 euro for parking, but we told them we booked through expedia so they didn't charge us. If you go to the front desk, they will give you a password for the wireless internet for free.The only thing I really didn't like about the hotel was that there was no refrigerator in our room. However, it was November, so we just set our food outside on the deck and it stayed cold enough to preserve it. Good luck to summer guests though.Over all, this was a good place to stay.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR301170862", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "melgody"}, {"Content": "Incredible Value with Wireless and Breakfast Included Paid $350 USD for 5 nights in a double room (2 comfortable twin beds). Breakfast (7-10am: fresh rolls, pastries, deli meats and cheese, tomato, cucumber, cereals, fruit yogurts, coffee/tea, nutella and jams, etc.) and wireless Internet included. The value here is incredible.Try to get a room in the main building. The annex building in the back (where the breakfast room is) does not have an elevator. Staff is very friendly and helpful.Our room was on the top floor (4th) in the main building. Small bathroom has sink, shower stall, and bathroom and is very clean. Room is cleaned daily. Only complaint is that neighboring guests smoke (even though the hotel is non-smoking). Huge 3-foot-by-3-foot window swings wide open and provides fresh air and a nice view of the neighborhood. To get to this hotel from Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof, you can either walk 15 minutes due west, take the 21 or 11 trams, or take the S3, 4, 5, 6 to Galluswarte and walk 5 minutes east on Mainzerlandstrasse.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR674923321", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lazydaisy11791"}, {"Content": "A nice hotel, but keep your eyes on your finances.... My wife decided to take me on a trip to Frankfurt for the Easter weekend and an early birthday present. What started as a nice trip (despite the weather) unfortunatley ended slightly badly.We (eventually) found the hotel after getting somewhat lost following the directions provided, and must say the hotel itself was pretty pleasent - clean and bright, spacious room, nice compact and clean bathroom. Although it was perishingly cold outside (and piddling down too!) the room was lovely and warm. The only complaint about the room was regarding the promised satellite television, which had a half-dozen channels, all in German (not even the ubiquitous CNN!). The only thing in English was a pay-per-view blue movie which wasn't what we wanted!However, on the third day (the day we were leaving Frankfurt) we discovered that monies we'd left in the room (50 Euros) had taken a walk. We tried to make our feelings known at reception but couldn't really communicate it (the person on reception being a little less than receptive to English, and our German being rather less than adequate). Anyway, what had been an OK trip (despite the weather, and most of the places we wanted to see being closed although they'd advertised on-line as being open) was somewhat marred by this.My advice would be, yes, go to the Fair Hotel Frankfurt, but keep your eye on your money, just to be on the safe side. The place itself is really nice, ideal to get your head down (and the breakfast is substantial) - but it could do with some kind of safe/deposit box facility. Also be aware that it's definitely more than 10 minutes walk from the station, but it's cheap for a cab (4 Euros).", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR891655922", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BigAudio"}, {"Content": "Hei\u813des Zimmer im Dachgeschoss   showReview(19645224, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR580751964", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Top Preis-Leistung   showReview(18526097, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR845109227", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "OK   showReview(18526095, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR438363472", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "F\u7709r den Preis super   showReview(18526094, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR370402960", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Leider entsprach das 3 Sterne-Hotel nicht unseren Vorstellungen von einem 3 Sterne Hotel   showReview(14728881, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR553892053", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\"Molto accogliente\"   showReview(14728880, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR794476302", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "buono in rapporto al prezzo   showReview(18526096, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR665391333", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "molto confortevole   showReview(11309199, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR583193949", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "F\u7709r den Preis ein gutes Hotel   showReview(11309198, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR775409123", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "wirklich keine Empfehlung!   showReview(11309196, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR994225470", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d659628-r23385173-Fair_Hotel_Frankfurt-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "659628", "Price": "$153"}}
