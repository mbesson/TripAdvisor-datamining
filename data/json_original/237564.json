Our double room turned out to be little more than a shoebox - just large enough for the bed, with dirty bare walls and a very basic shower/bathroom. We were also placed on the 5th (top) floor, and it was extremely hot from rising heat, despite it being very cold outside and having the windows open. I went to ask for a room change and the staff member was completely uninterested saying they were full. He then said that they had overbooked for the following night and so would be doing them a favour if i left and found somewhere else to stay! This would have been a good option, but i didn't wish to spend the precious little time we have there looking for a new hotel, so we stayed. The bed was uncomfortable and it was very hot at night.

I left the external windows open all day (although room-service shut them) which cleared some of the smell. The bed was very small and matress was hard. Smoking: There are signs up everywhere advising that smoking is not tolerated. On several occasions I went downstairs to find the hotel staff smoking in the lobby. I guess it is OK for the hotel to break their own rules. Tours: Be careful of the guides in the rooms. On several occasions the pricing was wrong. Not hugely. The guide said it would cost 10 Euro to rent a bicycle from the hotel, they charged $12.50. The brochure also mentioned a canal cruise for $10. When I showed it to then cruise operators, they explained the brochure was outdated and the price had increased to $12. The bike I hired was good but had no gears and only pedal-brakes (ie pedal backwards to stop). This took some getting used to. Facilities: The hotel internet was very expensive, five Euro for 30 minutes. The ironing board and iron had to be borrowed from downstairs, there was no iron or board in the room.

Not the view I had hoped for, but not everyone can have the canal view I guess. Well, no one was really hanging in the garden yet in early april so it was ok. The room was very \"optimized\" for two adults: not more than 50 cm around the double bed anywhere, the window sill ended up as the best storage facility, there was one cupboard to hang clothes but it had only one shelf. A + for the safe tough. The bathroom was almost as big as the room itself and I have nothing to complain about it. After some searching I found even the hairdryer located under the tiny table, but they would have been happy to borrow me one from the reception too if needed. The house is over two hundred years old so the walls do not keep the souds off very well. The most disturbing sounds were perhaps the thumping of the stairs every time someone climbed them. There was also the occasional sound of the elevator or the plumbing, but they did not prevent us from sleeping very well. I liked the lobby / breakfast room very much and the breakfast included everything we wanted. It was served until 11 which was nice since we were looking for some R&R. The location has been mentioned many times and it is indeed very good, in a beautiful, peaceful neighbourhood away from the bustle of the tacky tourist traps. It's still very reachable either with trams ( 4 or 16, 24 or 25) or by walking. We ended up taking a taxi from Centraal at arrival because Google Maps located the addres s somewhere around Jordaan (the 100 something numbers at Prinsengracht, not the thousands it should really be) and I hadn't printed a map when booking. The staff was friedly an all of them spoke exellent english. They booked us an table at the Indonesian restaurant Indrapura (which I really can recommend). We dined in the neighbouring Cafe des Fles and Pieter De Leeuwe and were not disappointed. Some mixed feelings but all in all a pleasant stay and I would recommend the place, though not for budget travellers. We paid around 140 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac / double / night including breakfast. The fee for using their wlan would have been 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac / 24h but we found a free one on the corner which was enough to keep our iPod & emails updated ;-) every time we walked by to the tram stop.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDecent 2* Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Davey1800", "ReviewID": "UR14631411", "Content": "My second stay in a few weeks.

I paid 105EUR per night for a single room, not including breakfast and taxes. I thought this to be quite expensive, but it was high season and one of the cheapest rooms I could find. Lets start with the positives. The hotel is in a lovely location on Prinsengracht, a very picturesque canal. It is quiet and you can have your window open in the evening with no noise at all. Front rooms overlook the canal; I had a room overlooking the rear residental gardens - very pleasant. It is quite far (approx 30 mins walk) to Centraal Station, but I used the trams (either take Tram 4 to Prinsengracht or 16,24 or 25 to Keizersgracht) to reach it with my luggage easily. It is close to many of the main sights in Amsterdam, Leidesplein, Rembrantsplein, Museumplein are easily walkable. Anne Frank Huis is an enjoyable 20 minute walk along Prinsengracht. The room: I had a single room. Unsurprisingly quite small, but I did not spend much time in the room. Simply furnished, they could do with a refurb but are adequate and I could not fault the cleaniness. Flat screen TV, which received many channels from all over Europe, it was great for me to have the BBC channels, especially as my stay was during Wimbledon! Shower room was clean and the shower worked well. Slight negative - they use shower curtains which aren't as nice as a cubicle with a screen. Breakfast: typical continental breakfast with bread and pastries, fruit salad and yoghurts, cheeses and meats. Good start to the day. Hotel communal areas: Very pleasant bar and breakfast area - that is furnished nicely with a modern feel - leading out into a lovely garden which residents can use. However, the hallways upstairs are rather dull and dated, similar to the rooms. The main negative here was that noise from the hallways travels into the rooms quite easily so it can disturb you if other guests come back to their room late. Staff: Very helpful and friendly. I had an issue with the tuning on my TV but it was fixed fairly quickly. Summary: Great location, simple but clean rooms.

I can't fault the service of the hotel staff, but the hotel was plain and uninspired much more like a 2* hotel, to be honest. Wallpaper was marked, furniture scuffed in places and stained. in all, a rather tired hotel that is in need of updating and a makeover. Breakfast was OK - very much the usual tourist 'continental' fayre that is served up. We won't stay here again - for what ended up costing almost 450 euros it was simply not worth the money.
