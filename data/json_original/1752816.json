The location is right on the corner of a main road, so I'm sure it's a great location for tourists passing through or wanting to move around Kissimmee.

There was no dead bolt lock on the door which, to me, should be mandated by law. The worst offense was cockroaches, which I found in two places. During the night was when they chose to have workmen hammering, sawing, and ripping molding off walls in the hallway, something which should have been done during the day when customers are not trying to sleep. Also, the morning I was leaving I was subjected to a shower that had no hot water (caused, I was told, by a valve malfunction in the building). On the good side, the staff was most helpful. I had made it clear when I checked in that a good internet connection was an absolute necessity. When I could not get a good connection in the room I was given, I was moved to a more expensive room (at no additional cost) that was next to the motels wireless router which assured me an excellent connection. They also gave me personalized assistance in establishing a connection to the motels wireless network. Personally, I would never stay here again unless it is totally rebuilt.

The staff was quite friendly to us and they even gave us a great suite with bunkbeds for the grandchildren traveling with us - all for the same low price. The bathtub needed work (dripped and needed to be repaired) and the microwave should be replaced. Other than that our room was just fine. Two TVs (one in our section with queen bed and one in double/single bunkbed section), microwave and mini-frig, table and chairs, bench at door, separate sink outside of bathroom area (sink also inside bathroom area), clothes hanging rack, coffee pot with coffee, cream, etc. lots of drawers (we were staying for 4 nights so clothes were put out of the way), quite roomy area throughout. Much larger than we were expecting to get for the money. There is a large pool, a kiddie wading pool, playground (one piece needed repair but the rest was useable by all of the children), basketball goal (we had brought our own basketball but some were available at the desk), vollyball and shuffleboard (needed cleaning off from oak trees surrounding area) and a nice putting green (9 holes spread around) with clubs and balls at the desk. The grandchildren had a grand time for the days we stayed and slept great. Again, for the money a good deal, unless you need fancy trappings and plush carpet. Part of the place was closed down, but in this ecomony I can understand why! Housekeeping did the best they could to keep the halls and lobby clean. I would recommend looking at our room before checking in to know what you are getting, some rooms must be pretty bad judging by other reviews. Ours was fine. As for price, other hotels advertise the same or less per night, just be sure you are not going to charged for additional persons with the price. We were charged the advertised price for all in our party - two adults and three children - no extra as some of the others wanted to charge. One other thing, there are a few places to eat within walking distance, but most are more of a short drive away. They also do offer bus service to the parks and such and have a small \"store\" inside the lobby. No restaurant on site, but Perkins is just across the street.

Staff friendly and helpful, though we were there for 6 days before we had any maidservice. Needed to track down a toilet roll after day 4. The hotel now appears to be a community home for locals who have lost their own homes for whatever reason. School buses pick up and deposit school kids who are living in the 'hotel' on a daily basis. The same kids use the hotel facilities. Lots of the balconies have signs of habitation, such as BBQ's and bicycles. There was one incident where a 'guest' was dressed in towels and on various occasions over a 24 hour period could be seen and heard shouting and yelling from his balcony, obscenities and general abuse. He was either drunk or on drugs or both. He was subsequently taken away by the police after a night where I was awoken at 12.30am, 2.30am and 7.15am. One English holidaymaker and her family who travelled with Cosmos were quite annoyed as they had been told that the hotel was three star but it is patently obvious this is not the case. No entertainment, no restaurant. On one occasion there was loud music blasting around the pool area when there was absolutely nobody there apart from my wife and I and when asked if it could be turned off or down we were told that it was on a timer and could not be controlled as nobody had the key to the bar where the controls were located. We left the pool as it was impossible to relax because of the noise, but in fairness from that day there was no music around the pool. If you like Kissimmee the hotel is in a good location as it is not too far from the attractions and there is a Perkins restaurant right next door, with many other restaurants within a short drive.

Me and hubby had been to Florida 16 years ago, pre-kids, so managed to find a short notice weeks holiday there through a travel agent. We trusted the brochures word for it and didn't bother looking up reviews (which we normally do!) Kids (girl 14 and boy 11) were really looking forward to it, we were a bit disappointed with it all for a day or two, but were soon busy out and about so it didn't spoil our holiday. So... outside looked grubby, reception was marble, ceiling fans, sofas etc, so thought mmm looks ok. Checked in, staff very friendly, got lift to our 3rd floor room (lifts a bit tempremental). Very first impression was old and tired, peeling paint, TV on/off button broken and disappeared inside the TV!, bathroom door hinges rusty, fittings coming off the walls, taps loose, etc. On the plus side, the toilet flushed, the shower worked and there was plenty of hot water, the a/c worked fine, the beds were comfy (although extra pillows would've been nice) and we had a balcony overlooking the pool (although we didn't have chairs and most other rooms did). The room was very clean and the housekeeping staff were great, clean towels, beds made and floor hoovered every day. We soon realised that there were no tea/coffee making facilities as described in the brochure and when I mentioned this to the manager, he apologised and said they don't do that anymore, but I could get a cup of hot water from the drinks maker in the reception for 75c and he would give me a teabag! I think it depends on which room you have, because I've read in other reviews that people have had fridges and microwaves in their rooms! There was a hairdryer and iron, but I ended up going out to buy a kettle and extra pillow! Around the hotel - didn't bother with the restaurant (only open for breakfast) or the bar. Games room wasn't up to much and the 'gym' had a treadmill (broken) and a crosstrainer. The pool was good, looked clean and not too much chlorine, clean towels for you to use were put out every day. Also a jaccuzi (although not sure how this was cleaned, and quite a few bodies are in there throughout the day!) There was never more than a few people at the pool at one time, and it closed at 11pm (to be honest I would say that the pool was the best thing about this hotel!) At the back of the pool is a small kids play area (also a very strong smell of gas), then round to the left is a lovely lake with swinging bench seats. Couple of warnings - scammers push pizza flyers under the hotel doors , do not order from these people! Also, the ticket sellers in reception can be quite pushy and try to persuade you into timeshare. We bought our tickets - Seaworld, Universal, Gaterland and Wet n Wild - from Walmart, got a good saving and a safe place to buy. By the way, Walmart is excellent for anything you want to buy and it's open 24 hours! Good places to eat are Perkins (just over the road), staff great and good food, and Sizzlin Grill ($3.49 all you can eat breakfast!) if you don't mind plastic plates.

For starters trying to get up to our room on the 4th floor, 1 of the 2 elevators were broken and 2nd one didn't sound too safe!

Our room did have a microwave and mini-fridge, thank goodness because the restaurant downstairs was shut down for business (not sure why), so we had to go to a local 7-eleven to buy food. Our UNpleasant stay started while waiting to check-in, the guy at the guest relations counter on the side of the front desk started HOUNDING us to take a \"resort tour\" in exchange for discount attraction tix or a rebate of $100...We already had our Disney tix and he just would not leave us alone, one day he even followed me into the elevator, a bit much...BEWARE of this SCAM!!!!! It wouldn't be so bad if these guys would just take a simple \"no\" for an answer! As for the room, believe what you are reading here, paint off the walls, a constant running bath tub and rusty disgusting drains that backed up and had no plugs. The bath tub was painted and paint was peeling from that as well. Everything was very old (carpet, furniture)The king size bed was super old and was sunk down on both sides from over use, very uncomfortable, sheets did appear clean (I would not have gotten in them otherwise) however only 3 pillows that were flat, had to use towels under the pillows to make a little more comfortable. A very strong musty/moldy smell to the entire room at all times. Went down by the pool one time only, my husband got in the pool while I sunbathed. We couldn't tolerate anymore than 1 hour due to the strong sulfur/sewer smell around the whole pool area, it was making me sick. Upon our 4th morning there at 7am I awoke to the biggest roach I ever saw crawling up the wall on my husbands side of the bed, I could not believe my eyes. I call the front desk for IMMEDIATE assistance. 15 minutes later, I had to call down again and I was told someone was on their way. For 20 minutes I waited in the hallway with the door open while my husband watched this thing crawl all over our room to make sure he didn't get in our suitcases! UGH! Maintenance did remove the roach and totally tried to down play the whole incident as if it wasn't a big deal! Sorry, it was a VERY BIG DEAL to us.

It's back with a new name and maybe new owners (though it still had the Ramada sign when I was there). Other than that, the decline continues. The best thing I can say is that I only had to stay one night. The place was probably OK and at the middle to upper middle of the market in the 70s, but now it's about 10 years past due for renovations. My room had the musty and mildewy smell noticed by others. The carpet, beds, all furniture and fixtures were tired and overworn. In the bathroom, the toilet tank lid had been replaced with a non-fitting one, there was a foul smell, paint was cracking and signs abounded that maintenance was merely trying to keep things operational. I had been put here through Priceline after bidding 2-star and up in Kissimmee and other Orlando zones. At $22 (for a weeknight in mid-January), it hit on this place. With taxes and the hidden Priceline service charge the total came to $31.88. Ah, but then they surprise all Priceline and other customers on check-in with a RESORT FEE of $3.34 a night (they say it's $2.95, but that amount is subject to hotel/motel tax, so it's really $3.34). A 2-star (should be sub 1-star) place that charges a resort fee! Supposedly this is for a shuttle to Disney, use of exercise equipment and some other things that should be part of the base rate. What the fee really does is allow this place to unfairly bag a lot of unsuspecting customers like myself through Priceline at the expense of better, less underhanded competitors in one of the country's most crowded and competitive hotel areas. I'm pretty sure, for example, that other hotels would have taken a bid at $25.34 (22 + 3.34), probably even in the same zone (Kissimmee /Disney is glutted with budget hotels). But those other hotels were probably under the illusion that you can play it straight and still get customers via Priceline. Of course, Priceline has a blanket disclaimer saying that you may run into resort fees and, if you do, they're your responsibility. Sorry, guys...you have a quality problem here and you need to take ownership of that problem. When people get dumped into lousy hotels that shouldn't even BE on Priceline because the hotel management used hidden fees so that they could accept bids at lower bid levels than competitors and \"scoop up\" the bids, those customers will justifiably feel abused. They will hold the hotel AND Priceline responsible and give bad word-of-mouth to the hotel AND Priceline. Playing CYA with disclaimers won't save you in the court of public opinion. Lesson learned: I won't be bidding through Priceline for Orlando again. The only other defense, if you MUST use Priceline, is to not bid lower than 2.5-stars for Kissimmee. This hotel was likely built anticipating a boom from Disney visitors back in the 70s. But there was (and is) such a glut of hotels in the area that rates have long been depressed, so Ramada apparently just let the place go to pot rather than sink money into keeping it up. And now it's handed off. Avoid. And beware of bidding through Priceline.

I mentioned this to the administration of the hotel, but they did'nt care, and they stated \"Unless we catch them doing something we can't do a thing\"!Fourth, the pool area is dirty, there is no restuarant,no wear to get a drink and also the construction guys sit by the pool,screaming and drinking beer all dat as well as oggling all the women, from age 12 to 88!!These guys are also smoking marijuana in the pool area as well as in the halls, making this hotel smell and or reek like POT! Also the pool area does not have security guard or a lifeguard,or even a camera, and while I was staying there, a young tourist girl,12, died in the pool area. My suggestion is to have the county officials who approved the owners to allow this place to run as a hotel,to investigate if the owner paid them off,because no way can a place like this be open and be run like a hotel!!This place needs to be closed down by the county!!!", "Date": "June 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cCan you say Nasty?\u201d", "Author": "kattimNc", "ReviewID": "UR7394791", "Content": "We stayed here on a group trip.

For example, they charge you $3.34 per day a \"resort fee\" that other 192 hotels seem to find a way not to charge. They explain that it's for use of their recreational equipment, their in-room safe, and shuttle to Disney. If you do not use those services, TOUGH. If they're so desperate for the $2.95 plus tax, they should just raise their room rates by 3-dollars so people don't know they're being ripped. I mean, I've stayed at budget hotels like Days Inn and Super 8 and actually been reimbursed a $1 safe fee. And beware if you use their shuttle to anywhere but Disney. The shuttle to Sea World, for example, will cost you even though you already \"paid for it in the resort fee\". Another thing: local calls are NOT free and they charge you after so many minutes....there's no free continental breakfast. These are all little things that even a budget hotel provides. Internet will cost you $1 per 20 minutes on a lobby kiosk, although you can sit on a couch with your laptop next to the kiosk and get free Net. The Net does not work in the rooms. The TV has only a few channels above the ABC, CBS, etc. I know being on vacation isn't about watching TV, but if the Super 8 down the street can have 60 cable channels, why can't a supposedly-superior Ramada? So, you can save a few bucks by choosing this hotel but you end up paying more, or the same as another 192 hotel that offers these perks. The hallways smelled very bad on the fourth floor, where my room was. Like cat urine. But I will say the rooms themselves were fine, beds were comfortable....and the hotel's location on 192 is very good for getting to attractions.

This was the case at this motel so I stayed for the week at a rate of $235.00 plus tax. Be warned, their is tax and surcharges so after all is added, it's closer to $300.00 but still a fair value at $42.00 per night. Maintenance here is fair, I called for 2 clogged sinks and needed some drain opener, a man arrived and fiddled with the trap but couldn't fix either of them, I told him they needed draino and he looked at me as if I had 2 heads. Fire alarms went off at different times through the 7 day stay and we lost hot water one morning. Peeling tub paint and a leaking toilet but again, what do I expect for $35.00 + per night ?? It was clean. So in ending, I stayed for an additional 7 nights and put up again with the minor problems. Housekeeping was very considerate to obeying our DND and cleaned our room every afternoon without fail.

The elevators were crusty & old... our room was on the 3rd floor & one time the elevators didnt even work to come down to the lobby..we had to take the stairs!

In the morning I discovered dirty childrens socks in the bed with me (I was not travelling with children) along with crumbs and fruit punch stains on the sheets and jam on the other beds cover. I called the day manager who was not helpful at all. I told them I wanted fresh clean linen. I stripped the beds & put the linens on the floor. Imagine my horror when I came back Monday night and found the same sheets were put back on the bed!!(the punch stains were proof). I went to the night mgr and complained again. He offered to send someone up to change the bedding. A security guard came up with 4 flat sheets and handed them to me. When I complained in the morning, the same mgr Kevin was on . Again he made no effort at service recovery, only stated that it's their policy to change linens every other day.

It was your typical Ramada stay -- clean, with up-to-date accomodations, and the staff was very helpful. They even bent the rules and let us check in early after our 20 hour drive from Pennsylvania. Gotta love that! The restaurant was all right. We ate our breakfast there because the buffet really wasn't bad and for a family of four to eat for a whopping $12 or so is pretty amazing (kids eat free). The staff there was very helpful and friendly, more so than the folks working the Disney counter. And therein lies the problem... If we had any questions about Disney, the front desk staff referred us to the \"wonderful\" Disney counter next to them. To say the folks working there were clueless is an understatement. We received more helpful information about the various parks from the staff at the restaurant. That, coupled with -- as one other person had said -- the lack of transportation to and from the park -- were the only downers. The shuttle is a bust. There's only a 9:30 AM hotel pick up time and 6 PM, 7PM, and 10:30 PM park pick ups. We have a seven year old and a five year old and had hoped to do one of the parks in the AM, take a break and head back to the room to give the kids some down time in the afternoon and then return in the evening. Nope. Couldn't do it unless we drove. We also couldn't do the waterparks unless we drove because the shuttle didn't go to Typhoon Lagoon or Blizzard Beach -- this was something NOT mentioned in our travel arrangements, because if it had been, we might've reconsidered our stay. There's got to be another shuttle service that the hotel can contract with. If they would, then this would've been the idea off-property Disney stay.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "America's Best Inn Main Gate East", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d1752816-Reviews-America_s_Best_Inn_Main_Gate_East-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$41 - $62*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5150 West US Hwy 192</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34746</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1752816", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ac/70/ac70d42af886f1e8d8dc571c3eb02b2e4large.jpg"}}
