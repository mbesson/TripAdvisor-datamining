Especially, because I read them AFTER I booked in CieloMar. So I was not looking forward going there, but had no choice; so of course I went. Ok, so we got there like at 2pm and the check in was not until 3pm, so they let us sign but they could give us the keys after 3. So we had a chance to walk around a little while they were cleaning the rooms. We took a peak of some of them and were allowed to see some of the new rooms. They were super clean neat and smelled really good, and were very cool, considering the heat out there was 100F. We tried to change rooms to the new ones, but they were already reserved, so we went to see our room (i thought they were bad, without seeing them-because of the reviews i read). The room looked OK so we stayed. Our room was interior, 1 bed and no balcony. I really have to say that the foor tiles were nice, the decoration was pretty up-to-date (it was not old looking at all!!). The towels in the room smelled clean, the bed was pretty neat and clean. Although it was a hard mattress, and the bedcover was a little old looking, I slept well and for the price we payed ($74 the night), you can't expect them to be from a ritz-carlton. The sheets don't work very good against the cold room, but you can always control the temperature of the air conditioner. Talking about the air conditioner, we had to ask maintenance to help us with it because we tried to put it a little cooler and don't know what we did that it turned to \"fan\". So the maintenance guy came and helped us with it. He was really friendly and cordial, too. The bathroom in our room had no ceiling, so if it was at night and you had to pee, the bathroom light could light all the room. And the TV was an old-school one, but it worked and it was no problem for me. The pool.... the pool was clean and I didn't see animals floating anywhere in the pool. Of course, you can't control nature anyways. The bar & restaurant area has a great, beautiful view !! The waiters were extra nice and friendly. I did not had anything to eat, but we did had the drink of the house and it was good. So overall, we paid very low for our stay, and I cannot complain. For me being a person used to staying in luxury hotels and great commodities, it was way better than expected. The service, cleanliness, the rooms, everything. Oh, and free parking with security!! You don't get that anywhere !! You are not paying for a 4 star hotel, but I really recommend this place.

On the positive side, most of the staff is friendly and will go the extra mile but two of the receptionists could do with more training on how to greet/deal with customers and the waiter who served us the first (and only) time we ate at the restaurant could gain on honesty. In term of location, I understand it is a great place for surfers as it is close to many spots but that's it. Although many other interresting places (suggested in their handbook) are from reachable distance if you have your own transportation and are planning to do some sightseeing. On the other side, as we tour the hotel on our first day there, we realised (from the view from the restaurant) that it appeared to be still in construction ... however other bits tended to prove that it was either old or badly maintained. A case in point is \"the whale\" a small slide for kids in the pool area. The paint on it is totally faded and in some area the steel even shows. Another review mentionned the plumbing system, and I thought come on, that was until I realised I could hear my neighboor shower, flush their loo ... and that the pressure of the water in the shower also changed if my neighbour was having a shower at the same time. The fact that I could hear all this was a good indication of the soundproofing as well ... paper thin walls and doors and noisy a/c made my nights there virtually sleepless. Oh nearly forgot ... what they say about the critters in and outside the pool is true too ... in the shower next to the pool we were greeted by a cosy spider (in full swing in its wide web) and a dead cocroach and inside the pool ... an unidentified amphibian.

They did have some bugs on the pool because of the location of the hotel, you cant control mother nature... an employee took care of them with quickness.

The BAR/REST employees where just as friendly. 2.CLEANLINESS- The room was clean, ROOM SERVICE came by every single day and in cases we where not ready for them they would return, none of our personal stuff was messed with. The bathrooms where clean and attended to every single day. The common areas where very clean considering they are in wide open spaces in front of the beach. 3.LOCATION- You all have read it over and over again the view is expectacular, and close to everithing. 4.VALUE- You pay for what you get, good bang for your buck. 5.ROOMS- They have brand new furniture in the rooms, the A/C is realllllllllly cold.

I've posted pics of the first room. The television needed an upgrade, the refrigerator was in front of the closet which made it difficult to open. I requested a room change (416) to a room with double full size beds and plenty of room to move around in, the bathroom was more than double the size of my first room and they did not charge me any additional monies. I rate a 2 and 1/2. I wish I had pics to post on this room but take my word for it, this room was much better with a better looking television and a desk with a chair and a table with two chairs. The food was good but a little pricey if you eat locally the prices are much better. Anyway despite the disappointment at first, it turned out to be a really nice vacation spot.

None of the staff has a uniform, their wear anything they want, any color, any style, and the housekeepers are wearing nurse uniforms. Very unprofessional. And in fact the musty stench in the rooms was so horrible that we could not stay at all. We ended up having to move to another hotel. So please do not waste your time and money. Do not even consider this place.

As a younger traveler, my standards are not as refined, I suppose. Given that, I would never stay at Cielo Mar again. Granted, this was a last minute business trip to Aguadilla, and there are no 'American' hotels in the area. That said, this one is miserable. First off, you plug in its address to any GPS device, and it directs you to the middle of a residential area not near the hotel. After searching 30 minutes for the hotel, my fellow traveler and I check in to find that they give you the TV remote when you check in. Never a good sign. You enter the room, and my first thought was 1950s New Jersey Shore with no updates or cleaning since that time. Thankfully, no critters, but rust everywhere. Never seen more of it in my life. The Internet was not working (not a huge surprise I suppose), and I really did not want to get into the bed without a full body covering. The air conditioning only semi-worked. Breakfast on our second morning started 30 minutes later, so we could not get any before leaving for our business meeting. All in all, a bad hotel that I would never return to. Try Villa Montana instead - equally as difficult to find, but the restaurant was fabulous and the ocean view amazing.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cStay Somewhere Else\u201d", "Author": "maythefal", "ReviewID": "UR10089483", "Content": "First of all, I did not choose this hotel. I had no option, as I was attending a marriage seminar and the hotel was chosen by the organizers. We stayed for a weekend, and I was ready to get divorced if I had to stay a day longer (which kind of beats the purpose of the weekend). The rooms were quite comfortable, and that is the only good thing about them. There was very poor lighting, and the bathroom was a nightmare. The bathtub was stained and rusty, really disgusting. The air conditioner is turned off when the rooms are not in use, and there is a lot of humidity, so you can imagine the smell when we walked into the room. My husband had to take down a screen to be able to open a window to let the room air out (no balcony in our room). The pillows were really thin, and when we asked for extra pillows, there were none (they had already been distributed to other complaining guests). A couple that was attending the seminar had to go out and buy their own pillows. The staff was friendly, but couldn't really provide much service. On the positive side, the view is great and if you have kids, the pool is designed for their entertainment, with slides and waterfalls. But I have no plans on ever staying there again. If I need another weekend escape, I'll stay somewhere else in Puerto Rico.

What is also great is that the airport in Aguadilla is literally five minutes away, alot of people dont know that this airport has major Airline companies flying in there like Jet Blue. Also you have Ramey base within minutes from here. It's very easy to get to from the major highway #2. And parking is free, not like some other places who charge an additional fee for parking.
