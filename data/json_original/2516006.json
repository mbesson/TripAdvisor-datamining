This is not the right hotel if you are expecting to spend a lot of time entertained on-site, but it is perfect for a business traveler or active tourist.

From Vicky's pleasant and helpful welcome in reception to the well-kept rooms, this is a hotel that is great value for money spent. Room 114 was, as asked for, very quiet as its window was on the narrow patio between the two wings of the hotel. We were able to spend a restful night on comfortable beds in a quiet location. As has been mentioned, it is an old hotel so don't expect a trendy, upscale property. It is more \"old Hollywood\" than anything else. Carpets could use some updating but they are clean and not shabby. Our only concern was parking as there is no dedicated lot, only street parking, which, as in most areas in the city, has severe restrictions. Weekends are easier and the hotel will accommodate you if you return home late on a weekend night - ask Vicky! There is a complimentary breakfast which we didn't stay for so we can't comment on it.

So it's not the Ritz, but give me this over the Ritz any day. I can honestly say that this was one of the most enjoyable and hassle-free stays at a hotel for quite a while. I can't find a fault in any aspect of my stay here. The location was perfect for getting to almost anywhere downtown, museums, shopping at The Grove or Farmers Market and freeways for venturing further afield. Staff could not have been more helpful. I was concerned before arriving at some of the comments regarding parking in the street and the permit, but if you keep your wits about you and know what the rules are about where to park, you will have no problems. The furthest I had to park was about 200 yards away and the owner was also proactive with regard to the street cleaning days and making sure that guests were not parked in areas that were being cleaned. The room was comfortable, clean and large and my bed was very comfortable. There is also a small area out front to sit and chill after a days sightseeing or shopping. There was occasional noise from other guests, but I was never awakened or disturbed by any noise.

The breakfast was also okay, but it wouldn't take much to make it rate higher, such as baked goods of just a bit better quality -- the cottage cheese, tomato and cucumber is a nice touch. In my opinion this property would rate another star if not for the somewhat bleak nature of the room.

The hotel looks like it could use some minor repairs such as painting interior trim work and exterior trim. Our real complaint was from a customer service standpoint was when we requested a taxi. The front desk staff person called and the taxi arrived in a timely manor. The driver came to the front desk at which time my wife noticed the driver gave the staff member a few rolled up dollar bills for the referral. The horrible part was the taxi was awful! We were enclosed in the back seat of what appeared to be a old Ford Crown Vic police car with a divider. We were unable to place our feet flat on the floor and the cab was a rolling oven! No air in the passenger area and we felt as if we would faint! It was terrible. It is our opinion the hotel should have certain standards in regard to their taxi company referrals for their guests especially after receiving a referral fee! Not good.

We loved the Wilshire Crest. Typically one can't find a reasonably priced hotel within walking distance of attractions but this place is just blocks away from museums, the Grove, the Farmers Market -- plus I could run in the early morning through its residential neighborhood and feel safe. Best of all - free parking. The one time we had trouble finding a spot I left my keys with the staff and they parked for me. The room was clean and very big. As other posters have noted, it does not have all the 'extras' of bigger hotels, but the staff provided everything that was missing. The staff was always helpful. The shower had excellent water pressure. The beds were dressed with spotless white down comforters and half a dozen pillows. Breakfast was very handy although heavy on the sugar - even the instant oatmeal was flavored with sugar. To avoid sweets you'd have to stick to the plentiful (and fresh) bagels with trimmings. Regarding security - there was somebody at the front desk 24 hours and I felt very secure there. But if you are a person who is very nervous, know that the locks on the room doors are wobbly and the doors are not heavy and solid. This was not an issue for me at all, but I know that for some people a solid door with a key card is vital for their comfort The whole place was quiet but again, any noise from the hallway came right under and around the doors. My only issue with the place had to do with the placement of my room just over the kitchen - I woke to the sound of cupboards opening and closing every morning at breakfast time. To avoid that just ask for a different room. I can't say enough good things about the manager Aaron. He communicated with me very promptly in advance of our trip, greeted us by name when we arrived, and provided a fruit basket on our second day.

We were working on a budget this time. Based on the price and reviews from here, we decided to try a 'Boutique Hotel'. Service - We were very impressed with the service. We arrived home late on Sunday night. The street cleaners were doing one 1/2 of the street (Mondays), so parking was full on our entire block. We stopped at the desk, and he said he left a bit of room where he parked in case this happened. So he went out and moved his car so we could fit in! Awesome! The free continental breakfast consisted of coffee, juice, bagels, sweet pastries, Cheerios, Cornflakes and yogurt. It wasn't anything to write home about but it did the trick to get our day going! If you're looking for more, there is an IHOP close by. I brought along a laptop (I've never used one before) and tried to access the WiFi (the person at the front desk gave me the code). I never did get connected. Could've been me? Either way, they had a computer in the sitting area by the front entrance that we used. Room - We were in Room 215 (view of apartments next door and partial view of front street) and it was just what you would expect. A bed, bathroom, a door for an option to use adjoining rooms, dresser, table with 2 chairs, wall-mounted TV, mini fridge, stand for setting your luggage on, and a very spacious closet. There was also a vanity mirror and sink outside the bathroom (which was very handy). We weren't expecting to spend much time at the hotel, so the basics were all we needed. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. We heard something through the wall maybe once for about 10 secs. That was it. I guess it depends on who your neighbours are at the time! Check out was seamless. We didn't get any 'surprise' charges. Location - We planned on doing the typical touristy things. It was great being so close to The Grove/Farmer's Market. It's only blocks away, and there were tons of dinner options there. We also caught a movie at the theatre there. We drove everywhere else (Venice Beach, West Hollywood, Rodeo Drive, Griffith Observatory, etc..) and didn't use more than 1/2 tank of gas in the entire 4 days. Everything is nice and close!

All in all a good stay- would definately recommend the Wilshire and should I find myself in LA again-would come back and stay.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant, quiet hotel in a great location.\u201d", "Author": "HampsteadCBD", "ReviewID": "UR94959361", "Content": "This a quiet, no-frills hotel with a homely atmosphere which concentrates on the essentials that a visitor requires.

I was deceived by their nicely constructed website and inviting pictures. In fact, I stayed in the same room that was shown on their website. It is by far the WORST place I've ever stayed in. It is absolutely false advertisement claiming it's an \"European Style Boutique Hotel\" . The place is old, smelly, dirty, and gross. First of all, the room smelled as soon as I walked in. I killed a small cockroach in the bathroom. The towels and the bed sheets were not clean and had stains on them. I found 1 more small cockroach crawling on the bed. The furniture was old and dirty. Breakfast was pathetic with juice, coffee, rotting bananas and apples. I believed I paid $140 for the room, which is a completely waste of money. I just don't want any more travelers be deceived by their nice website. I don't have anything against the hotel or the owner, but I just feel deceived by their claim and pictures on the website.

Hotel was located in a residential neighborhood. This caused parking to be problematic. However, off street parking at bank\u2019s parking lot across a busy street was available. Within walking distance to LA County Museum of Art and La Brea Tar Pits. About 5 blocks south of the Farmer\u2019s Market and The Grove shopping center. This is an older hotel. Seems to have been an apartment building in it's former life. It is quaint and it does have an European feel; albeit a 2 star, 100 year old European hotel.. Floors were \u2018squeaky\u2019 & I could hear people in room above me walking. Rooms were larger than the average hotel/motel. Room was clean and daily maid service excellent. Our bathroom seems to have been remodeled recently. Bright and clean. However, several spot lights in the room were out. Knob on the heater/AC unit was loose and the knob controlling the vent was missing. Breakfast was true continental. Bagels, a few pastries, OJ and coffee. Not much compared the typical Hampton Inn/Holiday Inn Express fare. If you want a breakfast, walk 5 blocks to the Farmer\u2019s Market for a REAL meal. This is a great value hotel, given the area it is located. It is what it is advertised as \u2013a good, clean hotel.

If all you care about is a clean bed, a hot shower, and a decent selection of cable TV channels, it will suit your purposes fine. At $112/night, some might consider it a good value, given its location. But I've gotten better values at other L.A. hotels (e.g. $60 at the MUCH nicer Hyatt West Hollywood) by booking through Priceline.

We were probably the first to have our room for some time, it was clean but very musty and unaired. Browns and greens of the old fashioned tones. The beds were of the type found in cheap motels in the 50's and 60's. Not too uncomfy if you like hard mattresses and lumpy pillows. The linen was changed after the first night. Bathroom modernised. No tea/coffee maker. Please, in this day and age! A deserted and gloomy breakfast room with defrosted pastries and actually quite nice coffee. Sorry, this was so disappointing.
