Very comfortable, clean with excellent service and a great cafeteria. Their buffet breakfast is excellent. Across the street is the famous Alameda Central Park walk a couple of blocks to the right and you start coming across all the sights of the historic center of Mexico City such as the the Palace of Fine Arts, the Latin American Tower which you can ride up to the top and get a spectacular view of the city. Keep walking and you are the Government Palace square with the Cathedral on one end and Government Palace on another surrounded by the Jewelry district, marvelous old churches, theaters, monuments etc. Let me not forget to mention that practically on any of these corners you can hop on the city tour bus and take the great narrated 3+ hour tour all around Distrito Federal that takes you all the way to Chapultepec Park allowing you to get off and hop back on as you wish through out the day for the same reasonable fare. We have stayed at this hotel 3 times and although Mexico City does have more great luxury hotels in the surroundings, I would not have it any other way. This one has given us exactly what we need and until we find something unpleasant from them we will always go back", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNice, straightforward hotel\u201d", "Author": "XFisher", "ReviewID": "UR122592462", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel many times before (business travel) and this is my first review. I definitely recommend. It is a nice, clean, straightforward hotel. Nothing fancy. The location is very good. Within walking distance there are lots of historic places: Palacio Bellas Artes, Zocalo, Palacio Nacional, Cathedral, Templo Mayor, and the business centers of Reforma. Rooms are clean and fair sized. Be sure not to get a room facing avenida Juarez, you will have a nice view of La Alameda (park) but the noise of the traffic and people goes on past 2AM. The restaurant is fair, do not expect anything fancy. Attendants are very courteous and friendly, as well as the bellboys and the front desk persons. To the side of the hotel, across the street, there is a Hilton hotel which hosts many good restaurants in case you wish to enjoy a more formal lunch or dinner with a good wine. The hotel has free WiFi, and at least in my room the reception was very good. There are also places for those who smoke.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Xalapa", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel!\u201d", "Author": "R2D2_MX", "ReviewID": "UR122070957", "Content": "I found a discount rate for a single room for two (about 55 dollars per night) and it was great!

You complain at the reception and they promise to fix it the next day. On the next day, imagine you worked for 12 hours, had no dinner, so everything you want is to get into your room and ask for room service. But the phone is still not working. You go down to the reception, complain, they say it is a \"problem with the line\" (uau !), and promise to fix it for the next day. And the situation keeps the same forever. I am in my fourth night here, and I still do not have a telephone that works !!! Yesterday they proposed to change my room. At 11 at night, after working for 13 hours, the idea of packing everything, moving to another room and unpacking again sounded like a bad-taste joke. I am sat here waiting for somebody, cannot take a shower (there will be technicians in my room, I guess), cannot order food, simply because \"there is a problem with the line of your room\" I've chosen this hotel based on the positive comments I was here. Now I realize most of the good comments are 4 or 5 years old. The air conditioning does not heat the room properly. There is a couch in my room which has stains. The curtains does not close properly, so I had to use a hair-clip to have it fixed. The hotel's taxis costs 160 pesos to Polanco area, while radio-taxis costs 90 pesos.

Mexico is so dry for someone who lives at sea level humid island like me, I needed about 3 liter of water daily. The cleaning lady was so nice of leaving me couple more free bottle water. The breakfast buffet was nice however monotone after 4 days. They barely change menu. I love the juice!! Specially grapefruit juice. Since the hotel is inside a small mall and lobby on the second floor, it is hard for someone who visit for the first time to figure out where to check in. Lack of a helping hand on the ground level took away 1 point from service. However at the lobby both Adriana and Laura was so friendly and helpful. Hotel taxi was very expensive in comparison with the \"street\" taxi.

The hotel is fairly new, the rooms are large and clean, the beds were comfortable enough, (I got a couple extra pillows), The furnishings were sparse, but functional. The staff, whose English was not the best, tried hard and were eager to please. I was able to book a couple excursions right in the hotel lobby and was picked up for the trips by the tour company. The location and setting of this hotel was a breath of fresh air on our 4 day stay. To the delight of my companion, the Fiesta Inn was located in a modern mall which contained a Starbucks, a Mc Donalds, an Italianni's Italian restaurant, as well as a half dozen other restaurants and many shops on the first two floors. You have to take the elevator in the mall to the second floor hotel lobby. There was plenty of security in and around the Hotel, and in the whole city for that matter. We felt safe in this hotel and in the surrounding area. At night we would sit out on the public benches outside the hotel, and watch the busy city passing by. It was a busy area facing Alemeda Park, just down the block from Pallace of Belles Artes. While there was plenty of shopping and banks in the immediate area, it was an interesting 10-20 minute walk to the busy downtown streets and the Zocolo. With ATM's everywhere, there is no need to bring large amounts of cash into the city. It was about a 20 minute walk to Garabaldi Square, but at night, there was a couple blocks of dimly lit areas, so I'd recommend going there with a group or in a Taxi. I loved the location of this hotel. Having stayed in the Zona Rosa area on another trip, I found this location was more centrally located, and had easier access to all the Mexico City attractions. Especially the Historic area. While this is not a luxury hotel by any means, I will book it again in a heartbeat!

A fifteen minute walk to the crowded Zocalo, it was a ring-side seat for Mexican Independence Day. It's set back from the busy Ave. Juarez and access is through a mall with shops and restaurants or a you can enter by a side street. The room was clean, fairly large and average. It had air-conditioning, which we used a few times, but the windows do not open, so the room was quiet but stifling. We had a standard hair dryer, soaps & shampoos, king bed, sofa, desk, and TV with CNN and the American Network. Although the Fiesta Inn was perfectly fine, it was standard. The pillows were thin and on their last legs, the towels were thin and rough, and the lighting in the room was set up so that when you turned the light on in the bathroom, the light in the bedroom came on. I thought the breakfast was poor and expensive, and there was some confusion with our reservations that was politely resolved, but should not have happened in the first place. It seemed like a lot of business people stayed at the Fiesta Inn, but the staff was still able to arrange a tour of Teotihuacan with a great tour guide. Also, despite some problems, the staff at the hotel are excellent, and will try anything to make your stay great. The hotel is a short distance from the metro, which we took to Chipultapec and the must-see Archealogical Museum. Don't let people dissuade you from using the Metro. It's cheap, efficient and as safe as other metros in the world.

Once you go up to the actual hotel lobby, you find pleasant hotel personnel to assist you with anything you may need. There is a small office that can book any type of sightseeing excursion you may want. They had an excellent restaurant with a great buffet and menu. Foods ranged from the tipical Mexican meals to the traditional foods. The price was right!! The hotel also had their own taxis available for your service.
