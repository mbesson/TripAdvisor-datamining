We were not disappointed, although strange entrance/front desk, staff were very helpful. We got our parking spot in the back as promised, room was big and clean (a little musty, faint smell of stale smoke). Location was fantastic, s-Bahn a block away, subway 5 minutes away, many restaurants and shops in the area. This is not by any means a five star hotel, but if you are looking for well priced, comfortable place to crash after a long day of sightseeing, you will not regret staying here.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWorth for what I have paid\u201d", "Author": "Cherrypratiwi", "ReviewID": "UR116833283", "Content": "Been here for a week during my visit to Berlin.

Was the hotel close to things (e.g. transport, attractions, restaurants)? 2min walk to train station, 15min walk to city areas. Many restaurants nearby. About 15min on train to city. 2. Was the hotel in a safe area? Yes. 3. Was there much noise at night? Too loud. Our room was right next to the train line - maybe 15m away!! All night we could hear trains rumbling past. There was also the courtyard of a local restaurant under our window, and we could hear the staff emptying the bins / chatting on thier mobiles out there until early morning. 4. What was the quality and cleanliness of the hotel furniture and fittings like (e.g. bed, lock-up safe, shower)? Basic furniture, a bit old and worn looking, but functional. Pillows very uncomfortable. There was a safe present. The toilet was very odd, with a platform at the back of the inside of the bowl, which made using it fairly unpleasant! 5. Do the hotel staff provide a good service (e.g. competence, attitude, availability)? Although staff seemed to be friendly in general, i felt like i was asking a lot for basic requests. The staff seemed to find it odd when i asked for a second pillow, and could only locate a huge one with no pillowcase after a lot of searching. Over 5 nights it was never provided with a cover, although i left it for the cleaners to see. I also asked staff if there was a laundromat nearby and they couldn't identify one, even though thier hotel had no washing machines or laundry service. 6. What were the hotel amenities like (e.g. breakfast, restaurant, pool, bar, car parking)? None of these amenities available. 7. Did the room come with extras (e.g. minibar, TV, internet, air-con, tea making facility)? Small fridge available, TV, and air con. 8. Other / general comments: Very basic accommodation, and very loud. OK for a rough traveller perhaps.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brasilia, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cGood price & central\u201d", "Author": "F_Velame", "ReviewID": "UR24159132", "Content": "I stayed in Berlim for two nights, and the Vega ApartHotel was a good option. It had triple rooms, what was useful for me. The building is located very close to the S-Bahn tracks. As it was winter season and the windows were closed, it was OK. But if you are sensitive to some noise, it may be a reason for complaining. I would suggest the Hotel to reform the sound isolation. The Hotel is ruled by some russians, and they are nice and kind. There was no breakfast, but there is one starbucks coffee not fair from there. The subway (U-Bahn) is also very close. It seems (as an ApartHotel) that you can also rent a room for longer periods, what can be useful for people who will temporarily work or study in Berlin.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montevideo", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for the price\u201d", "Author": "uy_best", "ReviewID": "UR15121441", "Content": "Altough the entrance to the apart-hotel (and the reception) are very strange, we found this hotel excellent for the price we pay.

Your right in the middle of everything and the train station is about 10mins aay and can take you pretty much anywhere, the Zoo is a definite go see!!!

It seemed a little dodgy at first but once I saw the room I was extremely happy! The apartments are large and the showers are great. There is a little noise from the trains but it did not disturbe my sleep. The hotel is about 2 minutes walk to the U-Bahn (underground)and about 5 mins walk to the Zoo station for the S-bahn (overground). Journey time to the tourist sites from both stations is maximum 10 minutes. It is also about 2 minutes walk to the main shopping street. The Europa centre is 5 minutes walk - it contains lots of nice places to eat at a reasonable price. There is also an Irish pub if you feel like a pint of Guiness.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "ApartHotel Vega", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d656865-Reviews-ApartHotel_Vega-Berlin.html", "Price": "$64 - $197*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Uhlandstrasse 185/186</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Charlottenburg</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10623</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "656865", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/17/85/178580be0a7c8d7851a87406fd9a120c1large.jpg"}}
