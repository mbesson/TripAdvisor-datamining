{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Had a good time My wife, 1 yr old daughter, and myself arrived at Golden Sands Villas with the idea that we were not going to be happy because of the reviews. When we arrived in our room we immediately had a maintainence issue. I called the front desk and within 5 minutes a technician was on scene and ready to work. Unfortunately the problem could not be resolved quickly. Without hesitation they immediately moved us to another room, and helped with our luggage. The view was beautiful and the room was exactly what we paid for.

We got there late Friday and did not got the room we paid for ( we got a studio for 2 and we were 4 adults and a 2 year old baby). I asked if they were sure that was our room and they said yes. We stayed there until saturday morning and went to the front desk to ask again. Then they noticed they gave us the wrong room (we paid for a 4 people suite) and after an hour, gave us the right room. NO apologies, NO I am sorry, NOTHING!... When I went to do the check out (very very bothered because the 4 adult suite had only 1 king bed and a NOT COMFORTABLE futton that I had sleep on with my boyfriend (there should have been 2 beds there!!) they didn't wanted to at least pay the difference in prices between the 2 rooms. They just wanted to give us a free lunch (that we had to ask for) and tried to blame it on the webpage we booked the hotel (it is NOT the web pages fault they gave us the wrong room!!!!!!).

WE HAD ALREADY PAID FOR THE ROOM! embassy sent us over to the golden sands and gave us an upgrade on our suit. everything was going great, we were happy at this time. the new room was very nice. we moved all of our stuff in and went down the road to a store to get a few things we needed for the next day. when we arrived back at the hotel, not even an hour later, OUR ROOM HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ANOTHER FAMILY WITH OUR STUFF INSIDE!! we had to ask this family if we could come in and get our stuff out. lucky for us this other family was very nice and didnt give us any problems. we went down to the front desk to see what had happened and nobody seemed to care that we were now roomless again a 9pm. we went over to embassy suits to complain to them as well. they were very nice and said they would do everything possible to find out what was going on and to get us another room. embassy bought us dinner and a few drinks while we waited for a room. we finally got a crappy room, not what we had paid for at 11:30pm. it was the worst experience we have ever had! dont get me wrong PR is great but the GOLDEN SANDS VILLAS SUCKS!!

We spent the past week at Golden Sands Villas. I'll start out with the good stuff. The staff is very nice, friendly and helpful. The pool area is large with lots of good lounging in the sun or shade. The views from each of our rooms on opposite sides were beautiful. Here we go with the not so good stuff: Parking costs $7.50 per day and there is no parking available. So you have to double park your car and give your keys to the valet. The Valet is just a little small booth on the left side of the potholed, run down entrance to the skinny parking area. You give him your keys, tell him what your car looks like and walk away. Anyone could come behind you and say - that's my car - and that person would get your keys and away they'd go. Yes, they give you a hand scribbled ticket, but you don't need it to get your keys. So much for security. Our rooms costs $169 per night before taxes. The ONLY amenity was ONE day of free coffee packs for our little in-room coffee maker. After that each packet was $1.50 each. The kitchenette is a tiny sized refrigerator (ours did not cool adequately and our 1/2 gallon of milk soured before 5 days were up), a microwave and a little sink. There were no face clothes in the room, and when we asked for them we were told that they didn't have any. Later that day, someone else did have some and got them for us. In order to get a beach towel, you have to present a little blue card that charges the towel to your room if it is not returned by 10:00 at night. Sometimes the attendant requires the card, sometimes not, depends upon who is there and whether or not they feel like filling out the charge form. There are HUGE potholes (really overgrown manholes) that will tear up your car if you hit them. The east side of the island is much more modern and developed. We found Durado and the roads to Arecibo and an historical Indian site to be narrow and poorly maintained. Forget about finding anything quickly as there are no street signs and directions are extremely difficult to follow. The trip to Fajardo to Bio Bay and snorkeling were magnificent. Overall on a scale of 1-10, I'd give the hotel a 3. Not very impressive at all. Everything in PR is overpriced. The only things well worth the money are the beaches ($3 per car), the rain forest (El Yungue), don't miss the visitors center - very nice!, and the snorkeling excursions and BioBay.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR898102224", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "anzobe"}, {"Content": "Spacious Rooms; Tiny Beach We booked a holiday get-a-away on short notice. The San Juan area hotels were booked solid. The Golden Sands Villas are adjacent to the Embassy Suites hotel in Dorado, and share their amenities. We had a 2 bedroom condo, which was very spacious and comfortable. The only problem was the beach. Ocean access is blocked by a huge stone bulkhead. The beach is man-made, with shallow water and no waves. My teen boys were disappointed. The pool area is very nice, the ocean views are great and the beach would be wonderful for families with small children.

The only thing connected was the pool (which was the best area of the complex.) Upon arriving, we were directed to a small lobby to check in. I couldn't believe I was in the right place! After negotiating our way into an over-crowded parking lot, we made it inside. Upon entering our room, we found a dirty, torn sofa sleeper, stained, well-worn carpeting, flat cushions on chairs, peeling contact paper on cupboard doors, no water running from the hot water faucet in the kitchen, watered-down dishwashing liquid, rusted grates in the refrigerator, non-operational draperies w/o sheers, thread-bare sheets, filthy windows, missing light bulbs, mold on the ceiling...get the picture? Although they were responsive to all our many requests, we've never needed to request so much. I have never experienced such unfriendly, unwelcoming front desk personnel. They didn't have a concierge and only on the last day did we see an attempt at an activity sheet.

I am familiar with the San Juan/Guaynabo/Dorado area and had originally tried to stay in one of the super hotels in the resort area of San Juan. However, they were all booked due to a national convention.The Golden Sands was a pleasant surprise as I was familiar with the Embassy Suites at Dorado. Basically, both Aquarious and Golden Sands are the time share arms of the Embassy facilities and are very reasonable. I had a gigantic room which was quite clean and very comfortable. Even had a corner suite that looked out over the ocean and the pool..very nice!The other reviewer is correct that the Golden Sands shares the property and amenities. Overall, about 95% of the construction was complete and no major amenities were impacted by the little that was left to complete.I had a very nice experience and recommend the hotel to anyone, especially families, looking to get out of the Vida Loca in San Juan!", "Date": "Sep 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR910448841", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Aviator38"}, {"Content": "Golden Sands Villas / Aquarius Vacation Club My fiance and I had planned on going for a quick getaway last weekend from New York City. We were planning on staying at the Embassy Suites in Dorado (we previously stayed in the Hyatt Dorado Beach, but that has since closed only to be converted into timeshares in the future). But due to the bad weather, we had to postpone the trip by two days. When we tried to rebook, the Embassy Suites was full. We saw that there was a cheaper alternative - the Golden Sands Villas in Dorado, but we knew nothing about it. We were skeptical because we hadn't seen any reviews on Expedia or TripAdvisor. In the end, we decided to just go for it, and we booked our stay.When we pulled up to the Golden Sands Villas, we were pleasantly surprised that it was connected to the Embassy Suites! It turns out that this is the timeshare version of the Embassy. We had the same access to the Embassy's facilities (the pool, hot tub, gym, beach, restaurants, etc.) but paid less. The only things that we discovered that were not included were tennis (Embassy Suites gives its guests 1 free hour) and breakfast (it would have cost us $14.95 had we opted for the breakfast - we did not).From March to June 2007, they are renovating the common areas, so don't be afraid when you see that it's not as nice as you would have liked. Hopefully, it will be a lot nicer when it's done. The room itself was fine - we had a lovely ocean view and there was enough space for two people to be comfortable. There was a small refrigerator (not a mini bar) and a microwave.The staff was nice and helpful. They checked us in at 4am and were extremely pleasant and chatty. They always helped us out when we had any questions. Also, the pool bar was very friendly. They forgot our drinks once, but made up for it by giving us free lunch and drinks, when it would have cost us around $35.If you decide to opt for the Golden Sands Villas option, here is a word of advice - go through the gates of the Embassy, drive all the way down the path, past the golf course. You will pass all of these gated communities (like Villas de Golf Este and Villas de Golf Oeste). Drive up to the Embassy, go straight towards the self parking until you get to another gate. Take your ticket, make a right, and park your car. The Golden Sands Villas entrance is the brightly lit entranceway.Restaurant recommendations: We really liked Villa Dorado de Alberto's (try the shrimp stuffed with cheese!) and Rancho Mar (a good seafood place). If you are looking for breakfast, there is Villa Magna, which serves pastries, breakfast and lunch.", "Date": "Mar 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR158444831", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vktang"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147322-d647687-r22662196-Golden_Sands_Villas-Dorado_Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "647687", "Price": "$233"}}
