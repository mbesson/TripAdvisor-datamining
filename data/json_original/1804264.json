I am always welcomed in a way by the staff, so I feel this is my second home. And the staff is really very good to spot what I like and what makes my stay special. The staff is absolute exceptional in international standards. The hotel is refreshing different in design. It takes a good deal of courage to build a hotel like this, and it works! It is a fantastic idea to incorporate music as a part of the life and identity. Music is and has always been a passion of mine, so I love it! The hotel is placed by the river in a very Berlin hot spot. The view is fantastic and I recommend to take a room to the riverside. It is easy to get to the hotel both when I fly and when I drive( lots of parking space). Everything can be reached by U or S Bahn. Or by bicycle. I prefer this location, it has a more authentic Berlin vibe, than most touristic parts of Berlin. The food and service in the restaurant Fabric has always been very good, fun and special. Try it!!! And the bar and great terrace is a fantastic place to hang out all day. I will recommend everybody interested in music or just a fun evening to come and experience \"open mic\" concerts the first Saturday every month. I personally try to plan my business so I can join the party. I will be back again and again, and I can only say one thing: try it!!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "K\u00f8benhavn, Staden Kobenhavn, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cNHOW Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Thomas K", "ReviewID": "UR128327783", "Content": "This is the most cool and funky hotel we've ever stayed at!

We were having a weekend visit of Berlin. Location: Overall not bad. It will take you approximately 30 minutes to arrive from the aiport Tegel with a cab, the nearest subway (U2) and S-Bahn station is Warschauer Stra\u00dfe, which will take you to Alexander Platz and other areas. The station is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is directly at the Spree, one side overlooking the Spree, the other side facing a lifely street. The location itself was great for us, as we were looking to visit a lot of places in Kreutzberg and Friedrichshain, however, getting to the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm can take a while. Rooms: Standard rooms will overlook the busy street and the surcharge for rooms facing the Spree is quite high with 25 EUR / night (this was offered to us upon arrival). The pink interior itself is definitely something special, however, as a lot of the materials used are plastics which kind of gives you a \"cheap\" impression. Especially the floor in our room was made of pvc/rubber, which I personally did not like. Our bathroom was not too big, but ok, however, the wall separating the bedroom from the bath was partly transparent (you could see the silhouette of the person in the bath) which could be awkward if it's not a couple travelling. The beds are comfy and we always got a good rest. From our room overviewing the Spree, we didn't not hear the street. We thought the service in the hotel was not too attentive. My wife was asking for nice places to go to in Friedrichshein or Kreutzberg and we were told that there would not be so much and we should rather look to Friedrichsstra\u00dfe and Ku'damm. Actually, the most interesting parts we saw in Berlin were in those quarters, so if we would have followed the instructions, we might have really missed an interesting part of the city (although of course we also went to Friedrichsstra\u00dfe and the other shopping mile). Which I didn't like at all was the pricing in the hotel. I paid for an espresso (just the espresso, no little treat or glas of water, or anything) 3 EUR. The breakfast was 22 EUR per person and as already mentioned, for views over the Spree a surcharge of 25 EUR / night is applicable. Internet is not free in the rooms, but they refer to a free internet in the lobby. However, this one being so weak, that you can hardly use it. Also, you need to log on every 30 minutes with a voucher again, so that retrieving big e-mails (which will take a while because of the weak connection) can be a real pain. Basically, you cannot really use it for working but you would have to get internet in the rooms (judging from the rest of the pricing in the hotel, I think it must be expensive, too). The overall theme of the hotel is music, so there's electrical guitars and drums and pianos standing in the lobby, so the design is somewhat hip, but I also thought that other hotels following such design strategies manage to bring that feeling more naturally across (e.g. the 25hours hotels in Frankfurt and Vienna or the Pentahotel in Vienna). Overall I think that the hotel is ok. Highlights are definitely the design (which however will challange your taste) and I also thought the location was great, if you're looking into visiting also other neighbourhoods than Charlottenburg and Mitte. A downturn was the pricing strategy in the hotel, which included incredibly high rates for almost everything. Personally, I would not go there again.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201camazing!\u201d", "Author": "karmefunk", "ReviewID": "UR124389183", "Content": "loved the modern design, the colors, music branded all around.. fantastic! impressed of the shower size in the room and the delicious breakfast! definitely my choice if I go back to berlin again", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poland", "Title": "\u201cfunky hotel for fun stay in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "polandpi", "ReviewID": "UR123869405", "Content": "Great hotel, very well designed! we have had 3 standard rooms and one at top floor with fantastic view on river and all city!

When we got to the room we said \"but we asked for the blue room\" to which the answer was \"this is the blue room\". Cheap, tacky decor makes the whole hotel feel like Hello Kitty's bedroom. Tiny rooms. Pink accessories, pink walls, pink highlights on a cheap plastic floor. Their idea of a non-pink room is literally a pink room with blue highlights. Fine if you are into that sort of thing, but hardly what one would expect in one of the few \"5 star\" hotels in Berlin. Like the rest of Berlin, \"5 star\" really means 4 star, \"4 star\" really means 3 star, and so on. To call this place a 5 star is a joke - it has more in common with a Japanese Love Hotel than anything on par with world 5 star standards. The funniest part about our stay was bumping into the legions of 50-something conference attendees going up and down in the fluorescent painted lifts. Heads of Pharmaceutical companies and Oxford professors all had the oddest looks on their faces as they exchanged comments about the preposterous decor. I daresay that if this place wants to be taken seriously as a business hotel, and it seems it does, (of course the \"musician\" market in Berlin isn't going to fill that property night after night), it will need to rip out the whole of that interior decor and start again. Their sales force seems to have done a good job of selling at least a couple of conferences into the pharma industry - but the days of Roche selling LSD are far behind us and I would be mightily surprised if they get repeat bookings next year. I know that if I had organized a conference in Berlin for my customers and suppliers and we ended up in this pink monstrosity I'd be running in shame for the rest of the decade.

But just to be sure: yes, the bedsheets are pink as well and so is the phone next to your bed. I only stayed one night, but I'm guessing the appearance of this one color just about everywhere might get tiring after a while. Then again, this is a very decent hotel that has much to offer. It's right besides the river and at least some of the rooms have very good views. It's also brand new and offers a good, healthy breakfast with lots of choice. Even during my short stay, I became a fan of the excellent rainshower. Minus points? Yes, a few: the tv-set is hidden in some sort of mirror that makes it hard to use during daylight. And in my case, I found a spider in the bathroom. Hard to avoid probably, but not a very nice experience to be sure.

First, to survive the stay, you must like pink or be able to appreciate a high dose of it. I went into a pink lift and thought I was swallowed up by Hello Kitty! The rooms are big for European standards but it was my visit to Germany so perhaps all German hotel rooms are large. There is no free wifi in the room, and even for the paid version at 10+euros, you cannot download past 500MB! the free wifi is only at the hotel's lobby and it is limited to 30 minutes usage. The toilet was tiny but could live with that. Still, it was very very pink. The front office staff really makes you feel like you've just wasted their time. Except for one friendly woman, everyone else was gruff and wouldn't hesitate to bark at you. Except for the Berlin Wall, there is not much else near the hotel. And there is no swimming pool in the hotel but there is a gym. The plusses are: 1. The hotel is near both the U and S Ban stations, so if you need to travel out, it is a 10 minutes walk to the station. 2. The breakfast service inside the - once again - pink restaurant is very good.

Excellent location, and we had views of the Oberbaumbruecke and the Spree from our windows. Everything was clean and new.

The bathroom was excellent, particularly the walk-in shower, and the nice pink toiletries. The bed was comfy. Downsides were when ideas had overtaken beyond practicality: the TV built into the mirror was not only difficult to operate with the very sluggish, annoying remote, but also strange to watch when we did get it working, as the mirror was still a mirror, so our reflections were superimposed on the TV picture. I had expected an iPod dock, but instead had to borrow a lead which did not charge my iPod and which had to work through the aforementioned TV/mirror/sluggish remote. I was given another lead to charge the iPod, but all that did wad freeze the iPod. Instead of bedside tables, niches are moulded into the walls beside the bed, and these niches are too small. The chair was designed for visual rather than comfort appeal, and if we'd stayed one night longer, the swirly pattern on the floor would have set headaches going. Unfortunately, the internet access was not only not free, but very expensive. However, the tea/coffee making facilities were very welcome. But despite these niggles, I would recommend this hotel.
