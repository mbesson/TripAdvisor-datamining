We had a double room with en suite on the 5th floor and had breakfast included. The room itself was great. I'd read that the rooms were somewhat on the small side, however, that did not reflect our experience. Especially for a Parisian hotel, the room was of a decent size. It had a double bed, two night stands, a desk and chair, flat screen TV, large wardrobe and windows that opened (something we had taken for granted in the past). The bathroom was slightly small, but nothing too bad and had a shower, basin, WC and enough room in the shower/on the basin to house all of our toiletries. There were original wooden beams in the room, which made it feel typically Parisian and the AC unit kept us nice and cool and we were able to adjust it as we required. The breakfast was okay. Each morning the tables are laid with one croissant, one other pastry (pain au chocolate, etc.) and one bread roll. Along side this there is a portion of butter and jam. You can then get your own cereal, coffee, juice and water. There is also a selection of yoghurt, some boiled eggs and a few packets of cheese available. We had already paid for the breakfast, so we had it each morning. However, if we had not paid for it in advance we would have used the local supermarket. We didn't feel ripped off by the breakfast, but definitely could have equalled or bettered it for less at the supermarket. The breakfast in the hotel is 10 Euro per person, however, about a 2 minute walk around the corner you will find a Carrefour grocery store. They have a good selection of food/drink and you could probably buy a weeks worth of breakfast products for 20 Euro or less, saving you quite a bit. We used the supermarket for quick evening meals when we didn't want to go back, we got the basics like some bread, cheese, meat, etc. The staff were friendly and if they didn't speak English they knew how to communicate enough to get the transaction done. One thing I will mention is that as our room was on the 5th floor we decided to take the elevator up. Upon entering the elevator I went in first with my bag and was suddenly confronted by a wall and the thought of \"where is the rest of the elevator\". It is a very small, one person + one bag elevator that looks like it was created from a coat closet. While it's very handy to have the elevator, especially for disabled guests, you would have to take it in turns to use it. We alternated, one would use the elevator and one the stairs. My partner and I don't require the room to be cleaned everyday, as we don't make that much mess and neither do we require fresh towels every day (trying to do our bit to save the environment)! However, even though we put our \"do not disturb\" sign out, each night we would come back and the room had been cleaned and the \"do not disturb\" sign was back on the desk, inside the room. Also, as per the instructions in the bathroom, we hung up our towels, which is supposed to tell the maid that we don't need clean towels, but everyday clean towels were provided. The staff at the hotel couldn't have been nicer. They were very welcoming and helpful. They ordered a taxis for us when needed and were available without issues whenever we needed something. The hotel is in a good location. Although all of the rooms look out onto a road or side street, the area is very quiet so you don't get street noise. We even had the windows open and didn't really hear any traffic, etc. As mentioned there is a supermarket just around the corner. There are also a few cafes within a 2-5 minute walking distance and the metro is a 1 minute walk across the road. The metro is a small line, but with changes will get you where you want to go and for 1.70 you can change as many times as you need (as long as you don't leave the metro system) to get to your destination. We bought a pack of 10 tickets for 12.50, which lasted us our whole trip. One word of advice: don't use the metro during rush hour (17:00-18:00)! We did and were astounded at how many people try to squeeze on. Just when you think there's not even enough room left to breath a few more people run up and squeeze on, to the point that the door can hardly close and if you want to get off you have to forcefully push through as they don't like moving. However, if you use the metro outside of rush hour, it's no different to anywhere else. Metro trains come every 2 minutes like clockwork. A couple of tips: 1) don't buy the breakfast, instead use the local supermarket. 2) Taxis can not be booked hours in advance, you need to ask the front desk to book you one about 10 minutes before you need to leave. 3) Get a book of 10 tickets for the metro if you're planning on using it a lot, it works out much cheaper. Overall this is a great little hotel and we would definitely stay again. The staff are great and went out of their way to be welcoming, the location is good and it feels like a little, family run hotel, just with all the amenities you require of a \"chain\" hotel.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocal Paris\u201d", "Author": "Franky21_12", "ReviewID": "UR124617424", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel Feb 2012 and will return when in Paris also would recommend to friends.

I think it's overrated. Well, the location is good. And the price isn't bad. I was there in October and when I arrived at the hotel in the evenings around 9-10 pm, the temperature was good. However during the night they must be turning the heat off or something, because I spent my whole 3 nights shivering and turning, not being able to get good sleep, and I ended up very sick, despite going to bed with a wool cardigan, wool vest and a scarf! The room, while not being fashionable at all, leaves a cozy impression at first. But once it's bedtime and you lift the bedspread, a nasty orange blanket with unidentified bits of hair awaits you. I already hate it when hotels provide an old blanket and a sheet instead of a duvet. The sheets had dust marks on them. Even though I was very put off by the lack of cleanliness, I was hugging that nasty blanket by the end of the night because I was FREEZING. You do hear some vibrations from the metro, and door slamming of the other guests. I wouldn't have minded this if I had been able to get proper sleep during the night. The towels and bathroom were clean. Breakfast is sufficient, with a croissant, bread, sweet pastry, packed cheese, jams, cereal etc. The tea and coffee however were awful. I didn't know tea & coffee were capable of tasting this bad, if you're going to stay here, definitely bring your own tea bags. The staff is kind, but I would like to point to a security issue that hasn't been mentioned before. You have to leave your room key to the reception, and because the person at the reception changes all the time, they don't really recognize you. I wanted to buy water one night and the receptionist misunderstood me and just handed me the key of another room! So basically, you can go into this hotel, ask for the key of a random room number, and voila! Pros: Location, clean bathroom, good hot water, internet.

As others have said, this is a family-run business and very friendly. The area itself is not the most thrilling, being on the edge of the 3e, but it is convenient. You are right by a metro stop (2 lines) and a short walk from the 4 line at Reaumur-Sebastopol (where there is also a Monoprix), which is a very convenient one for getting to left bank, Ile de la Cite etc.. It is also a short walk to Place de la Republique, which has most lines. You can walk or take the metro to the Centre Pompidou, the Seine, the trendier parts of the Marais, Les Halles area etc. There is a velib stand close to the hotel (so bring a helmet and credit card with a chip if you want) and a small grocery store that is open late. Some have complained about room size but I don't get it. My room (#26) was larger than my (small) bedroom at home, and well equipped with a desk, bedside lights and tables, windows that open, and wardrobe. I have stayed in smaller rooms in many places in North America, in major chain business-type hotels, eg NYC, Ottawa, Edmonton. I really appreciated that the curtains blocked out outside light and there was adequate lighting, which is getting rarer and rarer in North American hotels, even at the luxury end. Washroom was fine, seemed clean, place to put stuff, good shower, no problem with hot water or anything. There was a good sized radiator in the room which I didn't need to use. However, I could see that in summer lack of air conditioning or ceiling fan could pose a problem. Not in May of course. Elevator was appreciated upon arrival and departure with luggage. The room was very quiet and I slept very well every night. It faced the back, but I expect the front rooms were probably quiet as it is on a small side street. You can hear the rumble of the metro below periodically but it certainly is not loud enough to keep one from sleeping. There is tv in the room. The English channels are somewhat limited, understandably. There's BBC world, MSNBC I think? and occasional English news on Deutsche Welle. Before long though these channels get boring so I switched to the French news channel to get the local flavour. There's lots of sports if you're into that, plus channels in several other European languages. Anyway nobody comes to Paris to watch tv so it is no big deal. The wifi was a bit come and go but the desk staff were always ready to reboot the router or help get it going again. I found my iphone picked up the wifi in the lobby but not in my room, but my netbook picked up a very strong signal in the room (same thing happens at home.) There is a desktop in the lobby for guest use, but it has a French keyboard which some will find confusing. Breakfast was very good, as others have described . In this regard I would recommend that after researching rates on the internet, you contact the hotel directly (not using any link via tripadvisor) to book, as some of the booking agency rates may not include breakfast but don't tell you. Email [--] - they speak English. I would certainly stay at this hotel again, unless I decided to go with a completely different approach such as house exchange or renting an apartment. By Paris standards it is excellent value and worked really well for me.

The bathroom was small but recently renovated and very clean. With no air conditioning the room did heat up somewhat, and it was difficult to sleep at night with the windows open because of street noise, the temperature only reached about 30 degrees C when I was in Paris, so in the height of summer it would probably become very hot in the room. The staff were very helpful and allowed me to leave my bags when I arrived early and minded them again when I checked out, but had an evening flight. I received an extremely good deal booking via asiarooms.com of 62 euros a night including breakfast. The breakfast room is small, only holding about 20 people a time, so you might have to wait a little. The breakfast is all fresh and consisted of a roll, croissant, cheeses, jams, honey, three types of cereal, fruit, fruit salad, yoghurt, small cakes, orange juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and boiled eggs. Extra rolls and croissants are there for the taking. It is served between 7am-10am. One morning I left at 6am and they allowed me to take some rolls, croissants and jams. There is a computer in the small lounge area where you can access the internet, the connection is slow at times and it frequently froze. Free wifi is available throughout the hotel. The metro exit is practically at the front door, and just down the road around the corner was a frans prix supermarket, good for snacks and drinks. This was an excellent hotel but without air conditioning it could be uncomfortable.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, Calif USA", "Title": "\u201cA charming hotel in a great city....\u201d", "Author": "Iggywine", "ReviewID": "UR8023342", "Content": "It took awhile to find a hotel in Paris that would fit our budget requirements, but this hotel was a special find. Located right at the Arts & Metier Metro stop in the 3rd, this hotel was a perfect location for localized strolling (to Notre Dame, the Pompidou Museum, (and to Starbucks in the 4th!!), and also close to the Place du Republique for a (disappointing, sadly) dinner at Chez Jenny. It helped somewhat that the desk clerk complimented me on my somewhat limited grade-school heritage French, but the rooms were very clean and (always important for Americans!) the bathrooms were not only up to date but they had wonderful showers as well. The beds were comfortable, but somewhat typical of European beds overall (how do they sleep there?). Other reviews have mentioned noise and vibration from the Metro, but we didn't notice any at all - then again, we were on the top floor (the 6th), with a wonderful view out to the street below. The desk clerks were always helpful with local phone calls as well, and they provided us with a converter plug to help charge our various accoutrements (which we of course took with us and had to mail back....) The morning breakfast was pleasant (although interestingly served by a somewhat dour kitchen helper, at least on one morning). This trip to Paris was my 4th (I think), but far and away the most enjoyable, and I have to think that the quality of our accomodations was a significant part of that. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to spend more money on what goes on OUTSIDE of a hotel stay!!

The room was small but had everything we needed. It was impeccably clean. The breakfast room while being criicised in previous reviews for being on the small side, wasnt a problem for us as there was never more than one or two other couples in the room at the time. The breakfast was superb, lovely rolls, crousants, cheeses, preserves, fruit, cereals, breads and all hot drinks available. My only criticism was the lack on English channels on the TV.

But unlike some rooms we've stayed in the Austin's Arts et Metiers Hotel has plenty of \"breathing room.\" We felt very comfortable, and very much at home! Like the previous year, we once again received the same wonderful treatment from the hotel staff. On the first night there, due to the unusual heat wave that most of Europe was experiencing this summer, we had to sleep with the window open....but unfortunately the light from the Hotel sign kept us up. So the next morning we were moved to another room...and to our delight it was the same room we stayed in for our honeymoon! So once again, the Austin's Arts et Metiers Hotel made our visit to Europe very special! The Austin's Arts et Metiers Hotel will probably always be our home when we visit Paris.
