{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Absolutely wonderful I stayed in the Saphir Mabisa two times now and both stays were excellent. If you are used to a 5 star hotel I should not go to the saphir mabisa, but for me this is perfect. The staff is very, very friendly and breakfast and lunch is perfect. The hotel looks a bit like it needs a renovation but that does not influence the nice feeling I get when I stay there. I would surely recommend it to everyone who does not expect a 5 star luxury hotel.", "Date": "May 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR244702493", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Blauweelmo"}, {"Content": "What a huge disappointment!

It certainly wouldn't have been my first choice of places to stay. However, I decided what the hell and went along with it. The location is quite nice with many shops and restaurants within walking distance. It was also well located for access to the legian beach. The hotel itself isn't really much to be desired and in desperate need ot a little TLC. The rooms are very basic and the bathrooms are looking very tired. The main reception area, which is always you first impressions really needed a total make over. I guess for the money you pay it represents good value, but I would most certainly never stay here again. I believe this hotel has now been closed for renovation.", "Date": "Jan 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR377973063", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "maitairesort"}, {"Content": "You pay for what you get This is definitely a place to stay for one night only. We booked this through a Qantas brochure knowing we only needed an overnight stop in the Kuta area before moving onto to (greener ) pastures in Ubud. As seasoned, non-5-star travellers, we don't expect luxury, but this hotel has definitely seen better days.You get the feeling that a lot of money needs to be spent making this at least comfortable for the western traveller. Paint peeling everywhere, the same jangling indonesian gamelan/flute music piped from the restaurant loudly until 10pm outside our room, bathroom very basic, shower curtain mouldy, gecko and centipedes gained access somehow, light shades all broken, door locks hard to operate, outside chair broken, lace door curtains filthy, breakfast very basic with sugary cordial supplemented for orange juice. 16 year old daughter was asked by staff if she had a boyfriend (NOT appropriate!) On the basic positive: Aircon worked in our room, pool was clean. (pool chair mattresses stained with mildew). We could buy an extra 6 hrs checkout for 250kRp to stay in room till 9pm (midnight flight out). No direct access to beach. Long walk back to Jalan Legian. Beds clean. Towels grey, threadbare, and in some cases with holes. No room safe. Staff were friendly...I suspect this hotel has fallen on hard times and needs some support, but I question it's listing in a Qantas brochure.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR194563737", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Lizard62"}, {"Content": "Really bad experience.
