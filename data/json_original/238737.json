The safe and phone line did not operate for the five days of my staying, and had not been repaired despite my repeated requests.The staff has basic attitude problem, especially the night shifter. In order tp plug electric instument, I had to unplug the TV or the basic mini bar. I could hear every word the receptionist is saying through my room door. Be prepared to flood your floor after every shower. The breakfast is very basic, and the location is highly central.

We stayed at this awful hotel for 3 nights. We were 4 girls in our 30's and 40's with 2 rooms. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is the location, very convenient to the train station. 2 brothers, Osvando and Giovanni bought this hotel about a year ago. One couldn't sit on the toilet straight without your legs hitting the radiator. The showers are very small and the curtains do not keep water from getting all over the floor, not to mention the feeling of the curtain sticking to your body. We couldn't get the air to work so we were told by the owner he would look at it that day while we were gone. We still couldn't get it to work the second night. I told the night guy, who came in and got it to work then tried to make a move on me! The 3rd day, in our friends room , there was a problem with the electricity and it was off for 3 hours. They used our room to get ready as the repairmen came and cut holes in their walls and wires were sticking out. Upon checkout, we asked for a discount for the inconvenience of the electricity being out and we were told no, since it was only for 5 minutes!!!I would not recommend this hotel and the shady way it is ran to anyone!", "Date": "Jun 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR252570915", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "golfergirl1555"}, {"Content": "Hotel delle Tele in Florence I just came back from my trip in Italy. I was staying in Florence (Firenze) for 3 days (2 nights) in a hotel called \u9225\u6dd7otel delle Tele\u9225?(I\u9225\u6a92l put hotel\u9225\u6a9a data at the end of this overview for you to be sure of which one I\u9225\u6a93 talking about). Its location is nice for ones traveling on train- it\u9225\u6a9a really close to the main train station and the city center/old city. Both places are reachable on foot just in 5-10 min. But it\u9225\u6a9a quite tricky to find this hotel on the street since it hasn\u9225\u6a9b any noticeable signboard or lobby on the ground floor, just a small hallway with stairs to a tiny elevator (it\u9225\u6a9a difficult for 3 people to fit in it). It appeared that 2 upper floors of the house were turned into the hotel. Rooms are quite big, clean, but our windows were on the street side, so no long sleep. It\u9225\u6a9a noisy in the morning and sometimes it seems that walls are shaking cause of such big movement on the street. Other problem that our family faced was a conditioner- it was broken in one of the rooms and it wasn\u9225\u6a9b fixed during our stay there. Breakfast is served in a small room. Guests are offered a typical Italian breakfast: coffee or tea, couple sorts of bread, butter, jam, couple small boxes of cheese, yogurts, corn flakes and milk. No ham, sorry for meat eaters ;-) Most of the guests that I noticed were people over 40, but also some students were noticed :-) In over all, I was quite satisfied if not a first impression that you were tricked- online it looks like the real hotel, but with no lobby on the street level.

While the hotel is in a great location..... close to the Duomo, the Uffizi, the Ponte Vecchio, it was on a very busy and very noisy street. We had an early flight out and we were unable to get any sleep at all, maybe because it was a Saturday night, but there was traffic and noisy teens wandering the streets literally all night.

There is no obvious sign outside, so it is easy to miss it. Look for number 10 and you will see a brass sign with the name. The hotel is located on the 3rd and 4th floors. A tiny lift takes you there. Its location is excellent. Very close to all major sights. We stayed there for 2 nights, a family of four. The quadrable room was very spacious very clean and well decorated. Its location is unbeatable. The day stuff was very helpful but the night person could not speak english. The only really bad thing we can say is about the relatively poor breakfast.

The room was basic but very clean. We had to ask for additional pillows because we only had one per person. The first night was not very pleasant. Our room was close to the front desk and the worker was on the phone for several hours talking VERY loud. We needed ear plugs to get to sleep. Breakfast was OK - cereal, yogurt, juice and croissants. The room only had 4 tables, so plan accordingly if you need to get somewhere. The croissonts were already placed on the tables (3 and a few pieces of bread). This was enough for 2 people but I think you'd need to ask for more if you had 3-4 people. The staff did NOT speak much English, so I highly suggest bringing your translation guidebook. They were also nice enough to make gallery reservations for us. Location was perfect. We walked about 5 minutes from the train station - don't bother with a taxi. We could get to the Duomo in a few blocks and to the Uffizi and Accademia in about 10 minutes. For the price (105 Euro), it was a good value. I got the best price directly from the hotel's Web site. Ask for a room far away from the reception desk.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR215388000", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "you CAN avoid the problems i had, then it will be great. I arrived alone in Firenze without a reservation, and for that i understand that i would be asking too much to get a cheap room... I entered Delle Tele and Mr. Giovanni decided to charge me almost 20% less than the regular price. Well, at that time of the day he knew that the room would probably remain empty that night (and i was going to stay for only one night), so it was good for the hotel also... Anyway, the hotel was very clean and comfortable, good bathroom and a fantastic localization. I have to say that i had problems with noise, because early in the morning I could hear the guy at the reception talking really loud (you know... Italia!) and the preparation of the breakfast room, wich was right next to my door. The problem there is that they really didn`t worry about all that noise, they were really talking loud, carrying dishes and beating i don`t know what really hard, as if there were no guests in that floor.Also, my telephone didnt work well and neither did the television (the sound was terrible).And, and forgot to mention, their computer is a crap, so i recommend using and internet caffe, wich will cost exactally the same price.But, you know, people were really nice and they really happened to solve my problems, even when i decided to stay for one more night and asked for a cheaper hotel recommendation, but they let me stay there for the same price i has payed for the first night...So, i would reccomend people to stay at Hotel Delle Tele, but, seriously, ask for a room far from the reception...", "Date": "Apr 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR271373907", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "zenpazienzia"}, {"Content": "A Great Value in an Expensive City My husband and I were stationed in Italy for three years during which time we stayed at this hotel at least 5 times.

The decor is simple but very Tuscan. I recommend it to everyone.
