We have actually had a reasonably good time here from laughing at how bad the place is. The staff really are very friendly, but they know what you are about to walk into. At reception you will be informed that there are no refunds for cancellation, so that if you flee in horror your credit card will still be billed. Beginning with breakfast: It's 10pm and I am still yet to digest the stale croissant from this morning and the coffee which I think was piped in directly from the Grand Canal. With each passing day fewer and fewer people avail themselves of the breakfast offerings. Everyone eats in underwhelmed silence and whispers as though they were at a funeral. Indeed, the idea of breakfast has died here. My recommendation is to keep fasting. There is a faint but undeniable scent of old fish which has kept us mildly nauseated for days. Bathroom: Essentially needs to be gutted and re-built. There is an abundance of sellotape holding things like towel rails together. There is no shower curtain, and it is amazing how water coming at such low pressure from the broken shower head can saturate the entire bathroom. To avoid this, we tried the bath instead, but waiting for the thing to fill is an exercise in geological time. The hairdryer on the wall resembles something that an alien from a cheap sci-fi film of the 70's might use to probe someone. It does not dry hair particularly well. We did ask for the shower head to be fixed but got nothing other than a sympathetic smile and shrug of the shoulders. If you can both find and activate the tiny television you will be disappointed but not surprised to discover no cable channels. I know it's Italy but not even to have one of the english language news services is a bit cheap these days. This is somewhat alleviated by the free wifi, which is one of the plusses of this place. The other much vaunted plus is the location, and the view of the canal and rialto bridge is nice if you are lucky enough to get one of those rooms. But honestly people, the canal is long and there are many hotels along it. You CAN do better. There are chandeliers and fancy wall lights, but I would unscrew the chandelier from the ceiling and hand it in at reception in exchange for a working shower head. Come on guys. Priorities. If you want your Venice experience to be full of the tragic ambiance of former glory fallen into decay, then this is the hotel for you.

This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. How do I loathe thee. Let me count the ways. Where to start?. Bathroom: toilet lid cracked; shower leaked where head attached to hose making it impossible to keep water off floor; lid of waste bin broken. Bedroom: thermostat broken, had to be adjusted from desk; television broken, telephone to desk broken - both replaced next day, but after I wanted to view possible fireworks display New Years Eve. When the forced air heat worked, there was an odor of stale cooking that seemed to have mixed with air input which we cleared by opening window. Repeat. Confirmed by hotel management. Closet not deep enough for a normal hanger, clothes at an angle. What seemed to be a set of dresser drawers was actually a cover for a third bed, consequently no place to store clothing - used suitcases from floor. Breakfast: no fresh fruit; no fresh brioche nor eggs or any warm food; toast could be made from very plain white bread, the one time I used the toaster the bread was not fresh; coffee made from a powder; if you would want a cappuccino it would have costed one euro more. At a certain point it seemed not worth the trouble of complaining about an impossible situation.

We had understood from earlier reviews of this establishment that the Locanda really was something very special. In addition we were under the impression that we had booked a room overlooking the Grand Canal. Instead we were given the key to a dark, gloomy room overlooking the side alley and, on asking if we had made a mistake, told that, for an extra 50 Euros per night on top of the 224 Euros per night we had already paid, that could be arranged..... We declined the offer and made do. It looks as though an 'architect/designer' on drugs has been at work. One of our shower 'walls' was actually the bathroom window so how long before the window frame rots and falls into the alley below is debatable. Doorways had been boarded up and the lift smelt so bad we thought a corpse might be at the bottom of the lift shaft. Wi-Fi was, of course charged extra and breakfast consisted entirely of pre-packaged items e.g. processed cheese, coffee from a thermos flask etc 'served' by a very glum waitress who barely acknowledged anyone's presence. What really puzzled us was the 'TripAdvisor merit badge' at reception! How on earth had they been awarded this - TripAdvisor had better send someone 'ingognito' to take a look at this establishment! The hotel had two things going for it - a kind of common room with balcony overlooking the Rialto Bridge and the Grand Canal - with the weather absolutely perfect it was very agreeable to bring a cold beer from the stall just around the corner and just watch the world go by. It was, too, very convenient for getting to see all the sights. And a further gripe - beware of Hotels.com. We booked by Credit Card but when we received our C.Card statement it had an extra 66 Euros tacked on to cover an Italian Central Govt tax. This was explained to us as we checked out - not the fault of the hotel, of course, but we were then told Hotels.com charge Hotel Locanda Ovidus 25% commission. So if you really MUST use this establishment, book direct, but don't say you haven't been warned!", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Truro, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ca great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "monkey057", "ReviewID": "UR119097724", "Content": "this hotel is small but perfectly proportioned. my wife and I stayed for a week to celebrate her birthday.

I suppose some of the rooms must be nice, but the one we were shown to (Room 104) was dreadful. Small, sparcely furnished, overlooking the shabby side street where the entrance to the hotel is to be found. At \u00c2\u00a3162.20 per night I would consider it to be expensive at half the price. The en-suite was laughable - small, and with a bit of manouevring I guess it would be possible to get into the shower cubicle. The owners should be ashamed at charging what they do for this. It might be appropriate for someone looking for a cheap bunk for the night but not at this price. After complaining we were shown to another room, which was accessed up a steep narrow staircase to the bathroom level, and then a narrow spiral staircase to the bedroom. The room was basic with a step across the middle which we kept tripping on until we got used to it. No table/desk upon which to put anything, but I suppose it would be difficult to get any such furniture up the staircase (I wonder how they got the bed in there!). The shower rail was loose and did not hold the shower head. A feeble shower - not sure whether this was low water pressure or a clogged up shower head - I did not feel inclined to investigate. The overall fabric of the place is poor and in need of a complete overhaul and cleaning. Wallpaper hanging off, broken chandeliers, missing light bulbs, bare plaster board walling on the main stairway, ..... The shabby unrendered outside reflects what you will find on the inside. Breakfast was cheap and uninspiring. They had the cheek to ask for a supplement if you wanted fresh coffee. Otherwise coffee was found in a flask. Cereals, yogurt, dry bread, ham/salami, prepacked soft cheeses and prepacked croissants. Just dreadful. Reception was often unattended - the \"Back Soon\" notice always seemed to be there. A 4 out of 5 Trip Advisor Rating Certificate is prominently displayed. Does TripAdvisor calculate this from all feedback reports or just the most recent? The latter I think would be most appropriate. Anything positive to say - location close to Rialto might be considered to be good, but quite frankly anywhere in the San Marco or San Polo areas can be considered good and easily accessible to all the important places to visit in Venice, so nothing special about this place. The weather was good. When checking in we were asked to sign a form agreeing to certain points, one being the hotel would claim the full fee for our stay even if we decided to cancel and move elsewhere. If you really want to stay here after what I have said above I would strongly recommend that you inspect the room before signing anything, and before paying the tourist tax that hotels in Venice are now obliged to collect. Would I stay here again? - not if you paid me. Have I any chance of getting my money back? - I don't suppose so.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonbeach", "Title": "\u201cBe careful when you book\u201d", "Author": "janetBonbeach", "ReviewID": "UR118225037", "Content": "The photos of this hotel and the reality are quite two different things.

Hotel is in a great location - near the canal, Rialto Bridge, near several waterbus stops, restaurants, gonolas, the market (flea, fish/fruit) etc. It was a bit tough to find it at first - one reviewer suggested getting off at the Rialto stop (actually, you should get off at either the Rialto Mercato or S.Silvestro stops - ~5min walk to the hotel from either stop - this will eliminate the need to walk across the Rialto Bridge, which is a hassle with luggage, lots of steps to climb and descend and lots of tourists in the way). Another small room (although, it was the biggest room during our week trip). Bathroom had the best layout but the shower head holder was a bit broken (no biggie as it was also a handheld too). The bed was two singles pushed together though. Our room was just around the corner from where breakfast was served and where there was a great view of the canal from a small balcony - that was pretty cool. The room had a safety box, mini bar and a small hanging old style tube tv. It was air conditioned (as were all the rooms we stayed in). There was free wifi for us that worked great from our room (we booked directly with the hotel to get free wifi vs. through a discount website where there was a surcharge for wifi). If we had paid cash we would have been given a 10% discound off our rate (again, an agreement we had directly with the hotel). Breakfast was the standard again - bread, yogurt, luncheon meats, juice, cereal. The city is easily walkable so location-wise I'm sure any hotel would do but we got a waterbus pass and took it up and down the canal to get a great view of the city.

It was worth it to open the shutters & see the Rialto Bridge just 100 or so meters away. The bathroom was a good size & standard standard amenities were provided; however ours didn't have a shower, just a big tub & a hand-held shower hose. I'm sure they work for most people, just not me that's all I'm saying. We took advantage of the continental breakfast included with our rate; it had the basics and was more than satisfactory. Given Venice can be a bit pricey, it's a nice option to have. Great location, easily found by just following the Rialto signs. Arrived during Carnival so moving around the city was an exercise in patience. The rooms & common areas are fairly represented on the website. No more than a 10-minute walk to San Marco & less than 5 to the Rialto market. Be sure to watch prices in the restaurants by the hotel; they'll do their best to pull you in and are not affiliated with the hotel. We found 2 others just as good, if not better for about 1/3 the price. It's not a glamorous hotel, but that's not what they advertise to be and our expectations were pleasantly exceeded. Overall we found the 3-star rating to be solid & deserved with the only concern being the bed was too soft for us. But we had a 4+-star stay! This was down to Eliza and every other staff member making us feel welcome.

No one had mentioned that the Grand Canal was closed because there was new bridge being built. No one was willing to help. I had to leave my two daughters in a corner watching our luggage while I walked up and down the sides of the Canal trying to get info on how to get to the hotel. But once we made it there, around 12 midnight, we found ourselves in a small but very clean and air conditioned room. We had a problem with the third bed and the reception clerk came right away to fix it. Breakfast is served in a small dinning room by a lovely lady who will gladly prepare your favorite morning beverage. Nice selection of breads, ham, cheese, juices, cereal, etc. It was enough to get us going. At the reception desk, Mr. Moreno and Ms Lucia were an absolute delight. Extremely helpful. Gave us information about what we asked and more. Lucia even called a water taxi for us to take us to Murano to one of the glass factories. We were leaving Venice on that day and if it wasn't for her we would not have been able to go to the islands of Murano and Burano. When we came back from Burano, we were all wet and they allowed us to use the restrooms facilities to change clothes. They held our luggage for us all day at no cost.

The Staff were always friendly.. we arrived about an hour early and couldn't check in but we were allowed to leave our bags and they recommended a restaurant a short walk behind the Hotel which turned out to be one of the best meals we had during our stay. The Hotel is small, only about 12 rooms in total and they have 2 types of room, the economy and \"the rooms with a view\" as they call it.. so that is something to watch out for when you are shopping around for prices on the internet.. we got a really good price but it turned out to be an economy room at the side of the hotel with a view of a back street.. the room itself was quite small but quite adequate about 11' x 11' and had a small shower room attached. The room was spotlessly clean and as we only ever use our hotel room as a base and somewhere to sleep we would of been quite happy staying there but as it was a special occasion and had the chance to upgrade on our second night which we took advantage of it. The upgrade room had the view of the Grand Canal and was larger than our first and also had the benefit of a bathroom with Jacuzzi. Again the room was spotlessly clean and for the price couldn't be faulted. the downside of the upgrade was that the Grand Canal can get quite noisy . but not so noisy that it kept us awake there is also a restaurant on the ground floor of the Hotel which goes out onto the walkway and again this can get a little noisy when they are packing the tables away at around midnight.. but the room is double glazed and cuts the noise down to about 10% - that is the only downside we found. The Breakfast room is on the second floor and our room was right next to the kitchen, also on the second floor but the only reason we knew it was there was the fact that we were woken up each morning at 7am by the smell of freshly baked croissants.

I told the on-duty hotel clerk and he said it wouldn't be fixed until the next morning. So there we were, exhausted and hot with a deluxe room facing the Grand Canal and no A/C. My husband and I could not sleep b/c of the heat so I went downstairs and asked for 2 bottles of water and a bucket of ice. As we sucked on ice cubes throughout the night, we were never able to get a wink of sleep. This was due to the high temperatures in the room and when we had the windows open, the noise from the vaporettos was unbearable. We couldn't help thinking what a way to start off our trip. At 7am the next morning I went downstairs and asked that we get some money credited back to us b/c in my eyes, having no A/C takes a hotel down at least one star. They refused and even tried charging me for the 2 bottles of water we drank the night before. Later that day I took this problem up with Sebastiano and he proceeded to tell us that the A/C breaking was not his fault, it was the machines fault. I told him he was a reflection of the hotel and it was his job to make sure the hotel guests were comfortable. He must have told me 3 or 4 times that it was the machines fault and if the rooms were overbooked then maybe that would be his fault. I asked to speak to a manager/owner and he said he never comes in and is only available by phone. I demanded he ask the manager to take some money off the room for that one night. After a day of sightseeing we came back to find out they discounted it 15 euros. We told him it was a slap in the face but weren't going to argue this lost cause anymore. We went upstairs to our room only to find that the A/C had been fixed but a piece of furniture (ottoman) was missing from our room. Lovely, huh? BTW - whomever says the bathrooms of this place are gorgeous are out of their minds. We had a deluxe room with a Grand Canal view and our shower was a tiny 2 ft. x 2 ft. square, no kidding. The hair dryer was a reversible vacuum hose that blew out cold air. Maybe we should've used it to cool oursleves off the night before.

The first five nights were fine. The room was basic, but adequate, and the location is central. On the last afternoon I was there, I came back from a very hot afternoon of post-meeting touring, looking forward to relaxing before dinner in my air conditioned room. But the room was hot as a sauna, and the remote control for the air conditioner was missing. I spoke to the receptionist, and she told me that all the rooms on my floor had lost air conditioning (strange, since they were independent, wall-mounted units) and that the repairs would not be made until the next morning. I told her this would create a problem for me because I was leaving very early the next morning and I absolutely had to get a good night's sleep before my long (20-plus hour) trip home the next day. Air conditioning (as advertised on the hotel web page) was one of the reasons I picked this hotel. I had used it all of the previous five nights, and knew I would need it again my last night, so I asked to be moved to a room on a different floor that had working a/c. She told me the hotel was booked up, so she couldn't move me. I said that was fine, but I needed the a/c, so I asked her to arrange to put me up in another hotel that had a/c for my last night. She said she would not. Then I told her, fine, I will just check out a day early and find another hotel room on my own, and she said if I did that, they would still charge me for my last night because they have a 10-day cancellation period. I asked to speak to the owner or manager about the situation three separate times during our conversation, and each time she refused, saying \"they will just tell you the same thing.\" She absolutely refused to take responsibility for the broken a/c - she kept saying it was not their fault. While I certainly agree that they would not have intentionally broken the a/c, in my view, a hotel is responsible for providing guests with accomodations as-advertised, and if something prevents them from doing this, they need to find alternate arrangements for the guest. Later in the afternoon, the receptionist handed me a memo from the manager saying that because of my inconvenience, they would offer me 15% off my next stay at their hotel. I told her the memo was just silly and handed it back to her. I've only been to Venice twice in my life (including this time) and have no plans to come back there in the forseeable future. Even if I did, I would not stay with them again. I was not looking for financial gain from this situation, only a good night's sleep that night. That night, I tried to sleep with the window open, but didn't get any sleep - just laid there on top of my sweat-soaked sheets. Even a prescription sleep aid did not help. The air in the facing alleyway was hot, so the room never cooled to a reasonable temperature, and there were kids bouncing a ball in the alley that was very loud with the window open. Several buzzing insects (probably mosquitos) came in through the screenless window throughout the night, adding to the misery. The worst was the following day, trying to fly back to the U.S. on no sleep at all. In summary, avoid this place if customer service is even slightly important to you. They won't so much as lift a finger to correct a problem, and they'll give you a rude attitude on top of it. I've never been in a situation where I've repeatedly asked to speak with a manager and simply been flat-out refused.

This was our first time in Venice, so it was fascinating to watch the different boats on the canal. Carnivale had ended the day before we arrived, so the city was not very crowded. There are three or four restaurants in front of the hotel (on the Grand Canal). Prices varied from 14 Euros for 2 courses to 80 Euros for fish and pasta! Make sure you know the price before you order! We loved being able to explore Venice in the day time and then enjoy a meal by the hotel at night, so we didn't have to wander far after dark. Breakfast was more than adequate - Italian salami, croissants, tea, coffee, yoghurt, cereal, etc. The staff were always friendly and helpful. They even brought tea to our room the last day because we had to checkout before breakfast hours. Highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, ALberta,CDN", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4471315", "Content": "We stayed here in a room that overlooked the street. The staff were friendly and helpful. There is an elevator. The location is excellent with a water bus station fairly close. Our room was large for Europe and very comfortable. There are several restarunts nearby, be careful aand watch the prices though. We had there couples staying at the hotel and everyone liked their rooms. If you decide to go to Murano they will have a water taxi pick you up and the taxi is paid for by the glass factory, be aware, that there will be a hard sell at the end. We went and then left though an hard to find exit and toured around the island where the other shops were a lot cheaper.

Small, quiet, un-pretentious, good value. We had Room 202 which is the size of a basketball court and has two shuttered windows overlooking the canal. The marble bath would have suited a Ritz. The best part was the personal caring attention of Flavia and Gianni at the desk (we had a health issue). I guess there are other small quiet out of the way hotels in Venice, but the ability to hang out the window and watch the canal and the Rialto Bridge was special.", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel Ovidius\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4358645", "Content": "I took my 3 kids to Venice for Christmas, and we stayed at the Hotel Locanda Ovidius.
