We were on the top floor which is not bad but, for the hot water to make it up there you have to have the shower and the sink running at the same time for well over 5 minutes. The bathroom was nasty. Straight up nasty. I will post pictures so its a proven fact. There was hair stuck to the wall from the last \"cleaning\". There is also dirt in the grout on the floor.. I can understand stained grout but there was dirt in there grout. Dirt where the tile ends and the wall paper begins. There are my biggest cons.

I could tell how she spoke to me that she is excited about the work that has been done so far and is proud of her hotel. All the employees (at the front desk) were very helpful and cheerful which makes it enjoyable for us as guests. My only suggestion in our room would be that since nothing can be done about the size, it would be wonderful to have a full length mirror on the wall since the bathroom is so small and its hard to see yourself. Also, at some point, maybe a microwave.

Read the reviews and you\u2019ll see they are all over the map - as with ANY property. This fact is significant: People who started coming here 20+ years ago keep returning so there is a huge loyalty factor and there's a reason for that! PROS: Out of the fray of the southern end; great for people-watching; beach access is RIGHT THERE; plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance; helpful, patient, responsive staff (Destani was awesome!); great porch (for us this is preferable to a tiny private concrete balcony); comfortable beds, 40-cent coke machine (!), we arrived early and were able to check in at noon. CONS (they aren't deal-breakers so I list them just to inform): \"Rocking\" chairs on porch don\u2019t rock, small room and bathroom, limited electrical outlets, only one reading light between beds when one/bed would be better, weak water pressure, clammy air quality in rooms (forget about drying clothes in the room\u2026it won\u2019t happen!); only one tiny elevator to serve 5 floors and no room for extra passengers if someone is moving in or out with a full luggage cart (we used the stairs and congratulated ourselves for getting exercise!) Smoking: Apparently the hotel recently became a non-smoking establishment INSIDE but to appease long-standing smoking clients, smoking is still allowed on the porch. This is unfortunate for non-smokers since there is no sectioned-off area where they can remove themselves from smoke. Ocean breezes somewhat diminish this point but this problem seems easily-rectifiable \u2013 and will probably be solved by the time this review appears. While there were many there, I don\u2019t recommend this hotel for families with small children (there just isn't enough room for them to run around inside) and I can\u2019t imagine having more than 2 people in a room. Ditto for couples looking for a romantic stay. That leaves those in the 40+ category. I DO recommend inviting friends/family to join you since surrounding yourselves with people you enjoy can override the hotel\u2019s shortcomings. 4 stars may seem high and while I don't ever see this as a 5-star property, it does well in it's category by adhering to what has worked in the past.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schuylkill Haven, PA", "Title": "\u201cgreat cheap getaway\u201d", "Author": "millie516", "ReviewID": "UR133934379", "Content": "I was looking to get away for a cheap weekend, so I went online and saw Harrison Hall, 2 double beds, big pool, GREAT AC, sitting on the porch in the rocking chairs. the beach was right there and perfect, it was a great get away.

I proceeded to the front desk to retrieve my keys for a room on the 5th floor. After opening the door, I was welcomed with an awful smell. I pulled back one part of the bed only to see a brown stain on the sheet. I was on my way back to the front desk to possibly see if I could get my room changed but I realized I misplaced one of the room keys. After search for the key my friend noticed several bugs and chips located underneath the bed. I spoke with the manager and she stated that housekeeping marked the room as clean but her system did not reflect that. The beds were made and fresh towels were laid out so my guess is that they cleaned the room they just did a poor job. I was placed in another room located on the fourth floor but this wasn\u2019t any better. After walking up several steps (due to the elevator not working) I was yet again greeted with the smell of smoke when I thought this was a nonsmoking area. Once I got into the room I noticed the chair was raggedy, the place was very dusty, and the overall appearance was poor. The next day I met a few friends at the beach (who came from out of town) and after coming back around 5 pm, I noticed my room still wasn\u2019t clean. I called the front desk again and they said someone would be up shortly. The lady did come but with an attitude. She told me that she works nights and it really wasn\u2019t her responsibility to clean but she could give me fresh sheets and towels. I told her the room really needed to be cleaned and she agreed to do it after mumbling while walking away. After that discussion I then left again with my friends and came back around 10 pm to shower and get dressed for a night out on the town. We didn\u2019t make it out after noticing we didn\u2019t have an iron or an ironing board. So I called the front desk yet again and they told me I would have to come down and get the iron and ironing board because they are not provided in every room.

There's something wrong here with both the Harrison Hall's and the Hotels.com's policies and representation of what rooms are being reserved. I'm not asking for much, just a little old fashioned honestly. A reservationist also needs to clarify with caller what OCEAN VIEW and OCEAN FRONT is. However, that wasn't the issue since I didn't even have an ocean view at first, only a parking lot. The hotel itself is right on the boardwalk. But for a view of the parking lot, the rooms should be a lot more comfortable and updated. I'm not fauling the front desk staff, I'm sure they are following \"policy.\" But that management really should get a handle on this.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "FINKSBURG", "Title": "\u201cOLD BUT CHARMING\u201d", "Author": "Thomas D", "ReviewID": "UR120213628", "Content": "My wife and I bring our grand children here two times a year.

Like everyone else has said, if you're looking for a 5 star hotel this is NOT the place for you. You get what you pay for but I did have one MAJOR concern. There was very visible mold speckled all over the ceiling of the bathroom which I can only assume is because there is no exhaust or fan. When we addressed management about the problem they said they didn't have any rooms close to the size we had. We had 2 beds that they claim were queens... They appeared to be smaller than queens. According to management this was one of the largest rooms in the place. They offered to have maintenance come in and \"clean the mold\". Clearly that was a pacifier to shut us up because that kind of mold can't just be wiped up. We were given a credit for half of the second night we stayed after we further complained. The room was old, but appeared to be clean for what it was. There was a small refrigerator in the room inside of what looks like used to be a closet with no door. The small chair in the room by the window was old and coming apart at the seams. The mattresses were old and like other reviews stated, had huge dips in the middle. The water pressure sucked and it took me literally 5 minutes to get the proper temperature to shower. I was unable to shower my toddler the second night because I simply couldn't get a temperature that wasn't either ice cold or hot enough to melt off your skin. The elevator wasn't totally horrible but was a little rough and VERY small. I saw a couple people cram the baggage carts in them which I thought would be impossible, but it did take forever for them to get in and out of the elevator with them. On a brighter note... The pool is great and very clean. The lobby is nice and the rockers on the large porch right on the boardwalk are super relaxing. If it weren't for the mold, I would say I would stay again because of the price and location... Just concerns me because I know that breathing that in can't be healthy.

Although the staff has been very friendly and very quick to respond to requests, the hotel itself is in utterly terrible condition. The room we were given was a king room on the 4th floor. The room is so small that two people can barely walk by each other. There were only three outlets in this room. One was behind the bed (couldn't reach it), the other was for othe tv and the light (no available slots there) and the other was in the closet behind the refrigerator. The bed itself leaned to one side and the they did not supply a blanket so you were left with using the nasty bedspread to provide warmth. The A/C needed to be on all the time to help keep out the humidity. Now on to the bathroom. There are no words to adequately describe how bad this bathroom was. We actually went out and bought a bottle of bleach to dump into the shower which was so small that the smallest of little people would have felt cramped. Even after dumping bleach in the shower we still showered with our flipflops on. Heaven forbid if you would drop something while in the shower. You would either fall out of the stall or bang your head as you bent over. The shower curtain was so long that it hung three inches on the floor collecting all kinds of mold and mildew. The water pressure... well there wasn't any water pressure and the water temperature ranged from ice cold to scalding hot. There was no place within the shower to place your shampoo/conditioner/soap products. The knob that turned on the shower was so caked with mold and mildew you didn't really want to touch it. The flooring was peeling and coming up. The toilet would only flush properly if you stood there and held the handle for a good 90 seconds. There is no exhaust fan so you have to shower with the door open. You couldn't change clothes in the bathroom without banging your knees on something because the space was so incredibly small. Don't take your shoes off in the room because the carpet is so dirty looking and appears to have not been cleaned in a really long time. They provided no plastic bag for the ice bucket so you were expected to put your ice in a bucket that could have had who knows what dumped in it previsously. Be extremely careful if you get on the elevator. It will take you for quite a ride. Make sure you don't have a weak stomach because you will get jerked all over the place as it starts and stops.

We had two rooms and the staff didn't seem to want to ask any questions as to why we only had one double & one single bed but five people walking into each room..... As for the other reviews on here--we were on the third floor and didn't encounter any bugs, and yes, the elevator is terrifying. We used it once and didn't get back on after it shut on my friend's suitcase.

Our room was very clean other than the sand that was embeeded into the carpet but then again it is a oceanfront hotel. i didnt see the need in any lysol or candels as the room smelled fine. other than the typical beach smell all rooms near the beach have. as for the bathroom a tad small but was fine for one person our room had a bathtub. and as far as the water pressure. if some would just take the time to read some of the info that is left in the room they would see that the water pressue isnt anything that they can control. in the lobby they did offer free internet if you could get the teenagers off of it. yes we made the mistake of going down during senior week wont happen again. the staff was very friendly always asking you if there was anything you needed. cleaning ladies always coming around to clean the rooms if you wanted them to. my only complaint was the baby pool it wasnt holding water. but they where trying to address the issue before we left to come home my littlest one didnt seem to mind she just got in the big pool which by the way was cleaned daily. did notice one new improvement since the last time i was there is that they added a shower around by the pool so you could wash off before going to the pool or inside.all in all had a very good time there other the weather not being the greatest but hey the harrison cant control that. but then again there is probably some people that stayed there would disagree. so if you are looking a good cheap place to stay on the boardwalk that is close to everything yet not right in the middle of it all then stay there i will again sometime. they also offer customer loyalty pricing at the end of sept -oct for the price of either 10 or 15 dollars per person is the big chain hotels in oc going to do that probably not !!!!!!!!! if you dont need all the frills that the big hotels give you at a much higher price than stay here", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Towson, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cCheap & dirty\u201d", "Author": "Leonje", "ReviewID": "UR22922720", "Content": "We stayed at Harrison Hall because of the really cheap price and the fact that it was on the boardwalk.

We've encountered some problems, but I was willing to deal with them rather than pay double or triple to be somewhere more upscale. You're still right on the beach (get the oceanfront rooms!) and you have the front porch with the rocking chairs-- this is why we come here. Plus the outdoor pool is quite nice, something that many lower-cost hotels can't say. We also like Davinci's, a pretty good Italian restaurant right on site. The worst problems we've had have been the teeny size of the smaller rooms, and the hot water / cold water issue. We always get the oceanfront king bed rooms now. This last trip, the shower worked fine. It is a tiny bathroom and one-person only shower, for sure. The elevator can be tempermental-- they're old but they generally work. They could pay more attention to detail like cleaning hallway windows and updating the old furniture. But we're saving well over $100 a night to stay here-- mainly, sleep here. We love to open the windows and sleep to the sound of the ocean. This last trip, we had to ask if the windows could be cleaned-- saltwater haze distorted the ocean view. Some of the new wallpaper was peeling a bit in the \"recently renovated\" bathroom. Still pretty old looking. We also had to push hard to get the entry door open because it stuck pretty good. There was also trash bags in the narrow hallway for almost two days. This is as bad as the problems have ever gotten here for us. Maybe booking early gets us the better rooms. We still consider HH to be a great value for the money. Not everyone wants to pay $250-$300 per night. It's more of a dorm or cabin experience, but it doesn't deserve to be trashed like many reviewers have. Another good reason to stay here is this-- something I've never heard of before: If you stay at HH between memorial and labor day, you get to return after labor day for $10 a night. It's their guest appreciation policy. September is more than warm enough to take advantage of that. This year will be our first guest appreciation stay-- so I'm hoping we don't find anything worse than what we experienced in the past.

The first room we stayed in (for 30 minutes) had such a terrible plumbing problem; we had to move to another room. The second room we got was just as dirty and smelly as the first. There was this huge mysterious stain on one of the beds that my friend had pointed out. Then, I grabbed a washcloth to wash my face and there was a fresh yellow stain on it. It was used and it looked like someone wiped their dirty butt with it. I was livid. I tried to take a shower but it was almost impossible because there was no water pressure. Not to mention that the bathroom in a prison is much bigger and cleaner. Needless to say, I kept my flip flops on in the shower and during our entire stay. I was really fuming over my shower experience. So, my friend and I went to the front desk with dirty cloth in hand and a picture that we took of the mattress. He refunded us part of our money back, but I wanted to leave and unfortunately, my friend wanted to stay. We were now moved to our third room thinking that we could get a better shower in there but I was wrong. No water pressure. You either take a cold shower or a scolding hot shower. See the hotter you make the water, the more pressure you get. Shower at your own risk. Oh, and don\u2019t even get me started on the elevators! They jump and bounce and never dropped us off on the fifth floor. We had to get off on the 4th floor and walk up to the fifth. One of the attendants at the hotel assured us that the elevator was in tip top shape. One afternoon when we returned from the beach we were greeted by a pair of men\u2019s shoes in our wastebasket. Then, my friend brought her heirloom beach blanket for her son to lay on at the beach and when she set it in front of our door to dry because we had to no room in our 4 x 4 room, we realized that someone decided to urinate on the blanket and someone threw pizza boxes on it. I was so disgusted and my friend had to part with the blanket that was in her family for years. I felt like I couldn\u2019t touch anything or walk barefooted for fear of contacting a disease.

For the last several years my fianc\u00e9e and I have overlooked the lack of cleanliness for the convenience; however our past visit was our last visit. Aside from the dirt on the walls, the stains on the ceiling, and the fear of sleeping on the bed due to lack of changing the bedding, I have to say the customer service aspect of Harrison Hall is by far the worst that I have ever experienced. As an employee of company whose main focus is on the guest relations I have to say that I would be ashamed to work at a Harrison Hall. When we arrived we braced ourselves as we have in the past by saying\u201d It\u2019s just a place to sleep.\u201d After check in we made our way to our designated room on the third floor which was a \u201cking size bed\u201d (which we paid for upon check in) and my fianc\u00e9e and I both agreed that we wanted something on the first floor in case of emergencies (any other floor besides the first there is only one way out in case of emergencies.) Before even bringing in our luggage we went back down to the main lobby to ask if something was available on the first floor. Sure enough their was, we were placed in the same room as we were the year before room 116 a \u201dqueen bed\u201d not worried about price change only our safety we at this point finally made our way to our room. Much to what we expected it was a room much smaller than on the third floor, a room that only had a queen bed, when in fact we paid for a king, and a room with dirty floors. At this point we were both in disgust that we sucked it up four days making sure never to be bare foot, and never to sleep on the bed without our own blanket beneath us. To me this isn\u2019t what a vacation should be... it was very uncomfortable having to continuously worry. However we made it through and for the most part overlooked a lot of things. At first we weren\u2019t going to question the price change (from a king bed, down to a queen bed) but because of our unpleasant experience we decided to. On the day of our departure we went to the main lobby again, and asked if we can be reimbursement for the smaller room that we were moved into (We only asked for a room change to the first floor not a smaller room.). The women at the front desk checked something on the computer and then left to ask a manager what she should do, when she came back with an answer for us she said: \u201cWe moved you to the first floor, because the room on the third floor wasn\u2019t ready when you checked in.\u201d Cleary she was not stating the truth, when in fact we asked for the change. She was stunned to find out that we asked for the moved, at this point the Manager came behind the desk already defensive, and stated \u201c They were both King size beds, you can measure them if you want, prices do change, and we move beds around.\u201d So my question is\u2026 Which is the real story\u2026 first you tell us that you changed our rooms, when in reality we had asked for the change, or was it that the rooms were both king size and you change the rooms around.. At this point it wasn\u2019t about getting a reimbursement back, it was based on principal, the management lied to us\u2026. We left not knowing the truth, and will never come back to find it out.

Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience and did not experience the problems that other users had experienced. The hallways were narrow and the rooms were smaller than what I am used to from staying at other hotels/inns. The carpet showed alot of wear but it didn't bother me. My room had a full size bathtub and I got a side view facing the construction site of what appears to be another hotel being built and facing the parking lot/pool view which I was not bothered by. I did get woken up by a Ravens marching band and could not move my car until they were gone which know this is probably a one time obstacle. When I arrived on a weekday, it was like off-season so it was interesting to see the traffic coming in on the weekend. I liked how the lobby opened out to the boardwalk with rocking chairs facing the boardwalk/ocean and what a view and great if you like to watch people on the boardwalk. The coffee was excellent and they even had flavored creamer and sweetener substitute whcih I did not expect as most non-chain establishments do not have and the only way I can enjoy coffee. The staff was friendly and I spoke to them frequently and they were not grumpy as you might expect and very courteous. I used my dinner voucher to eat at Da'Vinci's Italian Restaurant underneathe the hotel which was convenient and although pricey was very good. I agree this hotel does need to renovate but money is tight for everyone. Maybe they will one day. I do not recall seeing any comment cards anywhere like I normally do at other hotels/inns. Parking was great for me because I never moved my car during my stay and arrived before the weekend crowd. The pool appeared clean and was olympic sized. The elevators were too small for one person with a luggage cart and myself but I managed to squeeze inside. It needs to be bigger and it stops on every floor even if the elevator goes up and you are going down which was a nusiance and may need repaired or better yet a new elevator. I stayed on the 2nd floor which worked great when going out to the boardwalk. There are not many hotels that open up to the boardwalk other than the Plim Plaza which I liked how this is layed out. This hotels reminds me more like a big guesthouse and it felt small and tight when walking down the hallway. It kinda feels like you're in an Amtrak which I got the feeling at first with how narrow the hallway is and how the doors looked. I liked how the key was very easy to open the door to the room, just stick it in, wait..hear the click and the light is lit then you're in. I didn't need maid service and the room and bathroom although is older was very clean and the toilet had a powerful flush. I guess I got lucky go ask for room #217 and you'll be happy. The bed felt comfortable although my back hurt probably from lying on a cheap innerspring mattress and felt somewhat too soft and maybe its just me, not the mattress as everyone has a different preference. I am looking forward to returning to utilize their customer appreciation days in September @ a rate of $10 per night for sideview or $15 for oceanview. You don't need to waste gas looking for parking when you can ride the tram or the short walk to the other end of the boardwalk. I considered the Carousel Resort and Pricess Royal Hotels which were similarly priced due to the slow season with high gas prices and poor economy and although are probably much nicer did not offer the convenience of the location you get from this hotel or free meals as an incentive. I did not see any bugs at this hotel which is a real positive.

The price is 2x cheaper than any boardwalk hotel. If you like to people watch, I guess this place is probably the cheapest you'll find. It has a decent pool with a bar. Rooms have a fridge so you can stash your beer or food. The staff there is friendly. There's a decent Italian restaurant (Davinci's) right underneath...although i didn't eat there, it looked good. Negatives: Hot water was hit or miss, which is not a good thing with young children. We asked about this and they said it's been like this all summer and they don't know what's wrong. Well, I'm not a plumber, but I'm guessing THEY SHOULD PROBABLY REPLACE THE HOT WATER HEATERS?! The shower in our room smelled rotten whenever we turned it on. Rooms are outdated and very small. You can't drink alcohol on the porch, but I just put it in a container and no one bothered me. If you can get a room like my sister-inlaw did (one of the side rooms with 2 double beds) then you should be fine. For some reason, they had hot water the whole time and a nice bathroom with a tub. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking at one of the other hotels back from the boardwalk a bit...although most OC hotels aren't a whole lot better. My guess is, this hotel will never be updated. I'm sure it's been paid off years ago and all the business they get now is just cash flowing in. They will probably wait for some bigger fish to come by and offer them a whole lotta cash for this location. This is probably our last time in OC anyway...it's just not a great place for a family vacation. I enjoyed it much more when I was younger. The Senior Week kids and singles can have their OC. Tips: There's a really good hole-in-the-wall crabshack nearby...Crab-Stop. Get a dozen take-out and eat in the lobby of the Harrison and you got ocean front AYCE crabs for cheap!

I checked out the Ocean CIty, MD website for hotels and discovered Harrison Hall, one of, if not the, cheapest hotel listed on the site. I checked out the reviews and they were absolutely horrible - one even said, \"do not stay here!!!\" However, we did anyway. I like staying in nice places, and prefer great service, etc., but if you're on a tight budget and are just looking for somewhere to stay, this place is absolutely perfect. The front desk service was fine, nothing out of the ordinary. We checked in 3 hours prior to check in time and they did not have a problem with that. The hotel is about 3-stories, and has the slowest elevator ever. (so plan on taking the stairs). The decor is so-so. There is nothing at all special about this place (other than the price and location). It has a restaurant attached called Di Vinci's or something like that. We didn't have a chance to eat there, but I'm sure it was overpriced and mediocre at best. The swimming pool is decent, but not if you're used to enormous resort-style pools. It is the equivalent to a nice back-yard inground pool. The only drawback is that it is in the parking lot of hotel, and not beach-side. There was also construction going on immediately next door to the pool (July 2007). I don't imagine that being there next year, but who knows. There is a bar in the pool are which is nice. They offer decently priced beer and frozen drinks. It is opened at random times, it follows no schedule it seems... The hotel is also right on the boardwalk at 15th street. This is good location because it is near the end of the busy-part of the boardwalk, so the beach is not incredibly crowded at this point. The hotel has a large porch which overlooks the boardwalk and beach, and is frequented by the elderly and middle-agers. If you're willing to walk 1-3 miles, you can easily make it down to the end of the boardwalk and back within a couple hours. The billing for the hotel was reasonable, no bad practices, no hidden charges - everything went fine there. Check in and check out were fine also. Parking is a pain - you can unload your car right next to the hotel, however, will most likely part across a street in a hotel designiated lot (not the main street however). The rooms are probably the worst part of the hotel. They are incredibly small, old and not the cleanest. The bathroom has not been renovated in decades I'm sure. The shower is literally 3 ft by 3 ft - I measured, so if you're on the larger side, you may not fit. The water temperature seemed to also frequently change as well?? The air conditioning is so-so, television fine. Beds you may want to spray down with Lysol, but they're typical for your run of the mill motel. In closing, don't go here if you're expecting a romantic or exotic get-away. You'll be dissappointed. However, if you want a cheaper, but decent hotel in a good location, and you don't plan on spending much time in the room, then this is the place for you. You get what you pay for I guess???

After reading the reviews I was a little scare about the decision but since I had to make a deposit I went ahead as planned. My family (wife, child 4yr old, mother-in-law) and I arrived July 3rd, 07. Our rate was $149 when everyone else was either sold out or $300+ a night. The first thing, parking... they do have a parking lot that is reserved for guests only... so that was great. The hotel is right off the boardwalk and the beach so the arrival experience was beautiful. The hotel has about 25 rocking chairs in their big balcony that are facing the beach. The lobby is comfortable...they have several couches, chairs, a TV mostly with news, board games for kids, complimentary coffee, hot chocolate and tea... these were always available and fresh during my stay. The check-in process was very smooth and staff was very friendly. The elevator is very small but worked great during our stay. The hallways are very small, some with peeling wallpaper (as you might expect from an old historic hotel). When we arrived to our guest room everything was in order. Fresh smell, clean carper, great view, a/c working properly. The conditions of the wall (especially in the bathroom) were not very good. We had problems with hot water...if you put the shower the water temperature will fluctuate so we had to use the water from the lower faucet which was always hot (so we used a little cup to bath). Towels were clean and fresh and they provided with branded soaps and shampoo/ conditioner. There was a closet in the room, refrigerator and TV with Cable. The beds were very comfortable and very clean. The hotel has a huge Olympic outdoor pool on the back (from 3ft deep to 10ft...) they also have a kiddy pool... the pool was great. A little dirty on the steps to get in but what else can you expect when the hotel is sitting right off the beach? They have a lot of chairs and a bar right off the pool serving soft drinks, beers, frozen drinks and food...I had a pina colada :)... Well, overall it was a great experience...and the location really makes up for the challenges that the property has from a renovation needs standpoint. If you are going to Ocean City to sleep and be in the hotel all day then this is not your hotel...but if you are going to Ocean City to enjoy the beach, the boardwalk, the activities, the restaurants then take a bath, and sleep for the next day...this your place and for a great rate...", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWhat a horrible experience!!!

The lobby (like the whole place) is in need of a major makeover and seems really dated but hey, maybe our room is nice - HAH!!! The hallway leading to our room featured stained and worn out carpet and wallpaper that was extremely worn and dirty. Our room featured a smoke detector that was dangling from the ceiling - not even sure if it worked. The support, from the ceiling, that was holding up the shower curtain was pulling away from the wall. The faucet handles pulled right off of the sink. The heat lamp, in the bathroom, was falling out of the wall. The backwall, above the toilet, had water leaking down from the upstairs bathroom and the rust stains proved that this problem was there for quite awhile. The bathroom sink had no vanity what-so-ever and the room itself had an odd smell. What would you expect for $110 per night early in the season. This place gets $150-180 in the peak season!! We went to the front desk to complain and were shown 3 other rooms to try to satisfy us. One room featured a clogged toilet with the previous tenants crap floating in it!!! Another room was not too bad, but didn't feature a bath tub, which my 4 year old needed. The final room that was shown to us - the manager went with us as I guess he though we were making all of this stuff up. When he entered the room he tried to turn on the lights and they wouldn't work - a little embarrassing for him. The toilet seat looked like it was 100 years old. It featured old, cracked and chipping paint and looked stained. I wouldn't have my dog use that toilet!! The manager then said to us \"I'll leave it to you guys to discuss.\" What was to discuss?!! Thankfully this \"hotel\" was part of a chain and we wound up staying at another partner hotel just up the boardwalk!! This is a classic example that not all income can be profit - You have to spend money to make money. I cannot believe that this place gets any return visits!!

The hallways leading to our room had worn dirty carpets, the floor moldings had worn paint with wallpaper peeling off the walls. Upon entering the room there was a distinct unpleasant cleaning product smell. OK, it's small but we were only there for 2 days. Forget the decor, \"old\" would sum it up nicely. The linens appeared clean, we could manage. The we went into the bathroom. The light fixture didn't work, to replace it we had a heating light fixture on a timer that shone right into your face when you were on the toilet. The medicine cabinet and air vent were rusted. The hot and cold water faucets were backwards. The shower head came up to the middle of my forehead and I had to bend down to wash my hair with water pressure that was almost nonexistent. The worst part of the whole bathroom was the floor. It literally had a hole in it with the head of a nail poking through with a piece of duct tape over it! Going up to the next floor to get ice, the machince was recessed into a wall, the machine leaked and you \"squished\" in the carpet in front of it. We decided to ask for another room but on our way down to the lobby we passed 2 other rooms that were being cleaned and peaked inside to find pretty much the same conditions in those rooms too. The best thing I could say about the place was that the staff was friendly and the pool was nice. Otherwise you would be better off staying somewhere else.

Some things were better than others. The room itself was small, but not as small as I was imagining based on reviews that I'd read. That may have partly have been because we'd gotten a corner room with a queen bed. The bed was a little annoying - the sheets were too small to fit the bed and the mattress pad kept rumpling up under the sheets. The bathroom was tiny - My boyfriend could barely fit in the shower and the water pressure was horrible. I didn't have too much of a temperature problem, though. The pool looked nice although we didn't go in, it was nice to have fresh fruit provided every morning, and the room was pretty clean.

In all the hotels I've stayed at I have never seen a shower like that one. I really think its the original from the 50's , I'm not kidding. Also the seniors were so bad and noisy that I didn't fall asleep till 3 or 4. The hotel actually shook. I can't believe no one in the hotel called the police. When I went down to complain and try to get my money back all I got from the woman at the desk was sarcasm. She said what did I expect with the junebugs in town. So I waited for the manager to come in and I think it was around 8am. I was hopping mad by this time. He wouldn't refund my wife and I for that night. But the second night that we had payed for he sent us to one of their other properties which was very nice. I think it was the Day's Inn. The Harrison group owns like 6 or 7 other hotels in oc. That room was really nice and the price I payed was valid for there. If you want to enjoy your vacation do not stay here no matter how cheap it is. That year they had a promotion that if you stayed at the Harrison Hall you could come back in September or October for $10 or $15 a night. They called it customer appreciaton weeks or something like that. Even at that price I said no thanks.

It was my one year old daughters first time away from home, so she was having trouble sleeping, and was crying non stop. Since we were going to check out the following morning anyhow, we decided to leave around 2:30 am. After we got the car all packed, we went to the front desk. No one was there. All the doors coming into the hotel were unlocked (including the one that says it locks from 11-7, yeah right), so we knew someone was to be at that desk. We stood there for an hour and half, ringing the bell, knocking on the counter and the office door, and yelling for someone. My husband even went back up to the room and called numerous times, no one would come. Finally, this lady comes walking out rubbing her eyes, and says sorry for the wait, I was on the phone. Ummm...hello. At this time it was 4:00 am, and when I told her we were there for more than an hour her face turned bright red and she had no comment. I will never, ever stay at this place again. The front porch was pretty, but very dirty with cigarette butts laying around. And the olympic size pool and pool bar, what a joke. The kiddie pool was green and had an inch of sand in the bottom. I wouldn't even consider putting my daughter in there. Not once during the 3 days I was there did you see anyone out there cleaning the pool.

It was after I stayed at Harrison Hall for the first time that I found trip advisor. As I read the reviews, I thought back to our stay and said to myself it was decent and I did understand why people were so unhappy there. Forward to this year and our return trip to Ocean City and my friend and I were happy to be staying in a place where we knew what to expect or so we thought. We were supposed to stay this year from August 25th to the 29th. We arrived late Wednesday night at about 10 pm after a three hour trip from Baltimore, so needless to say we were pretty tired. My friend had booked us a double room with an oceanview. We got to our room after checking in and I am glad we did not unload our things till we saw the room. The windows top pane were both stuck, so there was bugs flying in the room. The light knob for the two beds lamps looked as if it could fall out at any second. There were rips in the curtains and chairs in the room. There was mildew on the curtain of the shower and the shower was so tiny that a child could probably barely move in it. There was a ring of brown stuff around the sink drain and the toliet was dirty. I did not look at the sheets, but my friend and I were afraid to sleep in the beds after everything else. We went to the front desk to complain and were told that all other oceanview rooms were booked, but there was another room we could see instead. This second room was almost as bad as the first only slightly better. It was a side room with one double bed and one twin bed, not what we originally asked for. It was hard to believe that this place was full. We told the front desk that we would take the second room with the promise of returning to an ocean front after another couple checked out in the morning. We were also told that we were orginally given a smoking room, when we had requested a non-smoking. We tried to get a third floor room where we had stayed two years ago, but got told that they were all booked. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. We ended up driving up Coastal Highway a few blocks and staying at the Grand. It was so much better. (I posted a review in the Grand section as well) We had to forfeit one nights deposit for leaving Wednesday night, but it was worth it.
