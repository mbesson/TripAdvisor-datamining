Really enjoyed the stay. The hotel is chic and minimalist, if youre looking for opulence - then this place isn't probably for you. Rooms are quite small and designed on almost a capsule basis. Bed is large and comfortable Much of the hotel is dark in colour and low lit - which some might find oppressive. Light in the rooms is not helped by the fact that the whole outside of the hotel is clad in a mesh brie soleil - felt a bit like being in guantanamo bay on occasion! Food and cocktails are outstanding, had a veal burger and a beer on the roof terrace yesterday and it was awesome. Breakfast is standard fayre. There is no pool, just a small (but nice) plunge pool on roof deck. There is a gym - but, as is often the case with capsule type hotels it felt a bit of an afterthought - reasonably equipped though One thing to note and I see other people make reference to it, is that el Raval is a tough neighbourhood - fine in the day, but you needed your wits about doubt night with gangs of lads on corners.

Wish we had stayed longer. I know I am only just posting this this review, but I actually went to Barcelo Raval in August 2011 -TripAdvisor said error when I tried to review it straight after I got back from Barcelona! We got a really good deal on Expedia a couple of months before we went, which I have since found out saved us at least \u00a3200 over the asking price on the hotel's own website (I think we must have been fortunate.) I could spend hours writing about the hotel and the surrounding area, but instead I will just list the best bits to save everyone time and effort! THE BEST BITS: - Interior/Decor: The hotel is very contemporary and modern from top to bottom. I absolutely loved it. The room was equally modern with a rainfall shower, minimalistic design and stylish lighting with a Nespresso machine too. - Rooftop Pool/Bar: The roof terrace is one of the highlights of this hotel. You can walk all the way round and see some amazing views, including the sea, the business district and older parts of the city. The pool is purely for dipping to cool down, and it is perfect for that. The bar does amazing cocktails for 10 euros. Wine is approx. 7 euros (I think) and Peroni is 5. It's worth it though...plus you get free nibbles! - Location: The closest beach is less than half an hour's walk from the hotel, or you can get the metro to the further away beaches. Las Ramblas is literally 5 minutes away, however we couldn't see what the fuss was about as all we saw was standard Tapas bars and cheap gift shops all along the strip!! We preferred the square that the Hotel itself is on, it has at least 3 bars, 2 restaurants and a supermarket 2 mins down the road. I honestly can't think of many bad points about the area of the hotel. If I was being picky, the breakfast prices are high and so we never ate it at the hotel (15+euros PP I think). I love to keep fit and although there is a gym on the lower ground floor, it is very limited. However you don't go on holiday to work out!! and the lower ground floor itself is very nice. For anyone going to Barca I would highly recommend Barcelo Raval. The location is ideal for seeing all the major attractions and for the amazing beaches, and the hotel itself impressed in every quantifiable and qualitative way concievable. Try and look on independent sites (Expedia, Late Rooms etc.) for better offers than the hotel's own site.

Rather slow elevators took us up to our 10th-floor suite which was interestingly beautiful, with knock-out panoramic views across the city. The over-stocked minibar and oh-so comfy bed left us reluctant to leave the room, at all. Service throughout the hotel was good, though the bar staff could be a little more on-the-ball. Breakfast is good but overpriced, and was slightly chaotic on one morning since the Easter crowds had descended. Almost as if dropped in from space, this hotel is a little at odds with the surrounding area. Out front is a tree-lined boulevard which is great for a wander. The surrounding streets are a different story though and I can see why some people are intimidaed. As said by others I believe there is no more risk in walking around here than anywhere else in the city (in fact, we saw a fake-tourist-police-gun incident in a much \"nicer\" area but nothing near the hotel).

The rooms were comfortable, extremely comfortable beds with plenty of pillows. The whole Hotel was clean and modern, the staff were friendly and the Restaurant gave me tea bags and extra milk each evening (a plus for me). Everyone mentions the Restaurant is expensive ALL Hotels are expensive, but not ALL Hotels have superb food, this one did, the evening meals were exceptional, I did think the breakfast was overpriced BUT as there was a lot of choice if you were to have everything, then it was good value, not everyone is able to eat everything that is on offer and I think that is where the problem is, but I would admit that I have had far better breakfasts for a lot less money. THE BAD: I booked the Hotel before I knew it was in a bad area as far as safety is concerned, so I kept in the Hotel the whole time apart from using a taxi to get to and fro my Business during my stay. On the times I was in the Hotel I felt that I was a prisoner within the Hotel. I had been informed it was in a bad area and that is when I read some reviews, apparently on one review the couple had been warned about going out and to keep to main roads. The Hotel knew that I was a lady on my own yet not one person warned me not to go out on my own at night, neither did they tell me about keeping to main roads. Had I not known I would have ventured out to another venue for a meal for a change, this I was afraid to do. A young couple I met went out and got mugged just around the corner from the Hotel and no-body seemed interested in this, maybe because it happens so frequently, as this couple suggested, maybe they should be interested as this will seriously put people off visiting this Hotel. The lighting in the room could have been a lot better and the lighting in the Restaurant could have been brighter in some places, it was dim almost everywhere, the rooms are also noisy.

We walked down any of the three streets to get to the Ramblas, and found no hostility at all...the streets are packed with tourists! If you want a 10minute walk to the Port Vell, turn left outside the hotel and avoid the jostling down the Ramblas.The Boqueria market is great for a fresh juice or just to look at the impressive fish and ham stalls.It is just off the Ramblas. We took the bus tour but were not impressed as we were in a leisurely mood, my partner planned to get off at the football stadium but there were a lot of crowds and it cost 22 euros for entry. Overall we were suprised and somewhat unprepared for the cost of eating out.....on average 60 euros for lunch or dinner in a mid range restaurant, no starter or dessert and one drink each! We headed down to Port Olypmic and had a fab seafood meal at \"Salamanca\" which included free olives and breads and free cake and liquors afterwards....huge portions, monkfish and prawns to die for! Definitely good value compared to the restaurants on and around the Ramblas. Even the Tapas bars are expensive compared to London!? Another great restaurant is \"Marmalade\" for handmade steak burgers and cava cocktails, they also do a nice\" recovery brunch\". Make sure you take a drink(buy a bottle form one of the little ethnic shops outside the hotel and down Hospital street ) up to the roof terrace late afternoon and catch some rays, listening to the jazzy Motown music playing up there. Sagrada Familial is under a lot of construction, but we enjoyed Guell Park...take the metro for 3 euros(6 stops) to Vallcarca for amazing views and we also liked the Guell Place, just off the Ramblas.

Excellent selection of fruit, juices and milkshakes. Good pork sausages and roasted vegetables.The coffee was very good. The only drawback was on the 2nd morning when we were later down to breakfast and it was quite crowded - but it was Easter! Evening Tapas in the restaurant was very good. Not the cheapest but beautifully presented and delicious.

We have stayed twice in this hotel and have found it comfortable and welcoming. The trouble is, it is a top end hotel in a very bad area. Glad to return home yesterday, having been mugged on the way back from restaurant one evening this week. The adjacent streets have definitely worsened. A gang of about seven or eight surrounded us, pushing and shoving, asking us \"friendly\" questions. Our son, the most threatening for them I suppose, was surrounded while they took my husband's wallet. He had been walking at the back of the group. The wallet had been in a secure pocket but they still took it and he had no sensation of them doing so. I have always been an Hispanophile, loving the country, culture, language and specifically the city of Barcelona but now feel disillusioned and vulnerable. It was not just a chance pickpocketing. This group had obviously singled us out. Yes, we will learn from it but, even so, we are seasoned travellers and had deliberately avoided the smaller alleyways. However, they were very slick. Just a few minutes after it happened, my son was approached again in a similar way! Got the feeling this time that the people in this area definitely did not like us and did not want us there. I spoke to police who drove by and again the next day at the police station but they did not really want to know.

Rooms are nice, well equipped but decor is very dark everywhere which doesn't really help the overall feeling being a little claustrophobic.

There are however, good all round views from the roof terrace, but this in reality, is much smaller than photos would suggest (they must have had them taken by a good estate agent!). The roof \"pool\" is nothing more than a large hot tub that isn't hot, there are tables and chairs to sit and admire the view, but these obstruct the way round when people are sat at them, and to be honest, you can't see much sitting down anyhow as the sides to the roof terrace are about 4 feet high. Stairwells are very dark indeed, so use with caution or wait for the slow lifts to arrive (only 1 of 3 go to the roof so it can be quite a wait), corridors very dark and the room lighting too. There is no privacy in the open plan shower, particularly with the mirrored doors too, so only share with someone you know well! Happy to report there is a sliding door to the loo! Not a great deal of wardrobe space if you're staying more than a couple of days but the beds are very comfortable indeed. Overall a decent contemporary hotel, a little bit weird in it's choice of dark decor everywhere, and more than a little bit odd given the location.

I am from NYC and I've been in sketchy areas before and I will definitely vouch for this hotel being located in a sketchy sketchy neighborhood. It's a cool hotel, but not worth getting pick pocketed. My advice is don't stay near Las Ramblas. I read all of the reviews and thought \"hey, I've been in sketchy neighborhoods, the hotel sounds cool so I'm sure I can handle it.\" We were walking back home from dinner at around 10pm on Carrera Hospital street and some dude came up trying to bum a cigarette and then started kicking my husband in his chin (actually cut his chin up) and then when my husband pushed him away he jammed his hand into my husband's front jean pocket (where he happened to coincidentally have his iphone) and stole the phone. By the time my husband had grabbed the guy's hand he had already passed it off to his friend who ran down an alleyway and disappeared. We were extremely careful with where we had our stuff stored in our pockets (no back pockets, nothing easily accessible), but as you can see the thieves in this neighborhood are diligent in their thieving and even willing to resort to physical violence to get what they want. Heed the warnings of your fellow travelers and stay somewhere else. You can take your chances and you may be the one person that doesn't happen to get pick pocketed in this neighborhood but just know that makes you the exception and not the rule.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cRaval area is nice!\u201d", "Author": "robeland", "ReviewID": "UR126398553", "Content": "I liked the Raval area.

However, we'd already been booked by our travel agent, so we thought we'd suck up our courage and stick with it. We are so glad we did. I don't know if those who wrote about how scary it is are just not used to being in a big city, or if we just got lucky, but we did not have one negative experience in the area around the hotel. We weren't even scared a little bit. Be smart, don't put your wallet in your back pocket, keep an eye on your purse, like you would in any crowded area. My husband agreed to wear a messenger bag, so that solved everything for us; wallet in the bag, no purse for me. One night, we went for pizza at the area right outside the hotel (the pizza was actually really good) and there was this big local family sitting next to us. Their kids went running off and the parents weren't alarmed, so obviously the locals aren't too afraid either. Also, big fireworks started going off and everyone just started getting up and cheering and it was kind of magical (seems every other day is some sort of holiday in Spain). The hotel is hip (even though the iron cage that makes it look cool from the outside blocks the view a little from your window), with a nice clientele. Our room was small, but not too small, and the view was a little strange (it faced a concrete courtyard that I think the employees hung out in), but it was high enough to see over everything and see the beautiful sea beyond the city, so we were able to ignore the courtyard. Easy to walk everywhere, top bar with a view of the city was fabulous. The staff was helpful, and it was easy to get on the computers in the lobby.

We loved it because it was so different to normal everyday hotels because of the funky decour, low multi coloured lighting etc. One of the reasons we chose this hotel is because we stay away on a regular basis in 'traditional' style hotels, which can be very boring and they all seem the same - so this hotel really stood out! We were made to feel very welcome when we arrived and throughout our stay, the staff couldnt do any more for us! Great location - only 10 mins to the heart of the City, Las Ramblas, and a very pleasant 15 mins walk to the harbour area which is so lovely. Close enough to walk to all amenities but far enough away to be quiet. The reception staff told us to use only the main streets to get to Las Ramblas and stay away from the side streets - some very good advice! The rooms are very clean, the beds are reallyscomfortable, and because its glass all round the views are great! We loved the roof top viewing area - although it was early season when we visited, it was still lovely to sit out and enjoy the wonderful views. The hotel is very tall and because its a round hotel you get 360 degrees of amazing views - a great way to start each day! The only downsides are that the low lighting can in some places be too low - for example the stairs. I prefer to use the stairs rather than the lift and I found these to be too dark and in need of more lighting - but its really not an issue if you prefer the lift! Also the air conditioning unit was very noisy.

In an interesting neighbourhood full of many cultures which was fab. There seemed to be a commune or head office for a group of protestors directly across the road from the hotel - the building covered in graffiti and banners but I don't know what they're talking about as I don't speak Spanish. Also next to the hotel there seemed to be a group of kind people who'd set up an eating point for the homeless of the area on the Sunday which was very sweet. Strange to have something do luxurious in such a neighbourhood. The hotel shower is awesome and the room is comfy and modern. I emailed three months in advance via booking.com to request for a room with a double bed and not a twin bed - however on arrival at the hotel we were sent to a room in the fifth floor which had two single beds pushed together. I called down to reception and the rather exasperated receptionist explained that that hotel was full and there wasn't anything she could do. I told her that wasn't good enough as I'd emailed three months before to request a room without beds pushed together - I also requested a room on a high floor (both tips I got from this site) and said I wasn't happy with her answer and tht u would come downstairs and show her he emails from booking.com from her colleague Eli who said that we could have the double bed without an issue providing we arrived early - we got there at 2pm! She relented and asked to call me back. She called back and said she would 'upgrade' us free of charge to a kingsize bed - there are these rooms on all floors however as my boyfriend punted out they had ads on reception offering to upgrade to a kingsize bed on a high floor for an extra 20 euros per night - ridiculous as if you book a double room rather than a twin you should get a double bed. Make sure you email and specify this at you booking so you dont get ripped off. The \"upgraded\" room was smaller than the first however with one big bed rather than two singles! Make sure you get what you pay for as this place isn't cheap and why should you miss out! Only annoying thing in the room is the alarm which flashes all night!

Breakfast is GREAT, though it can get crowded. HUGE variety, definitely worth it. Lounge/restaurant/breakfast area is a fun place to hang out. Design is super cool---there's just no other way to describe it. It's definitely a \"one-of-a-kind\" experience. ROOM Probably not a good place to stay with someone you don't know very well :) The shower is \"integrated\" into the room with fairly transparent glass on both sides. Wonderful \"waterfall\" shower head, though. Cool sliding door for bathroom/closet area. Awkward sink area with no place to put soap. Very comfortable bed, cool lighting, neat electric window curtain (good blackout drapes). GREAT toiletries provided (razor, toothbrush, etc. in addition to the norm), and the Nespresso is a great touch. The room comes with STACKS of information about Barcelona, things to do, and places to eat. The only thing that has me confused is the difference between the \"Deluxe\" and \"Superior\" rooms. I expected my Deluxe to come with a few extra touches, like slippers and bath robes, but they were noticeably absent. So, I'm not sure what \"extras\" I paid for. NEIGHBORHOOD It is in a \"unique\" neighborhood, but it's very convenient to Las Ramblas (10 mins walking). I would say the neighborhood is no less safe than Las Ramblas (watch those wallets and purses!) or a typical ride on the metro. Coming from the US, I find Europe to be much safer in general. Maybe more petty thefts and vagabonds, but definitely no violent crime. That said, Barcelona is probably THE world's worst city for wallet/purse snatchers.

I took my daughter of 9yrs to Barcelona so we could both immerse ourselves in its beautiful architecture. I had been given all the usual scare stories about pick-pockets. And bought a security wallet and took clothing that would not make me look like a tourist ( At least and expensive one!). However, on arrival the place was full of people looking like tourists, carrying Loui bags and nice cloths :( I actually felt a little undressed. I did the usual search on TA to find the hotel with the best reviews within our budget. We both chose the Barcelo Raval because it 1) looked so different 2) close to La Rambla 3) price via Ebookers was unbeatable. On arrival the hotel was just as it looked on the internet. The best part was the 360 degree views from the top of the hotel, with a glass balcony showing images of the sights you should see if you look in a certain direction. My daughter and I loved the querkyness of the hotel. The reception staff and the cleaners were all very helpful and pleasant. The catering staff was different. Day 1 & 2 we had breakfast and a lovely man said we could sit anywhere and my daughter was f.o.c. This was great because neither of us eat a lot in the morning and 18Euros per adult is a lot :). The table staff were not very pleasant and welcoming, they just seemed to ignore you and clear tables. Day 3 the lovely man had gone and was replaced by a lady who told me that I had to pay full price for my daughters breakfast. When I told her that she couldn't do that given we had been charged a different price for the past 2 days, she became very loud and angry and refused to calm down. She was making such a seen, but on principle was not going to accept it. I went to reception and told them how she had behaved and they told me not to worry and they would sort it. Bless them they did and we got the same price but she made us feel uncomfortable which was unprofessional. I would recommend the hotel but not for children on a long stay. Despite the location which was only a very short walk to La Rambla, the hotel is for adults. Children need space and an indoor pool (at that time of year). Food in Barcelona wasn't geared towards children. I didn't find a single restaurant that offered a kids menu! The hotel did offer concessions for children but it was adult food and not fun food kids enjoy on holiday. Places to visit - We did all the Gaudi stuff, the beach and port, Barcelona Cathedral, Music/Oprah Tours and Picasso. Places were expensive to visit and it was a shame that more places didn't offer free admission for children under 11yrs. There was so much more we wanted to do, so I think another trip will be on the cards when my daughter is older. Would I recommend the hotel? Yes for adults Would I recommend Barcelona? Yes Did I find it expensive? Very I hope you find this helpful!

The area... same as some people have said before, we made the mistake of coming out the hotel and turning right down the first road, to start with it was fine but it led to an area which clearly was at night time the almost red light district road... women clearly ready and waiting for the police to disappear so they can start business early (it was only about 4pm and they were already waiting for 'customers' - dont let this put you off, we didn't, we just went straight out the hotel, walked forwards down past the little bars and restaurants then turned right at the end, shops all along the road, keep going for quite a while and you end up on a side road that then joins \"las ramblas\" this is where the street performers etc are, and many shops, restaurants etc, this also leads to the square where the 'tourist bus' departs every day. Safety: everyone we had spoken to about Barcelona had warned us about pick-pockets and thieves etc. We went prepared (purses inside a bag that has an inner zip and a travel wallet that has a chain you can clip to something else but I have to say we didn't notice anyone trying at all but there are old ladies going around asking for money but ignore them and they go away. Travel: there are two companies that do a 'tourist open top' type bus, we used the one called 'tourist bus' they run three main lines of buses, blue, red and green. Tip... buy your ticket first along \"las ramblas\" then join the que waiting for the bus, this que is because although there are LOTS of buses, everyone waits for the upstairs open deck to be free, dont do this, get on when they come along saying anyone for downstairs, then the first stop people get off, anyone downstairs gets asked if they want to go upstairs now before the new people get on.... we found this bus was a great way to get around, metro maybe cheaper but wasn't wanting to be constantly checking my bag wasn't being robbed as most of the thieving seemed to be happening on the metro itself. On the bus make sure you do things in order on the route, I made the mistake of getting the bus not thinking about the fact that the one attraction we wanted to do (zoo) was towards the end of the route and so taxi would have been a better idea but instead we had to wait on the route for 2.5 hours till we got there....oppps!!! :( Finally.... Hotel! This hotel is super modern and funky, some may say tacky but I thought it was expensive enough a feeling to not cross that line. Nearly everything is, black, white, pink or green...and 'different'/ 'funky' enough that I felt the need to photo it, even the lights etc are 'cool' staff seemed friendly enough to me, though didn't need to speak to many. The rooms are lovely, bright and clean... minor negatives... unless we were being stupid, I dont think you could actually put the plug on the sink in so you can fill it but could be wrong, also the shower, its amazing but you really need to be close to the person your sharing with as although the side is frosted in places you can still pretty much see the other person. Great for couples but maybe awkward for a friends trip away. Overall I loved this trip, barcelona and the hotel...

We ate right outside the hotel at several outdoor restaurants and the employees of the restaurants look out for their patrons. One employee noticed a woman had her purse on the ground and he requested she better secure it. Another employee pointed out a purse thief to us. They know what is going on and who is a thief. We received excellent service here as well. The employees at the Barcelo Raval will offer you for purchase a hop on/off voucher, and am I happy they did. This was a wonderful service and experience.

We started our day with the breakfast buffet at the hotel and we were both very pleased with the selections they offer. This is a wonderful hotel with wonderful service.

This hotel is located about a 5 minute walk away from Las Ramblas, the main drag in Barcelona. While the location is great for those of you who favor being out to all hours and soaking in the sights and sounds of Barcelona at night, my wife and I were disappointed in our stay and glad to check out so that we didn't have to stay another evening in the Del Raval neighbourhood. It's not that it is particularly unsafe, it's that it makes you feel uneasy. It could be the walk down C/Hospitalier to Las Ramblas at dusk or when you are returning late at night, or it could be the scores of sketchy looking people dotting the street, the stray dogs or the children running around with no parents and/or Islamic men in full gear staring at you or yelling at each other, but it just has a funny vibe. Nothing ever happened to me or my wife while we were there, but there was just something about the neighbourhood that made us walk quicker and breathe a sigh of relief when we were inside the hotel for the night. Hotel The hotel itself is extremely clean and well-appointed for the price point. I think it is trying for an ultra-modern/futuristic vibe because the lighting throughout the hotel seems to be all pink or silver, and the furniture in the rooms itself (while comfortable) looks like something out of a 2030 version of the IKEA catalogue. Rooms were very clean and the housekeeping staff obviously do an excellent job of keeping everything spotless. Truly, well done!! My only gripe with the hotel (aside from the neighbourhood) is the staff. Surly is the word that most quickly comes to mind. Julian on the front desk during check-in and check-out seemed to be in a bad mood. Not sure what was wrong with him, but perhaps a smile might be in order considering he is the first person you see when you walk in. But lest you think I am picking on him, let me assure you that his attitude and complete lack of helpfulness is shared by all the men and women who man that front desk. They can't be bothered to help and they seem to resent if you have the gall to ask them if they speak English. Oh well. My dealings with them were few and far between and of that, I am glad. I am also not sure who the older men in the sports jackets standing just inside the front door were supposed to be -- if they were security, they should a) get off their cell phone and b) dress more professionally. There was always at least one of these guys standing just inside the door -- who were they? I have no idea. They didn't offer to take our bags or help us with anything, and they sure didn't do much beyond yap on their cell phones or talk to the front desk clerk. The hotel also has a nice terrace -- and a very VERY small pool on the same level. Nice view but if I want an even better view, I'll go up to Montjuic. Overall, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay that is reasonably priced only minutes away from Barcelona's version of Times Square, then this is the place for you. However, if you are uncomfortable in neighbourhoods that are best described as sketchy and have an issue with surly, cranky staff, then please stay elsewhere.

It boasts amazing facilities and technology - a touch pad on the bed head controls the lighting, opens/closes curtains, controls heating and the iPod dock is also a nice touch. We were upgraded to the next room category and as soon as you walk into the room you will be impressed by the stylish, modern design. The showers are massive and the frosted glass does allow some privacy. The 360 degree views are fantastic as are the $10 euro mojitos. The swimming pool is tiny, however as a place to cool down the size is adequate. There is also a gym on the ground level, however we did not use this. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to La Rambla- Barcelo Raval is about a 20 min taxi ride to the airport and costs around $25-30 euros. We stayed at Barcelo twice- one booking for 3 nights and the next for 1 night. During the first stay the sliding door was damaged and toilet seat wobbly. We had to contact reception twice for help in resolving the sliding door issue. The hotel kindly compensated us with $10 euros worth of minibar, which was an appreciated token! On our second stay the lights in the bed head remained permanently on which was a little annoying having purple lights above your head when you are trying to sleep! Given that we returned to the hotel so late at night and were only there for 1 night we didn't bother contacting reception. We did advise them at checkout so hopefully they had a chance to rectify the issue before the next guest! Overall we would recommend this hotel to others- we paid about $155au p/night and felt that it was good value. I would however question some of the quality checks on the rooms as I would have expected staff to have noticed the broken sliding door, wobbly toilet seat and faulty lights on the bed head.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, England", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and comfortable.\u201d", "Author": "denshires", "ReviewID": "UR117397087", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights.

It's 5 minutes walk to the Ramblas, 10 to Plaza Catalunya. It has a big, 360 degree roof terrace which provided a welcome breeze. 'Swimming pool' is not what I'd call the pond on the roof. It's more a splash pool, but there were people taking advantage of it. We didn't go up there at night, when I'm sure it really comes into its own. Only two lounge chairs as far as we could see, otherwise it's sitting upright on a stool or on some rather uncomfy benches. Nice to have though.

I was a little nervous about the location of this hotel in the Raval neighborhood after reading some not so nice descriptions of it here on TA. The Raval is somewhat seedy, with some decidedly lower class looking Arabs and prostitutes mulling about, but there were many people on the streets at all times, and some street sense, we were not afraid to walk on any of the streets at all. (Well, my wife wasn\u2019t thrilled with it, but I had no issues walking thru the streets of the Raval.) You can tell that this area is undergoing a gentrification, and there were many women walking alone and also women with small children, so I felt perfectly safe here. The area is also a 5-minute walk to the Ramblas, so it was pretty convenient. The hotel itself is very modern, perhaps un-necessarily Euro-trendy, but the staff was courteous (and the woman who checked us in spoke English, which we didn't find all over Spain). Read some other reviews here about the lack of privacy in the bath area; I am married, so that wasn't a huge problem, but if you are a family or 2 friends, this lack of privacy could be a problem. The lighting is as other have described... not very much light in the room; hard to read. The TV was good... although we just had it on to catch up on CNN Int'l. There were a couple of electric outlets right under the TV on the wall...easy access for my electronic gear. I've been in hotels where the access to electric outlets is difficult, and you wind up plugging in behind the desk or bed, and then forget your charger when you check out! There is a Nespresso coffee maker in the room as well as a mini bar (we did not partake of the mini bar, and the La Boqueria market place is 5 minutes away, so we brought back fruit and water, etc to the room) There is also a little grocery store across the Rambla de Raval right outside the hotel. The lobby has two iMacs with internet, and there is also free wifi available. It was easy to stay connected to email, facebook, etc. We did not eat in the hotel, although the restaurant area looked very nice... there is just too many less expensive options for meals in Barcelona. The rooftop observation deck gives you a beautiful panoramic view of the city, and the pool is very very small, but there were people sitting there every time I was up there. I think the hotel caters to a young crowd; it appeared we were the oldest people here, but there were plenty of young people milling about. That's not a negative, but just my perception.

The hotel itself is very contemporary; everything you see from the website. My partner and I weren't particularly fans of our room though. There is no bathroom as such, with the shower being next to the bed and the toilet enclosed in very thin walls. The beds are comfy enough though, and it was clean.

My taxi driver warned me to keep a good grip on my bags as I got out, and that's good advice anywhere in Barcelona, and especially in the Raval. If you are prepared and aware, you'll be OK.

We did not take advantage of the rooftop terrace and pool although I am sure the view from there would be fantastic. Warning the rooms are very high tech - you have to use buttons to open and close the curtains and the lights take some working out as does the airconditioning which we never mastered. The coffe machine in the room was a bonus especially for a Spanish hotel and coffee was free. i would stay there again but probably with my spouse due to the lack of privacy.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest rooftop view of Barcelona,cool Hotel- Poor location\u201d", "Author": "MissFish_11", "ReviewID": "UR107132274", "Content": "El Raval- is the red light area, with a high crime rate! just avoid the street adjacent to the hotel (San Rafeal & the area around St Augsti- use common sense & be cautious at night!

The staff were nice and approachable, the restaurant there as you would expect is very expensive. the equivalent could easily be found down some side streets for a better price. there is also a nice panoramic view on the roof top on floor eleven. Moving to the room. We were placed on the 9th floor facing the street. On first impressions the room looked clean, with impressive large windows. The bed was comfortable. However everything was white which within a few hrs of staying there attracts all the dirt (not a problem as the cleaners do a great job). When you turn on the lights on at night, for some reason they have put pink LED's above the bed which makes the room look part of the red light district! You can hear some of the street level noise and noise of your neighbours entering and leaving their rooms, but didn\u2019t find this much of a problem. The main point which I would like to point out to those considering staying at the hotel is that there is no privacy from the bed room to the shower!! there is no real screen between the bed and the shower unit and you can easily see your room mate shower whilst laying in bed.. I don't know if this was only my room, and I was staying with my girlfriend which wasn't a problem. But it would make things very awkward if I was staying with my parents or colleges!! The toilet also nearby had a sliding door with no lock and didn't close completely... so if you would like to have complete privacy, I would take this into consideration.

The location of this hotel is very central and close to most things, however it is in the middle of the red light district! It can be a bit daunting when walking to the centre, passing all the sights. The hotel itself is ultra modern and trendy, with a dark reception area flecked with bright vibrant colours. Our room was a double and was a decent size. The views were good, although much better from the 360 viewing space at the top of the hotel. Much of our view consisted of looking at the local accomdoation across the street! The shower cubicle is in the centre of the room and it is supurb! Very large, room for more than 2 people! It is powerful and probably the best shower ive had. Although the layout of the room was trndy and modern, it left a lot to be desired. There were few plug sockets where you actually needed them, and this caused the room to be entangled with wires when one of us was ironing and the other doing hair. There is one central surface in the room, which is where the sink is and this is also cluttered with a coffee machine, and toilettries. This is the area where the hair dryer is and main lit mirror and this fast became a nightmare, with lotions and potions falling all over the place. The lighting in the room was quite poor as well. It was flecked with funky pink strip lighting around the bed, and lights aroun the mirror, but the room was quite dark. Ventilation and the air conditioning was also poor. The air con would only go to 17 and the room was boiling during the night. Would have loved to have been able to open the window, but the doors coul not be opened, and in the morning they would be fully steamed up. There was no extractor fan from the toilet and shower area, and again this caused the room to be hot and steamy. There was a tv and ipod docking station/radio in the bedroom, and although our coffee machine leaked everywhere it was a great idea and far better than having to boil a kettle. Breakfast was fantastic, with plenty of choice, from fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereal to cooked bacon and sausages and lush scrambled egg. The breakfast staff were great too, very accomodating and friendly.

So on to the room, the design of which uses modern styling to try and hide the fact that it is essentially very small. The shower was opposite the wardrobe so getting dressed often meant wet feet/socks, and the \"desk\" was just about big enough to put a laptop on, but certainly not comfortable enough to work at for any period of time.

We were on the 7th floor. What we were looking for was somewhere to recover from the festival antics, be comfortable & relaxed in stylish surroundings and be in a good location to explore the city - the Barcelo Raval delivered on everything we wanted. The rooms are spotlessly clean, the beds are super comfy and you get plenty of pillows & duvets. The shower - although probably not everyone's taste - is a glass box in the middle of the room! It has a giant rain style head, really powerful and we never had any problems with water temperature at any time of the day. You get a coffee machine in your room which is a lovely touch & there is a mini bar (although as expected it's very expensive). The rooms were cleaned everyday & if you needed new towels these were provided. We ate at the hotel restaurant once and i must say it was really tasty - but quite expensive. We also used the room service once for a few tapas items & found that to be good but also again quite expensive. The best thing about this hotel undoubtedly is the roof top. We spent every evening after a day of sightseeing sitting up there having a cocktail (10 euros) or a few glass of Cava (4 Euros) until the sun went down. It's a 360 degree roof terrace so you can see all across Barcelona - beautiful! There is a small pool on the roof, not great for swimming but perfect for a quick dip to cool off. We didn't use the pool as we were too busy exploring the city. There is also sun loungers on the roof. I really liked the area that the hotel was in, it was lovely walking through the lanes in the day & going to the fruit market in the morning. It's so central and close to La Ramblas. However, it goes without saying that you need to keep your wits about you after dark. We later found out that a guy we met at the festival was mugged at knife point & had his passport stolen very close to the hotel one evening. Pickpocketing is also rife in the area & Barcelona in general really, shop keepers, hotel staff & taxi drivers were always kindly reminding you to watch your bags. The safest & simple thing to do is jump in a taxi to & from the hotel at night...it's no problem to do, there is always taxis in the square or the hotel reception will call you one and when you get home in the evening there is always someone on the door of the hotel to escort you in. Every taxi driver we used knew the hotel, if your Spanish, like ours is not great, we found that just giving taxi drivers the business card to the hotel worked and we never had any problems.

Staying here for a weekend is fine but by the end of the stay, we had enough of the dim / coloured lights in the room and lobby. Rooftop bar is great - fantastic views from here and the bar faced south so can catch some sun in the evning while having a drink. The swimming pool is more like a paddling pool and it's not heated. We didn't use it but if you were staying in Barcelona in the hot summer, i think you'd appriciate a cold dip to cool down. Breakfast was ok, plenty of choice of fruit, coat meats, cheese, bread, pastries and fruit juice. Hot 'English' breakfast was ok but if I was to stay here again, I would have opted to have room only rather than B&B. 22 euro is a LOT for breakfast where there are plenty of little cafes around the Raval de Ramblas open early in the morning for a coffee and pasty for 6 euro. Staff were good at the hotel but the kitchen staff could be better - friendly staff at reception, fast check in and very helpful in getting a doctor for us as my boyfriend had food poisoning (stay away from the Taller de Tapas restaurants). However, the kitchen staff could have been a bit more helpful as we asked for some plain rice (doctors orders) but couldn't prepare any for us. Also, no low fat milk or yogurt at brekfast time. So I do question if they prepare food there from scrtach or is all ready meals. Location of the hotel is brilliant, very central and easy to get from Liceu stop. However, we prefered using the Paral.lel stop as we found the walk there faster and more pleasent. The hotel is located in a multicultural area of Barcelona so the locals are mostly Asian/Arabian. Plenty of bars and cafes in the Raval de Ramblas so don't have to venture far from the hotel for something to eat or drink in the evening.

First thing to note, if you are carrying lots of luggage do take a cab on arrival (either direct from airport or from Placa Catalunya where the airport bus drops you) as although the walk from Placa Cataluyna is very short with luggage we quickly became rather hot!! However that aside the location is excellent, less than 5 minutes walk from Las Rambles but fair enough away that you're not quite in the constant hussle and bussle. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted with a smile and checked in quickly and efficiently. We were also given a map of the local area and shown the routes to walk if we wanted to avoid the nearby red light area. We did in fact walk through that area one early evening but were not given any hassle, although women alone may find it slightly intimidating. However I found the location superb, we were right on the square of Raval so easy access to an early evening or late night drink. Our room was very modern and clean with lots of nice goodies - coffee machine, well-stocked mini bar and a nice selection of complementary toiletries. The bathroom/toilet set up is slightly unusual and probably not well suited to non-couples or those who are a little on the prudish side! However, we had no issues with this and the shower was really good. The beds were also very comfortable, although was a shame it was two twins rather than a double. The curtains were electronic (button by the bed) and blocked out the light excellently. We didn't try the food in the hotel - too many other places to visit - but we did have a few drinks on the rooftop bar, which was a lovely place to enjoy a glass of cava whilst the sun sets. Beware it does get very busy in the evening and so the queue does mean waiting sometimes, also they don;t sell bottles of wine/cava, which is a shame as it would mean less need to queue again. The pool is teeny - not large enough to swim in but a good spot to cool off. My boyfriend said the gym was well equipped and very quiet.

I've grown to like the Raval, the district where this hotel is located, and on previous visits watched as this hotel was developed so I was keen to stay there. I wasn't disappointed at all - I would say this is the best chain hotel I've stayed in Barcelona. It could probably be described as a design hotel - the building itself is an unusual piece of modern architecture, the rooms and public areas certainly have interesting decor. I'm not generally a fan of this type of design - but nothing here is unpleasant and nothing detracts from comfort. Whilst not enormous the room itself was very comfortable. Large comfortable bed with good linen, excellent shower, flat screen tv, reliable fast wifi and two really useful more unusual features - the iPod dock and the Nespresso machine. The rooftop bar has wonderful 360 degree views of the city and is a pleasant place for a sunset drink. I can't comment on any further food or drink, as even for breakfast I always go out in Barcelona - there are so many great places to go (try Bar Kasparo for breakfast) Staff in this hotel were friendly and helpful. The hotel is not cheap, but few hotels in Barcelona are, and this is certainly comparable with others for what you get. As a district some people will be put off by the Raval. But I find its mix of traditional working class, Asian immigrants, red-light district, artists and young professionals quite exciting, a place of real character. The Rambla de Raval, where the hotel is, is one of the great streets of the city even if only 10 years old. More and more tourists are discovering the Raval too, though its still a world away from the main tourist places (even though only a 5 minute walk from the Ramblas) You need to be careful walking around any area in Barcelona, including this one.

Our first afternoon here we mistakenly took a right after exiting our hotel and ended up on hooker row. No joke, I would say there were easily between 10-20 hookers in the alley right behind our hotel.

Needless to say, we don't feel safe here and feel even more uncomfortable at night. Also, this morning we had the pleasure to wake up to police, ambulances and firetrucks outside our window and the street was being hosed down. The hotel is also lacking some sound-proofing. We can hear ever word being said outside from seven floors up as well as from room to room and in the halls. The cleaning crew moves the metal bed frames on the tile floors when they clean which makes a loud screeching sound that is impossible to sleep through. Another thing that could be improved is the customer service. We bought a couple bottles of wine and called down to see if they could bring up a corkscrew and a bucket of ice. They told us we had to come down and get it from the restaurant. When we came down to get it they told us they don't have corkscrews to loan out or buckets of ice. Then the guy (who was very nice) looked around and found us a corkscrew that was left behind by another patron. It was filthy and we had to wash it off in our room with bar soap.

The light in the room live its own life but we were able to deal with it. Unfortunately our room was on the 3 floor, so the view from the room was not fantastic (on the neighboring building).

We reached the lobby and gave us a good impression. We had problems with the booking but the hotel staff member reassured us and it was fixed within 10 minutes. There were also two iMacs for free use. I had no laptop, but a phone with WiFi, only it did not connect because he could not get an IP address. Once in our room, the luxury exudes from it. Nice shower and sink, all things design. The curtains can be opened with a control on the side of the bed. I think the idea of the bathroom (wc) door is also very nice designed. The important thing was that it was very clean. When cleaning, I came inside and saw the girl, even scrubbing the shower. The only flaw I found that the LEDs above the bed can not turn off, only if you turn off all lights and want to sleep in complete darkness. The fitness centre was also very nice. What I recommend to everyone, is to visit the 360 degrees terrace. The view is very beautiful, and you can relax there (benches and a bar) One evening we had dinner at the restaurant of the hotel, it was delicious. The price was high, but that's to be expected. My mother also enjoyed the Nespresso, and I enjoyed the Ipod dock. Before I was booking this hotel, I read many reviews on the negative points about the neighborhood. It turnt out better than expected. The hotel employee gave us a map (nice of her) and showed us the path we must not take in the evening (Carrer l'Hospital) but we had to walk through Carrer del Carme.

Most of these are either hugely overpriced or are of low quality / located in old buildings where one can hardly sleep based on the reviews. Barcelo Raval has been chosen based on its location (reasonably close to Rambla and other places of interest) and modern design. Despite of few issues we liked our stay. The delux room was modern and clean, although I appreciate that some people might not like the design at all. The toilet and bath are split, which is unusual for a hotel. There is no normal bathroom but just an isolated area in the corner of the room with a bath. Being on the bed you can't see a person taking a shower due to one-side mirror, but I understand comments from people who found this to be a major issue while sharing a room with someone you are not used to see naked :). Ok for couples, but not for sisters/brothers and sons/moms. The staff was nice and helpful enough (almost felt in love with nice-looking lady at the reception :), room was clean, location - up to expectations. Great views from the terrace. Never tried their breakfast which appears to be pricy. Good free wifi in rooms. Big in-room safety box for free. I've read reviews claiming the area to be unsafe, but had no such feeling. Till quite late all surrounding streets are full of tourists. Few issues on the negative site: 1/ Although we've asked for a standard room with a king-size bed, while checking in the lady at reception claimed that they have 2 beds options only. As this made us very unhappy, she kindly offered as an upgrade to delux for free (room 711). We were pleased to accept, though later realised this to be a trick :). As I mentioned the room was good enough, and king-size bed actually great, but due to some technical issue lights in the room could not be switched off at night unless you deal with the main tumbler. The issue is that it also turns off air con as well ... so you have a choice - whether to sleep with a light and air con or with no light but no air con as well. As we stayed in May it was not really an issue, but people may really suffer in July or August. I suspect this is something unfixable (at least they couldn't have it fixed for 5 nights we stayed there), thus they propose the room as a free upgrade. 2/ Sound-proofness between rooms is ok, however, when someone openes a door to the next room, you can hear that very well. The windows have a poor sound-proofness, and you can hear lot's of noise from the street despite of the 7th floor. 3/ I'm not sure what is the reason for putting a metal net on the whole building, but it does not add design value at all. If the purpose was to improve privacy in rooms, may I recommend one-side windows. 4) Slippers in rooms would not hurt as the floor is actually quite cold. Guess this is easy to fix in 4 star hotel as this is a low cost. None of the above has spoiled our 5 days stay, thus I may generally recommend the hotel at least to couples.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kilkenny", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, wrong location\u201d", "Author": "MackKilkenny", "ReviewID": "UR64835352", "Content": "You just can't build a top class hotel in one of the roughest parts of Barcelona and expect to rejuvenate the area.

The room was much bigger than I expected and I really liked the open plan bathroom. Really suited us as a couple, but may not suit if your travelling with a friend or family member. I loved the electronic curtains, infact I loved everything! There is a couple of different light settings which allow you to change the lights to your preference (night/day/only a little light). The view from the top floor terrace is amazing, you can actually see the whole of Barcelona and there are binnoculars/telescopes to let you get an even closer view. The pool on the top floor is pretty small but it seems more like an area to chill out with some cocktails rather than a full day of sunbathing. We stayed on the 4th floor and there was a little outside noise at night time, but Im quite a light sleeper and it never really kept me awake (It wasn't loud enough to complain about or ruin your holiday). There is a DJ that plays every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night in the lobby. He was very arty, reminded me of someone you'd see in the Glasgow Artschool and he played a good mix of funk and motown. Was a nice atmosphere for a few final drinks before retiring to bed. The alcohol prices may seem quite expensive but every bar we went to throughout the city was the same. The cheapest we paid for two drinks was 15euros and that was in the Hardrock Cafe. There is a nice Italian restaurant a couple of doors up from the hotel which served really good pizza and pasta. Now onto the area: I was really worried that we would be intimidated when leaving the hotel but I must say that our experience was the complete opposite. We weren't walking about any later than 12pm so perhaps it is different after then but before this time we never seen one prostitute and we never got hassled. As for the drug dealers, you get them in every part of the city (whether it be Las Ramblas, Barri Gottic, Raval, etc) but they didn't hassle us and were actually pretty friendly. The area really isn't that bad, I was quite shocked to hear some people's views on it because alot of Barcelona has original run-down looking streets, its part of Barcelona's character. The location was perfect. It is about 7min walk to the centre of Las Ramblas and it's pretty much a straight road, just ask reception for directions. Beware of the over-pricing taxi drivers!!! Ours bumped us of atleast 10euros in the ride from the bus station to the hotel. It should cost about 12/13euros max and that's including the supplement charge so ask them before you get into a taxi. Anymore than the 15 mark, they are extremely overcharging! We got charged 23euros going and 12euros returning after the hotel receptionist said it shouldn't be anymore than 12, so do watch out! Overall, I'll definitely be returning. I absolutely love Barcelona and I'm so glad I found this hotel that has so much charm and beauty to it, yet is much more reasonably priced than the other hotels on Las Ramblas.

Rooms also have ipod/iphone dock to enjoy your favourite tunes. Lobby bar service was indifferent, but with a city like Barcelona on your doorstep, who wants to loiter in the lobby?

We stayed at the Omm in Eixample for the first half. Overall, the affordability, convenience to Old City sights, and visual style of the Barcelo were superior to the more expensive Omm. However, the Omm offered more perks and more luxurious digs. I'd recommend the Barcelo Raval to folks that want a trendy, boutique-style hotel experience that is near all the sights but off the main tourist beaten path. Folks have said that the location is a bit dodgy so I wanted to address that. The location, in El Raval, is a more working class residential area with actual Barcelonans around and the shops and restaurants they patronize. After basking in the golden glow of Eixample for a few days, this was a great change of pace. We always felt safe in the area around the hotel, which is on a wide, boisterous street with a plaza that has a market on the weekend. You're only about a 10 minute walk from the Ramblas. The buildings and shops are a bit more run-down that those in El Born or La Ribera, but the streets are just as cute and winding. Nearby you'll find an entire street of vintage clothing boutiques and some good Pakistani food. You won't find any gourmet restaurants or high-end shops, but there are plenty of little dive bars and bodegas. The very large hotel itself was very stylish in appearance, though a bit of an eyesore from the outside. There's a rooftop terrace that offers an excellent, 360-degree view of the city. In the summer, the pool up there would be quite sweet. There's a gym, which seemed very nice with some cardio machines and free weights. The B-lounge on the ground floor is the hotel's restaurant/bar. It seemed a bit like an afterthought. There was a DJ spinning dance music there a few nights, but no one dancing. With all of the restaurants in the Old City and great South Asian restaurants nearby, there isn't much reason to eat the hotel. There's also a bunch of grocery stores close by if you want to grab some food and chill in your room and watch some bad TV shows. The rooms were fine overall: Pros: free wireless Internet, cool electronics, and an exquisite rainfall shower. Cons: annoying pink room lighting, windows do not open, weird perfume-y fragrance throughout hotel, and the rooms offer no privacy at all (Rooms would be bad for families, coworkers, friends, or any other folks that require some privacy from one another. The shower is towards the center of the room in a glass booth--so your roommates have a front row seat to you soaping up. Only the toilet room, which is about the size of an airplane bathroom, offers privacy.) There are no service frills to this hotel. No turn-down service, bell-hops, or friendly front desk greeters. The staff do not seem particularly accommodating and I'd fear what would happen if something went wrong in a room. Overall, if you are looking for a trendy, boutique-style hotel with no frills in an area that is off the beaten path, then the Raval is a reasonable option--if you can get a good price. Families, coworkers, and friends that aren't so close should stay elsewhere.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg", "Title": "\u201cstylish hotel, unsafe area, not much service\u201d", "Author": "Hamburger_Deern", "ReviewID": "UR48905682", "Content": "We were a group of 5 people (family) and stayed over the weekend.

The hotel was clean and the beds were very comfortable, so sleeping there was fine! Be aware of the area... The area around the hotel is a little strange, narrow streets with prostitution and drugdealing also during the day. However, it is very centrally located, it is walking distance to Las Ramblas. Service really needs improvement. When we arrived we asked specifically for non-smoking rooms. We were told that non-smoking rooms where only avalable in 2 hours. When we came back, we were given smoking rooms.We decided to keep the rooms because it did not smell so badly. At 6 o clock in the morning the alarm clock went on that the guest the night before had used. I would expect that this would be one of the things a maid checks and switches off when she does the room. I had trouble dealing with this high-end-tech-thing that I wasn't able to switch it off so tired I was! In the morning we realised the hairdryer did not work. We complained at the reception and waited but the hairdryer never came. We went down for breakfast with wet hair and even after we came back still no hairdryer. We complained again and when we came back at night, we had a hairdryer but it was not working at full speed and was smelling like burned plastic. Breakfast is not to be recommended. The price they charge is too high. There was chaos in the breakfast room, dirty dished piling up, the buffet empty, no coffee, the eggs that we ordered were cold. When we complained we were not charged for beakfast which was a nice gesture. But what also counts is how a message is delivered and most of the staff hardly ever smiles!

We had ample space for 2 people to move around. Everything in the room is electronic, including the control for opening the curtains (which took us a few minutes to realize). It was very dark and quiet. There was an LCD tv and an Ipod docking station. The hotel staff was helpful and accomodating when we originally requested a room on a higher floor.

The only negatives that I would have to say are that the hotel is in a semi-shady part of town on Ramblas de Raval. It is on a main street that is large, but to get here from Las Ramblas you have to walk down smaller streets that can definitely be a little sketchy at night, depending on which street you walk down, there are lots of prostitutes. There is a good police presence though and as long as you have your wits about you, it's fine. Also, the bathroom is not in a separate room but partially in the room. The shower was right next to the bed and you can pretty much here everything that goes on in the room with the toilet, so if you're shy around the person that you're going with, it may not be the best choice to share a room.

Absolutely loved it. We met up with some locals and they told us that the area was indeed where some prossies USED to hang out but police had been trying to emliminate it as it's an area definately up and coming. The Raval area was well lite and again did see lots of police patrolling at night. I might have come across a couple of more questionable characters loitering late at night but not once I felt I was in any danger. Rambla del Raval (where the cat is - yes huge back cat sculpture - should you get lost) is just off the main La Rambla but more local I felt and surrounded by lots of eartern asian restaurants and stores as well as bars which open till very late at night - everything was just a short walking distance away - very convenient, yet not manic like La Rambla. The hotel was very new and it was built from scratch, finished last year I was told. It was quite special. It is a circular building (11/F) and wrapped round by a 'cage' so you can't see into the rooms from outside. Inside was very modern and brand spanking new. Receiption staff were friendly and everyone looked beautiful. We were given a room on the 3rd floor (rooms on higher floors were delux rooms, suites etc) and I thought it was going to be noisy - but no, I don't recall any noisy at all! The room numbers were projected onto the floor in the corridor and doors are unlocked by scanning rather than inserting the card - pretentious but loved it. The room was quite 'open-plan'. You walk into the room and toilet and storage/safe etc were next to the door. Movable partition for closing the toilet door. But as soon as you walk into the room, straight away you see a mirror hanging over a sink in the middle with coffee machine on the other side and minibar underneath it. Shower right next to it and it's glass door and partition separating from the bed area. So if you are with just a friend, it could be quite odd. Otherwise it's quite nice and romantic. The bed area was spacious but the 'double bed' was two beds put together which is one thing I never particularly liked. Not sure if they did do one double bed in other rooms though. Buttons to draw/open the curtains to a ceiling to floor windows. Big enough LCD TV with many many channels. Just a little desk underneath the TV that can be moved around. Had an iPod with me so was glad to see a dock for it! Two minor complaints, because of the glass windows, room can get very hot during the day and felt a/c wasn't powerful enough. Also, doors are literally right next to each other so you could hear people openning their doors and wake you up. I could pick up free Wifi from our room too but no sure if it's the same on higher floors. Gym was very very spacious and had a few machines and they were all new and of latest models. It also had a sauna. There was a overhead shower area with quite a few settings which was fun. A separate gents and ladies shower/bathroom with lockers for your valuables. Sounds good enough? Wait until to go up to the roof-top lounge. There was, as one of other reviewer described, oversized tub which no one used and drinks were way overprized. But what you have is a 360 panoramic view of the city and at night it was stunning and utterly romantic. We stood there mesmorizing and chatting for an hour without realising it. I just loved it. The neighbourhood might not be of everyone's taste but for a young couple wanting a romantic city break but with a budget, this is a good as you can get.

If I go back to Barca (or should I say 'when' I go back) I would definitely consider staying in this hotel again because it was lovely and really added a special touch to our trip. It wouldn't be to everyone's taste as it has a very modern, almost futuristic feel to it. The decor is gorgeous - both minimalist and over the top at the same time, which helps to avoid that cold atmosphere which some modern hotels have. The bright pink walls, horse lamp and silver pigs on the tables in the lobby are all examples of the love it or hate it appeal of this place! As you head further up you can get a great view of the city from the rooftop, where there is also a small pool and bar. We didn't use these as it was too chilly in January, but they seemed quite nice. The pool definitely isn't big enough to do laps but would be great to cool down on hotter days. There are three room types available - superior, deluxe and junior suites. We booked a superior but were upgraded to a deluxe by the lovely hotel staff when they learnt that the holiday had been a surprise Xmas gift. The deluxe rooms are slightly larger and higher up than the superiors, offering a great view over the city. Some people have criticised the view but I thought it was brilliant. At the end of the day, you are in a city and shouldn't expect to see expanses of trees or beaches, although you can see the coast from some rooms (we were amongst the lucky). The room itself was very comfortable and the bed was hands-down the best bed I've ever slept in in a hotel! We had lovely thick quilts which kept us warm in the slightly chillier evenings. The shower was another great feature - a waterfall shower that falls straight down onto you and is surrounded by glass with strategically placed frosting. The shower would admittedly make life a little harder if you aren't particularly close to your room buddies, but as a couple it's one of the best things about the place :) Another lovely little extra was the Tassimo coffee-maker in the room, which is free to use and gets restocked every day. Don't go near the mini-bar, it'll cost you the earth! The location overall was pretty good - Barca is so well connected by the underground tubes that it never takes very long to get anywhere. Some people apparently had breakfast bundles left on their door handle each morning, but we didn't sign up for those and really didn't miss them as there are some great little places to eat not too far from the hotel. There are supermerkats round the corner and plenty of great bars just outside the hotel in the Ramblas. Some people have expressed discomfort with the diversity of characters in the Ramblas area, but we loved the atmosphere, which is quite relaxed and a little bohemian. At night you may well notice ladies offering their business, and some even approached us, but we found that a simple 'no' and shake of the head sent them away, so it didn't bother us at all. There are so many good things I could say about this hotel and so many wonderful little finds when you explore, but I don't want to go into any more detail because discovering the place for yourself is half the fun.

The only other staff that I saw were one or two staff at the reception desk, who would not even make a recommendation for a local restaurant. The rooftop pool and deck are a narrow sliver along the edge of the roof, the pool no more than a large whirlpool. The rooftop bar was never open during my stay. The rooms were a very interesting design which, as an architect, I generally liked. The bathrooms are completely open to the bedrooms, so if privacy is an issue you should not stay here.

The location is good, in a largely residential area, and very close to the Ramblas, less than five minutes walk. There are a few bars/restaurants on the square that the hotel is on which are mainly used by locals so a lot more reasonably priced than those on the Ramblas and the other tourist areas. For an excellent restaurant try Ra which is to the back of the market off the Ramblas, again mainly used by locals not tourists it is well priced and the food is excellent - but you do need to book. Barcelona is an amazing city which never fails to disappoint whether for sight seeing, shopping, food and drink, or just chilling out.

And finally although I read the reviews about the area being a bit dodgy, I didn't think it really would be (after all I come from south London round the corner from Brixton) - but I have to say I found it surprisingly edgy and didn't feel at all comfortable wandering around it at night.

But it won't be! To make a long story short, the hotel is fabulous, its security not so... You see, someone stole a handbag of ours at the hotel's lobby, right under the nose of the security manager who was present at the time... Part 1: The room We made the reservation through barcelonahotels.es back in late August and took advantage of the hotel's amazing opening offer that gave us a double room with 40% discount. We booked our room for seven nights in Christmas. We arrived late in the afternoon of our arrival day (a piece of advice to travelers using the Metro: although it will take you everywhere in Barcelona, it's not the best way to travel when you're carrying a lot of luggage like we did; the escalators usually go only one way and there's a lot of stairs to climb up or down). The staff was very kind and spoke very well English so we were in our room on the fourth floor within minutes. The room had a big double bed. It was the best bed we've slept on! Very big, very comfortable with very comfy cushions, pillows and a great quilt. The room itself is fairly comfortable. It's rather big, with a huge window-wall. On the room's desk, under the television set, there were many guidebooks of Barcelona, so you needn't worry about buying one: you'll find all the info you want right there. The television was a flat screen LG with satellite reception. There is no separate bathroom. The room has a beautiful shower right next to the bed. The shower's walls are semi-transparent, so you must be very intimate with your roommate if you decide to stay there. There are though other rooms that have separate bathroom. The shower is magnificent! It has a rain function that is very relaxing and a temperature regulator to keep the water at a steady temperature. Behind the shower there's a small space to hang your clothes, the safe with an electronic key lock, a couple of drawers and room for your shoes. Next to the wardrobe is the toilet. The toilet's door is also a full body mirror, and it slides sideways revealing the toilet. Beside the shower there is a vanity mirror, the faucet and the sink, and the Nespresso coffee machine. Our offer didn't include a full breakfast in the price; instead we were offered what was called a light breakfast which consisted of an orange juice, a banana and one yogurt. Everyday the maid replenished our supply of nespresso coffee cartridges so in the morning we had almost everything we desired! If the light breakfast included a cake it would be nothing less than perfect! The room didn't have central heating. Instead, the room's temperature was regulated by the air condition unit. It's controls were next to the bed, by the phone, along with the controls to open or close the curtains. The only problem we could find with our room, was its lighting. It was simply not enough. It made a nice, romantic atmosphere, but if you wanted to read on bed, pick your clothes or put some make up on, it wasn't enough. The room and the lobby with its bar and restaurant were fantastic, as you can see from the photos as well. So what happened to award them with a mediocre 3 stars in our review? Part 2: The incident Someone stole a handbag of ours inside the hotel, in the lobby, right under the nose of the security manager who was present at the time and despite the many security cameras overlooking the premises!!! It was our last day at the hotel, we were to leave the next morning. In the lobby of the hotel there are two Mac's for the hotel's guests with free access to the Internet. We had just walked back from our stroll in the city and we sat to check our emails. When we finished we went upstairs only to realize that our bag was missing. Believing that we had simply forgotten it by the Mac I went immediately down to the lobby. Alas the bag was missing. I immediately asked the gentleman who was there all the time if he saw our bag but he told me that he hadn't seen anything. I also informed the hotel's reception. They assured me that the hotel is well monitored by numerous video surveillance cameras, that nothing out of the ordinary ever happened in their hotel. I asked them to check the video. The aforementioned gentleman indeed went somewhere to check the video tape. The gentleman returned and told me that he saw nothing suspicious on tape, just me and my wife entering the hotel, sitting at the computers and a little later leaving with nothing left behind. My mind was about to explode! I was certain that I had the bag with me when I walked into the hotel. I am a trusting man though, and went back to the last store we were before returning to the hotel just to make sure I hadn't forgotten it there. I hadn't. I came back to the hotel and asked them to check their tapes again. The security manager (the same man who was present at the time of the incident and the same man who didn't see anything out of the ordinary on the tape) told me that he would review the tapes as soon as possible. I explained to him that we were to leave very early in the morning so he assured me that by 22:30 he would give me a definitive answer of what happened according to their security tapes. Mind you that all these happened at 17:30. We went out for dinned and at 22:30 they called us from the hotel only to tell us that \"No one entered, no one left, no one went along you while you were sitting at the computers\". That made absolutely no sense at all! There were only two possibilities: Either I had lost the bag before returning to the hotel, or someone took it when we sat at the lobby, so I asked them to check the tape and see if I was wearing the bag on me when I entered the hotel at around 17:30. They said they would and we went straight back to the hotel. Upon our arrival at the hotel, the receptionist told us that \"Someone took your bag\"! No kidding! That was what we were telling them all day! They had reviewed the tapes, and I had the bag on me when I had entered the hotel in the afternoon. Then they saw someone who had come to the hotel only minutes before and sat there idly, to leave shortly after hiding something that looked like our bag under his coat. However, when we asked if they have him on tape actually grabbing the bag, the receptionist told us that the cameras don't caver the computers. On their advice, we went to the police to file a complaint. Hours later, we realized that something else was wrong: If the cameras didn't cover the area of the computers, why did they tell us that no one entered, no one left and no one passed by our table while we were there? So we left a note at the reception asking for explanations. The next day we checked out and returned home. The day after I received a phone call from the hotel. They apologized and told me that I was right, they had a problem with the security company they employed; it was their security manager who assured them all the time than nothing had happened, and only when the saw the video tape for themselves found out that he wasn't telling the truth. They said that they had a problem with their security company, a problem they would surely address immediately. I hope so! The hotel offered no compensation whatsoever, only their verbal apologies. It's such a pity, that we were their first customers to be robbed, right inside their hotel, at the lobby of the hotel! I sincerely hope they made all the necessary arrangements so something like that won't happen ever again.
