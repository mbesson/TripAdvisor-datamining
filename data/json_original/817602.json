We had a two bedroom villa, it seems that each villa comes with a splash pool, kitchen and living dinning.

We stayed in one of the smaller villas (2bdroom 2bath) but still has our own private pool. Our package included breakfasts (basically like a lunch), a bike tour, 1 lunch, 1 dinner, and 2 hr spa package. It was great. They provided excellent service. They can clean your villa as many times a day. They also provide you with car drop-off/pick-up service in the area of semniyak/legain/kuta - we saved a bunch of taxi and walking from this - and airport as well. The staff is extremely friendly and fun to hang out with - we spent alot of time with butler named Iwan who was our bike tour guide and driver.The only con for us was that we werent quite used to the villa outdoor feel - there will be mosquitoes and flys, but if you want you can certainly stay closed off in your bedroom with the AC on.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325410375", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "iammonki"}, {"Content": "Lovely, quiet villa in the middle of Seminyak Walking distance from the beach, Ku de Ta and Seminyak but you are in your own secluded villa with private pool. Need I say more.Maybe I do, there is a taxi service available by the hotel to bring you to town or Ku de Ta, they serve breakfast in your dining room (not the best breakfast ever but certainly nice)Babysit was available immediately when you phoned them, in the afternoon there were free coffee and snacks in the lobby.Villas were beautiful decorated with rooftop terrace, open air bathrooms, open air living room, pool  loungers. The only thing was the pool, it did not get a lot of sun because of the surrounding wall and the villa which means that the water stayed to cold.(How spoilt can you be)We had a lovely holiday with friends and small children, you can share the villa with friends and still have your privacy.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR242087907", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MM1908"}, {"Content": "Faultless 11 Villas only recently opened, i suspect this one will slowly find its way up to the top of the rankings. We were collected from the airport (despite a long delay) and we were greeted with refreshments and the offer of a relaxing foot massage. Your entrance to the villa is absolutely fantastic, 2 large double doors set in a stone entrance. The first thing you see is your own good sized swimming pool that goes up right up to the very large open plan fully equipped kitchen and lounge, with TV / Stereo that with speakers all round the villa. Its also possible slide open the bedroom doors so you jump straight into the pool from there. As youd imagine the decor is wonderfully modern with 2 big bedrooms and 2 outside bathrooms - Upstairs also offers a large veranda with a four poster sun lounger to watch the sunset. They have all been designed so that you are not overlooked from any position and despite all 11 villas being full we could barely hear a thing other than the sounds of the waterfall into the pool. Its a tranquil setting offering the most incredible privacy.Each morning breakfast (American, Continental or Indonesian) is brought to your villa and laid on the table ready for you to go. (They ask you choice of breakfast the night before). They have a great lunch and dinner menu (and reasonably priced) that is also brought and served in your apartment, although we chose to eat out each evening. They also have a full compliment of treatments to provide in your villa and will also drive you wherever you need locally. At night they come and turn the beds down whilst your out, leave a chilled bottle of water by your bed and spray the villa for mosquitos. On one night we returned to find the villa had had the (honeymoon treatment) despite not being on honeymoon, a heart of flowers at the entrance, the bath had been filled with rose petals and petals left on the bed.The staff are so incredibly friendly and will help your organise your sight seeing trips out and found us a driver for the day to show us around Bali, which only cost around 30GBP.The location itself is fantastic, 2 minutes walk one way and your on the beach of Seminyak (a peaceful part of the beach, but probably not as pretty as the beaches further on). 2 minutes walk the other way and your on the main street of Seminyak with more than enough bars, restaurants and shops to choose from. Particular favourite was JP's (good food and atmosphere) at the other end of the street .This is genuinely high standard villa, and i cannot imagine anyone could stay here and have a bad word to say about the staff or the villa. I would say if you had young children you may have to watch the access to the pool.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR759994986", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KilosUk"}, {"Content": "Perfect Place to Stay       Seminyak beach in the morning", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR715423673", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "leonardth"}, {"Content": "Villa Perfecta       La cama", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR440918675", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kalamarcin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d817602-r23023069-Le_Jardin_Boutique_Villa-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "817602", "Price": "$410"}}
