We had a long drive up from out of state, complicated by an accident that caused a two hour delay. We contacted the 6th Avenue Inn on the phone to tell them we were looking at a 2 hour delay. During the conversation they told us not a problem and they were holding our room on the fifth floor for us, away from the elevators, away from ice machines, etc. When we arrived, they informed us we were on the fourth floor. They were booked solid and had given our original room to someone else. I don't mean to be picky, but when they tell us four hours earlier that our room is confirmed, locked and located on the fifth floor but in truth give it away, that's a strike against them. We got there Thursday evening. Friday morning we woke up feeling somewhat refreshed, though it took us a while to fall asleep. They have very thin walls, and floors/ceilings. To make it even better, our room had a door that allowed it to join with the room next to it. The door is right by the headboard of the bed, so we got to very clearly hear our neighbors talking away. The room overall isn't bad, but the shower was incredibly small. I'm tall, but not wide and I had to stand sideways most of the time in the shower ... in part to avoid the hair that was embedded in the caulking from a repair they had made. This also put me in a good position to see the mold along the top of the shower! Saturday morning was horrendous ... we were woken up at 4:00AM by construction across the street. It would have been nice to have had a bit of warning about this! Literally, a block long crane was going up, and the workers were banging away on it. At least Sunday they didn't start until 7:00 AM! What I don't get is why Friday morning we were not bothered by the construction and they waited for the weekend! I get that the construction is beyond their control, but I suspect they were aware of it and could have warned guests, maybe leave some complimentary earplugs? For the most part the staff, though unhelpful, were friendly. I'd also add, that by Friday evening, our hallways started to smell something fierce. My wife and friends thought it was a urine smell ... me I'm not sure but it was nasty. Overall, this place needs some work. They need to clean up the place a bit and think more about the customer's experience. I heard several people grumbling the day we checked out.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, great location\u201d", "Author": "KHH-MN", "ReviewID": "UR126963172", "Content": "I stayed in March 2012, and would definitely go back. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, and the location is just great. When I was there the public transit system still had the free downtown area, and there were bus stops just steps out the front door of the hotel. I felt safe walking from the central downtown area even at night. The hotel itself is on the older side, so the sleeping area and the bathrooms are small. But everything was clean and it was quiet, so it all worked for me. My only complaint was that the light switch for the bathroom was on the wall entering the bathroom-- so to turn on the light I ran the risk of waking up the other person in the room. But that was a small price to pay for a great location and a MUCH lower price than the big chains just a few blocks away.

Quite honestly, I was absolutely nervous staying here---the price seemed too good to be true. However, once my partner and I settled in, we recieved wonderful customer service at the front desk! We actually felt welcome, which is a great feeling for our first time in a new city. The rooms are standard, but definitely clean. I'd only recommend making an advance reservation for a microwave if that is a need; but it is not guaranteed. Honestly though that wasn't much of an issue because there are so many hole-in-the-wall restaraunts, we hardly found ourselves carrying any left overs back to the room! Also, many people compalin about the club behind the hotel. Its really not an obscure area, and in fact the hotel itself is right across the street from the Westin---a very high star rated hotel. This confirmed to my partner and I that the area was a safe area, and we found ourselves walking back around 9:00 at night after visiting tourist attractions---and experienced no troubles at all. Its a very safe neighborhood, and I am guaranteed that we will be staying here every chance we get to come to Seattle. Absolutely beautiful city, and beautiful people. California needs to learn a thing or two from this city about composting! Hahaha. Overall though, definitely worth the money---especially if you have AAA. Besides, you're staying for the city, not the room! Did I mention how Google Maps over-exaggerates the distance from Pikes Place Public Market and Space Needle, and other attractions? 6th Avenue is actually one of the main streets that runs through the city, so you're always going to be surrounded by people and no sketchy alleyways. The only place I'd recommend to stay out of is on the weekends (including Friday nights) near the malls. We were seeing a concert on the last night of our stay, and were walking home at around 11-12 pm at night; there were a lot of sketchy fellows out and by the time we reached the Mc Donalds that is neighboring to the Sixth Avenue Inn, we felt secure. I'd say the best time to stay is during the week, so you can enjoy the town for what it is and not get caught in crowds on the weekends. Anyways, GREAT place to stay! AND AFFORDABLE! Disregard those negative comments, people are way too picky about hotels. Again, you're staying for the city, not the hotel! And there is no weird smell to the hotel----people are way overdramatic. And there is not \"a lot of construction\" going on that would disrupt your stay. Its a city for crying out loud, there's always things being torn down and rebuilt.

People were in and out of the rooms and hall way on our floor so that made the noise louder. We paid $212 for both nights with $15 parking each night, which is crazy because we are already paying to stay in the hotel. I wasnt happy.

I felt some pressure bc I did all the planning and research for this trip, also we were traveling with another couple and they decided to stay at this hotel as well; Sixth Ave Inn did not let me down one bit! To start off, for a 3 star hotel, it was more towards 4 star in my book bc I have stayed at a lot of 4 and 5 star hotels. The rooms are clean and remodeled, and it came with a flat screen TV that always gives the room a more modern feel. The staff is very friendly and efficient, checking in and out was a breeze. Parking is only $15 per night, which is cheap compared to the rest of the hotels in Seattle. Some hotels have parking fees of up to $50 per night. Parking spaces are plentiful as well. I always \"liked\" Sixth Ave Inn on Facebook and booked my reservations through Facebook, and got an $80/night rate! My total for 3 nights was about $330 (taxes and parking). For the best part, besides the rate I got, was the location. I couldn't have asked for a better location, it was in the middle of everything. Staying at Sixth Ave Inn is kind of like staying in Union Square for those who have ever been to San Francisco. You can walk a block or two, and you are in a big shopping district. A few short blocks the other way is the Seattle Center, where the Space Needle is located; you can also see the Space Needle from your hotel by the way. Then, for my favorite part of the trip, you walk about 6 short blocks down, and you will arrive at the water, where the Public Market is. The Public Market has some nice restaurants around it, along with many bakeries. The first Starbucks is also here as well. It was about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. When I search for hotels, cleanliness and location matters the most; that convenience factor is very important to me. We barely drove on this trip bc we were able to simply walk! Some places we drove to were Bruce Lee's gravesite at Lakeview Cemetery; we drove to the International District to go to Seattle's first Japanese restaurant known as Maneki, they had great prices btw, and everything we had was super fresh! Other than that, we mainly walked everywhere, which is a huge plus bc we were also able to drink and not have to drive. One night, we partied at Pink Lounge several short blocks away, and we were able to walk, which was a huge plus. Tom Douglas is also a famous chef in Seattle, and there was 3-4 restaurants all in a one or two block radius of the hotel. We dressed up and fine dined one night at Dahlia's Lounge (look up reviews on Yelp, get the duck btw!), and Dahlia's Lounge was only a block and a half away. Serious Pie is right next to Dahlia's Lounge; across the street fro Dahlia's Lounge is Lola's. Palace Kitchen is also a block from Sixth Ave Inn. All these restaurants I mentioned are all Tom Douglas restaurants. There are several other fancier hotels next to the Sixth Ave Inn, such as the Westin, but honestly, I wouldn't choose any other hotel other than the Sixth Ave Inn. The rate I got (80/night), as well as the parking fee (15/night), and the convenience factor are unbeatable. My gf as well as my other two friends were also very satisfied w/ this hotel simply bc we were in the middle over everything.

I'm an extremely light sleeper and they were able to fulfill my request for a higher-floor room, so we weren't right above the bar/grill on the first floor. The bed was comfy, the TV was a flat-screen and the shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion in the bathroom were in adorable containers hung against the wall. Also, I love how they had a recycling bin in the room. Gotta love the Northwest for being so environmentally conscious! The hotel is walking distance to the Space Needle. Seriously, you walk out the main entrance and voila -- there it is! I'd say it's a 10-minute walk at the most. It's also walking distance to Downtown Seattle (Pacific Center, tons of shopping and restaurants) and Pike Place Market. I'd say a 10-15 minute walk, but you don't even realize it because you're walking by all the shops and restaurants. The only thing I didn't like was that the Wi-Fi was shotty. It took us forever to log in and the connection was really slow. It made me wonder if they only have one router on the first floor for the entire hotel because we were barely getting a signal.

For example, when my key woudn't get me into the small workout room, the front desk staff advised me to tell the maintenance guy that he neeeded to rekey the door on the workout room. Then the maintenance guy told me that front desk guys really just didn't code my key right. Whatever. The workout room is a brutally uninspiring room with a total of three machines (bike, treadmill, and stairclimber). There is a pay-per laundry, which is convenient. I found the bed very comfortable and there is a small desk in the room, but it is not well outfitted for business. For example, I found only one outlet within reach of the desk. When I plugged my phone charger in a wall socket, it would fall out due to the weight of the plug. The place as been around for awhile. There's an on-site restaurant and bar, which is cozy and convenient. Don't expect fine cuisine. This is food that likely comes from some sort of premade service. Considering the range of good restaurants in walking range, I'd recommend something else based on my experience. There's a McDonald's right next door if you want cheap.

The very bad: I booked this hotel because I was traveling to Seattle and wanted to do some bike riding and most times it is easier to stay at a smaller hotel such as this. For $10-$20 more though on Hotwire you can stay at a 3-4star such as Westin etc. would recommend that. But where the bad takes place is the hospitality; I have traveled all over the world with my bikes for twenty years so when I was checking in I asked if I could leave my case here (which is the size of a suite case airline regulation size) and another suite case while I travel around for a week and I will book a room right now for my return day at whatever the rack rate was which I think was $98. The front desk guy told me they really only store luggage for 24hrs. but I can ask the manager tomorrow. The next day waited to speak and caught up with him and he informed they cannot store my suite cases for a week that they do not have the room. Even though when I was speaking with him they have shelves half empty with suite cases and I seen their laundry maintenance area next to the elevators with plenty of room. I completely understand that no hotel has room if every guest wanted to store stuff for a week. But come on throw it in a corner somewhere and make me sign something that your not liable if that is the issue. Now for where my trip got good again and you see the true hospitality of Seattle people and and other hotel chains why their so successful. I figured let me walk up the street about 8 blocks to the Marriott Spring Hill Suites I walk in the door and am greeted excellent I ask the gentleman working the front desk I ask the gentleman that I was bike ride and tour over the next week and I need to leave my suite cases somewhere for a week I will make a reservation for next week for the night of my return would it be possible to leave them here. First words out of his mouth \u201cAbsolutely\u201d I say they are two large suite cases is that ok \u201cnot a problem\u201d no matter what I said this guy was going to satisfy me. Next day dropped my cases off walk in told a different front desk clerk I have a reservation wanted to leave these hear for a week again \u201cno problem\u201d not once did they flinch about them, have to get their manager they were empowered to satisfy the guest. The bar also at this location Marriott location is happening the drinks are good priced right what else can you say and to top it off the room was free as I turned in Marriott miles.

I find some places think a \u201cfew\u201d means \u201cone\u201d so I always appreciate when they don\u2019t try and be Stingy with the stuff. There was a restaurant in the hotel that I did not try but I did look over the menu and it seemed to be at a fair price. I think the location of this hotel is great. I walked everywhere to and from it. There isn\u2019t even a need to ride the monorail to the Space Needle if you don\u2019t want to. Another great thing about its location was that it is right next to a Drop off/Pickup location (The Westin) for the Cheap Airport shuttle so you can choose an affordable way to/from airport and only have to cross the street to catch it. They have a secure place to keep your luggage after checkout if you need it. I\u2019d stay here again.

The first time I stayed at the Red Lion and loved it; great views, good room, well located. And it had the price to go with all of that. So when I had to go back two weeks later I wanted to stay someplace that was much less expensive. After checking the reviews I selected the Sixth Ave. Inn and was happy with my choice. First, be clear that this hotel is exactly what is described, a budget hotel. It's a good budget hotel but it's not more than that. The front desk staff was great, no one with attitude there! The rooms were not large and are not modern, at least by my standards. However, the two rooms I rented were very clean. I also have to hand it to the hotel for being responsive to guest's concerns. I emailed the hotel when I made the reservations and asked that my rooms be as quiet as possible as this is important to me. Our rooms were reasonably quiet (for a downtown location). I can see that some rooms might get street noise so if this is of concern to you then let the hotel know ahead of time. I was also concerned about the \"gentlemen's club\" that is mentioned in several reviews, as I was booking one of the rooms for a relative that I was meeting in Seattle. Our rooms didn't look that direction but I have to say that it wouldn't have bothered me if they had. The \"club\" is in the next building but it isn't like it's right against the hotel, there is a bit of separation. Things that may raise eyebrows: first, the outside of the building is painted concrete block (at least that's what it appears to be). The building is well maintained generally (there were a few missing tiles in my bathroom but it appears that repair work had recently been done and the tiles not yet re-installed). One thing that I didn't particularly care for were the wall dispensers for the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc. That's personal preference and for the money I was saving I could live with it. In the two rooms that I rented there were no bathtubs, only showers (fine by me). I will also have to say that the air conditioning in our rooms worked great. I happen to hit Seattle during hot spells both times. The a/c at the Red Lion was okay but the a/c at the 6th Ave. could really chill a room. Bottom line: it's a very well run budget hotel. The location is great and I do mean great; we walked everywhere except for the brief ride on the monorail. The staff all seem to have an interest in their guests. If you time your afternoon visit to the front desk just right you'll also get a warm cookie.

We rode the lightrail train from the airport into downtown and then walked the 5 or so blocks to the hotel with no problem. I booked this hotel for the location and price and after reading the reviews was confident in my choice especially because the staff takes the time to reply to each and every review and that says a lot to me. We were within 15 minutes from Pikes Place Market and the Space Needle so you couldn't beat the location for the price. It looks old from the outside but I knew the inside was going to be clean and modern and it was no disaapointment. I also love that they have toiletry dispensers to save costs and resources. It always seems like a waste to use a bar of soap for one night and then have to throw it away. I took advantage of the computers in the lobby to get some directions and the staff was super helpful. We were able to store our luggage after check out since we weren't catching our shuttle to the cruise pier till 1pm and wanted to walk around some more. It was a great service. If you stay here make sure to check out the Seattle Glassblowing Studio on 5th Ave (towards the space needle) and you can watch aritists blow glass. We also ate breakfast at the Top Pot doughnut shop a block away which was great. The line was out the door but it moved quickly and we were able to find a table. I will repeat that earplugs do help if you're a light sleeper. The traffic isn't bad after 10pm so it didn't keep us up but in the morning if probably would have woken us up if we hadn't had earplugs.

With the Sixth Avenue Inn, you actually get a significant value for $50 a night (what I paid). First, the hotel is situated in a fantastic location, just blocks from Pikes Place Market and shopping centers, close to the freeway (for those with a rental car), and close enough to the action but far enough away from the chaos. The hotel has clearly been renovated and the lobby is quite nice. The outside looks rather shabby but once you walk in, you're greeted to bright lights and a very friendly staff. The staff was fantastic and accommodating, and especially the cleaning staff was lovely. As for the room itself, I had a Queen room and it was a big, cushy room, more than ample. The carpets looked new, as did all of the furnishing. Do you get a mint on your pillow and lots of amenities? No, but hello, you're paying far less for it. I really only needed a room to rest my head as I was out of the hotel for 18 hours of the day. So I was thrilled with my room. I will say that the BIGGEST downside to this hotel is that the walls/floorboards seem to be VERY VERY thin. I could not get much sleep because I could hear the person above me stamping back and forth in their room. I have to assume that all they were doing was walking back and forth but I could hear it very loudly. Initially, I was pretty upset and considered asking to have my room changed. But then I guess I got used to it and ended up just dealing with it. But next time, I will probably change rooms and not be so lazy about it. I am sure that the staff would have changed my room for me. Also, there were really loud, drunk people in my hallway but they didn't wake me up as I got in late myself. They quieted down after a while so I have to assume management took care of them. The bathrooms are a bit small here but it's not a big deal. Wireless Internet access is free and the service was pretty good. They appeared to have two computers in the lobby with Internet service. There is also room service and a restaurant attached but I did not try either. Between the loud floorboards and the thin walls, plus the street noise, this hotel can be a bit noisy and I'd strongly suggest earplugs. But you really cannot beat this deal for downtown Seattle. I found plenty of street parking for my rental car. They do charge $15 for parking. Again, the location is key. Being within walking distance to Pikes Place is a real luxury. Plenty of places to eat, drink, and enjoy Seattle. The area is more than safe and I was walking around at 2 am (I got hungry) and felt fine.

It was perfect for our needs. Walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go, and if it wasn't walking distance, then it was just a few minutes to 3rd ave where all of the buses ran. It was also across the street from an Airporter stop, so we were able to easily get to and from the airport. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We never once passed by the front desk on our way in without being greeted, or on our way out without a \"have a nice day\". And we were in and out a lot! The front desk staff was also very helpful with directions and recommendations on where to eat or sites to see. We didn't use the internet in our room, but we did use the computers in the lobby. It especially came in handy when it came time to print our boarding passes for our trip home. We knew we wouldn't spend much time at the hotel so we weren't looking to spend much money on one. But our time spent there was always pleasant. If you're looking for an inexpensive hotel walking distance to just about everything, we'd highly recommend this place. We're planning to return to Seattle next summer, and we'll definitely be staying at Sixth Avenue Inn again. Oh one more thing. I remember reading negative reviews here first complaining about the strip club across the street. But decided to take a chance and stay here anyway. Our room faced the club and my husband didn't even realize it was there until I pointed it out on our last night. There was no loud noise and with our curtains closed there was no problem with the neon signs. And the club is actually on the back side of the hotel, not in front, so you'd never even have to walk passed the place. And the area was NOT \"shady\". In face, there was a very upscale restaurant across the other street (can't remember the name right now) with Lambos and Ferraris parked out front. Not your typical \"shady neighborhood\" vehicle. I'm from the southside of Chicago. I know shady when I see shady, and this area was not shady. So don't let the proximity to the club discourage you.

The problem is, there are no Motel 6s in the downtown area. It's one of the dilemmas, if you want to be in a decent location and want a nice room, you'll have to pay the extra 100.0-150.00 / night.

We've had tons of bubble tea here in Vancouver but Gossip is one of the best we've had. We have to thank previous posters on this board for that tip! For vegetarian lovers, you must try Araya (Thai vegetarian cuisine).

The rooms are basic but clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean with hot water but very small showers, and the front desk staff is friendly and helpful, but do not go \"above and beyond.\" Essentially, this is a two star hotel, fair and square. Bring earplugs, as the walls are paper thin, and there is constant noise either from the street or from other rooms. Even just the people in the room above you moving around is enough to keep you awake at night, since it creates a loud creaking and thumping sound with every step they take. The area is so-so. It is within walking distance to main areas and attractions, and cab rides are short and cheap from this central location, but I wouldn't want to be walking in the immediate area surrounding the hotel. The best feature of this hotel is the restaurant. The staff is amazingly friendly, attentive and FAST! Service is top notch. The food is also great for what it is. Don't expect gourmet cusine, by why would you at a hotel of this callibre. It's homestyle American food, and it is good, with oversized portions (perfect for sharing!). I would stay at this hotel again, but I would bring earplugs.", "Date": "January 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cPleasant but not luxury - will return\u201d", "Author": "mojave_ben", "ReviewID": "UR4102703", "Content": "Twice I have stayed here as a cheap alternative to the Westin, where I was at a conference. For $100 less per night, you get a perfectly adequate room. They may have done some work in the two years since I was last there. I found the room fine, though it and the bath were a bit small. Iron, coffee maker, hair dryer, lights and TV fine. The food is OK but the restaurant a bit on the dark side. I really liked my little room, except the windows are single pane and daytime traffic noise is a bit loud (get a room on the upper floor, or at the back). This is a budget hotel, but it is not a dive. Definitely a step up from Motel 6 style places. Lots of food in the places - just blocks from Westlake Center. Bed and linens were just fine. I have always found the staff to be pleasant.
