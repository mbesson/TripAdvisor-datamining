{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Our second home in Bali 2nd January 2008 We have just returned from our fifth trip to Bali and our second visit to Suites hotel Bali Royal. It is the undoubtedly one of the best small boutique hotels in Bali. Spacious and quiet bungalows which are impeccably maintained. The towels are changed almost before you can use them by charming staff who never intrude or disturb your peace and quiet. The pool is clean and well maintained and back from the beach enough not to be disturbed by the passers by. The gardens are beautiful and huge old frangipani trees shade the grassy approach to the beach. Not the best beach but the pool more than compensates for that. Undoubtedly however is the kitchen is the high point. The team was trained by the Austrian owners and everything is spick and span. They only cook with fresh ingredients and can arrange for any wishes from Schnitzel to export quality lobster served to your specifications. We ate every night there as the food quality and value and service are exceptional.I couldn't recommend it more for those who prefer small hotels with competent and personal service.Jessica", "Date": "Jan 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR147499060", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BlancheBerlin"}, {"Content": "One of BEST at Tanjung Benoa", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR529882294", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "annadiving"}, {"Content": "Bali Royal Suites simply superb It was our first time to Bali, we went there for our honeymoon and I would like to say how much we enjoyed ourselves at the Bali Royal Suites. The bungalow, facilities, service and location all first class. It was quiet and peaceful.We had the whole complex to ourselves the whole week we were there, tourist numbers are down, and yet we were treated absolutely perfectly. The gardens are immaculate, food and drinks wonderful. It really felt like a true holiday and the views out to sea from the pool and deck chairs just wonderful. The staff not intrusive but at the same time attentive.We would love to return sometime. There is so much to do and see in Bali. It is affordable and the people are very friendly.David and Patricia MitchellAustralia", "Date": "Jan 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR705187140", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "davidm1750"}, {"Content": "Hotel encantador       Lavabo", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR360818131", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Lamegon"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191333-d307564-r12375271-Suites_Hotel_Bali_Royal-Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "307564", "Price": "$140"}}
