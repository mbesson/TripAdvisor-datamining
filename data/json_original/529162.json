This is only a 10-15 minute stroll from Piazzale Roma where the Ryanair/ATVO bus drops you off. Arrived at the hotel @ 11.15pm on a weekday night. For a twin & triple room the cost was 190 euro - as there were 5 of us this worked out to be 38euro each. The guy who was on reception wasn't over friendly but wasn't rude either. Once passport details were taken he then showed us to our rooms. Slightly worried that we'd have another 15 minute walk, which some have had to make, we were taken across the narrow \"avenue\" to our rooms. Up one flight of stairs and 3 keys later there we were. A twin room, which smelt of damp and another room which was quite large(and bright in the daytime) awaited. 5 of us had one bathroom to share. This was fairly small and as well as the sink and toilet had a bidet, for some strange reason, as well as a washing machine & mop and bucket! The shower wasn't particularly high so if you're tall you need to crouch a bit. Water was hot though and the pressure ok. \"Towels\" were provided but these were more like bedsheets/tablecloths in texture & absorbancy-they did the job though and were clean...as was the bed linen and surfaces. There was a bedside table lamp in our room and a wardrobe but no mirror. In the 3-person room there was a mirrir on the inside of the wardrobe and a view of some rooves and washing. All in all the rooms & bathroom were pretty basic but enough to rest you head & wash (albeit a bit snug!) Next morning it was down to a rather limited breakfast but much friendlier staff. You have a choice of tea, coffee or cappuchino. Very nice cappuchino but you get one and that's it. Food consisted of a croissant, breadroll & 2 small slices of pre-packed \"toast\" along with butter and jam. Don't expect the breakfast to keep you going until late afternoon even if it is carbcity! If you turn right out of reception, walk to the end and turn left, keep going straight you come to a little piazza with a cafe/bar. This was still open @ 11.30/12 with a few locals and some tourists and they're pretty friendly. A prosecco is 3.50 euro and a small beer (20 cl) I think was @ 3.50/4 euro.

We stayed in the apartment 4 bridges away, near the McDonalds. The hotel is a bit difficult to find, and the website does not give very good directions. (I will post detailed directions on a tripadvisor forum to help others in the future.) In the meantime, on a map, find and get to Rio Tera S. Leonardo (street) and find the Hotel Leonardo sign (see photos), and go down that street, Calle De La Masena. The staff speak limited english, but can get their point across and are reasonably friendly. We paid 85 Euros a night, which was the lowest rate we could find for our time frame. We were advised by e-mail prior to coming that we would be staying in their apartment, which according to them was 5 minutes walk away. This might be true not accounting for carrying luggage over 4 bridges and fighting hordes of tourists. It's closer to 10-12 minutes walk. But much easier is getting on the #1 vaporetto at the San Marcuola stop, and getting off 2 stops later at Ca' D'Oro. I wish they would have told us this, as we had 48hour (highly reccommended) vaporetto passes, and its a 2 minute trip on the vaporetto, and the apartment is 2 minutes from the vaporetto stop, and no bridges to cross with luggage. Sooo much easier. # 1 comes every 10 minutes. The apartment is easy to find from Ca' D'Oro stop. Basically walk straight forward, cross the street (Strada Nova), quick zigzag, and you're there. Good location, there's a trendy little seafood/pasta restaurant below which was always packed, but that can mean noise late at night and early in the morning. But good food. For those wanting a taste from home, McDonalds around the corner. The room was up one flight of stairs, no elevator. Through a heavy door, (good for security). Bathroom was shared with one other room but very clean and functional. Hot water takes a few minutes though. Room for two is two beds pushed together. No safe in the room though. But the bed was made each morning for us, which we didn't expect given the class of hotel and location of apartment, a pleasant surprise. Small room, no TV (but you're in Venice, who needs TV). Be warned, the mosquitoes at night are like vampires. I woke up with at least 6 bites on my face/neck each morning, so either close the windows or apply bug spray. Breakfast is very simple and cheap, they don't spend much money on it. They serve a white roll each, a 2 pack of bread crackers (available at the supermarket up the street, 40 for ~1.5 euros) a packet of jam and butter, and a jam-filled croissant (again available at the supermarket, box of 6 for ~1.5 euros). However on the bright side, they will happily make you a cappucino or hot chocolate. The setting is pleasant, kind of quaint, and they don't mind if you stroll up at 9:55 (breakfast finishes at 10) they were quite accomodating for us. If you want better breakfast, buy it yourself at the nearby supermarket (across 1 bridge). Overall, if you can get a reasonable rate, and don't mind simple accomodation, its worth a stay.

The guy at the receiption spoke english but the cleaning lady couldn't so we had communicated via hand gestures. My only negative would be that though the breakfast was included in the room charge you had to go back to the hotel for it and since I am not an early riser I always missed out on that.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Sachin_Mehta", "ReviewID": "UR8115246", "Content": "We would like to thank Hotel Ariel Silva for a wonderful stay, we had in Venice. We were 5 people traveling from India who visited Venice as our 2nd destination; we stayed in Hotel Ariel Silva on 21st June 07 till 23rd June 07. Since we were 5 people staying so they had put us in an apartment as the rooms in the hotel were not very big to fit all 5 of us together, the apartment is about 7 min walk from the hotel. Must say the apartment we stayed in was very very comfortable, great location, very well equipped with all basic requirements. It has a small kitchen where one can cook anything they feel like, they have provided with all basic stuff one would require for cooking. It has 2 big rooms and 1 small store room where one can put your entire luggage & 1 bathroom. Venice is a very small city one can walk the entire city, hence there is no point paying extra to stay close to the main areas as all is about 10-15 min walk away from each of them. The hotel we stayed is very central located; it has a water bus stop just outside, so one can reach any part of Venice from there. It has lots of shops, restaurants & even a big grocery store just close by to the apartment. The only problem we had was to go for breakfast to the Hotel since the breakfast was included in the price but since the hotel was a little far off & in morning one does not really wants to walk all the way just for breakfast, hence that was the only problem we had, we would really recommend the hotel is they could some how arrange the breakfast within the apartment. But at the same time we really enjoyed our stay it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great location to stay in; basically we felt at home, so close to everywhere & yet away from the maddening crowd. We would really recommend all our friends visiting Venice to stay in Hotel Ariel Silva.", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cDon't waste your money\u201d", "Author": "travellerYE", "ReviewID": "UR7614417", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend.
