I want a good night's rest in a secure, quiet environment, with no surprises and no bugs, and that's about all. And in that respect, the Yorkland Hotel -- now rechristened the 'Days Hotel & Conference Center,' as you can see by visiting http://www.dayshoteltoronto.com/ -- was just what the doctor ordered. If I return to Toronto, I'll come here. The room was quiet, bug free -- it passed my flashlight bed bug inspection -- and everything worked. Firm mattress. Warm enough, and that means a lot in Toronto in February. Friendly staff; I have fond memories for Evelyn and Viajay, although everyone there was quite nice. I asked for a fridge, and they brought me one without delay. A few mild caveats: Look at the map and you'll see that the Don Mills subway station is a short walk away. True, but a 'short walk' becomes twice as long when the terra firma is smothered in snow, as it's bound to be here in winter. You might want something closer to the subway station if visiting here in the snow-bound months. The breakfast is a bit on the spartan side. Just a bit. Depends on what you expect. This hotel may not have bed bugs, but I think all hotels should invest in mattress encasements, given the threat bed bugs pose to travelers. What's it gonna cost? $50 wholesale per bed? And my biggest, perhaps most unreasonable beef: I had to lug my clothes in the freezing weather to this laundromat -- http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=105+Parkway+Forest+Drive,+Toronto,+Ontario,+Canada&aq=0&sll=43.773904,-79.341212&sspn=0.006988,0.015074&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=105+Parkway+Forest+Dr,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario+M2J+1P5,+Canada&z=17 -- because the hotel laundry service wants something like $6 to wash my blue jeans. Maybe that's typical, but no thanks. I don't mind paying a premium. The hotel could install washer/driers that go for, say, $5 a load. That would be a mild rip off, but I'd pay it rather than hike through the snow. I *won't* pay $6 just to get a pair of jeans washed. Next to last thoughts: this hotel seems to be a popular conference center in the Toronto area. If you pass a full parking lot, it's likely because a conference is in process. This had no negative effect on me as a guest. Last thoughts: I think this has to be an almost ideal bet for the business traveler. The wifi works, there's a safe in the room big enough for a laptop, and even a gym, to keep your muscle tone up.

The worst hotel I have ever placed foot in. My girlfriend and I wanted to stay here for a weekend together and it was the worst decision ever made! When we got there the staff at first seemed pleasant and things seemed ok. After we got on our floor, there were dirty dishes left at the doors of other rooms. I found this odd because I had read this in a different review about this hotel; so I was ready for this but still found it odd that their cleaning service didn't do their job. Might I add we checked in around 7/8PM, so for sure they had finished with their cleaning service for the day and there was no way those dishes were getting picked up. When we got in our room, it seemed nice and clean. Looked like your average hotel. We relaxed and lounged around a bit. When we were finally going to bed it was around 11PM and we had already been napping for a little bit by this point. I got up to get something and turned on a light. I noticed there was a bug, a small bug, on my girlfriends pillow. At first I thought it was a bug that came from outside or something so I just killed it. As soon as I looked up though, they were all over the walls behind the bed; crawling everywhere. On the backboard, the wall behind it, the bottom of the bed; it was DISGUSTING. I will never forget that image and how much it makes me cringe every time, I cannot tell you. We immediately packed our things and told them the story and asked for a new room. The guy at the front desk (who was interestingly enough the same guy who greeted us in a friendly manner when we first got there), he immediately changed his attitude. He acted all snobby and rude and said 'i want to see these bugs', and immediately left. Of course when he returned he was apologetic because he found them. They gave us a new room and when we got there the card didn't work for the room. We decided we didn't even want to stay there anymore. We told them we wanted our money back, which was a big hassle in itself (and which we haven't received everything yet; they owe us like another 50 bucks or something still). But we decided to stay at a different hotel, the Delta Markham, which might I add was amazing. We told them our story and they accommodated us well.

The bathrooms are very small, have no fans and the acrylic bathtub fitted liner was poorly installed causing the tub to be spongy and uneven to stand in, very dangerous. The heating/ac unit was loud.

The swimming pool liner was not properly installed causing major ripples in the liner, very unprofessional. The pool liner also showed signs of poor maintenance with what looked like a three-inch soap scum ring around the top. Even though I paid $ 47 per night through Hotwire (I searched the Don Valley / Toronto area) that doesn't make it a good deal in general, just that I paid a reasonable rate for a nights stay. I was hoping to get a great rate on a great hotel. Isn't that the point of searching for a great rate? Will I recommend this hotel? Unsure, it depends what your needs are. I paid a reasonable rate for this hotel; I wouldn't suggest you pay more than $ 60 tops. There are several other hotels that you may pay a little more for, but you will get way more for your money.

Our travel coordinator received a great rate ($99) and the reservation, check-in, and check-out process was smooth and easy. Good things about the room - it was fairly large which was good as we travel with a family and lots of \"stuff\", the beds were comfortable, and the room was set up perfectly fine for laptop and technology work (lots of plugs, easy to access wireless internet). That is a real MUST for us. The bathroom and the closet were tiny, though. Not a big issue, however. One thing I did notice is that dirty wineglasses sat outside another room in our hallway for 2 entire days .. morning, day, and night ... they just sat there in that hallway, never picked up. I noticed them when we got there on Friday night, and they were still sitting there when we left on Sunday. Strange that housekeeping never picked them up over that whole time and makes me wonder how many other housekeeping corners they cut. However, that being said, we had a good stay there. The hot tub was out of service when we were there, but the boys enjoyed the pool area - it was bright and clean and a pleasant environment, while not a huge pool.

This was by far the worst burger I have ever seen or tasted, I am not sure what kind of meat was in there but it was just horrible. We are not ones to complain, but we called down to Synergy and told them this, they did take the burger off the bill, I am thinking we both ended up with a stomache ache after just having a bite of this thing.
