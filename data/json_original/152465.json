{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location, Friendly Staff The Fiesta Americana hotel has a great location. If you are coming on business the price is right for a very average hotel. Definitely nothing to rave about here, but nothing done wrong either. The hotel is very dated, the TV worked rarely and I could not adjust the air conditioning in my room properly. I was shocked by how thin the towels were and the bar of soap was nearly microscopic. I was however thrilled to find a full service Starbucks just off the lower lobby. It became my oasis in between meetings.PS I checked out the Embassy Suites Mexico City - Reforma Hotel, MX - Exterior of Hotel Paseo de la Reforma #69 Colonia Tabacalera, M, Mexico which is just across the street. FAR NICER hotel and nearly the same price.

I was too tired to ask for another room. The restaurant seemed to be overpriced. I stayed at Sevilla Palace across the street the weekend before ( for 3 nights) and was totally blown away with deal that I got. It had good food, very modern rooms, and the roof-top sun deck and pool were very very cool. The view was amazing up there. Reforma is a safer part of the city but really that's all it's good for.

We stoped at this hotel for x4 nights in Mexico City, and then came back to it for x1 night, after spending x8 nights in Tulum near Cancun, before flying back to London, UK. All in all 5 nights at this Hotel.The hotel was booked by Trailfinders in London (travel agents) who have never ever dissappointed us. I was travelling with my baby daughter and wife, and had requested family friendly accomodation for our stay in Mexico City, and in Tulum.Keep in mind this hotel claims to be a 4 star. Where to begin, although child friendly (and by that I mean they provide high chairs in the restaurant), the facilities and service on offer at this hotel was abismal, lacking in choice, and far below the quality expected from this hotel. Our advice if you have to go to this hotel is...Do not make any phone calls as they are 8 times more expensive than buying a phone card (which I eventually did) and using a public phone. Plus they charged me for calls which never connected.Equally do not use room service (its rubbish), do not use their internet facility they charged us 50peso for 30 minutes, the cyber cafe's outside charge 5 peso for 30 minutes (so basically x10 mark up).Check your bills, as they tend to make a tonne of mistakes. And I leave the best for last. All hotels however many or little stars they may have you expect one thing, and that is that it is clean. Well I can guarantee that this hotel has an infestation (or plague your choice of adjective, as we couldn't think of a stronger adjective) of bed bugs, my wife and I were covered by bites, about the same time we were complaining (the day of our departure), they were changing all (and I mean all) the covers on our floor, and the next. The bathroom, was filthy and in serious need of some repair.All in all, if I were to use European standards, this hotel would not get a single star. It fails on hygiene, cost transparency (I am being diplomatic here), quality, variety, and service.Our advice, avoid it like you would a biblical plague.", "Date": "May 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR666663640", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "RJM1London"}, {"Content": "Used condom stuck to the bathroom floor I stayed in this hotel 4/6/2008 to 4/7/2008. On my second day at the hotel I noticed a used condom stuck to the floor in the corner of the bathroom. The bathroom must have been cleaned twice with it there. When I complained to the manager they offered to change my room but nothing else. I had to extend my stay by one day. The rate for the extra day was double the two other days. When I complained about this at check-out, I mentioned again the used condom.

The hotel is centrally located on a major street near the financial district and the old Centro Historico District. It is a great jumping point to all parts of the city. Overall, I was happy with my stay, but I must point out the good as well as the bad to be equitable and fair. The staff is quite knowledgeable, helpful, polite and bilingual. The service upon arrival, during and leaving was great. The hotel room and facilities were clean and tasteful but are beginning to show their age, but, still not a problem. The Food service is o.k. but servers seemed robotic and not helpful. Our bar service was bad. We entered one bar and were ignored by the bartender. So we went to the bar next door that had good service. The mattresses are hard or firm. I personally had a difficult time sleeping. If you like firm then it's o.k. If you travel for business this is a good place to be. The property does not have a pool. If you swim or have children this may be a factor to consider.

The service is excellent and we found that the concierge service was outstanding. They booked two tickets for us for a Sunday evening performance of the Ballet Folklorico on the spur of the moment and were able to attend without a problem. Taxi service was provided to and from the Palacio Belle Artes and was very reasonable and safe. The food in the buffet restaurant downstairs is excellent and the service is outstanding. Each room has a safe, which is very desireable. We could walk to many sights from this great location although we chose to catch tour bus (right in front of the hotel for 100 pesos a day per person).

This was my first encounter with such a thing, and hopefully my last! My dermatologist informed me bed bugs are becoming problematic again- he has treated several patients this year alone (people who had traveled all over...Mexico, Chicago, LA, New York, Dallas). As someone who travels quite a bit, I have now become very careful about where I stay as well as my handling of hotel bedding...once bitten, twice shy as they say.Bed bugs do not discriminate, even the most luxurious hotels can have bed bugs.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR183321458", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "goldrushbrides"}, {"Content": "Good hotel, friendly staff, good location I stayed here for several nights in late March. It is on Reforma, about equidistant from the historic center and the Zona Rosa area. There is no subway in the immediate vicinity but busses go up and down Reforma. There is a taxi stand on the premises but it is expensive. On the other hand, they are safe and the cars are comfortable.The hotel has changed hands a couple of times. It used to be the Crowne Plaza. I believe the Fiesta American chain is now working on some upgrades, which are needed. The common areas are better than average - lots of shiny marble, typical first class Mexico City decor. The dining rooms are nice and the business center very nice.The rooms themselves are slightly on the small side and quite standard. My only real complaint is the fact that the rooms are a bit worn. The furniture is on the old side and the bedspread was faded and frayed. They had just put in new lamps in my room, so I'm hoping other upgrades are on the way. The bathroom was also on the smallish side, also with older fixtures but very clean and completely serviceable. I ordered room service for breakfast a couple of times and it came quickly. The food is good, not great. For better meals you'll have to travel a bit because there are not a lot of restaurants in walking distance. There is a Wings and Sanborns nearby (both Mexican chain restaurants that have decent coffeeshop type food), as well as a few other hotels. One of the best nearby restaurants is at the Sheraton Centro Historico on Juarez - taking the hotel cab, it will be a $9.00 US cabride. The restaurant Cardenals, inside, is absolutely first rate - updated Mexican food in an elegant atmosphere. They also have a smaller Italian restaurant which I found very good. A big plus for me, as a single woman traveler, is that the staff is friendly and helpful and the hotel is very secure. The safes in the rooms are not large enough for a laptop and I inquired about this with the concierge. She told me not to worry so I didn't, and nothing was ever touched in my room (on the other hand, I'd simply prefer that the safe be able to accommodate my laptop).I got my room for $70 US with Hotwire, a bargain considering that at the reception desk, they advertise a $125 room rate. I'd probably stay here again, and definitely would if I knew they had freshened the room decor.", "Date": "Apr 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR324483806", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very Good Can't go wrong here.

The location was great, and you can easily walk back and forth to the airport in a few minutes. However, for the money, it was just an average stay. There must be some special tax there, because our bill was far higher than we expected. At the restaurant, we were told that the buffet was only open for 10 more minutes and we shouldn't order it.
