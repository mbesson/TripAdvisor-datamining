It was an excellent experience, staff were curteous and helpful. Our room was a corner room with a beautiful rounded window with a sitting area. The room was very clean with all the necessary amenties. The breakfast was good, we filled ourselves on yogurt and various meats, but definately save room for a Simit from a street vendor! In terms of location, Amiral is ideally located. Sultanhamet is a bustling neighborhood and some of the hotels which are on the main street could potentially be noisey - but the Amiral is set slighly off the main \"Hotel Row\" by one block and I found that it was much more serene. Sites around Sultanhamet are easily within walking distance, Hagia Sofia is about 7 minutes, Blue Mosque is the same, Topkapi is about 15 minutes, Basilica Cistern is about 10. We even walked all the way to the Galata Tower, over the Galata Bridge and that took about an hour and 25 minutes. Best Walk Ever, you see so much culture when you walk instead of taking a taxi! My tip on restaurants: Avoid the restaurants that are nearest to the hotel, instead walk further out, past Sultanhamet Park and there are some restaurants on the road towards Topkapi and Gulyhane Park that are cheaper and really good. We ate at a restaurant twice that I believe was called Turkish BBQ. Cheap Prices and excellent Pide's and beer. Also, we at mostly street food during the day and never got sick or had problems. Sandwiches from the street vendors run you about fifty cents (US) and are great! I would highly recommend staying at this hotel and hope to someday visit it again.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, California", "Title": "\u201cNice place, central location\u201d", "Author": "Terri M", "ReviewID": "UR122835345", "Content": "We stayed here with a group of six and enjoyed the hotel very much.

In the middle of the trip, we traveled to Izmir for two nights, then returned to Istanbul for the remainder of the trip. So we stayed at the Amiral Palace hotel in two different rooms. I'd like to offer my impressions and comment on some of the issues raised in other reviews. Having stayed at 2 different hotels, I think the breakfast at Amiral is comparable to the normal Turkish hotel breakfast. Having said that though, I do agree that it gets kind of old if you stay there for more than a couple of days. Trouble is, I was never able to find a really good hearty Turkish breakfast at a close restaurant. I heard the dog barking, but I think it was chained up at a property next door to the hotel. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bother me all that much. The first night I stayed at the hotel there was a party on the rooftop terrace across the street until about 1 am. Other than that 1 night, it was fairly quiet. The location is good but not great. You are about a 5 - 10 min walk up hill to the major attractions of old town, but you have to go through a gauntlet of restaurant hawkers to get there. I think it would be better to be a little farther up the hill and closer to the Tram. The rooms are OK\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI would call them adequate. Yes, the tubs drain very slowly, but that was the case in both rooms I stayed in. I think this is a common issue around here. On the second visit, the AC would not come on and there was no phone in the room. I reported it to the staff in the morning on the way out. When I returned, the AC/Heating unit was on, but it was turned to heat. The air was not cold. Since it was not all that hot at night, I just blew it off and opened the window. I think the staff are nice enough, but not forth coming. When I arrived, I said that I was going to take the ferry to Bandirma to catch a train to Izmir (see http://www.seat61.com/Turkey2.htm#Istanbul to Izmir). No one at the hotel knew of this option of traveling to Izmir. However, they did know of the ferry to Bandirma. It would have been nice for someone to suggest that I get the tickets in advance because these ferries fill up quickly. Unfortunately, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the tickets in advance and had to make an expensive last minute flight to Izmir. When I made the reservation, I asked for a pick up and return to the airport. I was given instructions for the pickup for my initial arrival, but I was never told that I would have to pay for my return to the airport. I found this failure to state that the hotel would provide only a pick up shuttle to be a deliberate non-disclosure. My advice is to avoid assumptions and get everything explicitly in writing. I think all in all this is probably a fairly typical hotel in the Sultanahmet area. I think I may have been able to find a better value, but this one was adequate.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent but overpriced\u201d", "Author": "ahatrack", "ReviewID": "UR115226978", "Content": "At a glance, Amiral Palace is a decent hotel in a very convenient location (just minutes from Blue Mosque and Aya Sophia).

My issues with Amiral Palace runs deeper. While I enjoyed my stay, it was far from perfect. To start, there was no clock in the room. The TV was also broken (not that we wanted to watch, but still), the in-room mini bar was NEVER restocked (even when we called the front desk to ask for more bottles of water). The showers were cramped (and clogged) and completely messy (impossible not to soak the floor). The free breakfast was barely edible. To add to the annoying inconveniences, there is also a dog tied up in the hotel's courtyard (which more accurately resembles a garbage pit) that barks tirelessly through the night. It's no wonder: the poor thing never seems to be taken off its two-foot-chain (even on really hot days when its only shelter is a patio chair). Heart breaking. Anyway, I digress.

The hotel has a spacious nicely decorated well lit lobby, the personnel is very hospitable, helpful and nice. The rooms are big, very clean, and the bathroom is clean and well equipped with consumables. The only negative thing is that the shower is fixed on the wall, and cannot be moved. Breakfast was served in a big room and the guests had a large variety to choose from (cheese, butter, gem, omlette, boiled eggs, tea, coffee, yoghurt, milk, raisins, dry apricots, apples, oranges, juice). Even though it is a 3 star hotel, the service is beyond 3 stars. The conditions offered by this hotel and its employees overtake many 3 star hotels in Paris. The location of the hotel is right in the center, just 5 minutes away from Hagia Sofia through Arasta Bazaar. Still it is a quiet area and very safe. You can negotiate the price if you stay longer. Message for the hotel: Thank you for a pleasant and quiet stay.

The location is convenient to Hagia Sofya, the Blue Mosque and most of the old part of the city. The room was clean, fairly small, but functional. The biggest issue was the noise. I was in room 208, which is located on the first floor above ground level and faces a side street. Both nights the garbage was picked up at about 2am. The first night the garbage collection lasted 15 minutes and fully woke me up. Probably smart to request a room on a higher floor and on the garden side. Although the staff was friendly, I found them somewhat unhelpful - particularly for an English speaker like me. I found the breakfast pretty bad.

Istanbul and the Amiral! The hotel is situated strategically. Close to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, the Sultanahmet hub, and on a quiet street for those who want some peace in the evenings. From the terrace you have a gorgeous view of the Marmara Sea on one side, and the Blue Mosque's imposing presence on the other. It is a minutes walk to next lane, if you favour some \"action\"in the evening. If you aren't eating at the hotel you can grab a bite from the local Kebab vendor or eat at a pub. The rooms are well decorated,extremely clean and reasonable in size. We got the largest room and believe me it was BIG according Istanbul standards. The staff works very hard to keep everything spotless.The building doesn't look spacious from the exterior but is of a decent size. The hotel staff are hospitable, gracious and extremely helpful. Patricia, Orhan, Cidam, Imam and everybody else..........a job well done! Now, for those who complain...... English speaking people tend to forget, that the language is not necessarily spoken everywhere. Resort to sign language and a smile....you'll go a long way. At the Amiral Palace Hotel , all your complaints are dealt with speed and with a smile. There is another point we must not forget. The concept of an American breakfast in a boutique hotel is almost non existent. I heard guests asking for a toast ie a square slice of toasted bread! This is Turkey and even though they eat lots of different kinds of breads you will not find a square loaf in the local market. Amiral gets freshly baked bread every morning from the baker in the vicinity. The breakfast is adequate and my suggestion to those who want a VERY lavish spread.....stay in a five star! The Turks serve a variety of cheeses, fresh fruit and veges. Eggs are normally boiled or scrambled. Indulge in eating olives, dried apricots, juicy watermelon, raisins, yoghurt......you couldn't get healthier. We would stay at the Amiral again and yet again...........I am dreaming of my next trip already!", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colombo", "Title": "\u201cIt was like staying with close friends\u201d", "Author": "Shazza04", "ReviewID": "UR26912519", "Content": "From our very first inquiry the Front Office & Sales Manager Mr. Yasin Deyirmenci's promptness, willingness to accommodate our many and varied requests and personal attention to detail, was a relief and pleasure to work with.

The only small issue is that not all the rooms get the Wi-Fi signal so some guests had to check email in the lobby. Other staff members namely Gorhan and Iman were equally helpful and friendly.
