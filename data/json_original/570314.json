The hotel is very near the railway station, one street back and two along towards the front of the station. The area was Ok, clean and felt safe. During commuting times there was a few people sell knock off handbags but that was about it. The area around the back of the railway station which is roughly ten street back from the hotel is a little salubrious with ladies of the night, beggars but felt safe but a little edgy. The hotel is a turn of last century building and no great beauty from the outside. It is built around two central courtyards and has busy roads on two sides. It has an Italian feel about it with lots of gilt mirrors, fussy paintings, big chandeliers and two marble and stone staircases. There are two lifts, a wonderful old cage life inside the stair well and a small modern one. The lift by reception can be busy as it serves the breakfast room as well but the other end of the hotel ones are quiet. The breakfast room was in the basement as the room terrace was not open until May. The reception is manned 24hrs and the stuff were helpful but night time staff had less command of English. They were quite happen to offer up tips, direction and book tickets over the web for no extra fee. The room was on the fourth floor at the side. It had the old single glazing and shutters plus modern double glazing and shutters so no street noise. The room must have been refurbished recently as the doors, bathroom and some furniture were new. There was a door card system with a keypad to say do not disturb, adjust air con, etc. The electronic system could be controlled by reception who could adjust thing like room temperature. On the first night the room was very hot as we found the air con came on during the night automatically to heat the room. Reception just said no problem I shall put the temperature down to 28! Room was good size, large window with huge drapes and ornate plaster ceiling. The bathroom made the room L shaped. There was a good shower, toilet, bidet and sink with cupboard underneath, soap and shampoo. Room was cleaned daily and towels changed daily. The room furniture was: Large mini bar and free electronic safe. Yes there was an open waldrobe with a curtain \u2013 couldn\u2019t see the issue myself. New bed, chairs, and padded bench. With old chipped fancy inlaid desk and side tables. Fancy lights and old paintings completed the Italian look. Overall nice to know which country you wake up in these days of the mass chain. The infamous breakfast buffet was overall very good value for money. It was very Italian i.e. cake, cake and cake of the day. Plus sweet bread, sliced bagged toast bread, ham, cheese, cereal, yogurt, tinned fruit salad, hot scrambled egg, bacon and pancakes. Some items would not appear but over 10 days that was the general selection. A person would check your room number at the door and then you found and table. A waitress would then come around to take your drink order. A peak times it was clear the system could not cope. The one poor waitress had to clear, set, take coffee orders and deal with shouting people waiting there one made to measure cup of coffee. If you are in hurry for coffee and not an Italian insisting on a made to measure cup then the system needs patience. Tip to the tourist: Make friends with you waitress/waiter at breakfast and ask for a pot. Understand your Italian coffees types well and a little Italian pays dividends. Learn the air con controls to avoid over heating. Get a high room at the side if you like open windows/hate air con. Tip to the owners: Get you breakfast system sorted now. Put heated plated with black filter coffee and hot water on the breakfast buffet for non Italians. People can still ask for made to measure coffee. Get the door staff more involved in the service as you are short staffed and poorly managed. The lady manageress should break am nail and help so she understand the basic issue. Would I go back again? Yes, it offers good, safe location. 2 minutes walk train station, 15 minutes walk coliseum. Good value and it felt non chain and Italian. Would I order the breakfast again? Yes, if offered very good value. Patience was tested on day one but by day 5 the staff bought what we wanted but day 10 without even an order. The items were not the finest but for the price well worth doing and choice was OK. The railway station would not offer cheaper value as the cheapest option was 1.80 black coffee and 3.50 salami roll and you would have to queue for that made to measure coffee twice. One to order and pay then wait again while made.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cA fine hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kazzakiwi", "ReviewID": "UR127794351", "Content": "This is a fine hotel, handy location, near the metro and airport shuttle.

We booked three rooms, all of which were different. The rooms were small but sufficient and clean. There were safes and refrigerators free of charge in the rooms. The beds were relatively comfortable, but the pillows were thin \"rocks\". The bathrooms were okay, though in my room it was dimly lit and there was no shower enclosure of any kind so the water from the shower ended up spraying all over the room, toilet and sink included; that was kind of a pain and made for a slippery floor throughout. Reviews on Trip Advisor suggested I ask for rooms at the back of the hotel which I did....BIG mistake. At 3 a.m. Friday morning a man spent an hour and a half loading a truck with laundry from nearby hotels. The noise was loud and kept us awake which made for a very tired group of people. There was additional alley noise the other two nights, but not as bad. We also had an issue with Internet access...the staff did NOT explain the policy well so we ended up paying for something we misunderstood; they told us they couldn't do anything about this issue. Overall the staff was okay, though not particularly friendly. The location is far from the airport, but that is the case if you want to be anywhere near any of the \"attractions\" in Rome. The hotel is not far from the Termini so that was convenient, though we found using public transportation in Rome was more difficult and people such as the bus drivers less helpful than in Barcelona from where we had come.

The metro and all buses converge at Termini where you can also find free wifi at the AutoGrill restaurant. Buy a 3 day tourist metro pass and off you go quickly to any point in Rome. The hotel charges 15 euro for 10 hours internet access in the lobby that you can start and stop. The rooftop was closed during our stay. The staff was not overly welcoming, didn't smile much and offered to allow us in our room early for 35 euros. We declined and decided to wait the 2 hours until official check in time. We sat in the lobby and decide to watch a movie on my daughters computer and within 30 minutes, the room was ready and they let us have it without further delay or cost. We appreciated it. The room was on the 5th floor, interior, ugly view basically nothing but on the positive side, it was relatively quiet. The room was clean and comfortable though not large. The bathroom was clean, water pressure and temperature good, and the shampoo/soaps were good quality. We booked through hotwire so the hotel was a surprise but for the basically $50 per night we paid, it was fine. The hotel charges and extra 3 euro per person per night Rome city tax that you pay at the end of your stay. On the street directly behind the hotel going away from Termini is a small restaurant in a cellar. The food is delicious and the people are charming. Prices are extremely reasonable as well. I would call this a three star hotel. It does have an overpriced spa which I suppose is why it's ranked 4 star but I think the rooms and services are more important to consider.

The price was very reasonable for its location and though I was expecting a tiny roman room, our room was enormous (we affectionately referred to it as our Roman apartment.) The location was good. The hotel is older and lacked personality but the basics were sufficient. Besides - when in Rome - who wants to hang around in the hotel??? CLEANLINESS: Our room was cleaned daily and kept up nicely. The linens were fair. Towels were fine but the blankets were thin and cheap. Sheets were clean with low thread count. Most importantly, however, everything was clean. Maid service was fine. The bathroom was very clean when we arrived and even the lobby bathroom was very well kept. Common areas were likewise fine. ROOM: Our room was HUGE. Though you hear the rooms in Rome are tiny, our room was the exception. See my pictures. We had booked a standard room and it had a couch, full chest of drawers, wardrobe, dining table and chairs and the bathroom was also nicely sized. The windows were a small with no view but again, who's staying in the room? The TV was small and but it did have a keyboard for interactive features. (We did not use it TV at all.) The room is best described as big, simple and clean. Hardwood floors, lower sloped ceiling so if you are super tall, you might feel a little boxed in. Our room was remarkably quiet though, we were on a corner of the building. ROOFTOP DECK: Wow! What a view! From the tallest deck, you feel you can see all of Rome. The deck was very well kept and beautiful. We grabbed a bottle of wine and lounged under the stars surrounded by 360 degrees of the city lights. I wanted to see the sunrise from there as well but the deck does not open until later morning. Also, the deck closes relatively early in the evening (and doesn't \"allow\" alcohol...) so keep this in mind. The jacuzzi tubs were not heated when we were there so we did not go in. BREAKFAST: Breakfast is served from the rooftop deck and is a great place to start your day, however, the quality of the food is not worth the price. Though it was a decent selection of foods, it was quite simple, toast, cheese, yogurt, few hot items and the hot items were marginal at best. Bakery items were also underwhelming. Cappuccino was good, however, and the service was fair. From a pure convenience standard, it was OK but also consider that breakfast did not get started until the later morning so if you did the breakfast included, you could be waiting around for it to start up and that is a waste of time when there is so much to see in Rome. If it were cheaper and started earlier, it might be a better value. I'd skip it. SERVICE: Front desk was fine. They spoke enough English and were patient when I spoke my poor Italian which was a mishmash of Spanish. As I mentioned, service at breakfast was fair, nothing bad, nothing good. Maid staff were pleasant if you passed them in the hallways. We were provided help with our bags when we arrived because you have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the elevator. No concierge which is expected at a 4-star hotel. Also, a 4-star would have much better English speakers. LOCATION: It is a short walk from the Termini station so if you are traveling by train, it is fantastic. We had well-wheeled luggage so we just walked there, no problem! Piazza della Repubblica is right down the street and just another 10 minute walk gets you to the Colosseum area. There are many restaurants nearby and a few small grocery stores. The neighborhood is fine and a good jumping-off point for seeing the city. We walked everywhere and found the location of the Hotel just-right for our home base. Compared to the other hotels we looked at, Piram was very reasonable for its location. Though it is older, has few luxuries and no whistles or bells, the room size was fantastic, location was great and the rooftop deck was amazing. It is NOT a 4-star by any stretch of the imagination but the price was not 4-star for Rome either - fair enough! The lobby was quaint and elevator was TINY!

I sent an email few days before my arrival asking for information in case of late arrival. The answer was at least rude. 2.

However, we were informed that the roof was close (and breakfast would be in the basement), we ask to have access only to enjoy the view, but we did not have any answer. b) We included the full access to the spa, with sauna and pool. But again, at our arrival we were informed that the pool was closed and only the sauna was working. When we used the sauna we had to change in a bathroom leaving our clothes over the basin & toilet with the articles of all other passengers. 3) Finally, in spite of that in general employees were cordial: one young lady in reception (afternoon shift) was particularly aggressive and rude with my friend and then with me with no reason. (I tend to assume that is the same person who replies my email). (Curly black hair) So, I paid for a room in a good hotel including breakfast in the terrace and access to the spa.

Unfortuneatly we got a room with no windows (there are a few of them actually!), but at least we didn't notice any noise. The beds aren't very comfortable, but it was just fine. The drain in the shower was clogged though, so when we had a shower, the water went all the way into the bedroom, but it was okay. Marble floors, so nothing got soaked, and we just let them know when we left. The man in the reception laughed it away and said that \"we create pool...for you!!\" He was so funny, he almost made everything worth it! The staff is not snippy, sour or angry. I think it depends on where you're from. Maybe if you're from the US, you are used to the staff always having a fake glued-on smile, but we're from Norway, so it's not uncommon that people don't always smile while talking. I found the staff quite pleasant and helpful. If you can afford to stay somewhere else, DO IT. But if you're on a budget and you just need somewhere to sleep for a weekend, this place is just fine.

On arrival we were told to pay the full price of the 3 night stay - 211 euros. We thought this was a bit odd but paid as we had had such a good stay 2 years ago. The problems started when we were given our key to Room 152 and told it was on the 1st floor. However, there are no signs on the walls of the 1st floor to indicate where our room was located. Unfortunately, the room numbers jumped from 126 to 151 but we only realised this after about 10 minutes of searching for 152 !! When we had booked we had requested Soya milk for breakfast and on checking in we were told this had been arranged. When we went for our first breakfast, we were asked to pay 10 euros each for breakfast even though we had booked for English breakfast when we had booked on the internet. I had to go back to our room to get the email confirming our stay to show the waitress that we had English breakfast. She then accepted this. However, when we asked for the soya milk, she could not find it!! I have an allergy to all dairy products so soya milk is quite important. She said they would go and get some and it would take only 5 minutes. In fact it took nearer 15 minutes. When the carton arrived , I asked for it to come to the table in the carton. However, for some reason, it was brought in a jug and it was hot !! So they had to go and get a 2nd carton !! More delay !! We had hoped for a Full English breakfast but the only hot food were some scrambled eggs and some very greasy and fatty bacon !! A major problem is that although the waitresses were quite helpful they hardly understood any English. Our room did not have any BBC channels except for BBC World News and even this did not work !! We complained to the reception staff who tried to fix it but without success. After a day or so it did eventually work. The air conditioning did not work and the room was heated at 24 degrees. Again I queried this with reception but got no help but was simply told it was working - which it did not !! The shower room was a wet room which would have been fine except there were about a dozen or so small mosaic style tiles missing off the floor which was potentially dangerous. The shower only had a cheap shower curtain and there was evidence of mould. The mirrored cabinet on the bathroom wall was fixed far too high and my shorter partner could only just see into it. The room was quite spacious but there were handles missing off some of the furniture and one drawer would not open. The double bed had only one thin pillow on each side. The duvet did not have a cover and was stained with what looked like body fluids. We asked for it to be changed but all we got was one thin blanket. We were promised a replacement duvet the next day but this did not arrive !! There was no plug in the sink and there were no tea/coffee making facilities.

Also, it takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the Colleseum and it is very close to other attractions (you will be impressed how close everything in Rome is!). Frankly speaking, because of the location, we never used any taxis or other public transport. It took us about an hour or so to walk to the city of Vatican, but we did not mind, cause there was a lot of different attractions along the way. The room was not particularly big, but I very much appreciated the high ceilings! I am not sure about other rooms, but, unfortunately, there was a lack of natural light, which we did not mind, cause this let us sleep a bit longer and we were never in the room during the daytime anyway. Yes, unfortunately, there was no decent wardrobe in the room. The bathroom was very nice. It was quite small, but there was everything you need including a hairdryer. Quite a lot of space in the shower itself. The air conditioning was perfect (not quite sure how come everyone had a problem with it). There were about 20 channels you could watch, but unfortunately only a few of them were English. The room was promptly cleaned every afternoon.

The rooms were clean and the bed was not to uncomfortable. Rome is a warm place, so we made sure our hotel offered air conditioning. Well this hotel claims to have AC but when we got there it was \"broken\". Every staff member had a different version of \"broke\" and if it was all rooms or some room and how long it had been out and when it would be working, we felt that the staff was just not being truthful about the situation. So the AC did not work, they commended sleeping witht the windows open, well the hotel is on a pretty busy road, so it was very loud with the window open and it was not much cooler with it open because again rome is warm. I asked for a different room, one that was not situated on the busy road since one with AC was not an option, well the new room was not on the road but in the middle of the hotel and the window opened to the small alley way with no breeze what so ever, and there were people (maybe restaurant staff) in the alley making a lot of noise. So again sleep was not possible. The las night we were there the AC was \"working\", it was blowing air at least, just not very cold air. When they came to the room to fix the AC they told me not to touch the control on the wall, so you are stuck with whatever temp and setting they pick. I can understand that things break, and if the AC was actually broken the staff was not very considerate. The staff seemed more annoyed by us asking the status of the AC, and did not offer any customer service to make up for the huge inconvenience to thier guest. My personal oppinon is that if your hotel is not running at close to 100% and your guest are suffering because of this you should offer a little customer service, a meal? A fan? Or how about a \"I am really sorry\" if nothing else. The location was not bad, close to tour bus stops (dont buy the bus they sell at hotel you can find it cheaper).

They seemed confused and clearly did not have record of our reservation at all. Also I had paid an added 35 Euros for early check-in and breakfast. We arrived between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM. It took close to two hours for them to resolve the check-in issue. This was the deal they promoted: \"1 x Early Check-in @ \u20ac35.00 For 2 people Why don't you take advantage of our special early check-in? Your room will be available whenever you want and we will be glad to offer you: -Breakfast for 2 people in the room or Buffet Breakfast or -5 euro voucher to be spent for Food & Beverage\" Clearly the room was not ready \"whenever we wanted\". They tried to be helpful but the delay was off-putting and they did not seem at all apologetic, though this could be the language/culture barrier. We did not feel all that \"Welcome\" that's for sure. We did get into our room before the check-in time but not in time for breakfast. They honored the commitment with a coupon for lunch at their location and despite my request that the additional 35 Euro charge for \"early check-in and breakfast\" be dropped they said we did get early check in because 3 PM is regular check in and they gave us a coupon for lunch. Was not worth more time spent discussing it so we went on with our day. Lesson learned...if booking by internet also phone in advance to ensure things will be place on arrival. Don't bother with the early check-in deal. For 35 Euros (for two people) it was not worth it. As for the room it was large and very clean. More than suitable for a family of 4 (two teens aged 14 and 17). Air conditioned room but did not get very cool...not really a big issue as it was comfortable enough even if a bit warm and humid. Teeny tiny TV on the wall (didn't matter because we were not there to watch TV of course but we did have a laugh at it). Location is close to Termini and within walking distance if you don't have too much luggage. Lots of nearby restaurants and easy walking (or metro access) to all the sites of Rome. Would feel safe walking around area alone during daylight but not at night. Food is average...breakfast was mostly pastries that did not seem fresh and were not all that tasty. Lunch was okay. Lots of options for food nearby so I would go elsewhere. Overall for accomodation the hotel is quite nice but due to the check-in issues and the overall reception we got I don't think I would stay there again. I am sure this is not everyone's experience...maybe we just hit a bad day...as I said at the start our friends spoke well of the place and had a good experience there.

The last night we were moved to another room. The front desk people had absolutely no respect for their customers. The management simply did not care.

We had arrived on an early flight, and so were not allowed to check in until 4pm, however we did use the luggage room located close to reception, which was useful as this meant we could sightsee and then come back for check-in!. The hotel is well located, near Termini and a short walk from the Trevi fountain and Spanish steps. This was useful when getting a bus from the airport (4 euros) as it was only a street or so walk. For the journey back we used the taxi service attached to the hotel, which although was expensive was very reliable (i had used this service previously with my friends and both times the driver turned up 15mins early!). The decor and amenities were very good, although it was a shame that i had not read about the hot tub's on the roof garden before going and had not taken a swimsuit - it wouldve been very nice to relax in after a hard days walk!. We also opted for the breakfast which was quite nice, with about the choice you would expect for a continental breakfast in any hotel. Only a few faults to note. As described in alot of posts there was some issues with air-conditioning. We found that when we tried to get it to work that it wouldnt. When we gave up however it did seem to work on its own and so we set the temperature when we first entered the room and left it, It would then eventually work of its own accord about 90% of the time!. Also the roof garden also seems to be expensive. We used this on the first night and were charged 12 euros for a beer and a glass of wine. We therefore only used the bar the once! The hotel doesnt look much from the outside (as also noted in other posts), however i dont think this really matters as the hotel inside is lovely and has a nice decor. I would definately consider using this hotel again if i were to travel back to rome, as it is comfortable and good value for money.

We had booked through hotels.com and had also seen their webpage, and were convinced that this would be a nice stay (beautiful rooms, spa you name it!). First we were quite surprised how difficult it was to find the hotel, but of course when the fa\u00e7ade looks like it could need some serious TLC you don\u2019t expect it to be a 4* hotel. We were \u201cmet\u201d by the most obnoxious receptionist, with a sleazy smile and at look saying \u201cI\u2019m so much better than you\u201d. After telling him our names, he smiled even more and started to tell us that he had some WOOONDERFUL news for us. Unfortunately a complete floor (so much for not checking with tripadvisor first:(\u2026didn\u2019t have time)was closed, so he couldn\u2019t give us our room. BUT! He was such a kind fellow that he would give us this fantastic apartment just a short walk from the hotel, much better than a room! Already here we got quite suspicious. We tried to say that we wanted the room we had booked, since two of the friends we were travelling with also had a room there. That was not possible, and he would not listen at all. He could not understand why we weren\u2019t happy when he had given us this fantastic opportunity. We were quite tired, and didn\u2019t want to quarrel, so we settled for this \u201cfantastic\u201d apartment. (we later heard that our friends had gotten the same story with closed floor and apartment, but they managed to get their room at last). My friend negotiated that we should at least get free breakfast for the inconvenience. With a sleazy smile he claimed that we already had gotten a better option than we had booked for, but OK. After the \u201cshort\u201d walk (not very short with two heavy suitcases!), we got into the apartment which was not that great at all. Seemed like it had not been cleaned in ages (dust everywhere, trash on the floor, stinky trash under sink not emptied \u2026.I could go on). My friend checked our beds at once: BIG YELLOW SPOT on the sheets. Went back to the hotel and complained (the staff seems like we should be grateful for that they even bother to listen to us) we were promised new sheets. To be sure it was done (and nothing got stolen\u2026.we had already lost all trust now) we followed the guy. When we got back to the apartment, well, you did not have to speak Italian to understand what the guy was saying! After the session of Italian swearing, he tried to convince us that it was not a spot but how the light was falling on the sheet! But if we really wanted it, he would change the sheets free of charge(!damn right you will!). Other things that should be mentioned are that there were electric wires sticking out everywhere, also in the shower!! They also wanted a credit card as safety when we checked in, even if the hotel was prepaid (never tried that before). We had a terrible night\u2019s sleep, since the walls were paper thin (neighbors watching TV all night) and because we felt very unsafe (if they could move us here, give us dirty sheets etc, what else could they do). In the morning we of course had to walk all the way back to the hotel to get our breakfast, which was terrible, but this was no surprise. So to sum it up: terrible TERRIBLE staff, terrible rooms (I can only speak for the apartment, but our friends room was no better), terrible feeling of being conned and a joke of a breakfast. Happy we only were staying for one night. I could have tolerated this from a hostel, 1 * hotel etc, but not from a claimed 4* hotel for 100\u20ac a night! They even had a sign on the front desk that they were traveller's choice on tripadvisor.com, which is not true!

We were then told our room still wasn't ready and that it would be five minutes. At 2:30 p.m. we inquired when our room would be ready, and were told in five minutes. About 2:45 we were walked over to the apartment building by one of the employees of the hotel. The lift (elevator) wasn't working and we had to carry our luggage up 5 flights of stairs. We then learned from other tourist and employee's of the building that the elevator routinely and daily went out of service and was not reliable. We were told to dial 9 to reach the hotel lobby if we had questions. Our phone in the room could not reach the hotel as suggested and just rang into the other room in the apartment. We borrowed the phone 3 times from a business next to the apartment and were told the elevator would be working in 5 minutes. It still was not working by 4:00 pm. We then borrowed a phone again and were told to come back to the hotel and they would give us a full refund. We booked another hotel on the way back to the Welcome Piram. When arriving at the Welcome Piram we were greeted (for lack of a better word) by the most rude and obnoxious person - that I have ever met in my 49 years. He said there would be no refund and that the elevator would be working in 5 minutes. I tried to explain that we had already wasted an entire afternoon of our vacation with empty promises of \"5 minutes\" and were told by numerous other tourist in the building as well as employees that the elevator was always breaking and always a problem. He talked over us and would not budge on his position until we made a scene in the lobby and demanded to speak to a supervisor. Finally, at 5:30 pm we were given a refund. I would not recommend this hotel with this type of customer service to ANYONE. I understand that the apartment is a different building then the hotel, but the customer service is the same. The employee in question was named \"Nicola\" He was the rudest, and most arrogant person I have ever talked to in customer service. He laughed in our face and talked over us the entire time.

Our demands are quite modest: Good location, Clean room, Air condition, hot shower - We don't expect any luxury. Pros: Location, Location, Location ************************************* The hotel's location is excellent - just near the Termini station, Rome's public transportation hub. This means we had a airport train, Italy train, metro and bus station 500 meters from our room. This saves lots of time and money on Airport transportation, eases the access to all city parts which are near a metro station (mainly the Colosseum and the Vatican) and most important - after the metro closes at 21:00, every second bus arrives to the Termini so we don't have to switch buses or start planning itineraries when we're drunk at 01:00. We also took a day trip to Venice, which was easy because we could find out the costs and depart early from the station. Furthermore, Rome's center isn't that big, so many times we just walked to our destination in order to feel the spirit of the city. The neighbourhood feels safe, well lighten, and has some late-night restaurants open, so walking wasn't scary. Cons: Air condition, cleanliness, hot water, tax ************************************************** * There was NO AIR CONDITION, and we stayed at late may. After we have struggled with it for 10 minutes, we called the reception. They told us it's due to a city regulation. We didn't find any reference to it on the web. Furthermore, the staff wouldn't provide us with any ventilator. We had to sleep with an open window, and wake up from the sounds of the near nightclub, the morning garbage truck and other city voices. This is totally unacceptable in a 200$/night hotel. * The shower and toilet wasn't neatly cleaned. We found some hairs of the previous guest in all over the toilet room. It really, really sucks. We took a shower with our sandals on because we didn't trust the hygiene level. This would be outrageous in a 30$ youth hostel double room, let alone a a 200$/night hotel. * There was only warm, not hot, water in the shower. Again, this really, really sucks. We walked many kilometers each day, and came back to the hotel dying for a hot shower to relax hour muscles. After we found out the water wasn't hot, we called the staff. They promised to help, but did nothing. Again, This would be outrageous in a 30$ youth hostel double room, let alone a a 200$/night hotel. * When we arrived, the receptionist told us that there was an extra 30-euros tax (3 euros per person per night). That's a good policy for a youth hostel, but when you charge such a high price for the room, I expect the taxes to be included in the price. * Breakfast was OK. Summary ********** Neighbourhood's excellent, hotel sucks. Try to find another hotel on that side of the Termini.

The hotel is in a good location, beware though, if you catch the Leonardo Express train from Fumunciano Airport to Termini the platform is to the far left of the station. It takes at least 10 minutes to walk from one end of the station to the other. The hotel is then 100metres away. The lobby and reception are small and uninviting, the lifts seem to take forever to arrive. I had read reviews before I left and from recommendations I requested a room facing the street on the second floor...sadly this request was overlooked. We had a room on the forth floor (424) which overlooked an alley. The beds were comfortable but only one pillow each and the TV was so high and far away from the bed it was uncomfortable to watch. The \"safe\" was not actually attached to anything and could be lifted out of the cupboard that it was in....when my husband queried this, he was told that most of the rooms are like it. We knew that it was a continental breakfast but they were clearly under staffed. The food was not being replensihed fast enough and it took us ages to get a waitress to clean our table. We waited a long time for a tea and a coffee and there was no chance of a second cup! There was no orange juice which was also a shame. This was sold to us by Lastminute.com as a 4 star hotel but I felt that 3 star would be more appropriate. Friends were staying in a 4 star around the corner and it was far superior.

Down the road was a good 10 minute walk from the hotel itself. The apartment was not a 4* apartment, it was grotty and smelly and not satisfactory at all. Thankfully I had a friend in Rome who spoke the language and she managed to make such a fuss that they eventually gave us a room in the hotel. The girl behind the desk even told my friend that as we booked the package through lastminute, that was the reason that we were not put up in the hotel. The hotel itself is noisy, we couldn't have the door open to the balcony as the bins were emptied daily. The cleaners don't really clean the room, they make the bed and that is about it. We put our towels in the bidet so that the maid would give us fresh but they just hang the towels up over the shower (as there is no where to hang the towels in the bathroom). We had to actually put the towels on the floor before they would give us fresh. The room is small but you could live with that if everything else was good, it does have a safe and a mini bar but really no hanging space for clothes, no coffee making facilities, no free internet, the list could go on.

My boyfriend and I stayed there 4 nights. At our arrival, we were astonished by the front of the hotel, it looked quite old, like if it hadn't been restored for years... Especially when we compared its walls with the walls of the 3* hotel next to Wecome Piram (which looked quite better!). Anyway, when we arrived at 13.50 (chech-in is at 14) we had to deal with one unfriendly, sulky blonde that told us that she wasn't sure our room was ready so we had to wait till 14. I agree with other people who say that reception staff is unpleasant.. It is true, we had the same feeling! The blonde asked for our ID and she also asked for a credit card (she did the same with other clients). She told me she needed the credit card as security... but this is the FIRST TIME hotel staff has asked me for my credit card number... This was quite unpleasant too (we had the feeling they didn't \"trust\" their clients) and besides I didn't like the girl's attitude on the whole. She gave us a room at the second floor. The room was really small... I wouldn't probabily say anything about the room size if Welcome Piram was a 3* hotel, but since it is rated as 4* you'd expect to find the qualities you normally find in 4* hotels. Well, the room is definitely small for a hotel that claims itself a 4*! We had also a small bathroom (you can't hang the towels, 'cos there's nowhere to hang them, as other have said in previous reviews). However our room was clean and the towels were changed when we needed new ones. Breakfast is very very poor. We usually woke up at 9 and when we arrived downstairs there wasn't much left. A few off-the-shelves cakes (cut in tiny tiny pieces...), small pieces of bread, rusks, jam, butter, cheese and two kinds of watery juice: red orange and pineapple. Sometimes we couldn't find spoons or glasses and we had to queue, waiting for our glass ('cos there were other people waiting before us...). Sometimes we had to wait for the juice, 'cos there were just two jugs...Well I know the hotel is very crowded, but I guess they could try to manage breakfast better than that!! Anyway, as I have said, breakfast is quite poor and there is very little choice... If you didn't pay for breakfast in your booking, you can go in a bar and get a coffee and a croissant... I think it would be better than a breakfast-waste of money... We had to ate everyday the same tastless things. The nights at Wecome Piram were a nightmare, at least for us... We didn't manage to get a quiet sleep not even one night during our stay... The hotel is very noisy, at least for us! In the room next to ours there were some Americans guys... They came back every morning at 3 a.m. and they chatted like if they were in the streets at 3 p.m... They spoke in a loud voice, guffawed... We could hear everything, 'cos the walls are very thin.. So if you happen to have some neighbours like that... Well you won't sleep much! Then at 8.30 we were woked up (every morning) by cleaning women cleaning the upstairs room.. In that case also we could hear everything (when they walked around the room, when they moved forniture, when they sweeped). And finally, our last night we were woked up not by our friends in the room next to ours (they left the hotel the same morning) but by garbage collector... He stayed in the street with the garbage truck for at least 40 minutes, and it was such noisy... So, as others advised.. Bring ear plugs, just in case! Maybe you'll get a room facing the main street or a side street (our room faced a side street, but it was very noisy all the same, also because of the cleaning staff), and in that case you'll definitely need them. So to sum up... I guess the only pro of Welcome Piram is its location... (the metro/bus stops are really close and you're just a 25-min walk away from the Colosseum)...

Because everyone else was doing the same thing, we then had to queue up again to be given the key! We found the staff at the reception desk to be surly & unfriendly. The room was large but very sparsely furnished with a tiny flat screen t.v on the wall with a wire hanging from it, which was designed to be plugged into a computer for internet etc. The t.v didn't work properly - we couldn't access the internet (which the hotel charged 7 Euros to use). All we managed to get was an Italian children's channel. There was absolutely no information available in the room either about the hotel itself or sightseeing etc. When we used the shower in the evening, we had no hot water, which we complained about at reception and were told that it was because everyone else had used it! The one plus plus point about the room was the bed, which was large & comfortable. The breakfast was absolute rubbish - small pieces of bread with cheap \"plastic\" ham & cheese, bits of cake & croissants, tinned fruit & a watery juice drink. The tea/coffee was served by unfriendly girls who didn't crack a smile. We have both travelled a lot and have stayed at many hotels. This hotel would not be given a 4 star rating if it was in London - would recommend Rome but would not stay here again.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWelcome Piram-very central\u201d", "Author": "PinkFarmer", "ReviewID": "UR89751405", "Content": "We booked this through lastminute.com for 5 nights.

The hotel is very clean and very nicely decorated, the rooms are nice and spacious, and the hotel is in an excellent location. Here is an honest, but long, review of our experience: Pros: Location is perfect (location is also a con because central Rome is very NOISY). Situated within close proximity to two Metro stations: Termini (main station in Rome) and Repubblica. Only about a 25 minute walk to the Colosseum and there are many restaurants and shops in the area. The complimentary breakfast was great and included baked goods (donuts, croissants, cake), cereal, freshly squeezed juices, fruit (from a can), milk, water, coffee, tea, cappuccino. The breakfast staff was hard-working and courteous and made sure that guests had what they needed. There were 2 bell-boys while we there and they were both the friendliest people in the hotel and we really enjoyed their big smiles every day! One day our room was not cleaned, but this was resolved with a quick call to the front desk. One of the bell-boys brought us up what we needed (towels, TP, etc.) and he was so kind and pleasant. I hope the management is aware of how great and courteous their bell-boys are! The cleaning staff was also very pleasant and did a great job. We were able to check in 30 minutes early (1:30pm), probably because the front desk staff felt bad for us because were falling asleep in the lobby! We got to the hotel around 9:00am and we were able to use the restrooms and provide all of our check in information, check our bags, and we were provided with a map of the city. The gentleman who checked us in was nice, but there was a female front desk rep who snapped at me when I asked if we could check in before 2:00 (we came back from exploring the city around 1:00pm). She was NOT so pleasant, and we were grateful that the \"nice\" guy let us check in a little early. Cons: The hotel staff (front desk) is friendly, but they do not seem to care all that much about customer satisfaction. Maybe it's just their attitude, but they were difficult to figure out. The bag storage room in the reception area is NOT locked and anyone can walk into it. While there was always someone staffed at the front desk, it was still a little disconcerting that our bags were not secured. The bell-boy was not there when we were able to check into our room, so the front desk staff told us to get our bags from the closet (instead of offering to help us), so we had to maneuver around the closet and other guests' bags. We really could have taken anything from that closet, but we did not, because we are good people. The hotel restaurant is just OK, and NOT worth visiting for dinner. We ate dinner there one night and our server was not very friendly. There are so many other options in the area with better food and lower or comparable prices, so we do NOT recommend wasting your time with dinner here. One of the hotel owners or managers or someone important dined in the restaurant with his significant other and their DOG, and the DOG received better and more courteous treatment than we did! The dog had it's own little pillow seat and water dish and we could not even get TAP WATER (we were denied tap water and told it was not an option, even though it is served at breakfast in the same restaurant). Internet access is expensive. We did not bring a laptop, but you can access the Internet from the TV in the room. We were explained the rates when we checked in and chose NOT to use the Internet. It was something like $10 for 24 hours or $15 for something else. There is a great Internet/copy/fax place a short walk away on Via Napoli, so don't waste your money on Internet access at the hotel. Lastly, the A/C in the hotel was turned off (November), so our room was very hot. It took me 1 visit and 4 calls to the front desk to finally be informed that the A/C was off and our only option was to \"open the window\". Of course, with the window open we could NOT SLEEP BECAUSE ROME IS A VERY LOUD CITY! So, this is why we rated the sleep quality so low. Overall, we would recommend this hotel because it is in a great location and it is a great value. But, bring earplugs and try to get a room NOT facing the street, if you choose to stay here!

The hotel offered a 20% off deal for a 4-night stay, plus we got a further 10% off through Expedia so it was very affordable 4-star at $107 AUD/night. The room featured the main room with king size bed, drawers, TV, safe, and small wardrobe. There was also a small space (not really a room because it didn't have doors, but it separated the main room and bathroom) which was very handy for storing suitcases! The bathroom contained a shower, sink, toilet and bidet. The shower and hand basin were good sized, but if I was the designer, I would have swapped the location of the toilet and bidet. The toilet was jammed into the corner of the room and you needed to sit down whilst navigating around the hand basin. However, the bidet had clear access (a bit annoying since we didn't plan on using it). Still, it was not a terribly tight squeeze, just an unusual design choice. We were also fortunate enough to get the one room (on the second floor) with the old-style balcony overlooking the street. There were a few tiny balconies on rooms at the back of the hotel but they overlooked an Asian restaurant so might not have been quite so enticing to open at night. It was very well located, near Termini station, so when we arrived from the airport, we just took the train from the airport to Termini then walked ~5-7 minutes to the hotel. It was quite easy to find (good, because it was after midnight by the time we arrived at Termini). We chose to walk to the Colosseum, Forum, etc, because it was advertised as \"15 minutes walk\". It's not. It's actually more like 25 minutes walk and if you're doing it in the heat of the day, it's a bit unpleasant. We could have chosen to take the local rail network to the station at the Colosseum but preferred to stroll down and buy icecream whenever we needed a break (we have been to Rome before and were just visiting a few sites this time instead of trying to cram EVERYTHING in). The hotel has a laundry service but it's overpriced, of course, if you're travelling on a budget. We chose to walk a couple of blocks to the self-service laundromat and just do it ourselves. The reception desk can help you find it by giving you a brochure that has a map to the laundromat. Be sure to stress you're looking for the \"self service\" laundromat - my first attempt at getting directions from one of the reception staff led me to the nearest dry cleaners, not a laundromat. When you exit the front door of the hotel to go there, if you turn left, you'll know you've been given the directions to the dry cleaner - you must turn to the right. The hotel includes breakfast in the price but it was not a good breakfast unless you went early. If you arrived at the middle-end part of the breakfast timeslot, you didn't get the full pick of pastries, etc, and the two types of juice were \"weird tasting sickly sweet pink\" and \"I think it's grapefruit but can't be sure\"...

This hotel nears the Termini station which is a good start to explore the city. However, it was quite difficult to find this hotel because they do not have big signage. They just write 'hotel' at the front door so you need to ask someone to get to this hotel. A useful tip to find this hotel in when you come from Termini station, go straight to the Termini bus station and cross the road in front of the bus station. Walk for about two blocks and you can see this hotel at the corner of the road. The breakfast was ok but limited choices of meals. They just had bread, cheese, bacon, pastry, cereal, fruit and yogurt. For us it was acceptable because it was included with the room. So we do not bother so much about the breakfast. Please beware when using the facilities in the room. They have flat screen tv in the room but you have to pay for the movies you watch. Internet cable was provided but you have to pay as well. The air condition was set to just 25c and you cannot adjust the temperature. This was quite annoyed for us because because the weather outside reaching 32c.

First off, this place is not anywhere close to a 4 star hotel. It's a 2-3 star hotel. I've never written this bad of a review for a hotel before, so allow me a chance to elaborate... Our room was on the 6th floor, in what appeared to be a separate but adjacent building. To get there, you first had to walk up stairs, then take an elevator to the 5th floor, then walk to the other end of the building, then walk up more stairs (or take an ancient manually-operated elevator), then walk down the hall to the room. I've never been to a hotel that was so difficult to get to my room. The \"double bed\" room was really just two single beds pushed together. At some point when I climbed into bed, part of the bed broke off from underneath. Now I weight about 180 lbs, so there's no excuse there! The shower was terrible. Imagine a stream like you would get from a garden hose, and that's what came from the shower head. The water was only lukewarm, except very early one morning when the temperature was fine. At any other time it was warm enough (for me) to take a shower when turned all of the way up, but others may find it not quite warm enough. The bathroom contained no towel rack. Towels were provided on a chair in the main room. The worst part of the stay was the awful air conditioner, which sounded like a helicopter taking off, when it worked that is. Most of the time it would not even work. It would turn on for about 45 seconds, then shut off for 5 minutes or so, and repeat this cycle. The end result was 1) we were never able to sleep, since it was so loud, and 2) the room never cooled off adequately. Eventually we resorted to buying citronella candles and leaving the window open at night. While most hotel breakfasts in Italy are poor my American standards, this one was the worst of all. While some breads were available, there was not one single piece of fruit. Also, on the first morning we ordered coffee but the waitress never brought it to us. We decided not to try for coffee again on future mornings. The only nice things was what appeared to be red-colored orange juice, which I've never seen before and was quite tasty. Contrary to other people's opinions about the location, I actually liked the location. It was a couple of blocks away from the main train station, which made it convenient to get just about anywhere. There were many restuarants in the area, though we were only able to find a couple of bars nearby. I can't believe the rave reviews that this place has been given. I can't emphasize more that this place should be avoided.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cVery happy with this hotel - great location!\u201d", "Author": "MisterDOS", "ReviewID": "UR67886039", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel during Easter of 2010. We were in Rome for 6 nights and pre-booked four of them at this hotel over the Internet before we got there. My girlfriend doesn't like the idea of being tied down for a whole trip at one place, and we thought we might spend a night or two in Assisi or somewhere. But after our first few nights, we liked this hotel a lot and added on the other two nights. This hotel was very nice for the price and the staff were great. But the main benefit of staying here is the perfect location. You are only approximately one-and-a-half blocks from the Termini train station that you can use to get everywhere else. You are directly on the A line that takes you to the Vatican, etc. (we found it most convenient to hop on this line at the Piazza de Repubblica station) and you are also directly on the B line that takes you down to the Colosseum (use Termini station). You are within a very short walking distance of all of the central sites: Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, etc. I guess there are places to stay that are closer to the Pantheon or down in the Trastavere area, but then you would sacrifice being so close to the Termini (metro lines, trains for daytrips, etc.) When we checked in, since it was Easter, we needed to pick up tickets for a Vatican event and we were going to head to the Vatican to get them. But, as an afterthought, I asked the man at the desk where the street address (of the ticket place) was and he gave me a map and drew directions. It was actually down by the Trevi Fountain, so that saved us a huge amount of hassle. Our room was clean, breakfast was ok (not super) but it was nice to order cappucinos in the morning and have them custom-made for free. The hot/warm water situation (often a problem in less expensive European hotels) was not any problem for us. We had a wonderful stay. My only suggestion to the hotel staff is this: The Termini is big and kind of confusing for out-of-towners. The Metro system is easy - I am talking about catching a train to Assisi, Sienna, etc. If I owned the Welcome Piram hotel, I would capitalize off the proximity to the Termini station and offer a map or guide to the train station and catching trains to various locations. For example, we had no problem using the ATM-style ticket machine to buy our tickets to Assisi, but when it came time to catch the train, we had to figure out that we were looking for a train bound for Perugia. By pure luck, we ended up on the right train.

We were happy with the location of the Hotel Welcome Piram. It is about a five minute walk from the Termini train station. If you take the Leonardo Express from Fiumicino Airport to the Termini, it will cost only14 E each and eliminate the necessity of dealing with cab drivers in Rome. In front of the Termini there are buses that will take you anywhere you want to go in Rome, including the No. 40 Express to St. Peter's. As well, there is a Metro Station at the Termini and a 7 day ticket is 16 E a person. By using a combination of Metro and Bus, we were able to visit the San Callisto Catacombs and the Appian Way on our own. It's about 2 miles from the hotel to St. Peter's if you like walking. Beware of Roman drivers while crossing the streets! My word of advice about Rome is to avoid at any cost the restaurants that are close to the main tourist attractions. They know they will never see you again anytime soon and their food reflects it. We got caught once and had without a doubt the worst lasagne and spaghetti carbonara known to man. There are many restaurants and cafes within walking distance of the hotel,our favourite being Pastarito, V. Gioberti 25, about two blocks away.

We stayed at the Piram Hotel for 5 nights and to be fair the hotel is very clean, the rooms are large for a European hotel and it is very well located. The problem with this hotel is the staff. Upon checking in we were dealing with 2 young men whose focus was more on having fun and joking around than in helping customers. During our check-in they took our passports and asked us to wait a few minutes while they wrote down the information. It just so happens that during this time another front desk employee by the name of Santos came on and picked up a call from a guest who was asking about the air conditioners and why the couldn't change the temp. He explained that it was computerized and by the sound of it the guest did not figure out that by this he meant that they had no control over it. Finally he relayed the message that the air conditioners were not able to be used or turned on until June 1st (which by the way was not true, they were turned on May 27th). After he hung up the phone he just kept say \"Stupid Americanos\" to his co-workers and expecting them to laugh. He apparently didn't figure it out that we were two Americanos sitting less than 3 feet away and his co-workers also didn't see the need to stop him from repeating himself several times. Also, when we got in the room we tried using the shower and the shower head was so old and dilapidated that more water poured out of the side of it, over the shower doors and onto the bathroom floor than what was left for us to shower in. We complained about this every single day that we were there and the responses each day ranged from a shrug of the shoulders to an off hand comment about the shower being for more than one person. After 5 days it still wasn't fixed even with a pool of water in their bathroom every single day. All in all if you need minimal assistance and end up with a working bathroom you're ahead staying here, but if you expect to be respected and you are unlucky enough to be a \"Stupid Americano\" who might need assistance from the front desk, you might want to find some other place to stay", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "croctad", "ReviewID": "UR65651159", "Content": "The Piram Hotel is well-priced and of moderate luxury, with a continental breakfast included in your package.

The good This hotel is in a great location, close to the terminal and metro stations, lots of nice caf\u00e9\u2019s and restaurants in the area. The bed was quite firm, this was ok for us (down to personal taste). Room was a good size and fairly clean. TV was pretty cool, lots of programs in many languages. The Bad Breakfast was ok although a little crazy at times, not really enough staff (they were working flat out) for the amount of people. Food was pretty basic (ham, cheese, bread, cakes, juice and coffee). Lift was so slow, might as well take the stairs. Front desk staff were ok maybe a bit moody. The Ugly. The bathroom and the noise. Lets start with the bathroom, small, and I mean so small you had to step over the toilet and then the bidet, to get into the shower (which was at best warm). The noise was the worst part, even with the double glazing, secondary glazing and wooden shutters closed it was like you were trying to sleep on a round-about. Building work noise from 6am, constant traffic noise with horns every few seconds and a few mornings I was lying in bed smiling to myself in disbelief because it was so loud. In summary, I wouldn\u2019t recommend the hotel even if I\u2019d paid half the money. The sign outside has 4 stars, I guess 2 are for decoration and 2 are for the standard of the hotel.

When we accepted to SEE the room (we where not positive, but why not see the room?)

We discovered that the wash basin would not drain the water away and so informed reception who said they would get someone to take a look. When we returned that evening no one had been to sort it out so we had to ask a second time. Fortunately, this time something was done and we had no further problems. Some other small negatives were that one of the beds had a big hole in the sheet, and there was a distinct lack of plug sockets!

I would also advise that if you don't have a sweet tooth then you won't find much to your liking at breakfast!

The Termini station is a significant transport interchange - with both metro lines stopping there and a large number of buses running past.

We wanted a hotel in central Rome within easy reach of all attractions and sadly that is the only thing going for it. It is very convenient to the main railway station (termini) and other attractions. A four-euro railcard can get you anywhere you want to go but that sadly, is nothing to do with the hotel. I emailed the hotel in advance explaining that this was a special trip for my wife and I, a twenty-fifth wedding anniversary treat. I asked for a nice room with bath and shower. They did not even reply and made no reference to it when we arrived. They clearly did not read it. We were allocated a room on the fourth floor and if we had a cat we would have trouble swinging it. The room was small, dark and dreary. The bathroom, with a shower only, was so tiny it was uncomfortable to use. The only window in the room opened onto a space that could only be described as cave like with daylight barely able to penetrate to the bottom and dirty too. There are no decent views from any room but it would be nice to look out on the hustle ad bustle of the streets below at least. I explained that we were not happy with the room allocated and the following night we were moved to a larger room but still had to put up a view from the bedroom window that I preferred to ignore. Room facilities, generally were ok, towels and linen changed daily and the rooms are clean but you expect that to be the case at any reasonable hotel across the world and congratulations for that is not offered or given. Other facilities did not work. Breakfast was of extremely poor quality. The breakfast room is divided in two and, it too is very dreary. Basically it is a cafeteria with all drinks dispensed from machines and again very poor quality. Breakfast consists of chocolate filled croissants (I hate chocolate at breakfast), white label yoghurt, cereal (a strange mixture of muesli and cornflakes), Melba toast in packets and sweetbread. Tables are not cleared quickly and if you happen to enter the breakfast room at a busy time you\u2019ll find it difficult to find a table that\u2019s clean. Overall the breakfast service is very poor, shoddy and does not cater for those who are used to a decent continental breakfast in other parts of Europe. If you are from the UK, France or Ireland you will find the breakfast offered is well below basic standards you might be used to and is the direct opposite to the general standard you would find elsewhere in Rome. Front of house staff at the hotel are cheerful and pleasant but show little understanding of their guest needs. It would seem that they expect customers to accept their point of view regardless and were somewhat condescending towards my expression of unhappiness with the room originally allocated. I had to be assertive with them and say that the first room was simply not acceptable. I got the clear impression that they were not very well trained in hotel etiquette and customer care and got by on cheery demeanour alone. Services provided in the rooms include a TV with internet access and access to movies (11 euro per movie??) if you wished. Over a three-day period none of these services were available anyway. The only services available to us were a few non-english TV channels and one English language news service (CNN). Surely it is a basic service to have one or two English speaking TV channels available considering the large proportion of English speaking guests staying in the hotel and especially as the hotel offers its services internationally. There was a safe in the room and after numerous attempts to get it to work I gave up. Bear in mind that the internet is a chargeable service according to reception staff, however on the hotel website it says that service is free. Talking of the hotel website, it clearly gives a very different impression of what is actually true and I would ignore the impression of quality it gives. I found the general atmosphere at the hotel as rundown; a lick of paint in the public areas would be welcome. What could be a charming building feels somewhat less so. Overall, service (despite being cheerful) was poor. Some facilities in the rooms don\u2019t work or chargeable despite statements clearly made on the hotel website. Breakfast quality and service is abysmal at best and the only, yes the only thing it has going for it is its location. There are plenty of great restaurants nearby and sadly there are a multitude of other really nice looking hotels in the immediate vicinity all look much nicer and offered at the same price as this one so, it might be wise to shop around first.

Room was basic but fine. Shower OK, but led to believe from the reviews here there'd be FAR more - even jacuzzis. There wasn't. Even the toilet seat wasn't screwed in properly, and kept slipping off one end. Clean, no doubt. Always well tidied. Breakfast awful unless you like doughnuts and glazed croissants (which were nice to be fair) bread, but no way of toasting them, coffee machines which were quite good - but like Spain, Italy does excellent coffee anywhere you may go. (The USA is the WORST coffee I have had anywhere by a LONG way) Unlike Spain, Italy does FABULOUS (if expensive) ice cream wherever you go too. Location couldn't have been much better, near Termini station. Don't make the same mistake I did if you're using the \"Terravision\" shuttle from Rome Ciampino airport. It drops you off on the OPPOSITE side of Termini station from where you need to be for this hotel. Walk through the station to the other entrance end, and then head to your RIGHT on the first line of streets after the main road running parallel to the station (I went left....) Great for Metro (which was much smaller than I thought it would be, and goes to less places) Get a Roma pass, for \u20ac23 for admission to 2 - Colosseum for example, and reduced to the rest, and free transport - metro and buses around the city.

Check-in was slow but since we were on holiday we just relaxed about it. Breakfast is as bad as everyone says it is, my tip is to turn left out of the hotel and at the first cafe you reach, you can stand at the bar for E1 cappuchino and 80c espresso. Croissants that haven't been double-glazed in sugar icing can be had for 80c as well. Don't sit down as everything will cost three times as much!! They also serve decent food and the service is good. We experienced low water pressure once during my stay, when we got up later than usual, but we had a lot of showers and it was fine and hot at all other times. Our rooms were clean, the air con wasn't massively powerful but we didn't wish to have a freezing room and then boil when we went outside. Our room was enormous, if sparsely furnished, with really nice wooden floor, nice old furniture and a very clean and new looking bathroom (room 453). We overlooked the road at the front of the hotel. Our room was pretty quiet though we did take ear plugs just in case. The area as a whole is ok, not as threatening as people make out, though I do live in south east London so maybe I am more used to it. The stretch of road that the hotel is on isn't great but turn left out of the hotel, and left again and there are a number of decent restaurants and small shops for snacks etc. The hotel is very close to Termini station as others have noted - so its very easy for train, metro and bus access. Trains leave Fumincino Airport every half an hour (6 mins past and 36 mins past I think). They leave Termini at 22 mins past and 52 mins past) The journey taks 30 mins and costs E11 each way. The bus takes 70 mins and costs E8. Walking times to the main sights (Trevi Fountain, Forum, Colliseum) are 15 mins plus, depending on your walking speed, and at 35 degrees you probably won't be walking too fast! Roma Pass - unless you are going to visit loads of museums it might not be worth it. It costs E23 and you get free transport (which is great). You also get free entry into 2 attractions and reduced entry into others (not inc Vatican City) but the vast majority of the attractions are musuems - not my cup of tea. Go to a street called Via del Governo Vecchio, between Piazza Navona and the river. There are loads of little Trattorias there and its less busy with cars than other streets near the sights. Trattorias are much cheaper than Ristorantes. We had a main course and beers for E15 each. You can eat hot panninis for lunch which are E2.50 each if you are feeling frugal, we we were. The exchange rate is TERRIBLE out there. The change places were offering \u00a31 for 89c and then there was commission as well.

The bus tickets are just 4Euros for the day and the bus journey is 10 minutes away from Vatican City, the Collusseum, The Spanish Steps and pretty much anywhere you would want to go. The breakfast was as described and unlimited, a selection of sweet pastries and yoghurt were available from 7.30 - 11am, the breakfast was self service but the food was not labelled and different pastries were in the same basket, however you could get as much as you liked and had a good selection of tea, coffee and fruit juice available. HOWEVER....... The pictures on the website showed a whirlpool bath which we were really looking forward to after a long day of walking and sightseeing, when we got there there was no bath, We complained and were told we could change rooms the next morning. This came as quite a relief as the room we were in had no wardrobes and the TV would only work on Italian channels. The pay per view did not work and the staff were unable to assist, this was very frustrating as the hotel offered nothing else in the way of entertainment. We went to reception the next morning to be told that the staff the previous night were wrong and that the whirlpool baths were not plumbed in in any of the rooms and therefore we would not be changing rooms. When we questioned the wardrobe we were told this would be corrected, when we arrived back at the hotel later that day we found that we had been given extra coat hangers but still nowhere to hang anything. The room had no tea or coffee making facilities just a mini bar which was fairly reasonable in price, but any tea or coffee we required we were sent down the street to the nearest tea room. (We strongly recommend the tea room on the corner for your evening meal, great food, fantastic service and reasonable prices). For a three star hotel it was disapointing to find there was no kettle, iron, tea or coffee, wardrobe or bath. The hotel did not even have a bar or restaurant.

The reception personnel needs a big training both for English and politeness, they are not rude but leave their area for long periods of time (so guests must wait for their keys a lot) and also do not push themselves to solve problems.

My wife and I stayed there for 8 nights earlier this month. To borrow from earlier reviews, the best format will be in pros and cons: Pros --The room and bathroom were clean and tidied up nicely each day when we returned from our travels. --The hotel is very convenient to the metro, which is a two minute walk from the hotel front if you turn right and take an immediate left and cut through the neighboring piazza. --I am not sure if it is different in July, but we did not experience the same \"issues\" others spoke of on air conditioning. Our room was set to 25 C which translates to 77 F. This may not be freezing like some people keep their homes, but it is certainly not uncomfortable. Cons --The breakfast is simply awful. Juices and coffee come from a machine and the coffee in particular is undrinkable. This is coming from a certified coffee addict. Some freeze-dried Taster's Choice would have been better (anyone get the reference?). You are better off going down the corner and spending 5-6 Euro on a couple espressos and pastries. --The staff is unbelievably rude. As an American, I often despise our customer service-oriented culture. However, I came to find that when at our hotel I was missing that service. I kept thinking, \"am I not paying you for this experience?\" The breakfast staff looked miserable, the maids looked at you with a mixture of skepticism and disdain and the front desk...the most important part...was flat-out rude. The most comical experience was when we checked out. The front desk clerk, a blond woman who's name for the life of me I cannot remember, asked if we had anything from the minibar. I explained we had one water and promptly handed her a 5 Euro bill. She thrusted change in to my hand and turned away. I stood there for a couple seconds in awkward silence waiting for a thank you or receipt of some kind for our 8 night stay. She looked up about a minute later, miffed at why I was still there. I asked if there was anything else I needed to do to check out and she issued a terse \"No!\" and turned away again. So let me get this straight. I just spent hundreds of dollars at your establishment over the course of 8 nights, never complained about anything or asked for any assistance the whole time I was there. This is how I get treated? I wasn't expecting a red carpet exit, just simple manners. I guess the service in the States isn't so bad after all! --The only negative about the cleanliness of the room was the bed comforter, which was stained and had a strange smell. It was clear that it had not been cleaned recently and was not changed between guests. Of course it was summer and we didn't even need to use it...this may be an issue in cool months! --The hotel is noisy and I took a previous reviewer's advise and wore ear plugs. You can hear people in rooms around you and the traffic/construction is deafening from 6:45am onward. One happy morning it sounded as if a construction crew was throwing scrap metal down several stories in to a metal bin. I was almost ready to look for a bomb shelter! --The hotel offers a \"wake-up\" service on their in-room television. This is comical and you have to see it to believe it. You set the time you want to wake up. When that time arrives, the tv turns on at a barely audible decibel level for less than two seconds. It then goes to a blue screen and falls silent. Suffice it to say, unless the tv is sitting suspended above you an inch or two while you are sleeping, this is not a wake-up service! On that note... --There is no alarm clock in the room and utilize the front desk for wake-up calls at your peril. We asked for one 4 times over the course of our 8 nights and only received a 50% success rate. I strongly suggest you purchase a 12-13 euro travel alarm clock at the Kodak store a couple blocks away or have a watch with an alarm function. The last thing you need is to miss your flight home because the afore-mentioned \"splendid\" staff forgot to wake you up! All in all, a wonderful experience in Rome and I guess this hotel has two stars for a reason. I was a little surprised by how well it was reviewed and that was the main reason why we booked there. Would I recommend it? If you are planning to utilize the Metro (believe me, you really should as it is an invaluable way to tour Rome) then yes. If not, pick somewhere else. What the hotel does not tell you is that if you do plan to walk, it is uphill on the way back in all directions you choose to come. This makes for an interesting trek after a long day of sightseeing.

The area is very safe during the day but a bit deserted at night and the walk between Termini and Reppublica should be avoided. At night is better to approach the hotel from via Cavour or Nazionale and not from Piazza Repubblica.

With my luggage I walked back to the hotel to get better directions. I tried once again and got to the correct building but there were two or three different hotels in that building none of them ever heard of Welcome Home Residences and there was nothing on the building that mentioned anything about the hotel or studios. I went back again and this time I told him I wouldn\u2019t go again looking for some place that I couldn\u2019t find.

The staff were helpful, and spoke good English. The room was nicely decorated, a good size and had a very comfortable bed. I didn't even realise breakfast was included, so it was a bonus, but if you had realised and were expecting it you may well find it a bit underwhelming. Croissants, yoghurt and a bit of cereal - but the coffee/juice was pretty terrible and the dining area itself was pretty packed and noisy. Key point for us though was the lack of hot water during peak times. Now again this wasn't a complete disaster as you could always go back for a siesta and a shower in the heat of the day, but wasn't ideal. Such a shame as well, because otherwise the Welcome Residences would make the ideal place to stay for travellers looking for comfort on a tight budget. P.S.

The location is excellent. Just around the corner from the Termini and metro. (once you get off the bus, you need to walk through the station to the other side, turn right, then second left after 150 yards, turn right at next junction and hotel is just up on your left - two green plants outside). We found the staff to be very helpful. Our room was small (converted roof space) but it had recently been refurbished and was acceptable for the time we were in it. We had running hot water at all times (perhaps they have sorted out the problem!). I agree with the comments about breakfast, you can only eat so many doughnuts! but the coffee etc was good. The problem with the lift is that people do not close the doors properly and the lift will not work if both doors are not closed properly. We also brought the Terravision coach tickets before we went. When we landed we were met with 200+ people trying to get onto 2 coaches. A Tip - across from the terminal there are buses that do exactly the same route as Terravision for only 6 euros and they seem to be more frequent. It is a good 45 minutes on the bus to get from the airport to the termini. If you use the Terravision to return to the airport you should allow approx 3 hours and be prepared that if you turn up and the bus is full you will have to wait for the next one..and they are not always just around the corner. We booked out Vatican tour through www.myvaticantour.com and the tour was 3 hours long and bypassed all the queues but the majority of the tour was in the museum, ok if you are really into art. We also booked the colosseum tour through www.mycolosseumtour.com and this was also 3 hours long and was excellent, the guide was very entertaining. I would definately recommend booking these tours before you leave as they were fully booked when people tried to book when they arrived and the queues are very very long. I would not recommend a couple of restaurants near to the hotel -Smeraldo (via Principe Amedeo) behind the hotel - frozen pasta etc & Ristorante Terme di Diocleziano (roof terrace), at the end of street - very overpriced and not particulary good food.

However we got a massive at least 150 sq m (1600 plus sq ft) top floor apartment with three big terraces. The apartment is for six people with two double ensuite bedrooms and a room in the middle where you can layout a bed. There is also a kitchen, dining area and living room. It was very clean and other than a dodgy ironing board and iron in OK condition. Basically it was like living in a fully furnished penthouse apartment for a week. It suited us really well as we could head back from the sites and chill out with a beer in the living room and store stuff in the two fridges. The only issue with this apartment which has daily maid service is that there was a sulphurous smell when running water in one of the ensuite's.

Luckily I woke up naturally and we still made it in time but it could have been disatorous! The best thing about the hotel is its location- it is a 2 minute walk from Termini Station so if you are being dropped off at Termini station you are best walking to the hotel becuase a taxi might take you on a \"scenic route\"! Most of the attractions like the Trevi Fountain, Coliseum, Forum, Spanish steps are within walking distance taking about 10-15 minutes to each depending how quick you walk!

The room was spacious and clean, bathroom was small and shower tiny but water pressure good and nice and hot. View out on to street was lots of fun. We had a corner room so had windows looking out onto two streets. We had no problems with traffic noise. We walked down to Forum and round Colesseum and took some night shots. Up very early (6ish) and headed out to squeeze in as much as we could before breakfast - Trevi Fountain and Spanish steps and just us taking pictures. Breakfast was fine. Good coffee, cereal, yoghurt and lots of sweet pastries and donuts. Not our kind of thing but it was good carb loading!

The room was average and had a smallish flat screen on the wall, lots of storage space and the bathroom was of average size with a bidet. We also had a balcony, which was nice. The bed was VERY comfortable, kind of like a tempurpedic. I would have liked to have 2 pillows each, but we also didn't ask for them. The TV is also a clock that we used for the alarm on mornings we had to wake up early. They offer body wash/shampoo combo, but no conditioner. The breakfast wasn't fantastic, but it worked. The milk for my cereal was room temperature, and they offered several types of pasteries - some were really good! The service staff was very nice. As for the location, in my opinion, it couldn't be beat! It was a block away, and with the Roma Pass that offers unlimited public transport rides, it worked out great to get to the Coloseum, Spanish Steps, Trivi Fountain, Vatican, etc. We would walk around at night and felt extremely safe. Roma Pass is fantastic - buy it at the airport as soon as you land in Rome and it covers your 30 min. train ride to the station along with public transport as I had mentioned and 2 free amusements ( we used it for the Coloseum - they have a separate line so we didn't wait a minute to get in, and the National Museum) if you were to visit other places included on the Roma Pass, I am told you also get discounts. Friday we went to the Vatican and did the Angel Tour so we were able to enter before the rest of the public. This would be great had we not waited for late tourists for the entire hour and entered as the public entered! On their website they say they'll wait for late comers, however, they do not say that they make the entire tour group wait along with them!! Big red flag in my opinion. The tour guides were very nice, and kept the group to 15 at most which was nice. They kept everything pretty light in a stuffy museum and if you're really interested in religious art, it may be worth it. It's a LONG tour - lasting 3 hours & if you're not an art enthusiast, I would definitely skip the Vatican Museum and go directly to the Basilica - which is free!!!", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBe careful when you book this hotel\u201d", "Author": "ashdale5", "ReviewID": "UR10005871", "Content": "My wife and I arrived in Rome late last Thursday night having booked this hotel on recomendation from a family member who had stayed there previously. When we got to reception they checked us in and then informed us that our room was not actually in the hotel itself, but in another building \"close by.\" A porter escorted us by foot to a building on Via Nacionale which is two or three blocks away from the hotel. To get to the room we had to first unlock a door to get to a courtyard, then unlock a gate to get to the building, then another door to get to the hallway and finally the door to the room. This meant carrying a big bunch of keys around for the entire stay as there was no reception at this building. In the room itself there was a small bathroom and a small bedroom. The view from the window, which was tiny, was the wall of another building less than ten feet away so very little light got into the room. The TV, advertised as satellite,had one channel working and even this was hazy. Worst of all, when I picked up the phone to call the hotel to see if we could be moved to another room, we discovered the phone didn't work either. Not even a dial tone on it. Rather than let this ruin our trip to Rome,we made the most of it and enjoyed our first three days of sightseeing. On our last evening we returned to the room to shower before heading out but when we attempted to leave we discovered that we were locked in. The door from the hallway to the top of the stairs had been locked from the outside and because there was no keyhole on the inside we were unable to get out. Luckily we had taken a hotel business card and rang the number on it from my mobile phone. After three fruitless conversations with the receptionist, who didn't seem to know that we were actually staying at his hotel, and a thirty minute wait, finally someone arrived to open the door for us. By this time we had run out of patience so we packed our bags to go to the main hotel buliding and request to be moved to another room. I asked the porter to wait so we could go with him to the main hotel,but when I came back with our bags he had gone. My wife and I had to drag our bags the three blocks back to the hotel at 10pm on our last night in Rome. When we got to the reception the porter who I had asked to wait for us was sitting next to the receptionist but hadn't even mentioned that we were looking to change rooms or that we were on our way. I explained to the receptionist, who was also the night manager, our issues with the room and the fact we were locked in,and that if nothing else the safety issue of having a door that could be locked from the outside was scandalous for a reputable hotel. It was very obvious from our conversation that he had never even been to the building we were staying in, never mind the room, and he kept insisting that the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing he could do about it. I asked him to call his manager and he talked to him on the phone,but the best solution they could come up with was a single room for the night. I looked at this room and there was barely enough room for one person in there. Luckily my wife had gone to the Bettoja Hotel Nord next door and they had a room available for 50 euro less than we were paying. The hotel manager insisted that I pay for my three nights stay in full which I did,simply to just get out of there. Maybe the main hotel is beautiful. Maybe the staff are friendly and courteous. Maybe the breakfast is sensational.

Had to change rooms after the first night because of the noise of delivery vans to our hotel and one across the road from 5am. Moved to an internal room and that was lovely and quiet. Nice breakfast choice and friendly, helpful staff. We also used the Metro and I really must warn people about pickpockets on the Metro. I know we are all aware of it, but you would not believe how fast and easily they steal your wallets. We saw one case that was 2 little innocent looking 10 year old girls who had done it. Luckily in both our case and the above one both wallets were dropped onto the floor in the chaos that arose. Please be careful. Fantastic very nice and cheap place to eat - was a Chinese restaurant just behind the Opera House Theatre by the Station. Lots of local Chinese people eat there and we went 2 nights and had lovely meals. Great iced coffees available in the \"News Cafe\" between Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. No service charge for sitting out on the street tables. Watch out for 40% service charges in some places. Collaseum and Vatican - Must get there really early.

However when we returned to the Hotel on our 4th day we were told that when they fixed the door they noticed some damage to a set of drawers. (the marks that were there when we arrived) I explained this was already there to them and one of the staff said not to worry, explain this to the manager who would be in the next morning - a young lady with blonde hair. When this young lady turned up she was not apparently the manager, he was in Hospital with his wife who was giving birth! He then turned up oblivious to the fact his wife was in hospital and said he would discuss this with me. He informed me I should have seen the damage and told him straight away, and as I hadnt I would have to pay almost one thousand euros to him or be detained by the Police and not allowed to leave the Country. I told him to inform the police and gave him my documents to copy. He then dissappeared from the Hotel and I never saw him again.

The hotel itself is situated on a busy little street just to the left of Termini. It is just off Via Cavour, a main street packed with bars and restaurants, and there is an internet cafe right next to the reception. The room we stayed in, which was in a block a few doors down the road from the main hotel building, was big enough for the two of us, and was very clean with bed linen and towels changed daily. It also has a free working safe and a television. The bathroom was small but very clean and the shower worked well (hot water is NOT required during a Roman summer!) 2 tiny little issues though. Although we booked a room with a double bed we were given 2 singles pushed together, and while these were comfy enough they tended to slip apart leading to more than one jarring mid-sleep fall. The other issue concerns the breakfast. As others has said it is very 'cakey' It consisted of, in total - iced croissants, huge sugared donuts, 2 types of cereals, bread, a small selection of jams, yoghurts, tarts, juice and coffee. Although it filled us up it would have been nice to see some meats, cheeses and more rolls and bread available, but maybe thats just Rome? But those are just 2 trifling matters, ones not woth complaining about at all. The hotel was fantastic and the staff brilliant, even providing us with a free city map on arrival and willing to recommend restaurants and places to visit. Just a few words abotu Rome itself. We went in the middle of July and it was roasting hot. So hot that we tended to go back to the hotel about 3pm each day for a 2 or 3 hour nap just to get out of the sun, so take lots of light clothes and buckets of suntan lotion! Also be prepared to queue if you're not an early-bird! Although we followed the advice of those before us and skipped the collosuem queues by buying our tickets at the Palatine office we discovered a 4 hour queue at the Vatican to climb St Peters dome, and what looked like a mile-long queue to the Vatican Museums at around 10am. Strangely once we were done with the Vatican at around 1pm the museum queue was non-existant and we walked straight in So many sights to see but you can't miss the Colosseum, Vatican, the Trevi Fountain at night and the Roma Forum. Other wee gems are the Mouth of Truth, the grisly Cappuccini Monks graveyard near Barberini metro stop and the view from the top of Castel San Angelo. The Spanish Steps were a dissapointment, not particularly grand and full of beggars and street traders. Sorry for rambling on but this city is amazing.

Especially given the fact that the room rate has almost doubled since last year. I placed a positive review of the hotel after our last visit and would definately rescind it. Booked for three nights. Firstly the positive aspects of the hotel. The location is excellent and the bathrooms in both rooms we had (we had to move rooms) were spotless. On the down side. In both rooms we had you could write your name in the dust on the surafaces of the bedroom furnature( bedside tables, dressing tables etc.). In our first room the door would not close properly and could only be locked by pulling it closed and locking it from the inside with the key. The bathroom door wouldn't close at all let alone lock. In both rooms we had the air conditioning did not work properly and whilst we had it set to 19 degrees it never managed to get below 25 degrees (not good in Rome at the end of June). In both rooms the units seemed to work more like giant fans than air coolers. At midnight on our second night we were woken by a jolt as the leg dropped off the bed only to be told be reception that there was nothing they could do until the following day. When we returned from a day sightseeing the following day our bed had been 'repaired; by placing telephone directories under the broken corner leaving the bed tilted. Upon checking I also found the bed linen hadn't been changed (as indeed it hadn't on the previous day). Not ideal or acceptable in hot, sticky, Rome. Since returning I've seen that their literature states fresh linen every day which is what I'd expect when paying over \u00a3100 a night for a room. I asked reception about how often linen is supposed to be changed three times and they refused to be pinned down and wouldn't give me a straight answer. No additioinal toiletries had been left in the bathroom after the day of our arrival luckily we always carry spare. After refusing to sleep on a bed propped up by telephone directories with dirty sheets we were offered a room change. The new room was very small but at least the door closed. There was no was of securing the door from the inside (lock deadbolt etc.) which we found very worrying. Again this room was dusty with an air conditioning unit which just seemd to circulate the air and not lower the temerature. The wardrobe consisted of an alcove behind a curtain with a safe which was too high for me to reach. The bathrooom was again spotlessly clean if very small (so small it had to have a sliding door). The small shower cabinet had no shelf or place to put soap or shower gel which meant having to wash with one hand whilst holding the shower gel or risk slipping on it on the floor. The breakfast in this hotel definately remains the worst that I have had in any hotel anywhere in the world and personally after trying it the first two days avoided it and found a local cafe for lovely coffee and great pastries.

We walked to a lot of places too and nothing was more than a 10-15 minute walk away. To get to the hotel, come out of the station so the bus stand is right in front of you. Turn left and cross the main road at the lights. Turn right to walk along the main road and take the second exit on your left down the side of a restaurant. There is a market stall on your right selling cases. The hotel is directly in front of you on the left corner. There are lots of lovely restaurants and snack bars nearby, it's round the corner to the opera house and Via Nazionale too where there are even more shops. I highly recommend this hotel as it is good value for money.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms with all you need\u201d", "Author": "Travelling_City_Girl", "ReviewID": "UR7936561", "Content": "The rooms are great--large by European standards and decorated nicely.

Restaurants in the area were excellent and we were able to walk to every location except the Vatican, which we used the Metro. Good restaurants in the area that were very close were Antica Boheme and Monte Arci. Trimani Wine Bar was overpriced and the Italian cheese plate was highly unpleasant. If you want even more authentic Italian, go to Colline Emiliane which is very near the Barberini Metro stop. Walking down the Via Cavour from the hotel there are a few wine shops that have great prices. But if you want even cheaper prices, go to the SuperMarket behind the Santa Maggiore.

I took Ryanair flight and reached ROME CIAMPINO Airport late night. I took Terravision bus which runs from airport to termini frequently. Its better to take return ticket which will cost around 14 Euros. I reached Termini aaround mid night and the rome looks bit lousy at the time. NEVER EVER TRUST THE TAXI GUYS IN ROME. I asked some taxi guys about the location but they all tried to fool me by suggesting that its very far. But when I asked few noble guys and referred to the map, its hardly 100 mtrs walk (3 minutes) from TERMINI. They don't have a big board but can be easily located on Via Giovanni 7 street. The reception (Silvia, James (not sure) were really helpful. The reception is the best part of the hotel. The room was pretty ok with mini bar , big bed, nice bathroom (no bath tub) and locker. The lift is very scary and kind of antique peice. But its ok as you don't need it all the time. The reception people were very good and helpful. Room was fantastic. The best part is that this place is so close to ROME Termini from where you can easily take trains to go to Venice, Pisa or Florence and no need to worry about time in day/night. All tours start from Termini alos which is just acros the road. There were few small problems which i faced regarding breakfast and wake up call. Vreakfast is no very good and doesn't include fruits etc. Its very very simple. Better take room without breakfast as it looks stupid paying money for it. Another thing if you have to leave from hotel at 7:00 AM to catch the flight, they don't provide breakfast even if you have already paid for it. They say it doesn't open before 7:30 which is ridiculous. Lot of hotel do that... Never trust the hotel reception for Wake up calls. Carry your mobile and set alarm on that. I asked them to give me wakeup call on 3 days and everytime they came to wake me up arounf 1 or 2 hours after the actual time. They just note it down somewhere in paper and forget it. I luckily always use alarm on my mobile. Except breakfast and wake up call, this hotel is really good to stay.

A HINT WHEN TRAVELLING FROM CIAMPINO AIRPORT TO THE HOTEL; When leaving ciampino airport, there is a desk to your right where you can book a coach from the airport to the main station termini stazione in the centre of rome, the coach company is called Terravision and for just 8 euro's per person the coach will take you to from the airport to the station in rome center which is less than 5 minute walk to the hotel, the coach trip was about 30-50 minutes depending on traffic, but well worth getting the coach as taxi's are triple this price. Where the coach drops you off you can purchase a coach ticket for your journey back to the airport also 8 euro's the coach will pick you up just up the road opposite the royal hotel, although the ticket office isnt signposted, so it may be worthwhile booking a return ticket at the airport 16 euro's p/p. The coach will drop you off at the station from there walk through the station straight ahead to the exit, cross the road turn left then its the 2nd turning on your rightto the hotel. The hotel isn't very well signposted there is a small gold plaque on the outside next t the door. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted by a very polite lady (sorry i dont recall her name) although we had pre-paid for the hotel they do request a credit card for damages that may be caused. The lady was very polite and very helpful, she gave us our room keys, one good thing they do is provie you with a very handy map, and she then circled places of interest and tips on how to get to them, which we found very useful. There is a very old fashioned lift although it looked scary it did work and was suprisingly quiet, you have to hold the button until the lift is at your floor open the door close the shutters and hold your floor button, reliable lift although doesnt look it!!! Our room was basic, tele, minibar, shower etc. Beware the hotel is non smoking which we werent aware of. Although the room was basic it wa very tidy and neat, bed sheets and towels changed daily. It is noisy at night but not overly noisy, as the hotel is on a main road opposite station but the noise didnt bother us, and able to sleep ok! From the hotel you can see a fountain to the left from our window which was nice!! Alot of people have written in their reviews that the breakfast was poor, but we were rather suprised, they have a selection of sweet pastries, crossaints, cereals coco pops, and a wheat nut cereal, as well as toast, bread etc. The juice from the machine is nice although not in english so lucy dip as to what you get, i didnt try the hot drinks machine, but my partner did and wasnt so keen on the tea (the mugs are pretty small) The coffee though was ok. Would ve nice if there was a hot drinks machine located elsewhere as only time available was at breakfast time 7-10 am. Although mini bar reasonably priced. We had a cold drink and crisps total3 euro's. Beware when buying drinks outside the hotel as they say me coming two bottles of cold drink 8 euro's (about \u00a36) learnt from our mistakes though they should be about 2 euro's 50 cents to 3 euro's. The hotel is excellent location the colloseum is about 15-20 minute walk, its worth getting a guided tour 12 euro's as it gets you straight into colloseum without queing or 3 euro's if you que. From the colloseum we walked to fontain di trevi then the panthoen and back to te hotel, you have to walk as there are so many things to see on the way to the sites. Although Vatican City we didnt walk to as a bit far but you can get the metro a 24 hou ticket was 4 euro's p/p very good and Vatican City was the 6th stop about 10 mins in metro and well worth a visit we walked from there to Castel sant angelo although it was closed when we went due to trade union meeting worth a visit also, then onto piazza del tribunalland across the 2nd bridge from there to piazza del popolo and then back on the metro to the hotel. Also saw trinita del monti a church. You do have to get up early about 730/8 am for a warm shower as was cold on our first day, due to other guests using all warm water although the rest of our trip the water was warm. The staff are very helpful.

The location, very close to Terminni and the bus station is perfect. There are also some reasonable and bars close by. All the staff, particularly at reception are charming and more than willing to help. The reception staff all speak excellent English. Our bedroom on the third floor was a little noisy but you have to expect that in a major capital city. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have experienced in a hotel and the furniture was adequate. It was good to have a safe (free of charge), a mini bar and the drinks were reasonably priced. The bathroom was a little small but beautifully clean. Towels were changed every day and the bed linen every two days. Breakfast was fine - a selection of bread and cakes, good coffee and fruit juice. you can have a more substantial breakfast by paying a small amount extra. The breakfast room is a little small and you can have to wait for a table - there is little concept of queuing except amongst the more polite! There are some very nice touches in the hotel - interesting pictures and ornate furniture. My sister and her family had a suite which had a sofa bed and very nice bathroom with a juccuzzi - excellent value. A final of warning please be careful of pick pockets they are everywhere and you are particularly vulnerable on the buses especially number 64 which is the stopping bus to the Vatican. Use the express number 40 which doesn't stop so often and so you are less likely to become a victim as the pick pockets want a quick getaway.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201c Location but warnings, thieves!

Summary: we wouldn't hesitate to book another stay here. PS A general Rome tip: if you're staying for a few days, it's worth buying a Roma Pass (tourist info centres and museums, including the Colosseum, sell them).
