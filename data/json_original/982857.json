Everytime we visit Madrid, we'll go back there because although the room is simple but clean and comfortable, big enough for 3 of us. Beside that, the other advantage is the metro station just round the corner so making it very convenience to move about Madrid.

The answer - ''we never supply glasses or papercups'' - was really surprising. Eventually I got a few plastic cups (the same they use in the morning for your fruitjuice), but still it wasn't very professional. And then the towels: the first one had brown stains on it and the second one was coloured red (as in lipgloss). I told them and can only hope they find a better cleaners. Breakfast was OK. Not luxurious, but as you expect in an ETAP hotel. The hotel is situated in an industrial estate, but with one hundred meters of a subway station that brings you direct to the Opera and with one change of trains to all other touristy places in Madrid.

Once we did manage to get to the hotel we were greeted by a young blonde girl on reception after she finished talking with another member of staff. She seemed disinterested in checking us in and took a long time. We asked for a map of the city and she threw it at us without explaining where we were (off the map ironically) or anything about the city. We asked about breakfast and she failed to tell us that this had not been included with our reservation and therefore incurred an extra cost. We also asked for the location of the nearest laundromat (it had been a long time so we were desperate) and she told us the name of a shopping centre without telling us where it was. After we asked she reluctantly wrote it down for us with the name of the metro station to get there. The laundromat was not there, either. At another time we wanted to purchase wifi (5 euro per 24 hours - the first Etap we have stayed at to charge for wifi) and she seemed more interested in batting her eyelids at a male guest she had finished checking in prior to us, rather then completing our request. All other members of staff were ok. The room was typical Etap - clean, simple and basic. Nothing more than you would expect for the price. We had breakfast one morning and it was the poorest variety we have seen at an Etap. The location is typical of Etap - within a couple of minutes walking of public transport making it very convenient to get into the city centre.

We paid 45 Euros for the room, 7 Euros for car parking - and 3,90 Euros per person for breakfast. I think that the price for the room and the parking was valuable, but not the price for breakfast. The room was small, but very nice. It looked very new and shiny. There was also separate rooms for shower and toilet, so one person can shower while the other person is at the toilet. There was a little bit bad smell inside the shower room, and I believe it was because it comes very small amounts of air inside there when the door is closed - which it is most of the time. If you want to discover the city, this hotel is a good choice. It is a bit far from the city, but the metro station Suanzes is only 200 meters away. We took the metro to Gran Via, and the trip lasted for about 20 minutes. So we had a nice evening in Madrid! When we drove from the hotel to the airport the next day, that was very easy - even we didnt use our GPS. If you have time to eat breakfast in the city, I would recommend that. The breakfast costs 3,90 Euros per person, and that is not expensive - but the breakfast buffet is not very good. There was no ham, only jam, marmelade and honey to have on the bread. And the only bread they had was white bread sliced into very thick slices. They also had Frosties, Corn Flakes, orange juice and milk. That's it!
