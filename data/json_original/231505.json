My husband and I loved it. It's located in the swanky Gracia district, and the hotel holds up to the area. Very classy from top to bottom, from decor to service. It's located a short walk from bus stops and the train lines, making it really convenient to get around town. There's a direct line from there to La Rambla, one of the tourist hotspots in Barcelona. There is also a lot to see in the area around the hotel. The kitchen does not have a microwave, but otherwise has everything else you'll need: 2 burner stove, fridge, sink, a pot, a pan, utensils, plates, cups. After we used dishes, the cleaning staff left us a bottle of dishwashing soap but no sponge. I bought one from the Consum supermarket just a few doors down. We saved a lot of money by picking up breakfast and snack items at Consum and storing them at the hotel. There is free wifi, which I was able to get quite easily from my phone but my husband could not. They also have two computers in the lobby which are free to use. The service was absolutely fantastic. Many staff members spoke English and were able to make recommendations on where to go, how to get there, and how to stay safe (e.g., definitely see La Rambla, but beware pickpockets at night). They ordered us a taxi for our early morning flight out so we didn't have to worry about it. My only complaint is the noise. The walls are very thin, and we could hear everything from neighboring rooms. The first morning, I woke up to a neighbor's cell phone alarm, which coincidentally was the same tone as mine. It made me wake up thinking my phone was going off in my purse, when it was actually from another phone and room entirely. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFamily break to Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Caroline1116", "ReviewID": "UR126913123", "Content": "I visited Barcelona for the first time in February this year (2012).

The hotel is less than 10min walk from Gracia station. Make sure that you do not get off at Passag d'Gracia, as you will have a long walk ahead of you (as we did!) We arrived early in the morning and were unable to check in until 2pm. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel and see Barcelona. The hotel clearly has a large focus on image. All staff were faultless in their appearance, and the ground floor is clean and has a mahogony wood theme (not real, of course). The rooms are very large and spacious, as are the beds. However, it is a case of two single beds pushed together - which will be very uncomfortable if you happen to fall between them during the night. The bathroom is also very spacious, but the quality of the shower left a lot to be desired. Water pressure was poor, and the temperature changed from freezing to boiling within seconds. The main drawback about this place - do not stay here if you want a good night's sleep! There is a bar right outside, and rauchous noise continued until about 4.30am each night. The sound was so loud, and carried into the room so easily, that they may as well have been partying in our room! We only got 3-4 hours each night. We did however manage to get this place at a bargain basement price, and were travelling on a strict budget. Aside from the gorgeous staff members, this hotel has few redeeming features.

I stayed for a week with my husband. The first two nights we were in a room (first floor) directly above the breakfast area. Starting at 6am there were loud shouts and banging around. After the first night we asked to be moved and we were moved after another night of no sleep. The second room was a little better, but the walls and floors are paper thin. The floors are wood, so you can hear every little step anyone takes above you. Barcelona is a late night city, so guests are returning at all hours of the night. Of course there was some noise from outside the hotel, but the biggest problem was from within. We ended up having to run our cell phone background noise apps the entire night, every night. We also requested a wake up call most mornings, just in case our phone alarms didn't work. It ended up being a running joke between us on whether or not we were going to get one. I think we got one about half the time the requested. So do not depend on it as your only source (which you might have to since there is no clock in the room). Lastly, I had some laundry go missing from my room. I never asked for it to be cleaned. The front desk said the maid had sent it to the laundry. I was annoyed, but even more so when I had to leave 2 days later and there was still no sign of my clothing. They took my address and promised to send it on when it arrived. The very next day I received an email explaining the laundry never had my clothing and the maid claims to have never removed anything from my room. I felt a bit as if they had just waited for me to leave to tell me the whole story. I can't imagine anyone actually stealing my dirty clothes, but they were misplaced. Now the hotel is offering free parking or a room upgrade upon my return. I have no plans to visit Barcelona again, and certainly wouldn't choose to stay here if I were, mainly due to the noise issue. Other than the way the management/staff is handling my lost clothing issue, which I of course find poor, I did find the front desk staff pleasant. The rooms are clean, and the location is fine.

Really easy to get to pretty much everywhere else in the city from Gracia tube stop and also the lady at reception pointed out another stop called Fontana about 5mins away that connected to even more stuff with less changing lines!

The people at Mariano Cubi (down the street) not only let me use their WIFI to find a room (I ended up staying at the Mariano Cubi for two nights), but let me keep my valuables there as the Hostal Amsterdam was basically a transient hotel.

Arrived at 11am and were able to check in then even though it is usually 2pm. Having researched the hotel before we went we knew this was a modern hotel. When we got to our room though we were really disappointed. Apparently only certain rooms in the hotel have been refurbished (it was built in the 1970's) and obviously we had been given one of the old rooms, which although was in good condition was not the beautiful modern room we had seen on the hotel's website and were expecting. After speaking to reception, they admitted some rooms were old although this was not advertised on their website and was in some ways false advertising. I was told there was nothing that could be done for the first nights stay but they would try and find a alternative room for the following two nights. II found this strange considering I watched 3 people check out and it was still only 11am but........... Anyway the following day we had out new room which was far superior. WORD OF WARNING - if you stay at this hotel make sure it is not a room on the 5th floor as they are all old rooms. We were moved to the 3rd and they were lovely. The hotel breakfast was fantastic with cereal, fruit, ham and cheese etc croissants/pain au choc and cooked breakfast. Was lovely and clean and the food was of a high standard. We couldn't complain. The location of the hotel I thought was excellent. It was about a 35 minute walk to Las Ramblas although you could get the metro from Gracia station about a 4 minute walk from the hotel. Make sure you get a T-10 ticket - 10 journeys for 6 euros odd and it can be used by more than one person. Taxi at night to/from Placa de Catalunya was between 5-7 euros. Although the hotel was on a small side road the area felt quite safe as it was towards the business district.

Reception dealt with my complaint straight away after being woken up at 6.00am by what seemed to be party of 50 people below us, and the music was turned off but I wish I had insisted on changing rooms because the following night was again noisy with shouts, banging doors, etc. In the end I turned on the kitchen extractor fan to drown out the noise which helped!
