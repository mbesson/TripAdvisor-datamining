The property is very close to the Sydney CBD and everything is very accessible and nearby - Harbors and Bondi and all other beaches as well. No wonder due to closeness to city, its an old building needs refurbishment,but nothing came into my attention that prevent me not to recommand to someone else except couple of things :- 1. Lift is dodgy, be very careful. 2. Toilets and rooms are very moderate, nothing to expect more, but as usual dream beds make your sleep very comfortable. Staff attitude is ok.

I had to keep telling myself that it is an older building (probably 60's) though boy oh boy could it do with a refurb and some styling. We had a King Suite, so was at least spacious, though not a great layout (chair in front of the TV, so couldn't exactly sit there). Lots of carpet stains, had to laugh at the inbuilt medicine cabinet (with plastic shelves that had long broke) slight refub in the bathroom with a new vanity and sink, but definitely lacks ventilation - so best to leave the door open. The shower was sooo annoying. Probably 15-20 deg difference of hot/cold/hot/cold every 30 seconds or so. Had my own wireless internet, so not sure if there's any available or price, albeit there were some wireless access points around. There was also a bunch of cat 5 cable going to a box in the linen cupboard that was just hanging there. Positives: It was very clean. Even out by the pool area I couldn't find a single cobweb in sight, or even under the eaves of those oh so 60's 70's facade. Didn't notice any dust in common and not so common areas. (Speaking of the pool, access is rather weird. Through the fire stairs, then down another set of external stairs.) Bed wasn't bad, no problems sleeping and woke up feeling fine and refreshed. Staff were mostly great, reception/concierge very helpful. Breakfast - if it isn't included I would definitely go up the road. It wasn't too bad, but not great either. Adequate springs to mind. Didn't hear too much noise from other rooms/floors. So basically, if you're after a clean basic hotel, this place is fine. If you prefer a little more dazzle/modern then this isn't the place for you at all. Oh 1 BIG annoying thing. The damn LED lighting on the elevators on the ground floor - they will send you blind.

We arrived around the check-in time - we were both driving, so we both parked in the secure garage, not the easiest garage to navigate through, but you can hardly expect the hotel to remove supporting beams that help hold the building up - so not fussed about that. Went up to the room - first thing I noticed in the room was the total waste of space as soon as you walk in - it looks like what used to be part of the hallway, is now the entrance to your room. There could be somewhere to store suitcases, a tallboy, even just some lighting and full length mirror would have been nice here. The living room was huge, but very bare, old furniture - including a fold out sofa bed, that was so old and used, you couldn't even sit on it. Nice new TV, but old and outdated entertainment box, meant that TV wasn't that great to use anyway. There is an interconnecting door to the next room, but the gaps between the door and the frame are so big that noise just travels through and doesn't feel very private at all. I started getting ready to go out around 5pm - The bathroom has no ventilation fans, the shelves in the medicine cabinet were broken and the broken shelves still sitting in side the cabinet. I found myself constantly stepping away from the water in the shower as the hot water was cutting in and out, as you were at home and someone flushed a toilet somewhere else in the house. This was incredibly annoying... Didn't bother with the food, so no feedback here. I noticed wireless routers in the hallway, but there is no wireless internet signal - so not sure if this is just for security/alarm systems - the rooms are hardwired to the internet - but most of the devices I use to connect can't be connected with an ethernet cable.

I managed ok, but it must be scary for non-expert drivers. The location is fine, with the restaurants along King St, Newton, within walking distance. My room was big, and with nice views of the city skyline. It is true that some aspects of the room were a bit dated, but it was just a question of aesthetics. Everything was perfectly usable.

It was clear that the hotel I was about to stay in was not of the calibre of say, Parramatta Rydges which I frequent alot. As I had to stay close to RPA due to my partner in having surgery, I was not prepared to pay $180 a night to stay at Quest as a single and thought I'd 'risk it' with Rydges at Camperdown. My room, and from what I could tell from the carpets replaced etc throughout the floor, has indeed been re-furbished, albeit the bathroom with remained 80's style, but yet functional. Throughout the day tradesman were in and out of the hotel obviously making the necessary modifications (and intermitent noise). My room, a double/double was clean comfortable, and to my suprise and delight, a very large plasma/LCD TV. The beds, are comfortable enough, although I'm sure they will also be upgraded to the \"Dream Beds\" other Rygdes hotels provide. (Would be a good investment as they are a dream to sleep on) I had one incident of disruption of a group of men in the room next door. From the early afternoon you could tell they would be trouble, swearing, drinking etc. The had gone out for the night and I just knew I'd be woken when they returned. That they did, at 5am. One ph call to downstairs and security was called. No less then 5mins later they were paid a visit, and thankfully.....Quit the noise. Just a tip, I opted for a non-smoking room after originally been provided with a room on level 4. Despite being a smoker, I opted not to stay on the floor due to the stagnent smoke smell, even I couldn't stand it. I was then given a room on level one which smelt fresh and clean. Non smokers would not be able to bear level 4, so steer clear if this is the case. I'd stay here again for it's reasonable price, and closeness to RPA.

I was disgusted at the state of the Hotel when I stayed there last week for business. Cockroaches meandered in and out of the air conditioning ducts that were clogged with years of dirty grey dust. Carpets were full of dust and covered completely in stains that looked as though they had not even been attempted to be cleaned. There was hair in the bathroom sink, paint peeling of the bath. The electric jug did not fit under the handbasin facet so you had to try and fill it over the bath, the bath controller was locked permanently in off position so you could only fill the jug over the shower head that was also clogged with soap scum. Old coffee and coffee wrappers were inside the drawer where the coffee was kept. Cigarette burns on most of the furniture. I refused to stay in the first room and was given the only other available room a 'smoking room' which was not much better than the first. Frankly given the gap under the doors in the room and that they have guest smoking rooms in it and clogged air conditioning units I think this is a recipe for a Hotel Fire, which would possibly claim many lives. I hope in writing this here that others do not book this Hotel since you are putting your lives and health at risk. I will write to Sydney Fire Brigade also since I feel that it is the only thing i can do to assist others.

The vent system was poor if someone smoked in a nearby room, the smell became quite strong in my room. But an open window helped. The view of the city was fantastic. The price, unlike the previous reviewer, was reasonable based on my search of similar offerings in the area. Again, location was important to me.

There was Internet access in the room as well as a proper desk, table and chair. Turndown service was good and the reception was polite and called me a cab everyday. Unfortunately, there were quite a few bad factors too. The TV was just stuffed. The reception on all channels (including pay-per-view) was completely blurry. I called reception but they said there was nothing they could do. For such basic amenity its something that should be at least watchable. The lift is appauling. Its slow, clunky, sounds like its going to fall and I crossed my fingers every time I got into it. The decor outside the rooms is what I can only describe as completely dated, the carpet and walls were stained/peeling and it was just simply depressing. The room was sound proofed from outside noise, but for two nights (during the week) there were people running in and out of rooms and around the corridors all night at around 3-4am. Reception refused to do anything about it. How can business travellers stay in a Hotel that allows people to run rampant around the place, holding parties in rooms in the early hours of a work day?
