I'll also say that a review of any travel experience is always measured against expectations. My expectation (and what I was looking for in a hotel) was a clean, boutique hotel in a convenient area in the latin quarter of Paris. All expectations were met and exceeded. Overall, I loved my stay, enjoyed the hotel and the staff, and would absolutely recommend the hotel without hesitation. Room: We stayed in the \"Man\" room symbolized by the upside down \"A\". The room was as advertised. Queen bed, very comfortable (not two twins, but a true queen). Large closet. As in other reviews, of note is that the shower and bathroom sink are a part of your room. I thought this was charming. It helped that the shower was incredible. The toilet is its own bathroom and is private. Staff: The staff were all exceptionally helpful. Someone at the desk 24/7. They had recommendations, made our reservations, called our room an hour before to ask if we needed taxis. When we came downstairs, they had maps printed to get us to our restaurants. Made the stay that much nicer. Also of note, I booked through Tablet.com. When I received my confirmation, I emailed and asked for as nice a room as possible (seemingly obvious but can't hurt) as every room at the Apostrophe is different. They were so accommodating, giving us the top floor room with a view. It was much appreciated. All in all, a great boutique hotel. Not for the people looking for amenity-driven hotels or luxury. But I wouldn't call it \"no-frills\" either. It was charming, very comfortable, modern and well appointed. But definitely a Paris Boutique hotel and not a luxury or chain-like establishment.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "Megan O", "ReviewID": "UR125381468", "Content": "A great location, walking distance to everything and close to the Metro.

The attention to detail and the environmental experience of the room (from color selection to lighting to selection of soaps and shampoo) are what make this hotel stand out as very special. Last year I stayed at the Hilton Paris hotel where I had a large luxurious, and wood-panelled but soulless room.

The location is perfect--quiet and almost residential, but close to the RER Airport line (10 min walk) and minutes away from three different Metro lines-giving you full access to all of Paris.

It was the first time I've been to Paris and didn't feel like I was drastically inconveniencing the front desk clerk with the thoughtless need to check-in to the hotel. The rooms are quite small (smaller than other rooms in Paris), but the bed was probably the most comfortable I've had in Europe (meaning, it's about average for an American bed, but doesn't feel like you're on sheets wrapped over a board). Our room had the tiniest shower I've ever seen (even in Europe) with fancy jets spraying in many directions - conceptually it was fun, but in reality, the shower stall was a bit too small for that kind of spraying, and I ended up turning the water pressure really low to take a normal shower. Rooms were not great in terms of sound insulation, I was awakened several nights in a row by the neighboring people showering in the middle of the night. The location is good if you want to be in the Paris of Parisians - near Vavin, between the South gate of the Luxembourg gardens and Montparnasse. It's a fun area to walk around, and is more authentic than more touristy areas, yet is only about 15-20 minutes from Notre Dame. The Rive Gauche is by far my favorite location in Paris, and this place is very good for wandering around and finding cute, authentic, french-speaking restaurants and cafes (especially if you stay off the big streets). It's in a safe neighborhood (much, much better than anywhere in the north), and my BF and I felt safe walking around, even late at night. Also, it has GREAT metro access - some of the best in the city, because of its proximity to multiple major lines (it's less than a 10 min walk from Port Royal on blue, Notre Dame des Champs on green, and montparnasse on green). We were there for New Years, and ended up walking from the Eiffel tower because all the metro trains were full, which was do-able - it took about 45 minutes. The only complaint is that we almost missed our flight due to the lack of planning of the night front desk clerk. We asked the front desk clerk to call a taxi for the morning the night before, and told him the time of our flight and that we wanted the taxi at 8am (flight left at 10:40, 25 min drive to airport). He apparently didn't plan for it to be New Years, and when we headed downstairs at 8am, there was no taxi in sight. He and the morning clerk were frantically calling numbers, saying \"don't worry, don't worry\" and then discussing in French that they couldn't find a taxi to come. We didn't get a taxi until almost 9am, when they called a limo company (which we had to pay for). I understand that new years was an exception, but it is also an event that happens every year, always with the same results. Luckily it worked out, but we were very close to missing our flight, and as a small hotel they didn't seem to have any sway with taxi companies, the way a large hotel would.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAll that was expected and more!\u201d", "Author": "simonpwilkes", "ReviewID": "UR122450835", "Content": "Very quirky hotel.

We flew in to Charles de gaulle and then caught the train to Port Royal on the RER line B. Gare Du Nord is on the same line, so its equally as easy to access if catching the euro star. Its then a quick 5 minute walk up Boulevard de Montparnasse to Rue de Chevreuse, where the Apostrophe Hotel awaits you. When you are navigating your way around Paris, Vavin metro stop is right near by as are a number of bus lines and the RER port royal station, I'd definately recommend making use of public transport in Paris. The lovely Isabelle, took us up to our room and showed us all the features and how everything worked. We stayed in the calligraphie room on the second floor, beautiful blue which you might assume from the pictures on the website is all over the room but its focused on the bedhead and curtains so is not overwhelming. Yes, the rooms are relatively small if you're used to the size of hotel rooms in the US or Middle east but its really all the space you need. If you had a lot of luggage I'm sure you could keep the empty cases in the hotels luggage store or under the bed to save space. We had a shower in our room which was amazing. Fantastic water preassure and every kind of shower configuration you could imagine, overhead monsoon shower head, shower jets for when you want to feel like you're in a car wash and a hand held shower attachment for when it all feels a bit too much and you just want to keep it simple. I never had a problem with water getting out of the shower as some of the other reviewers have, so I can certainly vouch for the Calligraphie room shower being contained well and water tight. We opted for breakfast in bed each morning, I had the apostrophe breakfast, 2 mini pastries, beautiful bread, jams, honey and nutella, choice of a hot drink and fresh fruit juice. Russ had the tonic breakfast, yoghurt, cereal, fresh fruit, fruit juice and a hot drink. Both were lovely choices and the quality of the food was very high. Definately kept us going each day.

We wanted a meticulously clean, modern hotel with a helpful staff. And, we didn't want to break the bank paying for these things. The Apostrophe Hotel met all of our criteria and then some. The hotel is located off Blvd Montparnasse on a tiny side street. The location off the boulevard means easy access to 3 different metro stops (representing two different lines, making most trips to restaurants and sights one transfer or less), but its positioning on the side street means the hotel is protected from most city noise. While it's true that you can hear the occasional police siren, and trash is collected on the side street daily (which could be heard from our room on the third floor) I found the hotel to be unusually quiet considering it was right in the middle of a big city. The hotel itself was perfect. There are 5 floors, with rooms decorated by theme on each floor. For every theme and on every floor, there are rooms in 3 different sizes. We chose the Pittoresque-sized, or middle-sized, room because it was only 10 or 15 Euros/night more than the smallest room. While not huge, there was room to walk around the bed, and it was so thoughtfully laid out with large shelves in the closet and handy ledges and tables, that we never really felt cramped. But the very best thing about this hotel was the staff. We couldn't have asked for more helpful hosts on our trip. We thank Laurent and Roman, especially, who helped us with directions, restaurant recommendations, and reservations at every opportunity. It made all the difference. (On a side note, if you do choose to stay here, consider a Boulangerie Julien for breakfast pastries or lunch sandwiches. Make a right out of the hotel, left at Notre Dame Des Champs, and then 3 blocks down at the corner of Rue Brea.

Since I was traveling by myself on business, the room was sufficient, but I suspect it would have felt cramped for more than one person. Also, the services were a bit lacking - I ended up ironing my shirt for my business meeting on a towel laid out on top of the washer in the laundry room. Still, I couldn't help but like this hotel. Likely had to do with the incredible staff, all of whom went out of their way to be friendly and helpful... on my departure, this included the front desk person carrying my luggage two blocks to a taxi stand, where he proceeded to wait with me for about 10 minutes until a taxi arrived (he wanted to make sure I was able to get a taxi and also that the driver knew where to take me).

The website\u2014different versions in French and English\u2014were polished and informative. And the emails exchanged between booking and arrival were warm and helpful. Apostrophe does many things right\u2014big and small: Each room is different. My room\u2014V for voyageur\u2014on the third floor was done in soft grays with deep red accents. The queen bed was comfortable and there was adequate storage space in the closets on each side of the bed. There were even enough hangars, which I appreciate as a business traveler. The lighting was excellent with overhead halogen lighting and additional LED lights on the bed for reading in bed. And the 2 large windows provided quite a bit of natural light. The room was one of the smallest I\u2019ve stayed in, but the vanity area was open, and there were several tall mirrors, so the room looked a bit larger. The shower was fantastic with overhead rainshower and side jet sprays. The room was well maintained and very clean (except for a very slight mildew odor in the sink drain). The continental breakfast (in room or in the lobby) was plentiful and reasonably priced: do try to fresh juice smoothies made by the hotel staff. Desk service was simply wonderful. The gentlemen answered numerous questions for me and assisted me in getting restaurant reservations. They were unfailing cheerful and a pleasure to do business with. The hotel faces a small, quiet street just off the noisy Boulevard Raspail. When the windows were closed, the street noise was barely audible. The hotel is in the bustling Montparnasse area, within a 5-6 minute walk of two different metro lines. It\u2019s easy to get to anywhere in Paris from here, and there are a number of cafes nearby as well as the Jardin de Luxembourg. There were a few negative aspects to my stay, but on balance they weren\u2019t significant enough to keep me from coming back or from recommending this hotel to others. First, the entry/reception is dank, dark, and when I was there, smelled slightly of mildew. It doesn\u2019t make a good first impression. Second, the room was small with very little area to work. If you are here as a tourist, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. The layout of the room, though, didn\u2019t seem optimized for normal traffic flow. Third\u2014and a major pet peeve of mine in many hotels\u2014was the push-to-operate hair dryer. Annoying. Which is why I always bring my own. The last complaint is that on all three nights of my stay from about 11 or 11:30 at night and continuing for a couple of hours, the guests in the room next to mind played their music loud enough that I could hear it through the walls. Thumpa-thumpa-thump-squeal. Perhaps if I hadn\u2019t had to get up early for meetings I wouldn\u2019t have minded so much. The first night it was quite loud; I asked the front desk staff to ask the guests to turn it down and they did, but it was still audible. Noisy guests aren\u2019t the hotel\u2019s fault, but inadequate soundproofing or placing CD/DVD/MP3 players on the wall when a bed is placed on the other side of that wall is.

The pros: - Immaculate, up-to-date, fresh and modern rooms. - Very comfortable bed, nice firm mattress, quality linens. - Extremely quiet hotel on a quiet little street - we never heard street noise and only once even heard other guests, since each floor only has 3 or 4 rooms on it. This is truly an intimate and unique boutique hotel. - Free wifi that was easy to access. - Stylish and fun room decor - we actually switched rooms during our stay after seeing a room across the hall, just to mix it up. Both had great style. - The beds have really nice headrests that make it comfortable to read or laptop in bed. - The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They got us dinner reservations, oriented us to the neighborhood, and even helped me work up the courage to brave the Metro despite my lack of French! Kind and considerate in all things. This is a very small boutique hotel, so you see the same couple people each day and they take solicitous but not nosy interest in your day. Very few cons: - Rooms are quite compact, but space is well used. - The rooms either come with a. a wonderful shower with a large showerhead and several spray nozzles on the side, or b. a jetted tub that can be very relaxing I enjoy jetted tubs but like a spacious enclosed shower (sometimes a challenge when traveling in France). The room with tub only had a shower wand. So, if you love to take a stand up shower with showerhead above, request a room with a shower rather than a jetted tub. The showers are very nice.

The decor was neat: clouds and Parisian rooftops painted on the walls, a big window looking out onto the street, gorgeous tiles in the bathroom. But really, it was more than just the pleasant atmosphere: the bed was comfortable, the sheets and bedding were super clean, and the gorgeous bathtub worked perfectly, cycling through green and blue LED lights while massaging with bubble jets. The staff downstairs was also really kind; helpful with directions and very friendly which can be a relief in Paris.

My scores are quiet high but that is because it stood up to my expectations, I knew what I was booking.

For us it was perfectly wonderful discovering an area of Paris where we had not been before. The Sunday market which is nearby is fantastic. Room: we stayed in the Paris Paradise where it is wonderful to sit in bed and be able to see the top part of the Eiffel Tower. You can really think \u2018Hooray we are in Paris\u201d. I knew the room would be small but even so when walking in it my first thought was \u2018gosh it is small\u2019.

The bed seems small at first but you need to know that you can take the large cushion off the bed and then you have a normal length. This is good to use when watching tv. We found the bed extremely comfortable. The \u2018bathroom\u2019: well as you can read here there is not one but actually that is why I choose this room, it was wonderful to relax in bath with a book while my other half was lying in bed watching tv or reading. I would say to people who are not average sized with their weight to be aware that the bath is not of a wide type, the length is fine. Having a separate toilet is a plus point here, who likes to relax in bath while your other half needs to go\u2026 Actually I found the toilet space to be the average size of toilets here in The Netherlands, so I suppose it is what you are used to what your thoughts are. I think for a special occasion this is a wonderful hotel. I would recommend this hotel but only if I knew the people would enjoy this type of room.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol UK", "Title": "\u201cEccentric loveliness in a great district\u201d", "Author": "shinyredheart", "ReviewID": "UR49982215", "Content": "We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time.

We stayed one night in a Baln\u00e9o room (the largest) in Oct. 09, but moved after the first night. The room had no bathroom (a toilet in a closet), the promised tourbillon jacuzzi bath was next to the bed, splashing it and our bags when we tried it out. No shower other than a handheld, again splashing all over, and the room (as is common in Paris) so small that there was nowhere to put bags except jammed between the bed and the wall --- and this is the largest-style room. Room and lobby very dimly lit like a nightclub, which is fun for a suite party but awful during the day. And then some logistics problems: the stereo was broken but the staff just shrugged when we asked; a power socket came out of the wall when I pulled out a charger; and there was no iron available to press clothes, except for use downstairs in their own linens room. Staff were great, very nice all around, but a bit clueless on the stereo and iron. Also -- not really anywhere near central St-Germain, quite a walk. We are young design lovers, but for all the hassles and compared to other boutique hotels I have enjoyed in Paris, not worth it.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNo separate bathroom ruined it for me\u201d", "Author": "SJ13London", "ReviewID": "UR47544339", "Content": "If you are contemplating booking this hotel, be very sure that you are comfortable with there being no separate bathroom. The shower and basin are actually in the room. The hotel's website doesn't make this clear, which I think is misleading. There is a very small cupboard for the loo. The hotel room was incredibly small, which I appreciate is standard for Paris, but is very difficult when you then have to contend with the shower and basin being at the foot of your bed - it makes it quite claustrophobic. The room was beautifully decorated, although not much thought had been given to storage - there was a tiny wardrobe with a few shelves in, but this was the only storage.
