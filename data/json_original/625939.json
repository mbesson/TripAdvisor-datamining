We were desperate to find a cheap room for 1 night and I only booked out of desperation. However, we were pleasantly surprised by our room. Clean fluffy sheets and pillows on a really comfortable bed. This is a no frills place in a location that is out of the way but if you don't mind taking the bus and already know exactly what you're going to do while in Hong Kong I would say this place is not a bad option. This place is not going to exceed expectations but it really isn't bad.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cInconvenient location & Very small room\u201d", "Author": "Vera A", "ReviewID": "UR120918797", "Content": "This hotel could be considered as the worst one that I had stayed in throughout my entire stay in Hong Kong. Firstly, there isn't any MTR Station nearby. Secondly, there is only 1 lift in the entire hotel. Thirdly, the room is rather small. Fourthly, the staff could barely speak/understand English or Chinese. An incident that had occurred during my stay there was that the fire alarm gone off just because one of the hotel tenant did not shut his/her toilet door tight that had caused the leak of hot air triggering the fire alarm.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saigon", "Title": "\u201cthere's nothing fun around\u201d", "Author": "vy_nguyen", "ReviewID": "UR115054133", "Content": "It's quite far from the center.

They offered monthly rates which worked out for my family travelling with my baby who was just short of 12 months old. The room was indeed small but acceptable in terms of the standards of Hong Kong accommodation. While it was no fancy hotel, it provided everything we needed such as towels, mugs, tea bags, electric kettle, disposable slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, bottles of filtered water daily. Everything was arranged neatly in the room. We stayed in a room with a double bed. There was a mini desk with Mirror, internet hookup, hair blow dryer, refrigerator and enough storage space if you know where to look! While they did not change the sheets everyday, they serviced/cleaned the room daily, and sheets were done at least once a week that I could notice. The only thing we did not like about our stay there, was the noise, especially in the morning. The hotel hosts a lot of guests that check in-out every few days. You could hear people talking loudly in their rooms, in the hall way, day or night. But the slamming of the doors was worst in the morning. It was so loud that you would have no choice but to get up early in the morning. This happened almost every morning! Another minor inconvenience - about once a week, when my family got back to the hotel, we would have trouble getting through the mini door entrance where the only elevator was for the building because the tour bus arrived at night and dropped of many tourists that crowded the small entrance where the reception was. You could walk up the stairs on the other side of the building but it would have been too difficult for us with our tiny baby. I suppose if you were single/without kids, just looking for a cheap place to stay, bring your ear plugs and you are set. Although there is no MTR subway close by, there are many options to get to various MTR locations by just one bus/van even taxi for less than USD$3. Another advantage of staying at the TO Kwa Wan location is that it is an old, poor but safe neighborhood. Descent restaurants are close by and they are inexpensive. You will also find bargains at small vendors in the neighbourhood.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bridal Tea House Hotel (To Kwa Wan)", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d625939-Reviews-Bridal_Tea_House_Hotel_To_Kwa_Wan-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$65 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.14-18 Sung Wong Toi Rd, To Kwa Wan</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "625939", "ImgURL": "http://img.travel.rakuten.co.jp/share/HOTEL/109337/109337.jpg"}}
