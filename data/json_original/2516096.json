Additionally, while we were there we felt that the area was particularly rough and not safe for us to stay in. We felt very uncomfortable. The cashier was barricaded and only had a peep hole. The outside of this place looks like a forgotten old motel and to make matters worse as we were leaving we saw a person in handcuffs getting arrested by the police. I must mention while we were looking for a new hotel, they manager changed his attitude and said we were now able to check in as a room had become available but it was too late. I just wanted to get out of there. Perhaps we had a bad experience and too high expectations but to me the manager was beyond rude and I felt very uncomfortable in the area.

The location is great, less than 5 minutes walk from Hollywood Blv, Chinese theater, Kodak center\u2026 very safe (even if some reviews attesting the opposite!!!).

The first day we arrived I had an issue with my credit card but the Manager helped us out fixing it and he was very patient with us, he even gave us a discount without us asking him for any thing :) Breakfast is lite and tasty, we always have a parking spot for the car, rooms are very clean and maintained if you have any request. The only negative thing that we may say is that it's a bit noisy the night because of the area, but this is what you get when you want to be in the heart of Hollywood (though it wasn't a big deal to sleep after a long day enjoying LA).

Originally, we had only booked one week at the place but we liked it so much we extended our stay for the full holiday!

The room we stayed in was clean and tidy, there was a daily maid service where our bed sheets were changed, new towels were provided and the bathroom was given a spruce.

The staff were incredibly helpful and courteous - I'd recommend them above anything else! They were able to help with public transport queries, booking shuttles for us, general chat and advice about all and sundry. They even matched online rates for us on the second week and gave us a great deal. There is also a small swimming pool at the back of the hotel, which looked fine to me but I didn't take a dip. Other travellers did go for a swim and they seemed happy enough!

Possibly their laundry isn\u2019t the best as the beds in both rooms we stayed in had several hairs in - I\u2019m assuming they changed the sheets. They have tried to modernise the rooms but they are a little rough around edges (patched doors, drafty windows, mould). EXTRAS - TV needs 2 remotes & some patience to operate. You will need to plug your laptop in to use the internet. Breakfast includes waffles, toast, bagels & donuts in a very small space so be prepared to wait. LOCATION \u2013 1 block from Walk of Stars. Great for public transport. Very central to attractions. Santa Monica / Venice Beach are pricey & most hotels are a bus ride from beach & several transfers elsewhere. Don\u2019t stay in City as there is nothing to do. Airport & South are seedy & unsafe at night. Lot of derelicts wandering about. Untidy, rough, slums abound. Sales people are sleazy.

Make sure you try In N Out burgers on corner \u2013 tasty & well priced - no wonder they are so busy. Hollywood a Great Ending Bar across the road is actually quite nice inside. TRANSIT - $6 day pass is a good option as you will need to get a number of connecting buses to get to Santa Monica / Venice Beach.

When we travel, I like things to be perfect, so I took the time to read several reviews about this place. Most of them were positive so I booked it. When we arrived at the hotel (which was easy to find using our GPS), the first thing I noticed was that Sunset Blvd. was a busy street, and that made getting in and out of the parking lot a bit tiresome. The parking spaces are small and limited, but we had no trouble with parking. The hotel was smaller and less polished than I anticipated (more like a three story motel). The Manager (Anisur) allowed us to check-in about an hour and a half early, which was a big help. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but the carpet needed cleaning. We walked about the room in our socks and within 2 minutes they were visibly dirty. Breakfast was good - a nice variety of things to choose from, but the breakfast area is small and can feel congested if more than eight people are there at one time. The hotel is located within walking distance of eating places and other amenities (7-eleven, Rite-aid, iHop, Starbucks, Burger King etc.), and about 7-10 minutes walk to Hollywood Blvd. When we stayed there, they were doing road work out front so we had a couple noisy nights to contend with, but that's temporary. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe, but I wouldn't let kids run around by themselves. All in all, this was a good choice for the price. Don't expect a three star hotel and you'll enjoy your stay. The manager and staff realize that their hotel is small and can't compete with the more affluent places, so they do a great job trying to accommodate their guests and make them feel at home.

We always wipe down every hotel room with anitibacterial wipes as soon as we arrive, and this room was no exception. In most every hotel we have ever stayed, even 4 and 5 star ones, the wipes are black when we are finished. This room totally passed the \"white glove\" test.

There are not many parking spots, so, if you have a late evening, you may not get one when you return. The parking spots are small. We had trouble fitting our SUV into one.

My only complaint about this hotel is that the price is a bit high for the area and there is a lack of security. It is possible to access the hotel by several different doors and none seem to be closely monitored by the hotel staff, but my room did have double locks. What more, the hotel's location is in an area that seems to be on the margins of tourist Hollywood and a run down residential area with a liquor store on the corner.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn Near the Sunset Strip", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77277-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Near_the_Sunset_Strip-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$74 - $160*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7051 Sunset Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90028</span></span> (Formerly Travelodge Sunset La Brea)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516096", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/14/f4/14f4a0d72bf271d284a52f0ca4fc7d165large.jpg"}}
