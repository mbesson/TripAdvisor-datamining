As others have mentioned the staff are polite (although it's an odd kind of aloof politeness which we noticed from many other Dutch staff everywhere), there is a luggage room in the main building which you can use before or after checking in/out, there is a PC in the reception which is slow as hell but at least it works, there is a daily breakfast with some nice food and drink, and for getting to the train station or the tram terminus it's in a perfect accessible location. We stayed in Room 10, for which one must climb three increasingly steep and narrow flights of stairs (it's almost as though you're climbing into your loft/attic). A bit annoying but as long as you spend most of the day out you don't take too much notice, although in an inebriated state I'd advise caution. Our room was clean, had a small TV and sink with mirror, and a couple of bedside tables and a single chair. The room can smell of cannabis when you arrive but it's easy to latch the window open whilst you're out to keep it fresh (of course, then you have a problem of fresh cannabis smoke coming in from the many coffeeshops and residences neighbouring your room!). My girlfriend and I both suffered back pain for the first two days since the mattresses are incredibly soft, and difficult to get on/off of. The room is also quite cramped, as it is at the top of the building (although I think rooms on floors below ours might have been just as cramped for having more beds in them). Yay for being able to watch the BBC and on the Dutch channel Veronica, American sitcoms like Two and a Half Men or The Simpsons. You get a sink but you have to share the Hotel's shower rooms and toilets, which are almost never occupied when you need them but feel kinda small. Whilst we were there the shower drain begin to clog up more and more until our last night when we just gave up on having a shower at all. Our failure not to mention this to the staff, who probably could have unclogged it during housekeeping hours. The location of the hotel is a huge advantage for sightseeing and entertainment, but it can be annoying as you're in the centre of the nightlife, which can be noisy even when the window is shut. We arrived in the second week-long heatwave so far this summer, so sleeping with the window shut was impossible, but even with the window open the room was too hot to move! We weren't exactly getting to bed early, but even at 7 a.m. I'd wake up to shouting matches between god-knows-who down in the street on two days, I'm actually looking forward to my first decent night of kip now that I'm back home! Overall, some people may be fine with all the hotel's setbacks, but for the price (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac72 per room per night ((\u00e2\u201a\u00ac36 per person))) I feel we should have at least had more space, or a quieter location, or an ensuite toilet and bathroom, or airconditioning, or any combination thereof. I would recommend group travellers to stick to a well-rated hostel (if there's enough of you, book a dormitory room just for yourselves) and couples like us would be better advised to find someplace outside the Red Light District. I wish I'd known about TripAdvisor before I booked the place, not to imply that Mallemoolen is bad, only that I would have wanted more amenities for the price. p.s. you get bath towels (only one other review mentioned this).", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "OMmani80", "ReviewID": "UR69379325", "Content": "what a piece of S***T hotel, rooms are totally dissapointing, if u want a place to stay and not to be noisy this is definately not the place you are looking for.

Cleanliness - shabby decor, smelt of stale fags (clearly they allow smoking in rooms) but the important parts ie. sheets, towels and bathroom seemed fairly clean (bar the fag burns on the bath - not the hotel's fault - and the shabby tiger blankets) and the carpet looked like it had been given a quick once-over with a hoover. TV in room could get signal for BBC 1. Receptionist was very helpful, giving us a map recommending acitivities to do.

There is someone at the front desk 24 hours a day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a breakfast served every morning. When we were given our key, we were told that we could leave the key at the front desk when we leave and just pick it up when we get back, just so it would not get lost or stolen. In order to get into our room each time (since we were staying in the same hotel but essentially next door), we got someone at the front desk to buzz us past the front door. There is no elevator, so we walked up 3 flights of really, really narrow stairs. The ceiling in the hallway is pretty low, but we are pretty big guys and we managed it just fine. We stayed in room #10, which had twin beds, a sink, a TV, two chairs, and a small table. The room was small and a little hard to maneuver around, but we managed just fine. Whenever we would first enter the room, it would smell like someone had been smoking drugs in it, but we would just open the windows and after a few minutes the smell mostly went away. (It is a smoker-friendly hotel and allows smoking in the rooms). Down the hall there was a single communal toilet with and sink with a lock for the door and in another room was a single communal shower, which had a lock for the door as well. We were told we could use any of showers or toilets on other floors as well if we wanted. Our particular floor's shower had a window looking into a small alley on top of the roof of the hotel, but there was a curtain between the window and the shower and then another curtain between the shower and the door to the shower room. The hotel provided us with towels and some soap. The sheets for the beds were largely clean, but the blanket had a few spots on it that I just avoided. The hotel is located just a few blocks from Centraal Station, there are a number of \"coffee shops\" and bars both on the block and nearby. You are a block away from the red light district, a few blocks away from Dam square, but you are about a 20 minute walk from what I think is called Rembrand Square which is generally a big scene at night. The area felt safe at night, but we were cautioned by the friendly police that past 12 or 1 am it gets a little bit less safe to hang around the red light district area, particularly if you are on a street where there is no camera surveillance (although many of the streets have such surveillance). Until around midnight though we were told it is relatively safe. When we were checking out of the hotel, we were allowed to lock up our bags in a storage room for the day. Overall, the hotel is in a very nice location, near various bike rental places, has friendly and helpful staff, the room was pretty good for what we paid for, and I would recommend it to others, particularly to people on a budget.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, Northants", "Title": "\u201cReally awful room and disgusting shower\u201d", "Author": "Packman78", "ReviewID": "UR32999128", "Content": "My friend and I used this hotel as we needed a cheap hotel in the centre of Amsterdam. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Only a day before arriving a person who was travelling could no longer travel. I emailed the hotel and they were able to change our booking to a 2 bed instead of a 3 bed room. We arrived very early and the staff were very friendly and allowed us to use the luggage room until our room was ready. The location itself is excellant. It is literally a few minutes and several hundred metres from the central station. It is located in the heart of the red light district near to loads of coffeeshops, bars and restaurants. This early promise though came crashing down when we got our room keys. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was incredibly small. The first thing that hit us was the odd smell in the hotel and the room and a general feeling that the room was dirty and dated. This was reinforced by the presence of numerous flies in the room. The shared toilet was acceptable, but the shared shower was really smelly and felt unhygenic and dirty. Further to this there was no hot water on the second day of our stay. Although the location is superb, this is about as bad as it gets for a hotel room in the westernised world. Do not take a partner to this hotel and if anyone likes their comforts this is not the place to go. An awful hotel room and I left feeling I needed a good clean.

The dirt encamps to its wide ones. We requested a 5 beds room and as our surprise when arriving at the room, finding a room with 4 beds of comedy and a mattress in the ground. To raise the stairs was an odyssey, cost less of raising to me the Annapurna. This hotel does not have idea of which it is a maintenance service. The baths were like sewers. The rooms that show in their official page are of another hotel. We are transacting a denunciation in Consumption. I hope that they close the hotel to them.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cpretty dodgy!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2330589", "Content": "The Mallemoolan Hotel (and I use the term \"hotel\" loosely!) is located in the Red Light District, about two minutes walk from Central Station, making it extremely easy to find upon arrival in Ansterdam. However, unless you are stoned for the majority of your stay, you will find the standard of accommodation very poor! It does not even have cheapness to recommend it, as a 4-bed room costs 30 euro per person per night. In order to get to the rooms, one has to manoeuvre suitcases up an extremely steep staircase (with absolutely no help from any of the staff who all look very depressed to be working there!). If your room is on the second floor, another staircase (which is steep enough to be described as a ladder!) awaits you. We stayed in two rooms in the \"hotel\" due to a mix-up with reservations. The first was a 5-bed room which resembled somthing from a prison movie- shabby carpets, names etched on the wooden wall panels, a scary sculpture of a cone of french fies (!!), and a window (with no lock!) overlooking a scaffold from the next door building. The communal toilet was vile in that it apeared clean but reeked of urine, and we didn't even dare set foot in the shower. The second room was marginally beter in that it had private bathroom facilities which were cleaner in smell and appearance. However, once again, there was no lock on the window, the decor was extremely shabby, and the toilet was separated from the rest of the room with only a shower curtain! It would be quite complimentary to describe the clientele as dodgy. Basically, the Mallemoolan is a great place to stay if you intend to spend your time in the \"coffeeshops\" of which, a large number are located only a stone's throw away. However, if you want to be close to the pretty parts of of Amsterdam, don't stay here.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel De Mallemoolen", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d284235-Reviews-Hotel_De_Mallemoolen-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$82 - $177*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Warmoesstraat 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1012 HT </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "284235", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/32/a0/32a01e1698149d041719b946998384b56large.jpg"}}
