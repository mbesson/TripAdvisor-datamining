Our first impressions were that the hotel was mediocre: stayable, mostly clean, not bad for the price. The shower pressure was pretty bad and the water temperature fluxuated a lot. After staying one night, my fiancee woke up with 3 bug bites on his behind. We did a check of the mattresses & didn't find any evidence of bed bugs anywhere. We weren't 100% sure that it came from the hotel so we didn't worry about it too much. The next morning I found one bug on his pillow. We immediately put it in a cup to bring with us when we checked out. We also checked online and made sure it was, in fact, a bed bug.The manager was very accommodating when we checked out and comped us for one night. She thanked us for bringing it to their attention and said they would seal off the room. The pros: - Location was very good. On the bay, close to the beach, and close to every place we needed to go for the wedding. - Walking distance to a lot of places (Seacrets, Macky's, liquor stores, the beach) - 2 pools, indoor and on the roof. The pools were nice but very crowded. - private access to the bay, very safe Cons: The bed bug (I'm don't think it's infested...I just think maybe the person who stayed in that room before us brought some with them.)", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gordonville, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA Fun, Relaxing Stay at the Princess Bayside!\u201d", "Author": "pjhershey", "ReviewID": "UR138727719", "Content": "My son and I had a wonderful 4 days in August, when we stayed at the Princess Bayside!

They polish the inside of the elevators! I saw them doing this! They clean the glass doors and walls daily. I saw them doing this. They really make an effort to keep this place looking like the multi-star resort it is. /// Parking: Plentiful parking, even when returning late at night from being out on the town. Covered parking is available, and I recommend you get one before they get full. Keeps your car cooler. The upper deck parking is usually open, but you'd better check the angle of that ramp. It's steep! /// Decor: Nice lobbies in each building. Lovely rooms and hallways. Very nicely appointed/decorated. New looking rooms and decor. Clean new linens. Memory Foam beds that are REALLY comfortable! Our room had a \"kitchen\" in it, and it was fully stocked with cooking tools. We could have used it, but didn't. Full sized refrigerator, which we did use. Microwave, which we reheated our coffee in. Coffee maker there, with coffee. /// Service: Call the desk for anything you need, and they are very responsive. We got an extra chair for the balcony immediately. We got some extra towels immediately (accidentally got wet). They helped us figure out the TV and Air Conditioning immediately. Very helpful desk. /// Rooftop Pool: Beautiful pool on the roof of the building! You must go to the pool at least once! I know, this is the beach! But, where else can you get a spectacular view of most of Ocean City, hear great music (not too loud), a full-service bar (great drinks, they make them strong here), shower, and bathrooms, all right at poolside?!

I have stayed at this hotel 5 or so times in the past, but never for more than one night and only with other couples with the sole purpose of staying close to Seacrets. The trip last week was with my wife and twin four year olds. We got the $599 special which included a 5 night stay in a standard room with 2 queen beds and a breakfast buffet each morning. If you read the other reviews I will agree, yes the shower is extremely annoying, mainly with the low pressure, but also with the quick temp changes. Yes the elevator doors close very quickly and started to shut on my daughter while everyone in the elevator just stood and watched while I had to drop everything and push hard to keep it open. Yes, the beds in the standard rooms are very uncomfortable, and are probably the worst beds I've slept on. I was expecting tempurpedic, but I guess the standard rooms have not been upgraded yet. Yes, the A/C unit was extremely loud, it kept the room cool, however, to sleep at night we turned the temp up so it wouldn't kick on as much. The room is dated, but seemed clean. The staff wasn't as friendly as they could have been, but no one was rude at all. The indoor pool was never crowded, even during the storm. The bayside beach was the best part in our opinion. There were no waves and you could walk out several hundred yards and still only be waste deep, so it was perfect for my kids to play in while we relaxed on the beach. We spent most of our time here. The biggest complaint we had was the breakfast buffet. The first 3 mornings, we had a tough time getting food. The main items they had were french toast, bacon, sausage, eggs and potatoes. They were out of all the main items but one. They were constantly bringing items out, but as soon as they set out one item, the people in line took it all. So we all had to eat eggs on one plate, then 5 minutes later we would all eat bacon, and 5 minutes later the potatoes, and so on. Not very relaxing to say the least. Then the 3rd morning was the absolute worst. We arrived at 10:20(open until 11am). They were out of everything but eggs as usual, no surprise. The problem was that the only thing my son can eat off the buffet was bacon due to his food allergies. We kept an eye on the buffet, and no bacon ever came out, finally at 10:40 I went and asked the cook if bacon was coming out. He said no, not at this point. I explained that we had been there 20 minutes and there hasn't been any bacon and that was all my son could eat. He went back in the back and came out like 2 minutes later with a plate of bacon(awesome), but still never provided any to anyone else from at least 10:20-11am. Also on the 3rd day, I found a hair in my eggs when I first started eating. I was done after that even though my family continued to eat. When the waitress came to take my plate, I pointed at the hair and told her about it. She just looked at it with a disgusting look and said \"Well it couldn't have come from the kitchen or it would have been short and black\" and then took the plate away. That's it, no appoligies or anything. I couldn't demand my money back or anything like that because it was sort of a \"free\" breakfast that came with my room package. The breakfast was one of the reasons that I chose this hotel so I had pretty much decided after that morning that I would not be returning next year. However, on the last 2 mornings, breakfast was awesome. The waitress even told me on the 4th day, that breakfast should be better today. They had everything fully stocked the whole time we were there and it tasted good. So that gave me hope that those 3 mornings were out of the ordinary. It had nothing to do with the time, because all 5 mornings we ate around 9:30-10:30. I also ate at the seafood buffet 3 nights, I would have eaten there all 5 if my wife had let me. For 17.95 (with coupon) and the convenience you can't beat it. The food was very good and fresh. I've had the seafood buffet at the Princess Royale earlier this year and I don't think I would return there, however this was 10 times better and not expected. I still prefer Phillips for the best AUCE buffet in OC, but they are 32.99 and you may have to wait in a line. For half the price and being in the hotel I highly recommend trying it. As far as noise goes, we never had any issues with the \"Seacrets crowd\" We were usually asleep by midnight though. We were on the 5th floor, and noticed several other families staying near us. Maybe they try to keep the families up there and the seacrets crowd on the lower floors??? We liked the hotel as a family destination enough to consider it for next year but I will look around more and will be willing to spend more to get a bit nicer place. We enjoyed this stay and wanted to stay another night but they wanted $259 for an extra night. That's about half of what I paid for the week plus no breakfast. I can't see paying that no matter what time of the year it is for this place. The $599 for 5 nights is about the only price that would get me to stay again.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scranton Pa", "Title": "\u201cFind another hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kate S", "ReviewID": "UR136228372", "Content": "This was the first time my husband and I visited Ocean City Maryland.

We loved Ocean City and will definitely come back, however we will not stay at the Princess Bayside. I did not complain to the front desk because I figured there wasn't anything they can do. Pros and Cons below: Pros: -The hotel is right next to Seacrets- best club I've ever been too. -We really liked the pool bar at the hotel. It was in a separate building, but the view overlooking the bay was great. -We always seemed to stumble to Finnigans in the hotel every night. They have some old school arcade games, pool and photo hunt. -The staff was really nice, everyone always said hello when we passed them. One day we didn't get out of the room until 12-1 and by time we came back later on the room wasn't clean. I called the front desk to ask for towels and they offered to send someone upstairs to clean the room. Cons: -The hotel overall has a musty smell to it. -The bathroom in the room was not clean at all. The tub AND the toilet had gross mildew stains that could easily be removed by some bleach. -The floor had all kinds of stains on it. -The blankets on the bed had burn marks on them -We had an iron, but no ironing board. -We did stay up late, however being that the hotel is right next to Seacrets, you will get those occasional people who come home around 3-4 in the morning. I would not recommend this hotel for families. -The walls are paper thin and the doors to the room slam unless you carefully close them, again its very loud at all hours of the day/ night. -The water pressure in the shower is awful and there would be times where we would get a stream of ice cold water then scolding hot water. -The tub is a hazard itself. It dips in the center and has awkward bumps in it. We always had to be careful not to fall. -The air conditioner was set to 67 degrees, however it felt more like 75 degrees. It was also very loud and kept me up all night. -The beds were as hard as a rock, we woke up with back pains every night. -The pillows on the bed were flat. -We ordered room service one morning and it was the worst meal I had during my stay in OCMD.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Emmaus, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "Aunt_Tamster", "ReviewID": "UR135898424", "Content": "I am a tough critic when it comes to lodging.

We left the \"do not disturb\" sign (which is in 3 different languages) on the door on 2 days but the maid still knocked. The toilet sometimes had to be flushed a few times (enough said about that.) The buffet was good but only if you know the trick ... at first we got the prime rib from the buffet pans where all of the food was. It was like leather. We asked the person behind the counter to cut a fresh piece. After all, the prime rib it was sitting next to the buffet under a heat lamp. Apparently this was too much work for him and again, we got a piece that was cut hours earlier sitting in the pan. I explained it was very hard and he said \"it's the same meat.\" After I asked again, he cut another piece. Aside from that, the buffet was decent, especially for the price in OC.

So we changed and went to the pool (which is rooftop and really nice!) It had a great view of the bay. The only bad part was you had to walk a ways to get to the building that the pool was on and then take the elevator all the way to the top. Then you got up to the pool and there was no bathroom, so you had to get back into the elevator and go down a floor to find the bathroom. And just so you know, there is only one bathroom that we could find on the 5th floor and it has a handicap sign on the front and there are no signs telling you where the bathroom is so good luck! After the pool we laid out at the bay (not that many chairs so bring your towel to sit in the sand). I really like the bay area because there are no waves and it is very relaxing. You can also rent kayaks, paddle boats, everything right there behind the hotel...very convenient! And the front desk will give you coupons for it. We finally got to check in at 4:05 (late!) Our room was ok, nothing special. Really old tv, couldn't even hook up a DVD player to it. Shower had no pressure and if someone else was taking a shower on the floor then the water would not get hot. The really bad part about the room was that their was no balcony :( We love to hang out on the balcony and read :( Anyway, the walls were paper thin and drunks coming from Seacrets would wake us up at 3-4AM screaming and running down the hallway for HOURS! I couldn't believe that hotel security didn't say ANYTHING to them! I really think one of the managers was from Jersey and so were the drunks so they were probably buddies. By the second night, I had enough and called security myself. They are lucky I didn't just call the cops because it went on ALL night!

Then, he offered a $ 50.00 discount from the $210.00/per night and late check-out. We rejected it again.

We picked the Princess Bayside because of its close proximity to Seacrets as well as its central location in Ocean City and price in the off-season. Let me start by saying, after spending the weekend here, I inquired about the price of the same hotel room during peak. IN NO WAY would I ever spend more than what we spent ($89/night) much less $300/night during the summer! The Princess Bayside's condition was disappointing (considering I think it is owned and managed by the same company who is affiliated with the Princess Royale).

We even became trapped in one of the elevators on Saturday night - we were staying on level 5 of the main building and the elevator door would not open on level 5. Luckily were able to get the elevator to move back down to level 4 and a staff worker was able to pry the door open so we could take the stairs. The hotel room was nothing to write home about. When we arrived, the carpet was wet. Once we turned the heat on, it did dry out by the second day, but we proceeded to wear flip flops the entire weekend as to not walk barefoot on the carpet. This may have also explained the damp smell to the bedroom. The bathroom was moderately clean on arrival, but we know for a fact the housekeeping staff only replaced our towels in the morning (the sink and bathtub were never washed out). When our towels were replaced, they weren't even replaced with the same number and we never received clean washcloths. The TV is old and the beds are hard and flat - a far cry from newer flat-screen TVs and updated bedding many hotels have added in recent years. They are also only covered by a poor fitting flat sheet, which didn't scream sanitary with the outbreak of bedbugs in hotels. If you can get past the lack of cleanliness, DO NOT expect to get a quiet night's sleep.

I've never seen anything like that, and seemed to receive an attitude from a bunch of people around OC. The hotel front Desk Manager Barbra was the worst, She was condescending to us off the bat as we walked through the door to check in. There was a problem with the way the man over the phone booked the rooms, and she told us we had not paid any money on the rooms, even though my brother paid off the $700 bill the credit card company charged him, after arguing with us she quickly realized her mistake, but her attitude didn't change for the better. Me and my brother and friends weren't hyper or acting crazy like you would probably infer with us being a bachelor party, but we were polite and refrained from causing any problems. That night we returned from seacrets at 2am and admittedly our party was loud for that hour, talking to other guests in the hallway, but nothing crazy and obnoxious. Security came up and was extremely rude in how they told us to quiet down, which we gladly did so not wanting to cause any problems, so we went into our rooms and my cousin let the door close itself ,which if you know hotel doors can be loud, but unintentional, the security guards said we we slamming doors being too loud and told us we were getting an eviction warning. so my cousin signed it we told them we were sorry, and tryed to calm our friends down. we all went to sleep then, but the were four or five other rooms in that hallway making noise and slamming doors. then next morning my two cousins who were staying in one of the four rooms we had booked and paid for for two nights had an emergency and had to leave after one night. the asked if they could get a refund for the night they were staying for at 8am and were denied so they turned their keys in. my brother whose name the rooms were all in found out and asked for the keys back, being they weren't in right to check that room out. after being rudely told we weren't allowed to have the room back even though we paid for it, my brother convinced the desk manager to give us keys back for that room and give two guys in one room their own room. we ate breakfast and hung out at seacrets for the rest of the afternoon until 3pm when we came back in my friend try to get into his room, the key did not work. The hotel security manager told my brother that we were evicted from that room and that they had rented it out to other people, that we had two eviction notices ( we had one warning) and we lost the room even though it was paid for, that we were being too loud last night and slamming doors. ( which other rooms were making much more noise than us) we were told The hotel general manager was not there to talk to he made a decision and left. and that if we want to argue with them about getting our refund or our room back they would evict us all from our other rooms. we called the cops on them and eventually they gave us 66$ of the 178$ spent on the room back, plus the $178 they made by double dipping on one room by renting it out double. If our cousins didn't leave I believe the hotel satff would not have done what they had done and taken our room. I believe they seen an empty room on a holiday weekend and found any grounds to make money off of that. I also heard of other people getting evicted that weekend, and the hotel staff taking the guests valuables out of their room (ie. diamond necklace, jewels) at least we received some of the money back, but DO NOT go to this hotel it is dirty, smells bad and I don't care what the hotel says about their pool meeting health regulations, minimum code is way too often still below par. the pool room is too humid and muggy and smells like feet. it might be clean but it sure isn't pleasant. there is no ventilation in the bathrooms. The hotel staff is the rudest customer service I have ever seen, almost like the soup nazi, or genos or pats steaks in Philly. One thought of advice to the hotel who says they cater to families over people who stay there to go to seacrets. Treat you guests equally, the money is the same. I know families are a different type of crowd than a bachelor party, but learn something about why your guests are coming to stay with you. Try and group familys on a different floor or other end of the hallway from guest taking advantage of you location next to seacrets, that is better business sense than evicting people", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "salem", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "JerseyGirl003", "ReviewID": "UR39601692", "Content": "I would stay at the Princess Bayside again.

We went out to dinner, and after the rest of our party met us, we entered the last room at 8:15pm upon entering the room there were 2 holes in the wall, clearly there were there before as there was no dust, or dirt on the floor at all. upon calling the front desk to notify them, security and maintaince arrived, they threatened to call the police, and accused us of the damage, we pointed out that there was no debris around and still they insisted if we did not pay the 300 dollars they would have us arrested and everyone else evicted from the rooms. obviously we were cornered into this scam, this price was later lowered but we had to pay cash as credit is not accepted, although we found this all disturbing we had no choice, as the weekend went on ants overtook room, we were afraid we would be accused of bringing them in from elsewhere so we didnt dare complain as it may cost us more money! after several years of staying in this hotel with a large group, and a yearly long weekend with my wife at the princess royale this incident alone, the way we were treated and called liars, the terrible conditions, burn marks on the hair dryers, most outlets not working, lights broken, bugs etc...... it is clear that this will be my last stay at either of the princess resorts.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "DE", "Title": "\u201cGood stay overall, some problems\u201d", "Author": "justBeachyOCMD", "ReviewID": "UR38299062", "Content": "Overall this hotel is nice, spacious, and clean.

Usually we stay at the Best Western just a few blocks away, it's a brand new hotel with spacious rooms and it's less expensive than the Princess Bayside. However, we ended up booking a last minute weekend trip and the Best Western did not have availability. Since we were going to OC primarily for Seacrets we knew this location could not be beat. Seacrets is directly next door. The Princess Bayside does have a great location. Unfortunately that is where the positives begin and end. For starters, the decor is shabby at best. This is not a big complaint to me but I think must be noted considering the competition at this price point does not look as generally run down. This theme extends from the 80's pink Golden Girl lobby to the guest rooms (we stayed in the main building). The 2 elevators are old, tiny, fetid and slow to service the 5 floors. The corridor leading to the rooms on my floor was not ventilated at all and I can only assume the AC unit stuck at the end of the hall in the wall was not operational. Luckily, our room was on the end of the building leaving us with only one neighbor. There was a large gap beneath the door that allowed hallway noise to enter the room. That is another issue, because of the excellent location to Seacrets the drunken circus that plays nightly in the halls is a bit much. I actually watched a person do what I can only describe as somersaults down the hallway one night after dinner and I believe the time was only 8:30 pm. Once liquored up they were a nuisance and quite inconsolable. I would not stay here with children for that reason. Otherwise, the AC unit in the room was also very loud but it was a welcome change from the traffic noise (the room faced the road directly) and sounds from next door. Although I set the thermometer down to 70 it never got very cool in the room. The decor here too is tired and dingy. It did appear to be clean but the shower drain did not do so at all and after a few minutes was very much both shower and bath which is repulsive in a hotel. The sink drain's stopper also appeared to be in a permanently semi-closed position. My friend called the provided hotel hairdryer a relic that she would not risk turning on. We did pass by an indoor pool off the lobby that I believe would have been a health hazard to enter although it seemed quite a few less discerning patrons took this calculated risk. All the staff I encountered were friendly. Check in is at 4, we arrived right at this rush and it was a slow and frustrating experience. I am not a picky aristocrat who thought I was booking a room at the Ritz. All in all it did meet our basic needs but I believe the price should reflect its shortcomings. Even in the world of overpriced OC hotels, there are better options at this price point.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Street, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWe're coming back next month!!!\u201d", "Author": "avatar1295", "ReviewID": "UR37650547", "Content": "I have been vacationing down Ocean City, MD since I was a teenager.

Would not have booked it based on other reviews, but we were planning a last minute holiday weekend trip, so we did not have many options. Our biggest problem was the noise level. First of all, our room was located directly outside of the elevator lobby. It wasn't the people coming and going that was a problem, it was the contant bell that dinged every time the elevator was in service. Second of all, and more problematic, were the other guests in the buidling. Our next door neighbors were blaring rap music day and night. At one point, they put their speakers out on the balcony and proceeded to stand out there, singing along at the top of their lungs! We were appalled! We called the lobby and they did come right up and give them a warning, but it only forced them to turn it down every so slightly. We were a group of 4 young people; I cannot imagine how upset a family would have been. The decor of the hotel was outdated, but fine. The beds were Tempurpedic and really comfy, so that was a plus. For the price, it's what you would expect, so i can't really complain. My favorite part was our balcony overlooking the bay. I would HIGHLY recommend getting a bayside room. Unfortunately, there are very flimsy dividers between each balcony, so it doesn't feel that private. Plus, if your neighbors decide to put their speakers out on their balcony, you're not going to have a very relaxing balcony experience. Finally, the proximity to Seacrets was a huge plus. It was super convenient to head over there. It was also a very easy walk to the beach.

A friend whom I was going with ranted and raved about her previous stays at this hotel, especially because it was right next to Secrets. When we arrived, check in went smoothly, our first snag was the parking. It took forever to find a space and we didn't want to park up stairs because of having many bags to carry and you either have to drag them down steps or a very steep ramp. This hotel doesn't seem to offer those rolling luggage carts, and if they do I don't know how since the elevators are much too small. We entered our room, 5th floor facing the ocean, and the first thing we noticed was the peeling wall paper. Touching the walls also yielded a sponge like consistency. We next found ants crawling on the walls, side table and table and chairs. We ignored this as it was only a few and we were ready to party. The shower was so horrible that what would have taken 20mins was much more like an hour. It came out so weakly and wonky that most of it squired up on the ceiling tiles and ran down the outside of the tub. Also the shower no matter what you had it on would go from normal to freezing cold to boiling hot in a matter of seconds. When we went to brush our teeth we found that the sink immediately clogged up for no reason. So the next morning we called the front desk. We explained about the problems and were told there were no rooms to move us to, even though the sign said vacancy the whole time during our trip. He convinced us to let them clean the room and it would be better. Big mistake, we had more ants after they \"cleaned\" than before. When we finally checked out we were given $50 back and told to write a letter to seek more compensation. There were 3 of us so they can expect 3 letters.

Unfortunately, though, an apparent bachelor party was taking place next to our room with lots of drunk men carrying on until 4:00 AM in their room and the hallway. We experienced it all including loud thuds on our wall in the middle of the night. I had to call the front desk to have someone try to get the \"boys\" to stop with the noise at 3:00 AM, which worked for all of about 20 minutes and they started right back up. My 10 year old daughters also unfortunately got to see two naked men standing knee deep in the bay at 11:00 PM one night when we returned from dinner. So much for the bay view. The pool was not \"swimmable\" very murky unhealthy looking water and our door had to be slammed very hard to close all the way. Kind of makes one nervous when you are a mom with two little girls next to a room of drunk men.

The drunk men were also at the pool, drinking by 10:00 AM using vulgar language, etc. I personally would not stay here again unless the hotel went through a major renovation, including new management.

We choose this hotel for our weekend getaway because it is close to Seacrets, a great bar/club/restaurant within walking distance. Also, because we enjoy the short distance to the beach. There is a newer part to the hotel in a separate building, which is where we stayed. We booked the suite overlooking the bay and were on the 3rd floor (room 335). Check-in was very quick and we were able to be placed on the same floor and right next door to our friends. This was a plus considering that the hotel was completely booked this weekend. Our room was clean upon arrival but definitely in need of updating. It felt a little bit run-down. A nice thing though was the Swedish tempur-pedic mattresses that had recently been added. They were very comfortable and made for a good night's sleep. Around the second day, after our room had been cleaned and vacuumed, a strong odor developed similar to if a dog had been kept in the room after a long day at the beach. Not kidding. It was definitely coming from the carpet - which led me to think that maybe the carpet needed to be ripped out and re-installed. Yes, this is a beach town and I understand that moisture can be an issue; however, this was not a mold smell. Our other friends did not have this problem. It was isolated to only our room. We did not attempt to get another room because we had already been informed the hotel was booked solid. We were only in the room to sleep and only for two nights, but I feel this should be noted. The small beach in front of our room was tidy and raked each morning. Hibiscus trees had been planted and it was a nice place to walk to in the morning and relax. Beach loungers also were set out. We had breakfast at the hotel the first morning (never dined here before). It was buffet style and not good. Wouldn't waste the money going there again. Service was awful/non-existent. Our server disappeared and I proceeded to hunt for utensils. We had to find her for the check and she barely said a word. In conclusion, I honestly wouldn't stay here if it were not walking distance to the beach and also if Seacrets were not nearby. We love to go to lunch there and sometimes go at night. It is a convenience factor. Plain and simple. Do I feel this hotel is worth what is paid per night? Absolutely not. But we found a great deal on Hotels.com for $124 per night for a bayfront suite and went for it.

The hotel room itself didn\u2019t smell but that didn\u2019t really make us feel any better.

Room - We had a standard room in the main building, facing Coastal Highway. Noise could be heard during the night, coming from the street, from trucks to screaming people. They are also constructing some condos across the street from the hotel, and I would notice the sound of construction around 7:30 a.m. each morning. I would recommend asking for a room that doesn\u2019t face the street. The room had a small fridge/freezer, coffee pot, hairdryer. We were able to call downstairs and have an iron and small ironing board brought to the room. When we asked for two extra pillows, the staff was prompt in bringing them up. The cleaning person was a Russian girl, who had trouble understanding that we just needed clean towels. It was hot during our stay and the air conditioning worked fine. I didn\u2019t notice any significant smells (such as mold or mildew), but you\u2019re down at the beach, and every place you stay at will probably have the saltwater and sand smell. The thing I didn\u2019t like was that they didn\u2019t use fitted sheets on the beds, the sheets would come un-tucked and rumble up during the course of the night. Pool \u2013 The roof-top pool was nice and secure. They had a good mix of kids and adults, and nobody was out of hand. The bartender closed the little bar they had at 4:00 p.m. (5:00 p.m. if he was busy enough). Selection was kind of limited. Beers \u2013 Coors Light and Miller Light for $3. Daiquiris and other alcohol ice drinks for $6. Hot dogs and Bar-B-Que, I think around $6. The Pool had an outdoor shower and provided towels for your use. Island music was piped in over the speakers. There was construction going on next door, so you have the sights and sounds going on with that. There were little pieces of Styrofoam that would blow into the pool from the construction site, but was cleaned up each day. They were pretty vigilant making sure that people didn\u2019t bring their own food and drink to the rooftop pool, especially at night. The pools closed at 10:00 p.m. each noght. The indoor pool was nice, also had towels, but was a little hot and humid to just sit around at. The hotel had a little beach on the bay. It was nice to sit at, but I\u2019m not sure if I would go swim in the water. The fireworks for the convention were shot off from a barge in the bay in front of the hotel and the hotels beach provided the best seats in Ocean City, (as well as the bay front rooms). The hotel is a short walk to the beach, but you have to walk around the construction site, some of the equipment and workers. There is also a covered parking area so your car doesn\u2019t get to hot during the day. When I was checking in at the front desk, a foreign worker was there and couldn\u2019t understand my name until I wrote it down. Other than that we had no problem. There are a lot more foreign workers in Ocean City, so try to deal with that, and you\u2019ll be fine. We didn\u2019t eat at Finnegan\u2019s, but we did gets drinks there in the evening.

I highly recommend!", "Date": "January 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cnot impressed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4358303", "Content": "My friends and I stayed at the PB for a long \"girls weekend\". When we arrived we found that the sliding glass door was broken and off the track. It did not lock either. Five women in a room that does not lock. So much for feeling safe! There was a Party going on next door which was ok until all the party guests stared strippping and running into the bay! Our room was on the second floor bayside. We got quite a show. I would not reccommend this for families. I agree with most of the other posting as far as the smell of mold and mildew. We did not actually see it but it was there. One good thing is that it is very close to Seacrets! The pool was ok but there are ALot of \"young\" adults that hang out and drink. We are all thirty something and were looking for a quiet gettaway. This was not the place.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cRestful and Enjoyable Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4299032", "Content": "It was a getaway for a few days for our family.

Our families stayed there also for the wedding and we all had a wonderful time. The staff was very helpful and went above and beyond their call of duty to help us during our stay. Our rooms were nice but typical of a \"mid range\" hotel. We never had any problems with cleanliness of the rooms. The only part I did not like was the restaurant in the lobby. The service was horrible! I did discuss it with a manager and they were very apologetic but anyone in our families who ate there had the same complaint.", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cHorrible at the Princess Bayside Resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4020664", "Content": "After spending a three day weekend at this hotel, I will NEVER use the Princess Bayside Resort again! This is certainly not a resort! We arrived to find that NOT only was this hotel not on the oceanfront or boardwalk as advertised, but that it was also in the process of renovations that we were not notified of. In fact, to get to the beach you have to walk across Coastal Highway, go down a block and then climb over a sand dune to get to the beach. And I suppose they could say that they were on the boardwalk if you factor in that they are on 48th Street and the boardwalk starts at 20th Street. I guess that is close for them?!?!? One of two small elevators was broken the first day, the shower in our room had a leak from above, and the door between our room and the adjoining room didn't close entirely. We left a cell phone charger in the room, and after 5 calls and four days, to a security person to retrieve it, I was told that he didn't know if he had ours because they dont tag items, but if we paid for postage ($25), he would send something that may work. I told him that we called twice within an hour of leaving the hotel and that we had friends in the area that would have retrieved it, but he didn't seem to care that his ignoring of our call, or the fact that no other staff member would walk to check the room was horrible customer service. Do yourself a favor and next time, book on your own. Using the service stuck us with a 7 day no cancellation policy, where other hotels are satisfied with canceling within 24-48 hours. Princess Bayside Resort should not be on anyone's vacation plan. The hotel should take the advise of their customers in this and other reviews that I ignored in error.", "Date": "October 13, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Princess Bayside Beach Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d280377-Reviews-Princess_Bayside_Beach_Hotel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$90 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">48th Street &amp; Coastal Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "280377", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/08/13/08131ea697c96183111485ea9f53abf53large.jpg"}}
