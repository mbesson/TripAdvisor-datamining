The setting is spectacular. We stayed in room 1 which was one the ground floor overlooking the Grand Canal in fact you felt you were actually on the Grand Canal. We arrived in style by water taxi right up to the front door. I don't think we would ever have found it otherwise as it is reached by a very long narrow lane but once you knew where it was it was a 2 minute walk to San Tomas waterbus stop.The Rialto Bridge is an easy 10 minute walk and St Marks Square about 20 minute walk. In our opinion it was the ideal spot to stay close enough to the centre but far enough away to be more tranquil and detached from day trippers. The room was very comfortable and although not huge it was big enough. The term Junior suite was perhaps a little misleading in that respect. It was very quiet cosidering it was on the Grand Canal. The double glazing was very effective and heavy curtains blocked out the light so much so that we slept in one morning and nearly missed breakfast. Breakfast was very good. Four platters were served at your table one with hams and cheese,one with breads, a fresh fruit platter and pastries. Eggs and bacon were available for a supplement but we were very happy with the selection that we were served. The bar upstairs was a lovely spot to sit with a glass of Pinot Grigio overlooking the canal.

The suite itself is not really a suite, just a bedroom with an en suite bathroom. We never thought it particularly large either unlike other reviewers - good size but not huge. Bathroom was lovely with nice toiletries. Good 'rain' shower but no bath. Service was generally very good but on a couple of times we had to wait at the bar until someone appeared from behind the kitchen door.

The lady on reception wasn't particuarly apologetic but said she would come back to us.

The hotel does not have a restaurant, but the breakfasts were amongst the best we had the entire trip. Patricia was wonderful - she recommended restaurants each night of our stay and her selections were excellent. I wish I could have had her at every hotel on the trip! Sangal's rooftop dinner was one of our best dining experiences of the entire trip - we also had a wonderful dinner at Linea D'Ombra and for something more casual we ate twice at Muro Frari (very near the hotel) - both meals and service were excellent. At the end of each night, we would enjoy after dinner drinks back at the hotel's very romantic bar on the small balcony overlooking the canal - the perfect ending to each day of long leisurely walks exploring Venice. Throw away your map and just enjoy wandering and soaking in the charm of the back streets. Avoid the crowds of Rialto Bridge and cross the canal the way the locals do - pay one euro via the Traghetto - quick and easy and there is a stop just near the hotel.

Firstly let me start by saying that you must book a private water taxi from the airport - it was a fabulous way to arrive and certainly gives you an amazing view of the city as you head towards the hotel on the Grand Canal. It is pricey at 100euros but certainly worth it. I would say that if you plan on taking the vaporetto and then walking the 5-10mins to the hotel that you might get a little lost and you will not get the right first impression of the hotel as it is down some very narrow little alleyways. I personally wouldn't bring children to this hotel (or to the city for that matter as there is so much walking and so many bridges to cross) - I was a little concerned when I saw on the website that it had been voted one of the most romantic hotels, but thankfully my mother and I didn't feel out of place. There are only about 20rooms so it has a very intimate feel and both the breakfast and the drinks served in the bar in the evening were very good. (Tip - sit out on the little balcony overlooking the Grand Canal in the evening with a glass of Bellini!) The rooms are all doubles and we had a lovely room overlooking a side canal. The only point I would make is about the bathroom - as lovely as it is, it is very dark so not great for doing your makeup. There is a great mirror with a little TV in it but unless you leave the door open to the bedroom you cannot hear the TV and personally I would've preferred the mirror to be 'steam free' rather than have a TV in it. The rain shower was lovely but it did have this round 'disc' in the floor of the shower that tilted if I moved my weight which was a little worrying as I kept thinking I might fall over (not entirely sure what it's purpose was). But apart from that small 'gripe' the room was lovely. The surrounding area is also nice and is away from the main tourists hot spots, so go wandering and find some beautiful churches, hidden alleyways and great shops I could go on about how fab this city is but I won't - you just need to go and experience it for yourself!!

The service is excellent, breakfast was very good, and the rooms are beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable, and fortunately very well sound proofed, baring in mind we were sharing the hotel with the family from hell. On day one, the hotel posted a note under our door apologising for the noise, and suggesting that we took breakfast after 10am in the morning. The reason being was that they had a family group who were staying in the hotel, who had booked without notifying the hotel that they had a large number of children in their group. The next morning, we took the hotels advice and waited until 10:15am before heading out for breakfast. To set the scene, breakfast is served in the restaurant area, which is basically one end of the bar area. Most of the hotels rooms are located just off of this area, down a short corridor. What faced us that morning was a scene of mayhem. This is a five star hotel, and this family group had taken over most of the tables in the restaurant area, and their children were proceeding to run a mock in the restaurant and bar area, as if it were their personal play ground. The family were barely dressed, with one of the group eating in her dressing gown and slippers, they proceed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 their orders at the two poor members of staff who were doing their best to cope. That evening we returned to the hotel after having dinner elsewhere, to find that quite drink at the bar was quite impossible, as the family had taken literally every chair in the bar, dragging them in to a circle in the middle of the room, preventing anyone else from using the bar. This family treated the hotel as if it was their personal residence, with little or no regard for any of the other residents, and even less regard for the staff who were doing their upmost to cope. This behaviour continued, until Sunday morning when after a series of complaints by other residents, the hotel manager finally stepped in. The group fortunately left Sunday, leaving the other residents to finally enjoy the piece and quite and ambiance of this first class hotel. I have read what other guests have written about the Hotel Palazzo Barbarigo, but as a seasoned traveller I have two rules, research your choice of hotel, and treat others (including hotel staff) as you would wish to be treated yourself. The Hotel Palazzo Barbarigo is not, and does not pretend to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel suitable for young children. It is a small, beautifully decorated, chic and well run haven in this fabulous, but busy city. As for the staff, I found them charming and pleasant, but then again my partner and I tend to treat the staff in the same manner as we expect to be treated. If the hotel could learn anything, they need to get hold of situations like this sooner. Where guests are disruptive, and spoiling the stay of all of the other guests, they should be dealt with swiftly and firmly.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwhat a disgusting hotel with rude obnoxious staff only interested in status and money\u201d", "Author": "seasonedtraveller092", "ReviewID": "UR110740912", "Content": "Oh my god! What a hotel!!! Due to work I am forced to travel every month but fortunately get to stay in the best hotels in the world. I booked this hotel as a surprise for my sisters 40th birthday for me and the whoel family - but what a disastor. Valentina took the booking and was fully aware of the family and children that were coming as she wrote on an email that we would need more water taxis due to the amount of strollers we needed..........however just a week before we were due to arrive she emailed me cancelling the booking claiming that she wasnt aware of the children. After she screamed and shouted on the phone she was only willing to reinstate the booking once she found out the family were featured in the Sunday Times Rich List - indicating that if you have a healthy bank balance then you are welcome - if not don't bother. However in hindsight I wish i did cancel the booking there and then as the hotel ruined my trip - the staff we rude, arrogant and obnoxious. I came off a water taxi holding a baby, a stroller and 3 shopping bags and struggled to carry all into the hotel while the man on reception merely watched me and didnt offer any help at all. As Valentina has a habit of lying her comments that we didnt make of the reservations that we had booked is just another lie - we asked to change one but when we were told we couldnt we still went and really enjoyed it. And we made all our own reservations anyway. The only reservation the hotel made for us was a waste of time - it was a fast food chain that we had to walk 25 minutes to get to. We left to the kind words of GOOD RIDDANCE and to be honest we felt the same. The hotel has nice decor but the bathrooms are small, they obvioulsy dont like changing towels as they have complained on the other review and the staff display the most disgusting, insulting language and actions I have ever experienced> I am sure they will respond with a whole reply but as I have mentioned Valentina is an expert at fabricating the truth!!!!", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flobecq, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cbeautifull hotel, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "ofabre", "ReviewID": "UR110464875", "Content": "We stayed in suite N\u00c2\u00b08 and had a wonderfull three days in Venice.

The staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke very good English. We had the junior suite, room 9, pretty spacious by European standards. The bed and pillows were comfortable, especially after a long day of walking around. There was a separate area for closets, suitcase storage, and getting dressed. The bathroom was a bit small for the size of room though, and there was no counter space. The hairdryer was nice, very strong.\u00c2\u00a0 The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the nearest vaporetto station, San Toma, and from various shops and restaurants. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge and about 20-25 minutes from St. Marc's Square (San Marco), depending on how fast you walk. It is definitely worth making the walk all the way to St. Marc's Square at least once to see everything along they way. We found a great shop that was selling Dali clocks on that route. After that, the vaporetto's are definitely the way to go; it's not that difficult to figure out which one to take to get where you wanted to go. You should also take a trip to St Marc's Square at night; there are considerably fewer people there after dark. It's much easier to take pictures of things. With our \"Indulge in Venice\" package we got from the hotel, we got a bottle of wine, flowers, a \"limo taxi\" tour, one dinner, and transportation to/from the airport/train station. The \"limo taxi\" tour was extremely nice; we were able to take pictures of everything we wanted since it took us around the entire Grand Canal for about an hour or so. The transportation from the airport and then to the train station was oh so nice since we didn't have to try to cart our luggage around the city, over bridges, etc. It took us to the door of the hotel and to the steps of the train station.\u00c2\u00a0 Now for the dinner the hotel recommended, made the reservation for, and provided: the food was incredible. The food was so good, in fact, that we went back the next night for dinner again. The first night we went, we had two courses each, each had dessert, and a bottle of wine, all on the hotel. When we went back the next night, they weren't open yet, but they invited us in anyway. They were obviously still preparing to open... Putting out Citronella, still in their street clothes, etc. The lady there (we assume she was one of the owners) remembered us even though she didn't wait on our table before. She invited us back to the kitchen to see the vegetables they had that night and offered us samples. The waiter we had the night before remembered everything that we had ordered the night before. We ordered pretty much the same thing since we enjoyed it so much the night before. The restaurant name was \"Trattoria da Ignazio\". When we got back to the hotel, we tried to thank the lady who had recommended it to us, but we never saw her again.\u00c2\u00a0 This is also the first hotel we have seen in a very long time that has an actual key to the room.

These are rooms you enjoy being in. The bathroom could be bigger but it's modern and stylish. The water pressure (important to me) is strong and the water hot. The heating / air conditioning in the room works well. There is also free wifi, which is a huge plus. The breakfasts are bountiful and really yummy. Huge spread with breads, cheese, fruit, local meats. Good coffee. Brekkie is served on the 2nd floor. What I love about small hotels is that you don't have to go far to get anything you need.

The Palazzo Barbarigo is a sleek, sophisticated, and discreet hotel situated right on the Grand Canal. We lucked out on a great rate and found ourselves enjoying a level of luxury (in Venice of all places!) we normally would not splurge for. Just the ticket for a romantic getaway. Location: \"Hidden gem\" is a very appropriate term here. Yes, alighting onto the private dock from a water taxi via the Grand Canal is the grandest and most expensive option, but for those of us looking for an authentic (and cheaper) Venetian alleyway maze alternative, the Palazzo Barbarigo also delivers. The hotel's land entrance is at the end of a long, narrow alley with 2 sharp turns. More generally, the hotel is located in the San Polo area, a bit far from San Marco, but allowing us a chance to explore Venice by foot and vaporetto. Hotel: Professionally designed with sleek, sultry undertones. Reception area on first floor faces the water entrance. Arriving on foot by land definitely feels like the back entrance. Building is short - only 2 floors. Sophisticated bar and breakfast room on the 2nd floor. You absolutely must have a cafe or cocktail on the balcony overlooking the Grand Canal as the boats putter by below. Bar area was mostly deserted during our stay. Room: We booked a Classic room which had a view of a side canal and a partial view of the Grand Canal. The room just oozes discreet refinement. 4 poster bed with luxurious sheets and bedding. With sleek, black furniture, polished to a glossy sheen, the room manages to successfully pull off feathered boa lampshades and felt printed wallpaper without coming across as a bordello. Black granite in the bathroom and a small flatscreen TV embedded in the bathroom mirror completed the room. Kudos to the designers. Service: A bit cold at reception. We couldn't tell if it was because we arrived on foot and were not wearing designer clothes or if the staff is trained to be distant. They are certainly unobtrusive and discreet...sometimes to the point of not being around when you need them. Like for check-out or for a drink at the bar. Also, the guy at reception tactlessly announced that \"yes, you have the 'no-frills' room rate\" at check-in. Internet: Free wifi...if you can get a signal. As mentioned by previous reviewer, the router is in the bar/lounge area and signal in the non-suite rooms is dismal. Value: As stated above, we managed to book a \"No-frills\" rate of 120 euros for a Classic room that normally starts at 170 euros. \"No-frills\" simply meant breakfast was not included, which was fine for us, as we were absolutely satisfied with the luxury 4-star accommodations.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with a tragic flaw\u201d", "Author": "nysteve", "ReviewID": "UR39610266", "Content": "Excellent, location, great staff, beautiful small boutique hotel.
