{"Reviews": [{"Content": "this is for Ohana Hostel 411 Washington Ave I was in this hostel for 8 days in December 2008 and I can say that it is nice place to stay and an excellent place to meet people from all over the world. The place has been renovated very recently so many things are brand new, such as the bunk beds, the air conditioners, the bathrooms (showers and sinks) , the light fixtures and the furniture (usually two small arm chairs and a small in-room fridge), and the lobby. The location is perfect for my taste, because it is only 2 blocks from the actual beach and all the fancy places on Ocean Avenue. It is right off of Washington Avenue which is THE street for all the bars, clubs, restaurants, you name it. It is not right in the middle of everything like some other hostels but I liked being south of 5th Street because it is a bit quieter area and I want to be able to rest when I want to.The cons... unlike the hostel description which will have you believe everything is readily available and free, keep the following considerations in mind. The wireless internet works pretty much only in the lobby which is actually outside in the courtyard of the property. It doesn't work in all rooms especially those which don't have windows close to the lobby. Even when you are in the lobby, there is no power during the day - for some reason the outlets which do exist there are not turned on. I requested the power to be turned on but was told they were on timer with a light sensor, or some nonsense like that, so I was basically out of luck. You can only work on your laptop if it has good battery life. Also, not all rooms have private lockers - I stayed in 3 different rooms and only one had lockers in your room. You will need to bring your own padlock. There is a locker closet next to the Front Desk but the people at the desk are very busy and you have to wait quite a lock to check your stuff in and out in the common locker. They were not giving tickets or tags identifying what belongs to who so anyone could have requested my laptop. None of the rooms has a plasma TV which is what my reservation says. The room service is not daily as advertised. For the most part my room was clean but as Jan-1 approached and the hostel became almost filled to capacity, the overflowing garbage container in my room was not picked up for 2 days and nobody came to even provide toiler paper. Still the hostel is quite clean in general and they do try to keep it clean. If you need to turn on your A/C, you will have to go downstairs to request the remote control as this is the only way. They seem to have only two remotes so if they were given out, you have to wait and hope that whoever has the remote, would return it soon. Sometimes you just give up. The same thing with the iron and the hair dryer. If the iron has been given out, they have no idea who has it and when it will be back at the Front Desk. In the last room I stayed, which was 223, the windows could not be closed. They are the old building windows and the crank to close them was broken. The same was true in my first room which was 112. I wanted to moved from that room since the air conditioned didn't work and the room was WAY too noisy - with all kinds of noise coming 24/7 from the front desk area, also from the people huddling to use (or wait for) the internet-connected PCs, and the night club next door. I had a much better luck on the second floor but up there the room was on the other side so I could not access the internet, there was no locker, and the windows could not be closer, so noise from the street and alley was coming in. The free breakfast consists of 1 jar of peanut butter, 1 container of margarine, 1 jar of jam, 2 loaves of cheap white bread (wonder bread - way too soft for my taste), only 1 communal plastic knife for each jar which everyone uses to spread the above on their toast. They also have bland coffee made in a regular home 12-cup drip coffee machine, the creamer being of the powder kind, and no sugar and no spoons provided. The free dinner consists 90% of the time of rice and beans, and fried chicken. If you are vegetarian and you are tired of eating beans and rice, don't look to the hostel for dinner. Also, they would routinely run out of stuff - we have no more bread, sorry or we are out of rice/beans, sorry. The free happy hour featured only soft drinks. I guess happy for some only... Other things which don't exist but they have written these items in some hostel booking web sites: no pool table, no game room, no indoor bike parking, no night club, no restaurant, not wheelchair accessible, no self catering facilities, no English Class, no Spanish Class, no Movie Nights, no free Poker Nights, no bingo Nights... etc, etc, etc.In conclusion, regardless of my cons section being considerably longer than my Pro section, unless I find another place that is cleaner AND a quieter, I would stay again at Ohana Hostel South Beach again but I will adjust my expectations next time, for such things as noise level, the internet, the lockers, the free breakfast and dinner and the housekeeping service. Usually hostels don't provide any of the above stuff anyway so Ohana South Beach is still the best hostel I've stayed at (I've stayed at hostels twice in the US and once in Europe).", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR723572213", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fastTraffik"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d1196040-r23239911-Ohana_Hostel_I_South_Beach-Miami_Florida.html", "HotelID": "1196040", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
