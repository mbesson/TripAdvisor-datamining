The hotel is family run so its operation is well supervised and the guest rules are monitored so everyone can enjoy their stay. The motel is very clean and very well maintained. We have stayed at the Ocean Mecca many times in the past and also tried other motels, but we feel that this is the best value for out money. We have stayed at some of the newer high rise hotels only to be dissapointed by the lack of friendliness or helpfulness at other hotels. We even had belongings stolen at one of the other high rise hotels which was owned by foreigners and we had an extremely had time trying to get them to reimburse us for the stolen articles. Our belongings were in their care when they went misssing and we could not even get them to review their security cameras. We have never had an concerns with leaving anything in out rooms during our stays at the Ocean Mecca. My hyusband noted that many of the staff are the same as when we stayed there years ago. I made our reservations on Wednesday night and was arriving Thursday. The young man who answered the phone on Wednesday night quoted me a price for Thursay night and another price for Friday and Saturday night, which was going to be about $35.00 more each of the two weekend nights ( as is frequently the case & I was agreeable to ). However, when I arrived I was informed that the price I was quoted was wrong and the price for Friday and Saturday night was not going to be any more than the rate for Thursday night. What a pleasant surprise. They were very honest and could have very easily charged me the additional amount. I would just have to think that anyone with negative comments probably does not like to follow the rules which are enforced by the management to make everyone stay more enjoyable.

Also, on day three, they asked us all for our ID\u2019s, something they should have done on the first day. They did not give us a reason. They then went in our room (after housekeeping was completed much earlier that morning) without asking us. I found this behavior unprofessional considering we were faulty accused of wrongs from day one. Although one of our friends was over twenty three and most of us were nineteen- adult age- we were treated like we were twelve year olds. Also, keep in mind that no guests are allowed on the premises, even if they are visiting for a couple of minutes. This added an unnecessary stress to our vacation.

We did enjoy our stay, even with the kids upstairs running around and sounding like they were coming through the ceiling at any moment. However, when I inquired about a room for a relative who would be arriving over the weekend, I was told by Neil that I should call on the Thursday of that week, and she could give me a \"deal\" on the price, because they don't drop their prices until late in the week if they're not filled up. She was very convincing that the \"deal\" would happen. When I called on Thursday, she in fact did have a room available, but now she said that they wouldn't be able to drop the rate till they arrived on Friday. I booked it for them, and when they did arrive, they of course now say they had to pay full price. $260 each night. Being that they didn't want to take the time to find another more reasonable price, they paid. Upon entering the room, they find that they paid \"full price\" for a room with no refrigerator. No table and chairs, only a desk that served as the dresser to put their clothing in. They asked at the desk for a room with the frig, and were told that the cost of that room would be $320 per night. That's absolutely ridiculous!!!! They had rooms available, because they were NOT sold out.... but would not move them. While I said that this was a nice \"little\" hotel, that is true, but to be so dishonest to me about what they could provide for my family member, only to get me to take the room, is inexcusable. My family most certainly could have had another room at another motel, just as nice, with a frig, and all the amenities, for ALOT LESS than what they had to pay at this one. Their dishonesty to me is something I will NEVER forget, and I certainly will NOT stay there again because of the deceit. I made a HUGE mistake in recommending this to our family member, and in the future, I will certainly stay in other hotels that I've had pleasant experiences at, and in Ocean CIty, there are many.....
