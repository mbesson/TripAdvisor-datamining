{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent service I have just returned from barcelona spain where i stayed for one week in a rented apartment that i found off the internet called [--].Barcelona itself is an amazing fast paced city, which can be quite tiring after some time, so it was great to have an apartment located in the centre of everything and to also have the apartment be so perfect for us. Everything we needed for our stay was in our apartment and the service we received upon arrival was in a professional relaxed and yet attentive manner. Couldn\u9e93t have asked for better. Check them out if you are wanting your own apartment and not just a hostel or hotel.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR690732315", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "injeegirl"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1101231-r17651262-Daily_Flats-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "1101231", "Price": "$183"}}
