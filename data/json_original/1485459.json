Would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could---but can't give it 4. We chose this hotel based on the sterling reviews from this sight + the decent discounted rate we were able to get. For the most part we weren't disappointed. We stayed her in March 2012 during spring training. The hotel is across the street (within walking distance) from the Angels stadium and training facility. During the week--this was a pretty well run facility---but on weekends, thronged with baseball fans, it was a different story. Elevators and their foyers were left disgustingly dirty, despite the front desk staff being advised of the problem. Hallways were filthy. Housekeeping services were very disorganized. The whole place from management to maintenance--just didn't seem to give a darn. Even during the week there were some flaws: the pool & spa (that I witnessed) were only cleaned once a week--on Mondays. Pool towels were a crapshoot ---some days they were supplied--others not. The exercise room had a nice towel rack and water cooler ---but never during our stay were towels or cups available. Housekeeping was a guessing game---early in our stay they consistently arrived during the afternoons ---while we were out---perfect! Then mid stay they started inquiring if we \"needed anything\" fairly early in the mornings--then toward the end of the stay--once, they didn't show at all- and two other occasions--we felt they wouldn't have shown had we not complained to the front desk---after 5PM. The no shows and lates were, again, on the weekend. Hate to seem so negative. Overall it was a pretty decent place. Well located to the freeway system---friendly front desk and hospitality staff. Given the reviews here though--I'd have to say we were slightly disappointed. We'd probably stay here again--but might look for a Spring Training base that wasn't so close to a stadium. Some tips if staying here: there are only two TINY wastebaskets for the entire two room suite. Bring a few larger trashbags , particularly for the kitchen. The pool is not designed for sun worshipers. At least in March --only a small portion of the pool has any sun until later in the day.---stake out your sunspot early!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "chubmasterp", "ReviewID": "UR125821329", "Content": "Huge rooms and lobbies.

It is at the eastern end of the Cotten Center Business Park, and is close to PHX. The hotel is fairly new (don't know the actual opening date) and still is \"shiney\". My experiences with the staff were all very positive, especially Dorothy for the evening meal and Bizarre at the front desk. The fitness room is probably the best I've seen in a hotel, bright and airy with a view out to the pool. My first stay my room was a handicap room. My only complaint with that room was the shower. It did not have any sort of shower curtain or door, so the water would run out into the bathroom area. I had to use an extra towel in addition to the shower mat to prevent that. Since this shower is wheel chair accessable, I don't know what could be done. Other than that, both rooms I had were fine. Although you have a full kitchen, you probably won't need it Monday through Thursday. The evening meals are pretty good. If you do choose to dine out, local options are limited. There are several fast food establishments around the corner, but no Chili's/BJ's/Texas Roadhouse type places in the immediate area, let alone \"fine dining\". You will have to drive 15 minutes or so to upgrade your dining choices.

The hotel is close to the airport and located in a business district, but also not far from ASU. I booked this hotel through my corporate travel and was surprised to see that all the room types were the same price, so I booked the presidential style suite thinking that it was probably a mistake. Well, it wasn't. I asked the gentleman at the front desk if I really got that suite and he said yes. Check-in was easy and the front desk staff were very nice. Housekeeping also did an excellent job and the staff in the dining room were helpful and kind. I was assigned to room 325 which is also equipped for guests with disabilities. So the counters were lower, there was a walk-in shower, etc. All the front doors to the rooms look charming. Upon entering the room, I was wowed by the size. I'd guess it's about 1000 square feet or so. There's a kitchen, dining area, large living room, separate bedroom with a sitting area and a large bathroom. Then there's a balcony with a view of the pool and a view of the mountains to the north. The kitchen is fully equipped with a full refrigerator, sink with disposal, flat top stove, plenty of cabinet space and a pantry. The counter tops are granite and there's a large pass through bar from the kitchen to the dining area with three bar stools. The dining area isn't walled off, but rather some space between the kitchen and living room with a table that seats 6. Off to the side is a work desk with a comfortable chair, phone and wired internet (wireless is also available in the hotel) for free. The living room has a sofa, loveseat, ottoman, and a 42\" LG LCD TV mounted over the gas fireplace. There's a glass door that opens to the large balcony that wraps around to the bedroom with another door. The living room and bedroom have separate thermostats. The bedroom is also very large with a king bed and a sitting area with two chairs. There's another work desk in the bedroom with another internet jack. The closet in the bedroom is average size. There's a chest of drawers and another 42\" LCD TV mounted on the wall. The bathroom is huge with two sinks, granite counter tops, plenty of drawer space, a 32\" LCD TV mounted over the Jacuzzi tub, and a walk-in shower. It was really nice to pull out the TV to watch while getting ready in the morning. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast and 'dinner' in the dining area adjacent to the lobby. The breakfast includes hot foods such as waffles, etc., or pastries, cereal, juice and so on. The buffet dinner varies. The night I was there they had some pastas. And they include free bottled beer, soda and water for guests. Any of this can be taken back to the room. The hours are limited and the hotel does not offer made to order entrees or room service. There's a pool and a very large hot tube in the center of the hotel. They also have a fitness room, but I didn't use to to rate it. The drawbacks I found were very minor. The high speed internet isn't very fast. I used the wired internet because I was getting about double the speed of the wireless, but the best I could get was about 0.4 mbps download speed the evening that I tried it. Contrast that with 5.5 mbps I get on my 3G phone. As I mentioned earlier, the hotel is located in a business area which was within walking distance to my office. But there are very few restaurants nearby (mostly fast food). I ended up dining over by the university which was about a 10-15 minute drive. I tried out the Jacuzzi tub in this particular suite and wasn't impressed. The jets barely made bubbles and the tub itself wasn't very comfortable. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely stay here again when I return on business.

Staff needs to be able to read people after a long trip and give 100% attention when people arrive. No side conversations. Example \"what does this mean?\" several times by young lady processing my reservation on the computer to \"Stephen\" who then \"fixed\" whatever issues she was having without explanation. He then ran my card and scared the daylights out of me by telling me my card declined. Worried that someone hacked my info and stole my identity as I had been traveling. Mind you this was for a one night stay. Hubby to the rescue. Sorry his card declined also. You may need to call your bank! OMG! Call the bank which was fortunately still open and spend 10 minutes with what I thought was a three way converstion until I realized hotel staff was not listening to me at all. Bank says plenty of money. Finally they ran it through again and it went through.Must be a problem with the computer! Too late, damage done, holds on both accounts now and then Steven asks if I want him to talk to the bank? HUH? No thanks, you both have been very unsympathetic and I am tired, frustated embarrased, but will talk to a manager as I am considering leaving. Manager comes and says he's sorry.I am not impressed. Hubby convinces me to stay. Otherwise: Managers reception was very nice, includes beer and wine. Front desk staff should take notice of hostess Dorothy, genuinely nice, hard working, friendly and very efficient. Same with hostess in morning (didn't catch her name) , real gems. Food very good, both breakfast and dinner, 24 hour coffee, reception area large, good flow, good selections. Rooms spacious, clean, great beds, flat screen TV's. Pool area small but nice, large spa. Large patio area with BBQ's. Hotel 100 % non smoking which I understand but still drives me nuts, can't there be 10 feet of an area outside away from everything for smoking so that smokers can be polite and not offensive? I saw smokers out front and on the patio \"sneaking\" a cigarette like high school, and there were ashtrays sitting there. I just don't get it. Especially for an extended stay. No airport shuttle before 6am but hotel will comp the cab which ran about S12.00 USD.

A supermarket with liquor (Fry's) is about a half hour round trip walk, or take the shuttle. Staff welcoming and accomadating. Free parking.
