{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Restful and Clean The NH Cornella is a convenient and restful place to stay if you have a flight in or out of Barcelona and simply need a place to decompress and regroup. It is not near the city center, but has all the last minute amenities you might need including a nearby mall ,grocery store, and pleasant urban stretch of benches and grass across the street to soak up the last vestiges of people-watching, evening walks and conversation. The ride to the airport is fairly short. The rooms were spotless and comfortable. They provided a great night's rest without noise from other occupants. The staff members were friendly, attentive and professional. There were no problems at all with this hotel and it should be highly recommended as an alternative to staying in the city center before an international flight or lay-over.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR417539052", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "urbanberber"}, {"Content": "Gutes Hotel f\u7709r Gesch\u76f2ftsreisen   showReview(11217017, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR784771478", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "wegdiel"}, {"Content": "Excelente ubicaci\u8d38n y valor   showReview(10022050, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR900853642", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pablogonat"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d259369-r14592369-NH_Cornella-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "259369", "Price": "$105"}}
