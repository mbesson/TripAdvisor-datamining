The rooms are very large and comfortable, surrounding a beautiful garden courtyard. The restaurant has good food, including breakfast and lunch buffets (try the enchiladas verdes!) as well as a fabulous Sunday brunch. There is a small workout room with treadmills and weights, as well as a small indoor pool (if you are inventive, you can figure out how to swim laps in it). The best thing about the Quinta del Rey, though, is the staff. Everyone there went out of their way on a consistent basis to make my stay comfortable. They truly became friends and I miss them (and those enchiladas) since my project ended. They will go the extra mile to you in any way they can.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR449698502", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "travelgirl75206"}, {"Content": "Nicest Hotel in the City       typical bedroom", "Date": "Dec 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR402822983", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Travlein-man"}, {"Content": "Excellence in Toluca. I got married in toluca last september, I booked quinta del rey for our first two nights after the wedding. When I checked in about 3 hours before my wedding and with the rush of the event I forgot to send flowers to my wife at her house... I asked the front desk while checking-in if they could arrange something and they sent a beautiful flower bouquet to my wife's house and another one to our room at my request.... The room was out of this world... and the price super low.... We had a beatiful time... and we checked out with that feeling of wanting to stay a couple more days... When you get that feeling you know you have been in a very nice hotel.... Thanks you Quinta del Rey for a wonderfull 2 night stay...", "Date": "Sep 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR189310624", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bororin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d248807-r16582674-Quinta_Del_Rey_Hotel-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "248807", "Price": "$126"}}
