Looking to contract this hotel for our Tour Operation in the UK, I went largely \u201cunder-cover\u201d , here\u2019s the feedback. The best positioning anyone could ask for \u2013 for people (even like myself that do not relish the fact of trawling around a large City) \u2013 I can honestly say it was ideally positioned on a) the main shopping street and b) for all into designer shops -right on the door-step !! and more importantly for what most come to Rome for c) the Historic attractions of this great City. The Spanish Steps are the nearest attraction (basically out of the hotel turn left and there they are!!) (2mins away). The furthest away being the Vatican (30 min leisurely stroll) PLEASE NOTE ROME IS FLAT AND IDEAL FOR EVERYONE!! The Grand Plaza Hotel \u2013 yes it has the wow factor of design and history. We found the staff (on all occasions) extremely helpful. The rooms were typically historic and what one would expect in Rome. The main lounge \u2013 wow! \u2013 simply stunning \u2013 (one thing is that it only lacked music!!) \u2013 this should be 24 hours \u2013 Grand Plaza, please take note. Would we recommend it \u2013 yes! Will we be contracting it \u2013 yes! Loved the stay, had a great time and to be honest - it\u2019s the kind of hotel you will never really forget. I have read some of the below reviews \u2013 one who states they are \u201cvery well travelled\u201d ???? Maybe they didn\u2019t stay at this hotel as I (working in the industry) - found little to criticize \u2013 even the breakfast spread was great!! That took me by surprise too!

We chose to splash out a little bit because of this, and chose this hotel due to the location and because of the reviews regarding it's grand decor. I had already read a few reviews, so I knew not to expect perfect finishes to the decor. On arrival, the reception staff were polite, but appeared slightly absentminded at times. It was difficult to tell if they were concentrating on what you were saying, as they appeared to be multitasking a lot of the time, and didn't make the time to gesture to acknowledge your existence. However, it was only a small grumble. The staff for the remainder of the stay were very attentive, very toddler friendly and helpful. We had to go to the bar to buy milk for our baby bottle, and the gentleman behind the bar was very friendly, polite and helpful enough to warm it up. The room we were given was beautiful. It was a suite, and had a sofa bed, which we used for our toddler. The only bug bear was, after the first night, my son had a little accident on the bed, so we took the sheets off and left them on the floor of the bathroom, hoping they would understand that they needed replacing. Unfortunately, from the smell of the sheets later that night, they put those sheets back on the sofa bed, so we had to bring him into our bed that night. The breakfast was included with our booking. It was a buffet, with some pastries, sausage and cereals. Not the best range of breakfast buffet I've had, but the room decor made up for it. It was like eating in the ballroom in the Sound of Music. I definitely did not regret staying here. The location was perfect (round the corner from the spanish steps) and the grandiosity of the place was breath taking.

So we were really looking forward to visiting Rome for 4 days in what appeared to be a beautiful grand hotel in the Heart of Rome, we couldn't be more wrong if we tried! We stayed for three evenings and believe it or not we had three different bedrooms due to the fact their cleaners must have been on strike for the past 3 years!!! Dirty, filthy and very poorly maintained is just the start of the list. Highlights of the hotel include; ======================= a) In all three rooms there were electrical wires hanging from the walls particularly in the bathrooms. b) The wall next to the sink in all three bathrooms included the previous guests toothpaste slashes. c) The bed had a bedframe added to make it look nice, but was not attached?! d) Light switches that simply do nothing. d) ear bud on floor in hallway for 2 days!!!! e) There were stained cots/matress just dumped in the main hallway!!!!!!!!! f) Both elevators had a broken rail and were smashed up beyond repair. g) the safe... ok, this was not safe, I could walk around the room with it, or even out the front door of the building as no security existed and it was not fastened to anything. Also whilst on, after putting our valuables in it, the lock combination brown and we had to wait for the 1 maintenance man (didn't speak English) and missed breakfast. h) If you like breakfast, get there fast, because once the juice/milk/everything runs out, they simply don't replace it. i) Air conditioning (when it works) is noisy, in fairness this was not a problem in our first room due to the fact it simply didn't work at all. j) In our final deluxe room (this was an upgrade), the TV cable does not reach the TV socket, so don't expect to watch TV. k) unsurprisingly the hotel Manager is never available. l) Even on arrival we felt ignored by the receptionist who carry on with other administrative duties when a queue is growing! In summary without lying or joking this is actually a 3 star at a push, please please don't even think you will slightly enjoy this hotel, it really is the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in.

I have stayed in many many 5 star hotels and do find Italy overgenerous on its grading but they need to be corrected as you are selling on a misconception and misleading clients The only thing 5 star were the bar price at \u20ac10 for a Gin and Tonic. You may benefit from looking at the competitors as the Quirinale was a better hotel for much less money and the stay with you defeated the object of giving my a treat for her birthday.

I had hardly overcome the yucky feeling when I discovered nail clippings on the shelf under the bathroom mirror. Not the welcome I had expected in a hotel that charges a rack rate of more than \u20ac 500 for a small room! (I hope that no one actually pays such sums for staying there). My room was small (especially considering the five stars); the TV did not have the many foreign channels that the hotel boasts about - in fact only two in English (BBC News and CNN); The Grand Plaza charges an unbelievable \u20ac30 per 25 hours for Wifi in the room; in the reception they had one computer attached to a printer (e.g. if you want to print your boarding card for your return trip), and it is occupied most of the time. It is not OK to keep people hanging around for access to one measly PC when you are a five star hotel. When it was finally my turn to use to computer, the internet-connection was out of order. I waited for a member of stay to come and fix it. When he showed up, he just restarted the computer and walked away without a word. It did not solve the problem, and I had to give up my plan of printing that damn boarding card altogether - having spent more than an hour on nothing. Just not good enough. The noise from the street is overwhelming because of drumming musicians until around 10 pm. Don't expect to be able to sleep during the day if you need a nap or are jetlagged. Get a room as high up as possible. The bed was remarkably hard - or maybe it's just me. A least the sheets were clean. The breakfast is OK, but no gourmet paradise: cereals, the ever-present sweet, dry cakes, sweet croissants, a bit of fruit, etc. The coffee is great. The area is wonderful as is most of Rome. It is very very hard to stay angry or down-hearted in the Eternal City so I shall certainly be back - but not to the Grand Plaza. This hotel is a clear case of bigger not always being better, so if by some miracle you manage to book a double here for \u20ac 150 then by all means take it, but if you are faced with a rate higher than that go somewhere else.

The hotel lost our reservation, saying we booked it via an old website.. which doesn't make sense. When you see the hotel you do get a sense of how grand it is, but you also get an immediate sense of how much work needs done. The carpets are filthy, torn and need replaced. I don't even have words for what type of repairs need to be made to the walls, ceilings, & floors. I understand that for an older hotel you must overlook slight cosmetic flaws, but this was in the least way slight. The room never got cool enough, we finally called on our 2nd day to see if they could send a repair person out to check the machine. When we returned from our day of sightseeing we came back to find that someone had smoked cigarettes in our room. We are all non-smokers so we could tell immediately.

That you are definitely not at an ordinary place. The lobby area itself is enough to make you feel like you are in a grand ballroom. It's decorated with sumptuous red fabrics, gold cravings, stained glass dome, with huge dripping crystal chandeliers. Breakfast rooms and other smaller rooms throughout the first floor echo the same opulence. Yes, this place needs a lot of work in my opinion. But I think that's part of the charm of a Roman way of life, instead of having it in the hands of some big international hotel company. It's not the five star commonly expected in American standards. So, if you are looking for value for your high room rate, please look else where. We stayed here 2 different times. One night before our cruise and 4 nights after. We came as a large group, booking 6 rooms for 14 people, with some people in triple rooms. The triple rooms were essentially a room with 2 separate bedrooms that could easily accommodate 4 people, and a shared bathroom. My husband & I stayed in a double room. The first stay, my husband & I got a really large room facing via Corso. This room came with a large bathroom with 3 shower heads! It was an awesome room we slept so well. No complaint here! The second stay we got a quiet room facing the courtyard. A smaller room with different format, with a bathroom with bathtub & shower. Not much room for 2 large suitcases, but we managed. Loved their crisp white linens that are so heavenly soft, including the plush towels. My only complaint is the bed. I should say, the old spring mattress sprung me awake every time my husband moved! Location is awesome, just around the corner from the fashionable Via dei Condotti and Spanish Steps. It's easy to just walk around everywhere, which is the great joy of exploring Rome is on foot. The location is also so centralized that it's wonderful to be able to come back for a few hours to refresh yourself before hitting the town again. We didn't need to take a lot of taxi, except when we went to our cooking class in Trastevere and to the Vatican. But from there we usually we ended up walking back to the hotel anyway. Getting taxis is quite easy, if not in front of the hotel, there is a taxi stand just a short walk away on via Tomacelli (where there is a Ferrari store!).

Ultimately, a kind person at an airport transportation window called the hotel and handed me her phone. The person I spoke with there said there had been a problem and told me to just wait in the line for a cab. I ended up speaking with a District Manger for the Grand Hotel Plaza who apologized, said he would look into the situation and requested that we ask for him when we got there. He did not disappoint as he told me how sorry they were for the problem and that he had upgraded us to a suite and had a basket of fresh fruit waiting for us upstairs. He sent our bags ahead, gave us a tour of the stately and ornate property including the history, the marble-lion staircase and the fabulous Salon delle Feste ballroom. Along the way he introduced us to the head of each department, telling them that we were his special guests and to be sure that we were treated accordingly. The hotel is on the Via del Corso, which runs from the Piazza de Popolo to Piazza Venezia is a wonderful street, crowded with pedestrians and entertainers and designer shops.

The location is fantastic. We walked to coliseum and St. Peters twice (about a 20-30 minute walk). The Spanish steps are just a couple minutes away by walk. And, you\u2019re right in the heart of a busy shopping area. (2). The hotel is like a small palace - the hotel ballroom, the lion and the staircase are all very spectacular and classy. (3). Breakfast Room with beautiful d\u00e9cor, fresco \u2013 I felt like I was eating inside a beautiful museum and under marvelous paintings. (4). 5th floor Lemon Terrace \u2013 A nice area to relax and look over the rooftops of Rome. Room Highlights - --- Our very nice and spacious executive suite had two large, lovely rooms, a nice bathroom, foyer, separate dressing area (with a floor-to-ceiling mirror) a balcony facing the inside court yard. --- There was a big gazebo was right next to our balcony. I spent quite a lot of time at the balcony after our sight seeing. It was perfect for relaxing or reading with some wine or snacks. The courtyard was a very pretty area full of lemon trees. --- The bed was extremely comfortable. They\u2019ll put a bed board under the mattress if you prefer firmer support. I wish I could take their bed home. --- The bed linens, bath towels, and robes were all very clean and of a very high quality. The Grand Hotel Plaza truly earned its five stars. Minor Issues --- The front desk staff was very busy at all times, meaning you might have to wait a little bit to get an answer to a question or to make a request. --- Internet service was sporadic on weekends. They told us this was normal, because of high device traffic in the area (people on the busy streets carrying their I-phones and smart phones). If you NEED internet service because you\u2019re doing some work on your trip, this can cause problems. The front desk did have a backup plan for us in case service was completely unavailable. We were finally able to get online late in the evening. --- There were no English language newspapers available in the hotel, but they were able to direct us to where we could find one. All in all, worth splurging for a five-star experience on a very special occasion.

The room was very very small, even for Rome standards, Included in our deal - was free mini bar and breakfast. The minibar had 3 bottles of water and a tonic for us to choose from, it was not replensished on a daily basis, in fact the glasses weren't even cleaned on a daily basis. Breakfast was ok, cakes and coffee, although there was an al a carte menu, which seemed pretty reasonable. Reception staff were unhelpful and one in particular was down right rude.

We did find the dining experience in the Rome restaurants disappointing but we do have high expectations.The hotel is a little faded and the command of the English language of the staff was imperfect.

I like the custom but not when I get a reluctant sigh every time I ask for my key back. Sheesh! The building is old and grand but in dire need of an upgrade. The rooms were obviously once elegant and technologically sophisticated. But half the buttons didn't work, the wall covering was dirty and looked burnt, the bed was huge and relatively convertible but the metal was rusted and flaking off. If we squinted our eyes, we could envision a beautiful room, but as it was, it was trashy. Also, don't believe the pictures on the site. There is no fancy rooftop bar (it's closed and difficult to get to), patios are overgrown with weeds and not much fun to sit on. Given the exchange rate, this was a huge waste of money for us. We had a good time but we were on our honeymoon and took the whole thing in stride as an adventure. But even if the exchange rate had been 1-to-1, we wouldn't have felt like we got anything close to resembling a good deal. If you have tens of millions of dollars you'd like to invest, I highly recommend buying the Grand Plaza, firing the staff, and renovating the building.

When i got to the bathroom i went to run a bath we had a suite with jacuzzi bath which the jets didnt work oh well i didnt expect there to be a jacuzzi bath anyway, But when i did run the bath as the and relaxed i went to drain the water from the tub and the bath would not empty so i called room service for the 4th time they sent someone who could not speak english up to my room and didnt know what i wanted him to fix so i pointed at bath and he left room and then i got call from front desk saying it would be fixed ASAP! we then went out for drinks and dinner got back to hotel late to find our bath still full of the same water that was there when i left and the same water that would still be there in the morning after!!! not on for a 5 star hotel 3 star or any other star hotel for hat matter! I went to speak to the manageress about the situation and was hopeing to move rooms to have a room myself and partner could shower wash in but she was the most RUDE person i have ever spoken too! and said it would be fixed and that she was not awere of the problem and why didnt i call front desk! after the day before they sent someone up! she said theres no note that i had asked to have someone fix our bath!! Now hoping that when we got back to the hotel after a day in sunny wounderful Rome, we would be able to shower again the bath was full of the same dirty water from the first day! i went str8 to the desk rather annoyied and demaned to speak to the Night manager and was told shes at home asleep and that i would have to wait till morning at this point i lost it and then i got allowd to use another rooms bath!

We had a family apartment on the 2nd floor as 3 family members were travelling together. The room size was very good and the outside space great to relax.

The downstairs rooms shown on the internet are fantastic and basically just shows off what the hotel could be like. They have no useful purpose though. The manager did not turn up at 9am to discuss the lack of room cleaning as promised. We did speak to him on check out to discuss why the rooms were not cleaned.

An April rate of \u20ac198 per night for this hotel was a fairly reasonable rate (in my opinion). B) The hotel lobby is grand in appearance, but is mostly empty. It looks great, but they could do so much more with it. C) The food, as with much of the food in Roma is good. And if you don't want to eat in the hotel, just go outside and there are plenty of places nearby. D) My room was \"upgraded\" (see photos) and was fairly large with a large bath. The not so good news -- A) Noise, although I travel a lot, and stay in many hotels this is one of the issues that I struggle with. The hotel is old, so you have to give it some slack, but my room was too noisy. Noise from the street came through the window, but what was most disturbing was that you could easily hear the people in the room next door. When they were talking to each other, or on the phone you could easily hear them and almost make out every word. B) Hot water? Not sure what happened one day, but didn't have any hot water. Front desk was not very helpful and we never did figure out what happened or why. The next day it was back to normal. C) Internet, at a \"reasonable\" \u20ac15 per day compared to other European hotels, it was a bit temperamental and slow. It could easily be improved. All in all, this is a hotel that could benefit from a heavy duty makeover, improved service and if they could put these things together it would be a great place to stay.

I see that one couple gave it a Five Star Rating, but trust me, this is ABSOLUTELY not a five star hotel. If you asked me if I would stay here again, the answer would be \"possibly....if it is the best deal.\" Being located just blocks from the Spanish Steps, the hotel is in a great shopping and dining area...and that is the hotels best calling card!

The hotel has a deep inner lobby area that is a visual feast, as you will see in the hotels website.... but it is never used, perhaps because there is no food or beverage service there. It's best for just...looking at when you check in... Our group was all maddened by the hotel internet service...sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. The hotel staff was barely useful in helping us with getting it to work. As we were on business, this proved particuarly difficult and in the end, we went down to the Vodaphone Store two blocks away and bought wireless cards for two hundred Euro to work around the hotels intermittent internet service. This proved a difficult challenge for many of us. And the internet center in the hotel, with just two computers, was often broken or not working. So as a business hotel...forget it. I had a grand suite...although the television in my room would not work. The front desk staff is kinda/sorta friendly, but feels like they are in a deep slumber. Working here must be a job for life!

I am in my 30's and stayed here with my girlfriend for four nights in July 2007. The 'Grand Plaza' provided me with the most disgusting hotel experience I have ever encountered. A stunning lobby and downstairs decor and a superb location.....where could it go wrong?? Firstly move to the bedroom floors and you will find a delapatated, stale smelling, run down, unmodernised and ill maintained set of rooms and corridors. The room i stayed in contained furniture that was falling apart, a toilet floor filled with leaking water, a shower that wouldn't be powerful enough or warm enough to wash a bar of soap and prehistoric air conditioning that did not work. It lacked style, comfort and feeling. The door provided little security and the safe resembled a childs' moneybox. (Please read other readers comments regarding the safe.) Breakfast ceased being served at 10.30. Unusually for myself I decided to make an effort and recover from a slight hangover and go to breakfst about 10.20. Lucky for me!!! Two days running at least 10 stunned guests were turned away for being no more than 5mins late. The entrance door was closed and locked, then manned by the head waiter. Rather than allow guests in, the waiter became involved in various very load and public shouting matches with guests trying to enter. These scenes were unbelievable, with well meaning guests and families being shouted at like prisoners and phsically being blocked from entering. My blood was boiling as the way these matters were dealt with was a disgrace. The guests were turned away, one set of which was literally 2MINS late!! The conduct was ignorant and undignified to the extreme. Further guest humilation was to follow as no food whatsoever was to be removed from the dining area. One by one guests were told to leave fruit, croissants etc behind and were screaned (visually) for innocently carrying out any items. Yet again a great public argument ensued with grown men, women and families being involved with very public and embarassing disputes. This experience was shared by many guests and was more akin to a scene from a prison. I personally filled my pockets with goodies and allowed my girlfriend to shield me from view!!!!!!!!!! The hotel staff have been noted in various reviews as being friendly and efficient. A bank manager smiles until you ask for money!!!! Firstly I had to use the internet service to book a hotel for the following night in Sorrento. It didnt work and the staff having informed me they would help on five occassions within an hour, did not make one attempt to assist me. I returned yet again to the main desk and was finally informed that the service was working and it was, wait for it, my problem I didn't know how to use the internet. The lobbly was quiet, it was 10.30pm. Honestly, you couldn't make it up. Reception couldn't inform me of what was the best way to travel to Sorrento simply replying in perfect English ' I don't know' before staring vacantly at me and holding a silence. This perfectly matched their outlook, ignorant, unhelpful, abnoxious, rude and devoid of all personality. This particularly applied to the stout, tall doorman, and the tall dark skinned man (I forget names now) who worked on the left hand side reception entering the hotel. He has been reffered to as 'the prince' in other reviews and remains one of the most dispicable people I have ever met. On leaving the hotel which was economy wise a complete rip off and a total waste of money, it was time to pay. I was travelling with a new maestro card that I had used to make the booking online with, and had handed over at reception at check in as per usual to prevent non payment. The cards details had been used successfully to book online, and been taken by the hotel. Probelm though, I couldnt remember my PIN. ( not asked for initially at reception) All hell broke out, now it was my turn for a public slanging session with 'the prince'. Couldnt swipe my card, couldnt use previous transactions, couldnt put it through manually, the manager was unavailable, nothing but a blazing row with me was going to suffice. Initially I was well mannered and composed and made great efforts to help. I explained that surely the purpose of taking my card at check in was to prevent future non payment and prevent any future problems. At this stage whilst trying to offer help the prince stopped listening and repeatedly pointed down to me shaking his head, stating over and over 'not my problem, your problem!' Enough was enough. I refused to foot the bill in cash due to the ignorance of this baffoon and when told the police would be called I erupted and encouraged him to do so. I wasnt going to be talked down to like other guests and be made a fool off in front of my gorgeous girlfriend. So after trading a great barage of insults that unprofessionally for him stooped into the gutter, the manager who was said to be initially unavailable was now very contactable by telephone. My passport details were taken and photocopied with both sides of my card. For revenge I complained vigourously on the phone to the manager about the conduct that I was exposed to and wasnt satisfied until I publically humiliated the prince for being incompetant for a good 5mins, before lifting my luggage and leaving. I think he gathered from my body language that I would have been more than partial to a bit of boxing before leaving. Anyway the point of my review is to completely discourage people from staying at this hotel. It is hugely over priced, dilapitated, has disgusting unhelpful staff, and is a huge disappointment all round. Generally I would not complain about much in a hotel and have stayed in the finest luxury to the lowest. I dont rate reviews that are negative for the slightest of issues however numerous but have been left with such a sour taste on this occassion that I felt obliged to. Read other negative reviews and then compare. A horrible experience. Ah well, at least I got some good lovin!!!! The big bonus is that payment still hasnt been taken!!! I think the hotels policy of 'not my problem, your problem' should apply to this case. It would be a shame to upset the prince again.

The Hotel is quite grand, although it's in need of a lot of TLC and a good refurb. Our room was tiny, dark and the rug on the floor looked liked it hadn't been washed since 300 BC. We had only tepid luke warm water for our entire stay which was in a very cold December, so wasn't ideal to say the least! When mentioning this to the hotel staff nothing was done, not even an explanation or apology was given. We also asked reception for 2 extra pillows and an extra blanket which again was acknowledged but nothing was sent up to us! Our room was not cleared of used glassed in replacement for clean ones, nor was our minibar re-filled for our entire duration. We also tried on two occasions to use their Internet but on these 2 occasions their server was shut down for a while which meant you had to buy another card for 3 euros at a time (great scam!) Then on our departure on New Years Day we were told at reception that there were no taxi's and there was nothing they could do about it, we eventually made them book a private car for us, but we had to suggest it! The customer service at this establishment is appalling, the only thing this hotel has to offer is a good location, within3 mins walk from the Spanish steps and all the main shops (luxury and high street), 7min walk to the Trevi fountain. My suggestion to the management is to down grade this hotel to a 3 star to save clients like myself, the disappointment of having our luxury 5 star expectations crushed on arrival.

Missing or loose drawer knobs, the toiletries could be better, poorly stocked mini-bar, a generally faded 3 star room feel. A bath would be good to soak in after a long days walk around Rome. The room was a good size, probably twice that of my room on my last trip to Paris. The location of the hotel is superb with all of the major sites within a 10 to 15 minute walk, and great places to eat on Via Della Croce 30 seconds away. I would say that the hotel is trading on it's public rooms for it's 5 star status. I'd say it was just about 4 star but it needs to attend to the details a little more.", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In\u201d", "Author": "WorldTraveleLV", "ReviewID": "UR6705105", "Content": "After reading some of the negative reviews I had to give my input.

The receptionist was the most wonderful Italian gentleman, determined to make the rest of our stay in Rome memorable, providing us with a beautiful superior room which was ready immediately.

One thing I would recommend is that you take an hour out of your trip one evening and use the roof terrace for a pre dinner drink. The setting is idyllic, so romantic. Although pricey it is definately well worth it just for the experience. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, the location is fantastic, the food delicious and the service impecable.

First, I want to point out that the hotel staff was terrific, and went out of their way on many occasions to accommodate our requests. Both Paola and Carlo (concierge) were terrific in handling our requests for tour arrangements and restaurant recommendations. The room was VERY clean and the maid service was terrific, every day. We had wanted more room for our stay in Rome, and so we chose a deluxe room that could accommodate my wife and myself as well as our 17 year old son. I had also asked about a room with a balcony which they also accommodated at no extra charge. The balcony was more like a patio which we enjoyed every day/evening (see photos). The breakfasts were wonderful, plentiful and well served each day in a beautiful room inside the lower level of the hotel. When I asked if we could bring coffee to our rom, they quickly took care of it for us at no charge and added a few croissants to the tray as well. They were always very thoughtful toward us.

But this is not about me. I mention these hotels only to suggest that I have some experience of what a 5-star hotel should be. Unfortunately, the Grand Hotel Plaza (GHP) meets none of the criteria. Understaffed--what staff there is clearly resigned to a fate of fielding constant complaints from guests--dirty, in disrepair, this hotel offers nothing beyond its central location. That, and the possible amusement to be had by listening to the concierge field complaints from other guests--\"no signora, we cannot make the water work in your room\"--both face-to-face and via telephone, while you are waiting to voice your own. Imagine, if you will, the absence of functioning airconditioning on a hot August night and you will get the picture of the fresh hell this hotel is. In what other ways does the GHP fall short of 5-star status? Ask that of the guests humping their own bags into the hotel. Eat (if you dare) in the hotel's bar. Do you prefer eight-way hand-tied coil springing in your mattress? To be frank, until I saw the beds in this hotel, I had never really thought about what \u201cinner spring\u201d meant; to envision the beds here, think Camp Runamuck. Do you wish a tissue in your bathroom? If so, be frugal, since the airplane-amenity-kit-sized container goes quickly. Do you expect Annick Goutal soap, Penhaligon shampoo? This would not be the place to find them (think Portico and then go down-market). How about a bar of soap for the sink and one for the bath? Don\u2019t be silly. Have you ever been in a hotel and needed housekeeping after, say, 10 p.m.? Better not need it here. (Another reason to avoid eating in the hotel bar.) Separate bath and shower (and, in the latter case, a shower head that can be adjusted above 4 feet)? Better forget it. There is neither world enough nor time to catalogue the myriad defects in the upkeep of the hotel. It would appear that the owners have decided that it is not financially attractive to bring this hotel up to true 5-star code. I suspect that the location, the \"Grand Hotel\" appellation, and the relatively modest pricing are, in combination, enough to keep occupancy rates high and them in Sardinian villas. Were this hotel outside Italy, I suspect it would be unable to retain its 5-star status. At face value, the room rates are attractive.

I have traveled heavily throughout Europe on business for the past 25 years and these days usually book on Internet travel sites, but in this case I called the Plaza directly to discuss the best room arrangement. They suggested a double for my wife and me and a second room with a double bed having a small room off of the entry hall with a sofa that converted to a bed for my son. That worked perfectly and saved me from renting a third room. Since there were five of us with a lot of luggage arriving from JFK, I asked the hotel to arrange to have a van pick us up at the airport. This was slightly cheaper and much easier than getting two taxis or trying to grab a mini-van taxi. The rooms were near each other on the 5th floor and were comfortable, quiet, modern and spacious. The bathrooms were very large and the fixtures seemed brand new. The hotel lobby, the lion and the staircase are spectacular and classy, but not new. The breakfast room is beautiful with fresh flowers on the tables with a lot to choose from the buffet. You can order non-buffet breakfast, but we didn\u2019t bother. Unless there is absolutely no alternative, I never use room service, hang out at a hotel bar, or use a mini-bar, so I can\u2019t comment on those aspects of the hotel. The location is perfect and we walked to many sites. There is a taxi stand across the street and the Metro is a few minutes\u2019 walk. There is wireless Internet in the lobby, but the site hits you for 3 euros an hour (I use my Palm Treo for Internet and e-mail anyway these days so I no longer have to lug around a laptop or rely on hotel connections). The kids wanted to see Pompeii and the concierge was very helpful in assisting us in making arrangements for a car and driver to take us to Pompeii and Sorrento. This turned out to be a good decision because a bridge on the main highway was closed unexpectedly that Saturday morning and traffic was crazy so if I had rented a car and driven myself I would probably still be lost. Also, with five people, this arrangement turned out to cost about the same as a bus tour (which I took last year on my own and it was absolute torture) with Sorrento and an English speaking driver/guide thrown in to boot. We did not have the guide in Pompeii itself as this was not his \u201cturf\u201d so we rented the audio sets and this worked fine. My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. My daughters, who have both traveled extensively, loved the hotel and had no complaints other than they hate hotel hair dryers. My son never complains about anything, so I am not sure how comfortable he was in his fold-out sofa. My one complaint about this hotel is that our waiter in one of the restaurants they recommended tried (unsuccessfully) to convince me the service charge was not included if I used a credit card. My pride was hurt because I didn\u2019t think I looked that stupid. I complained to the Plaza and the management expressed surprise and told me they would discuss this incident with the restaurant personally.

Arriving from the aiport on a sunny bright day entering this dark underlighted hotel made me feel cheated on both price ( over 300 Euros/nite) and extremely poor quality of rooms. Tremendous smell coming from public toilets on ground floor and from my bathroom. Room service took 45 minutes and bed filled with ants. Walked out the next day to book in a real Hotel up the road.

And it was certainly expensive. I refused the first room as it was filthy, dark and tiny. I was moved to a nice bright room at the front of the hotel. On Christmas day the bar and brasserie were shut, so I went out for lunch. When I came back my room was full of ants which were marching up and down to my dried fruit basket and box of chocolates from a hole in the floor. I phoned reception. Nothing. About 20 minutes later I phoned down again and a maid was sent up with an aerosol spray of ant-killer which she liberally applied to my christmas presents and everything around the ants' path. Holding my breath I marched out and to reception saying they must be joking if they thought I was going to sleep in those fumes, and demanded another room. Reluctantly they moved me to a rather gloomy suite. During the move they \"lost\" an expensive scarf. I had to keep reminding them to look for it - and the reply was 'Have you tried asking housekeeping?' On my last morning when I asked about it they shrugged as though I had a nerve to ask them for it. To add insult to injury they never replaced my lost gifts and gave me no rebate for the inconvenience (and the price is phenomenal). On the night before my departure they gave me some free fruit - 3 grapefruits and a pineapple. Really convenient for travelling. As for the hotel: The ancient baths were painted with gloss paint! The beds had a plastic undersheet so it was like sleeping in a steam room. The pillows were like bricks. There was no internet access. The public rooms were once magnificent but have been let go to ruin. There is no service in them and they are lit with fourescent light. The breakfast was dismal and stale. The restaurant was shut throughout my stay (Christmas!) but meals could be eaten in the tiny dark drab bar. The room service - one side salad with a sachet of salad dressing, 2 roast potatoes and a glass of wine cost more than a 3 course meal with wine for 2 at Numero 34, a local starred restaurant. I moved to the Sofitel for the last 5 days of my stay - gorgeous, clean, comfortable and much cheaper, with a charming staff. The manager at the Grand Plaza is supercilious and condescending and acts as though you are seriously wasting his time by being there. AVOID THIS HOTEL.

That was a huge mistake!! I thought the hotel was shabby when we arrived but that was not the problem. When we arrived at noon, our tv did not work (not a big deal) but our toilet did not flush (quite a big deal). They told us they would immediately take care of it. THIRTEEN hours later, when we wanted to go to bed, they told us both were fixed. They lied. When we showed the manager neither was fixed, he just said they would fix it the next day; they did not even offer to give us a new room - in fact, the woman at the front desk said there were no other rooms available and suggested that we use the public toilet 3 floors down. After MUCH discussion, they finally gave us a new room; it was an upgrade so I suspect they just did not want to give that to us. Eventually after much debate, they gave us a discount, but we should have not had to fight for it given the shoddy room and customer service.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solihull, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but they could do better\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4004934", "Content": "We had the good fortune to have our double deluxe room reservation upgraded to a suite, so we began feeling very good about this hotel. We didn't know quite what to expect as we had read very contradictory reviews after we booked! The location if fab (except that fact that the immediate vicinity is somewhat de-valued by McDonalds) The taxi dropped us at the next corner (some rubbish about one way streets) not a huge issue because the hotel was 30 yards away. It was a bit disappointing to have to drag out cases through the revolving door because there was no porter waiting outside. Check in was efficient and the upgrade completed we went up to the 4the floor suite. The view was fabulous and the suite was huge. Beds & furniture all very clean & new. NO BUGS . Bathroom was very nice and no smells. The breakfast was excellent (typical European selections and plenty of) but the bacon & potatoes were luke warm & plates cold\u2026.deduct one star. There is definitely some maintenance needed and you don\u2019t have to look very far for bad repairs to the old d\u00e9cor. Light bulbs missing from public areas etc lets the whole thing down. It\u2019s not the place to stay if you need access to modern features, internet etc. but fine for a romantic week for your 27th wedding anniversary!! You do get the feeling of neglect which is a great shame. The roof terraces could be a great asset but they appear to have been forgotten and the evidence of poor upkeep is never far away Overall we enjoyed our stay but this hotel could be \u201cgrand\u201d but at present it\u2019s not and it\u2019s a great shame.
