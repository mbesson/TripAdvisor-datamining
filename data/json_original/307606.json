{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a dump! The rooms we booked were not available at the time of arrival in spite of a three months earlier booking. As a result of this we had to look for other accommodation without being refunded by the hotel. After two hours waiting one much cheaper room was made available which smelled like an ashtray while we booked poolrooms, non-smoking.The manager and owner are not willing to refund the money paid for the rooms, also not through police interference (bribed?) while all evidence was produced.A never go there again hotel as far as I am concerned! There are much better hotels, better situated for the same price, so better look elsewhere!", "Date": "Jul 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR494386068", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Martin2007_9"}, {"Content": "Good location - great nearby restaurant This is a small hotel, 28 rooms in a good location in Sanur, close to the beach. The rooms are a little tired but you get water everyday and excellent breakfast. A few door away is the most wonderful restaurant with the best food we had in the month we travelled in Bali. Its called Kedai ha-bi-tat. Extremely reasonable and out of this world food.

This a small but friendly hotel with a large swimming pool and staff will bring you drinks from the bar to your sun bed, the prices are cheap for rooms and drinks. The rooms are a little dated, and some could do a with a lick of paint, but for the money paid , the rooms are more than adequate for the budget conscious. They could also do with some sound proofing so keep the TV down low at night if you don't want to disturb your next door neighbour. The staff are all friendly, the restaurant/bar is good for those chill out mornings if nursing a hangover ! Its location means a short walk to the beach, to shops, other restuarants and bars (incl KFC) and transport to Kuta - remember to agree taxi fare first. Sometimes, the hotel has only a few guests so you get to the swimming pool all to your self and the staff are only to pleased to join you for a chat to keep you company if you want to", "Date": "Oct 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR955430544", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sdnuttuk"}, {"Content": "molto buono   showReview(19641383, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR185241681", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7441\u5fdb\u4ebe\u9287\ue1be\u790c\u93c8\u6dec\u4efe\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(20348555, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR498933592", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "nichts fuer allein reisende Singles   showReview(17439120, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR638782650", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Alt, aber bezahlt   showReview(16609780, 'full');", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR246352493", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Empfehlenswert   showReview(13202642, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR126080836", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "une honte, \u813f d\u8305conseiller, surtout n'y mettez pas les pieds   showReview(11333010, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR652421534", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d307606-r17773113-Mentari_Sanur_Hotel-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "307606", "Price": "$63"}}
