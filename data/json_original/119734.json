You want cheap, you got it here. We stayed at Good Nite Inn for 3 nights during a blazing heat wave. The room we were in the a/c barely worked and the condenser had leaked all over the carpet and was soaked. The room smelled like mildew. We complained at the front desk, the person there was no help, would not give us the manager's name and said he/she would not be back till Monday, the day we were checking out! Unbelievable! And could not move us because they were sold out. The next afternoon we complained again to a new front desk person, at least she made the effort and moved us to another room with working a/c. No one had put in our previous complaint about the first room!. She sent a repair person to fix the a/c and clean up all the water on the carpet. I would not stay at Good Nite Inn again even if I had to sleep in my car. It smells awful, the carpet was dirty, looked like it was never cleaned. Next time I go to San Diego I will pay more for a nice hotel/motel room.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cNot as advertised\u201d", "Author": "snwrites", "ReviewID": "UR5480802", "Content": "Call before you book.

The Ice Machine did not work so we had to go to the other end of the hotel to get some Ice. The Beds were extremmly soft both husband and I could not sleep all night. The first night our phone rand all night long for no reason evertime we would pick it up there was no one there. They had 2 fitted sheets on the bed, so I ended up sleeping on plastic. The cleaning staff could not answer any questions I had because no one spoke any english. The only great thing I can say about this place was when I opened my drapes I saw beutifull flowers. Also Mission Beach and the San Diego Zoo are not far from this hotel (which is were we went). There is a better hotel right next door called the Best Western stay there instead I know I will be next time I am in San Diego.", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, NV", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5204740", "Content": "I have stayed in some cheap and dirty places in my time, but even in third world countries I have not seen something so disgusting. Upon entering the room, we were greeted with a musty rotten animal smell. There were dirty smudges all over the walls and fixtures. The floor hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The large white crusty stains on the floor under the TV was nauseating to look at. We never took our shoes off the entire visit. The TV had some sticky substance running down the front of it, so we had to use tissue to use the controls (there was no remote control). The bathroom was filthy. The tub had black grime in it and the toilet had dried blood on it. The bed had no fitted sheet, only two flat sheets, leaving the mattress exposed. Black hair was coming out from between the mattresses. We went to the front desk to complain. The girl was very friendly, but was unable to get us another room since they were all booked due to it being the SDSU graduation weekend. She offered to have it cleaned the next day when the cleaning staff was in, but this would not be soon enough. We ended up paying for the night and staying with friends in La Jolla. Perhaps other rooms are better, but this was terrible.", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Conditions...\u201d", "Author": "kaspernik", "ReviewID": "UR5180335", "Content": "We're usually not too picky if we just need a place to sleep - as long as it's clean and fairly comfortable. So, we weren't expecting the best night of our life - but we were appauled at the room condition. To start, the floor had not been vacuumed and had enough debris on it that we had to keep our shoes on. The bedding looked clean but the plastic covered mattresses didn't even have fitted sheets on them - they instead had flat sheets layed over them that weren't even large enough to tuck under. We ended up having a sleepless night because the sheet kept shifting around and we were laying directly on plastic. The bathroom was disgusting!!! The door and walls had something gross splashed all over them, the light switch and doorknob were gross and the worst part of all - the toilet seat had urine on it! When we talked to the lobby about it - they acted as if they didn't care - that it was no big deal - & told us the room had been cleaned. We didn't cause a fuss since as we were very tired, but we will definitely NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!

After a long drive and a long day at Sea World with my wife and 8 month year old boy it was nice and honestly pretty unexpected for the price I paid to come to an extremely spacious room that was right off the freeway but still very humble and tranquil. The staff was very courtious and the room was really clean like I already stated there was plenty off room to throw evrything down and still have room to relax. I would definetly recomend this place to a friend and would most certainly speend the night again. Now as we all know nothing in this world is perfect and my only suggestion to this establishment is to get better wireless connection for all those who travel with their lap tops.
