It is a 10 minute easy walk from the train station, very reasonably priced (for Venice standards) and it's continental breakfast was one of the better that we experienced in Italy for budget priced properties. The room was not very big, had two single beds, but it was clean and had running water (private sink). We had to share a bathroom with the other rooms on our floor, but this never seemed to be a problem, it was always fairly clean, but I guess that could change based on who your sharing the hotel with. The front end staff were always nice, I always appreciate that beyond belief when I stay somewhere, just makes a place feel a whole lot cozier and comforting. An obvious downside of this place is also the upside I mentioned before, being close to the train station means you are far from the heart of Venice. Now by far I mean only a kilometre or two, but a kilometre or two in Venice's maze for streets means it can be very hard to navigate if you are not a local! This is fine during the day, but if you would like to enjoy Piazza San Marco by night then your navigation back may not only be a little hard but may seem a little scary! But really, I would HATE to carry my bags to one of the hotels in more central Venice, and I am not a big fan on having to pay more than I have too so I wouldn't have opted in for renting a water Taxi. The only reason this was not given a 5 star rating is because I would have preferred a room with a double or queen sized bed, and for that it seems you need to pay big bucks! P.S. One full day was enough for me in Venice, but I would recommend to most to stay for 2 days so you can enjoy the morning, afternoon and night atmospheres!", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philippines", "Title": "\u201cCharming and convenient place to stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "mayfsi", "ReviewID": "UR118601984", "Content": "Hotel Guerrini is located a very short walk (less than 5 mins.) away from the Santa Lucia Railway Station and the vaporetto stop in front of it.

Breakfast is made up of delicious croissants and rolls, yogurt, milk, juice, cereal, etc. Note however that there is no lift, so if you are carrying heavy bags, request that you be put in one of the rooms in the second floor. I was assigned a room in the third floor, so I just left my heavy bag in the luggage area beside the front desk and just took what I needed. The luggage area is quite safe, but don't forget to lock your bag anyway. There is also Wi-Fi in the hotel, but the signal is quite weak in the upper floors. The rooms are simple but quaint, comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are very clean as well.
