The beach hotels wanted $650/night which was ridiculous seeing as we only wanted to sleep! I was concerned as we drove up to the hotel and saw that it was only 2 stories, with basically no big signs telling you where to turn or where to park. The hotel is basically an old motel which was redone very nicely. There is a nice \"verandah\" type area in the middle of the hotel (which used to be the outside patio for a 2 story motel. It has a nice sitting area with beautiful chandeliers hanging down, and the top is completely covered with nice fabric. I was worried when I walked through the verandah to see that the rooms were all accessible from the stairs/balcony. When we arrived in the room, we were very pleasantly surprised. The room was redone VERY nicely with bright, modern colors. We definitely felt like we were at a \"boutique\" style hotel. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable bed my husband and I have slept on in a long time, and we travel often. What would have made this hotel a 4 star instead of a 3 star? There was a coffee machine, but no coffee. The towels were too thin/cheap looking and our bath mat was basically a hand towel. The enclave which held the refrigerator needed repainting on the bottom. There was paint chipping off and it made it look old. I would put something on top of the refrigerator to lighten up that area and hide the scratch marks on the refrigerator. Besides that, the room was very clean and the bathroom facilities were new and up to date. The location is great also! Walking distance to the Westside Pavilion.

Four: They are about making money at the expense of treating customers well. Because there was no room with a window to the outside for me to move into (because I suspect they don't have any!), I moved out after only 2 days, but had pre-paid for 5. After multiple phone calls, I was refused even a PARTIAL refund for the other 3 nights. This place is in fact a converted motel.

When we opened the door to our room, we saw (what we assumed was a mistake) two queen beds. We had specifcally booked one queen bed online, so my fiance went down stairs to speak to the front desk clerk about the mix up. He told us that we actually got an \"upgrade\" and that was all they had. Once we tried pointing out to him that we did not book two queen beds, nor did we want a room with two beds in it, the front desk clerk (never got his name because nobody wore name tags) said there was a room with one king bed, but that would cost us a $30 upgrade fee. Once again I questioned why we should be the ones to pay to fix their mistake. He kept saying it was \"policy.\" I asked for a manager, and was told one would not be in until the morning. I left the situation feeling very unsettled... After the room debacle I had some friends stop by for a glass of wine before we went out to dinner, which we tried to enjoy in the courtyard because the AC in our room did not work, and it was HOT. The same desk clerk that was EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful before sat (in plain view) at the bar and watched t.v. with his feet up. In the morning I spoke with (again, no name tag) someone who said they were the front-desk manager.

It took about 5 minutes to realize that the walls of this \"cave\" were paper thin and we could make out our neighbors' conversation and what show they were watching on tv, not to mention the noise of the people above us. They were rather loud neighbors, but it was evident that any neighbors who weren't pretty much mute would've been a problem. It took 5 more minutes to figure out the wi-fi internet didn't work (we had to get a ethernet cable from mgmt.) After letting the mgmt. know about the noise and having to go buy earplugs, we made it through the night, planning to move hotels first-thing the next day. When we talked to the management in the morning, they offered to upgrade us to a room upstairs which was quite nice - plush bed and stylish decor (as before), but this time spacious and with a window on the street (double-paned for noise reduction). It was pretty much smooth sailing from there, with no more neighbor problems. The only other \"issue\" being a middle-of-the-night trip to the bathroom, where I could hear a woman with a southern accent talking on the phone, and again, so clearly that I could make out parts of the conversation.

Just call the hotel to make your reservation and by the person answering the phone you will be able to tell you don't want to stay there unless you like being treated extremely poorly. The rooms are unsafe for a single, female traveling alone. It is a motel style hotel and very loud, with extremely thin walls. Save yourself a headache.. don't stay here!!!!", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cHmmm, beware of hidden charges and somewhat dirty rooms!\u201d", "Author": "jeffnraven", "ReviewID": "UR14300053", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Sky Hotel at the beginning of March, 2008. It was a cute looking place once you pulled in off of the street. It had a nice little courtyard, and give off kind of a motel feel (not exactly what we like to stay in, but we love boutique hotels). It was obvious that this was a recent remodel. The front desk clerk was friendly, and helped us with our bags (there is no valet or bellman, this place is very small). The room was very nice, we paid for the Superior room off of their website, and got a deal because of our AAA membership. It was very modern, with a sexy looking headboard, marble floors, a pedestal sink, and other amenities. It was nice not paying for internet or parking, as this is standard in LA to pay up to 25.00 per day to park your car. The one thing we did notice was that the housekeeping staff did not pay too close of attention to the room. We found dirty socks in the wardrobe, an old shoe box that someone had left behind, toilet paper floating in the toilet, and crusty soap in the shower. Also, because the shower is a fiberglass resin material, it had dirt stains in it from previous guests. Unfortunately we did not take any pictures of this as we had a very busy few days in LA. We stayed three days and checked out to go home. The original room rate was reasonably priced (about 680.00 for the three days). The hotel did not seem very full at all, so it was very quiet the entire time we were there. Plus it was close to Westwood Village and the freeway which was convenient. Here is where the issues came in. Upon checking our account, we discovered an additional 150.00 in charges tacked on a few days after we left. When we called to inquire about the extra fees, we were told that my wife's hair had stained some towels and a robe (her hair is colored, and the color runs when she takes a shower). Now, these are garden variety white towels, but never in all of the years we have been traveling have we run into this issue. We were told that the towels were sent to the laundry, but they were not able to get the stains out. Have these people ever heard of bleach? My wife has had colored hair for seven years, and we have NEVER had this issue. We even brought it up to the hotel staff of a place that we have stayed at, and they said it was no problem. I think 150.00 for four towels and a robe is quite ridiculous, considering there was no notice of the additional charges. The management of this hotel seems very new, and a bit inexperienced in dealing with guests. The other thing we noticed is that the day clerk never bothered to ask how our stay was when we checked out. We are not the type of people to complain about a room, but if someone asks us a question, we will give them an honest answer. Granted this situation is unusual, as most people who surf this site probably will not face a towel replacement charge due to colored hair, but please be aware of the condition of the rooms. Had the hotel staff taken an extra 10 minutes to double check the room, many of these issues could have been corrected before we checked in. There are less than 30 rooms, and most of them were empty, how long could that possibly take? In closing, we will never stay in this hotel again, and intend to write a letter to the owners to apprise them of the situation we encountered..", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cMotel trying to be boutique\u201d", "Author": "ALadyNomad", "ReviewID": "UR13552594", "Content": "I have to agree with the negative comments made, bring ear plugs, confirm your rate, bad service staff, A/C not working well, and modern decor (not quality decor).

I would make a tray of croissant, cereals, cheeses, juice and biscotti to take on a tray back to my room for breakfast in bed. There were plenty of channels on the plasma television and the ethernet cabled internet was lightning fast. So much care and attention were paid to restoring/reviving this establishment. The location was great but Westwood does have traffic and I would imagine that the couple of rooms that front the street might be a bit loud. The second floor units have walkways directly in front of your room's window. I think they could put some sheer blind inside the curtain for those units so you can receive the light and maintain privacy. Maybe a main floor unit would allow more privacy as there are no walkways there.
