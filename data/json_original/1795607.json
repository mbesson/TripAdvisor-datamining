The room was VERY clean, as was the overall grounds. We left to see a show and when we got back, the place was packed. Greg & Colleen worked their tails off to make sure everyone's needs were met. I think the best part was the breakfast. They cook it right there in the kitchen!!! Scrambled Eggs, Gravy, It was wonderful!!! The pool was super, we took a swim right before we had to leave.

The pet-friendly rooms are at the back of the hotel with easy access to a large area in which to walk the dogs - plenty of green space and some wooded area too. Even though the rooms were full of dogs, did not hear any barking and the other guests were very nice. Unfortunately the WI-fi does not reach back to these rooms, but you can go to the lobby or just sit in your car outside the lobby and get wi-fi. The couple who run the hotel are very nice and accomodating. The room was your typical hotel room -had a lot of cable channels to choose from. The shower head was a little low (I am 5'6\" and it was just at eye level). The breakfast is very continental - cold cereal, coffee, juice, donuts and toast were the offerings. But it held us over until lunch. This hotel is just off of the main strip and very easy to get in and out of.
