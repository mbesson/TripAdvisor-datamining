There was no heat or a/c controls, and the TV didn't work - despite taking the remote twice to the management. Basically, I sat up all night hoping there wasn't a fire as there was simply no escape. I politely let the management know that there was no way in hell I was staying another night in that place (along with a line of similarly disgruntled guests). After taking enough pictures to prove my point, I left so fast that I left some things behind. I took pictures of the window that was permanently jammed half-way open, along with the toilet paper in the hall. They informed me that despite the conditions in the room that they were charging me for another night.

I was horified at the reviews, so i will give you my normal honest account. The staff were polite and helpful. Well I stayed for 3 nights 24th to 27th December for a christmas break. So here goes; stayed on the third floor in a two bed ensuite. Firstly the 51 steps up there was a nightmare, very steep and narrow. The room was 10 feet by 10 feet and the bathroom was very tiny; shower, toilet, and very small wash hand basin (cold water only). the bathroom was so small I couldn't reach the basin without straddling the toilet! but it was clean. The room was clean also and serviced everyday with clean sheets and towels. No tea/coffe making facilities and no cups either. When I asked for on I was given a paper coca cola cup. Also no bed bugs or mice in sight. As for the stealing of personal goods, I did over hear somebody complaining at reception and asking for the police. I had taken the precaution of locking my suitcase after reading the reviews. Now, wait for it!! on the last morning I went for my insulin injection and you won't believe it, six insulin pens had been taken from my medical bag. Luckily I had a pen in my jacket pocket to tie me over until I returned to the UK that evening. To sum it up. Clean and livable in. If you have trouble with stairs in any way give it a miss. As for security, thats nil, as the accomodation is in a seperate building with the same key card to enter the building and your room. (Does that mean everybodys key opens all doors, never heard of a dual card before?) By the way the twin beds was a bunk bed!!! Location was good and transport was easy with the trams. Would I stay again? No! Would I recommend you to stay? No! Not even the price would tempt me, it was cheap for Amsterdam but definitely not worth it for quality or hassle. I would have stayed in the Hotel where I stayed before had it been available. You can read my previous review of that one. The breakfast was ok for 5 Euros, normal continental breakfast. But it did feel like like you were eating in a factory canteen. The place probably doesn't merit the horrendous reviews it has had, I did see some other rooms, as the cleaning was going on, on the way past. My advice choose somewhere else, or you will get what you have paid for.

Very difficult to walk upstairs with a suitcase. But still, no big deal. Then the room! Very old and dirty.

Here is the story in a nutshell: My friends and I came back from a night out in Amsterdam at what must have been 12 or 12.30am; a reasonable hour I would think (at least for a hotel). The problem was that we weren't able to get into our room because the main door of the hotel building had been locked. One of our friends had returned to the hotel earlier than us that night seeing as though she was feeling tired and wanted to get some rest. The receptionist didn't have keys to the second building (this is where they accommodate guests in case there are too many people in their main establishment) because, according to him, he had already used the key once to let one of the guests of our room in (ie. our friend). Thus, in an attempt to understand this ridiculous situation of a receptionist telling guests he is unable to open the door to the hotel, we insisted that he call someone or do something to let us in.

We were a bit confused as our booking stated that we were to share a bathroom with one other room. Once we got to our room we found out we were sharing with 3 other rooms. Also the \"free wifi\" that is avaliable with the hotel only works in the reception area. Ok not that a big a deal, was a bit miffed but nothing to cry over right? The first night's sleep was very uncomfortable and both my boyfriend and I woke up the next morning to be covered in bed bug bites. This was very uncomfortable and we were left itching till we forked out for bug bite relief at a nearby chemist. Tried to just ignore it, make the most out of a bad situation till i saw a dead cockroach on the stairwell. Was quite grossed out but just assumed that it was a one off. Boy was I wrong. Got back to our room and found a cockroach at leat 7inches long on our wall. I was absolutely fuming so ran down all four flights of stairs and got the reception guy to come and get it out (after sarcastic remarks from him as to how big he probably was until he saw it and started swearing saying he was scared). I was so angry and demanded to be moved to another room as it obviously wasn't clean if they had cockraoches. He said he could move us to a different room the next day which being fair he did although did shake us up and didn't get a very good nights sleep.

For the same price, you can find so much nicer hotel in Amsterdam.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prag", "Title": "\u201cWill Never do it again\u201d", "Author": "Tom29", "ReviewID": "UR7165122", "Content": "We have booked 2 six-bed rooms, but although the bookings proceeded normally, when we arrived, the reception told us, they don\u00c5\u00a5 have the booked rooms. They had only one 6 bed room and one 4 bed room, so they put there 2 matraces inside on each room for some price reduction. The rooms were really small and awful. I haven't ever seen anything like this accomodation! And the social facilities-1 shower on the floor for appr. 20 people was inside the bath, so You had to wait until all the people finish cleaning their teeth or you could exhibate. Generally the \"bath\" was terrible, dirty and disgusting. The only average thing was the breakfast, but all the rest was about 1-2/10points. I thing that if you want to save some money, go to Formula1 or s.l.t. but trying to sleep at this hostel is really adventure for itself.

Since it was all booked last minute we did not have much choice as far as accomodation was concerned. But we're all former backpackers in our thirties now and decided it would be fun to re-live that dorm-room experience. Since one of us is pregnant though, we asked if the room had a private bathroom. We got a very nice answer saying, yes, of course the room has a private bathroom. As we got there we first had to make it to the third floor: the steepest and narrowest stairway I have ever seen! The room was about as big as my home bathroom (and I live in a small flat) with three bunk beds, no room for our bags (even very small ones) and NO BATHROOM. One of my friends had printed out the booking e-mail and made her way back down to complain only to be told that dorm rooms have no en suite bathroom and that since they're all booked out and all Amsterdam is booked out we would just have to make do...Since it was supposed to be a fun weekend we decided to laugh about it and adjusted but I still think at a 150 euros per night it was a rip-off. Had we known we would have just gone for a hostel that calls itself a hostel: at least we would have known what to expect! One last thing: the \"breakfast room\" is the tiny lobby which fits about 10 people. If like most of us you get up between 9 and 10 forget about finding a chair...we decided to splurge and went for the breakfast buffet at the American Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (just 5 minutes up the street) were you can sip champagne and eat all you can for 20 euros!!! All in all the Marnix Hotel is a youth hostel, the room and shared bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable. If you simply need somewhere to sleep and everywhere else is booked out, go for it. If not take the time to look for something decent (Hotel Sint Nicolaas by the main station, where we were allowed to leave our luggage FOR FREE finding the storage room at the station full, seemed very nice).", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cDecent and cheap\u201d", "Author": "laconikz", "ReviewID": "UR5471503", "Content": "For its price, the Marnix Hotel is decent.

Ideal mybe for skint students and backpackers. Room was dreadfull, bed the size of a coffin, no telly, no towels for the shower, tiny tiny room, window only openend slightly, walls were dirty and painted a century ago. Theres a busy street outside with trams going through the night and bright street lights. On the bed all you get in a thin sheet and a scritty thin blanket plus 1 really flat pillow. Saying all this we had a great time.. we arnt fussy and only stayed in room when we were unconscious.
