The pool looked dingy and dirty, but may have been partly due to the overcast weather and color that it's sealed with. The kiddy pool and hot tub looked better. Rooms were spacious and having a full kitchen was really great but make sure you bring/buy all your supplies from soap to paper towels to dish scrubbers - they do not provide anything. Don't take the sheets off the beds - the mattresses were really, really nasty!! The beds squeaked every time you sat on them or moved around. No room service at all. We had a small patio with chairs which was really nice to relax at night. JJ, the bartender is the BEST!!! He makes some mean drinks and was very entertaining. The Tiki hut is small but JJ is worth stopping by. Lots of parking available. No restaurants, snacks or \"must have\" items in the resort. TV's were 2nd rate at best and not many channels available. We got a really good rate on the room and we basically got what we paid for. I would stay there again if I received the same rate, but will go better prepared next time. If you want a place where they clean the room daily and you get clean sheets and towels, forget about staying at this place. There were 4 adults in our room, though, and for the money we paid, it was worth it. Unfortunately, Mike Ditka's Resot has definitely gone downhill over the past couple of years.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cRunaway.... the title says it all!!\u201d", "Author": "Laura S", "ReviewID": "UR128200629", "Content": "This was our 2nd visit to Mike Ditka's resort. The 1st was in 2007, Great stay then. This location has really gone down hill, Mike Ditka should take his name off of it since he has apparently sold it. We arrived early at 11:30 am and were told our room was not ready, BUT, if we wanted to pay 1/2 a day rate we could check in right away. We decided to go for lunch, since we had been traveling since 4am, what was a few more hours?? After shopping for our food supply needs, we returned to the off-site check in location down the street at 3:15pm to again be told \"Sorry, come back at 4pm\". BUT, the clerk gave us some wrist bands to use the pool while we waited. How Nice! At 4:10, we Finally got our room, (the check in location was filled with many angry visitors.) Arrival to our room in the 8000 building, (even though I requested the 2000 or 3000 close to the pool for the children), it was clear this was NOT in the same star rating as it was a few years earlier!! The room smelled damp, air conditioner not cooling (common complaint among guests), bed covering dirty and old, pillows flat, pool towels NOT provided unlike previous visit, (what hotel doesn't provide pool towels??) Check out pic's for other lovely perks! We were on the main floor, the people above us liked to preform the River Dance at all hours!! Absolutely no insulation. And lastly, do NOT use the washing machine at night, especially if you have sleeping children, louder than a plane taking off!!!

The main bed didn't have a fitted sheet, only a flat sheet and it rolled up when you slept. There were limited towels which never dried in the humidity and the furniture is huge. The chairs and tables are very high, which was fine but a little odd as if we were all 7 foot basketball players. The website had promised they had groceries you could order. This was a total lie. We got there after several emails back and forth to an agent and no groceries and no one had ever heard of the service. We then had to walk about a 1/2 mile to a Walmart over highways (no real walking path) to get groceries as there are no restaurants close enough to walk to and you would need to walk highways to get to them. The main entrance was apparently under construction or falling apart. There was a very random front lobby not being used with ripped wallpaper, dirty carpets, and an old ice cream freezer. The water in the hotel smelled like a fishtank and made the towels smell the same. There was nothing to use in the condo, no paper towels, napkins, or toilet paper. We had to buy everything ourselves, and walk to Walmart on several occasions. The taxis had no idea where we were or how to get to us, and no one had ever heard of the Mike Ditka resorts anywhere we went. The only redeeming quality to this place was the price. So if you go in just thinking of this place as a cheap place to stay, and you plan on getting everything you need on your own then it's fine. It's not a hotel in any sense, and you receive no service what so ever and are suppose to account for all of your supplies yourself. The staff seems confused and unhappy to be there and were not helpful at all. The shuttle service to Disney is few and far between, and often overcrowded and they they expected tips on top of it. They also make several stops so getting to Disney takes an hour instead of 10 minutes. You have to go in every morning and sign up for the shuttle to Disney, which is a hassle and requires a lot of extra time and a long walk from the condos. The pool is ok, but often filled with many people who don't follow any rules what-so-ever. The kids were running, jumping in with regular clothes, some adults were drinking at the pool and hot tub. Lots of yelling and splashing and throwing toys around disturbing every other guests and this took place every night of the 5 we were there. It's obvious people catch on that the place is not monitored at all, and no one makes the guests follow any type of rules. You are suppose to supervise the kids and get a bracelet to get in the pool area but no one does. The nightly movie never happened and the Tiki Bar was closed all of the time. The gym is overcrowded with kids playing basketball indoors and the workout room is very basic. They do not have a restaurant or any other amenities that a hotel would, and a small vending machine for pop only. The TV is very low quality with almost no channels, no cable for sure and a DVD player if you happened to bring a bunch of movies with you (or buy them at your lovely 1/2 walk to Walmart). I wish I had known more about this place before going. If you are looking for a cheap building to sleep in, this place if for you. If you are looking for a hotel that you are comfortable and happy in and don't have to be stressed out every day..this is not the place for you.

I should mention now that check out, was somewhere in another plaza, which made me feel like I was getting sent on a not very fun scavenger hunt.

We were thrilled... until we read the Tripadvisor reviews. We were so nervous that I had picked several places in the area we could go to if our experience was as bad as some of the previous reviews.Luckily, we did not need to leave Mike Ditka's Runaway Beach club. We arrived around noon. Check in time is 4pm. To our surprise we we told our room was available. Art, who checked us in did say that \"that does not happen too often\". Art was very friendly and welcoming. Our package also included an autographed Mike Ditka football but Art could not find one. He said that they would deliver it to our room later that day. Still concerned about previous reviews we did not have great hopes that we would ever see the football but headed off to our room. Our room was actually a 3 bedroom, 2 bath town home. Our certificate was only for a 2 bedroom but they upgraded us. Since it was just my husband and myself we did not use the other bedrooms but we loved having a second bathroom. The living room, dining room and kitchen were all open to one another so it felt very spacious. It was decorated in a subtle nautical theme, not over the top. The living room had two full sized couches which looked like they were just cleaned. I believe they were both sofa sleepers. We had a flat screen TV and a DVD player The remote however did not have any batteries. The dining room had a taller pub height table that sat 4 plus there were two bar stools at the kitchen counter. The kitchen was well appointed with everything needed to cook for a whole family. There was 1 package of dish washing soap in the dishwasher. Since we were there for only 3 days and there were only 2 of us we only ran it the day we were leaving. But if we did need more supplies there was a Wal-Mart just around the corner. The master bedroom was on one side of the unit with the other two bedrooms down the hall to the other. This would be a great set up with a whole family. The master had a king sized pillow top mattress that was very comfortable and a tube TV that again had a remote with no batteries. There was a very large dresser that would have held more than a weeks worth of clothes if we were going to unpack. The master bathroom had a whirlpool tub and one sink with lots of counter space. Through the bathroom was a walk in closet that was very big. There were a few hangers but it would have been nice if they had a few more. Down the hall were the other two bedrooms with a full and twin bed in each. Since the unit slept 8-12 people we had plenty of towels for our 3 night stay but there was a full sized washer and dryer in the unit if we had needed to do laundry, We walked to the pool to spend the afternoon. The pool was large and clean and there was a nice kiddie pool as well. We sat out on the large deck overlooking the pond. The chair cushions here looked worn and thin. If they are going to invest any money in this hotel to silence the critics I would start here. When we returned to our room we were happily surprised to see our autographed football sitting in the foyer. This was the icing on the cake. The second night of our stay a family checked in above us. They were VERY loud. At first we chalked it up to them being excited to be in Orlando. But the next night we realized that there was a lack of insulation between the two rooms.

It is always a pleasant stay. However I do have admonish them for missing some of the details that makes a resort five star, which I fully believe they have the capacity to be! Starting with checkin. The front desk is often unmanned. No one to greet you does not feel welcoming. Top resorts never leave the front desk unattended. The front desk staff are not surly but neither are they overly welcoming. You are left with the impression that they are just doing their job, which they do well. But some personality and joy would start our experience here on the best foot. Secondly, the list of things that you will be charged for, along with the amount of each, has to go! How unwelcoming to read through the packet of info and see this first thing! Disney does not do this- it's distancing and makes me feel accused before I even enjoy myself. Outside the buildings, at the entry doer, are cans of sand filled with cig butts. They smell, a whiff of which you ey eveyte to enter or exit your unit. I get why they are there, but they should be emptied daily. Plantings around the buildings could greatly enhance their curb appeal. Again, they are nice enough but lack the detail - such as lush platings - that would make a stand out five star resort. Painting inside the units is needed, at least on the one we stayed in. Gouges in the wall and worn paint makes it feel tired. They ate truly beautiful units, spacious, very clean, bright. But those small details your eye notices makes and impression. Also, replace any worn linens- our bed blanket had three cigarette burn holes in it. Unappealing. Overall we really enjoy the report which is why we have returned year over year.

It was an awful experience. Let be begin by stating that I am almost 8 months pregnant and was traveling with my husband, 2 year old child, in-laws and my parents. This is why we booked a 3 bedroom 3 bath unit way in advance on January 21. The day before we arrived I called the 800 at your resort to see if we may have an early check in - this way we may store our bags in the room and get accommodated and then head to the parks [we were celebrating my 2 year old's birthday]. I was told that it would not be possible because you were fully booked and the earliest we can probably check to see was between 2 and 3 PM. That was not going to work for us so instead of checking in we went straight to the parks since we had no where else to go at 11 AM. Needless to say after driving almost 5 hours to get to Kissimee and spending an entire day at the Disney park, we arrived at nearly midnight to the check-in area. At this time we were told that all that was available was a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite. This is absolutely the most unprofessional and inconsiderate thing that has been done to me. After we clearly booked the 3/3 suite in January we were downgraded to a 2/2 without prior notification to us at all! No one authorized this nor did we ever requested a 2/2 suite. My confirmation was for a 3/3 suite. We were told that night by the gentleman in the front check in desk that someone at Mike Ditka had made the change the day before. WHAT?! I could not even believe this! I am so disgusted by this it's not even funny! How can someone at the resort just make a change to MY reservation just like that after I clearly booked a 3/3? This was an extreme inconvenience and very uncomfortable stay for us. We had no where else to go at that time at night. Some very inconsiderate and unprofessional person at the resort decided it was best for them to give our suite to another party. Who the hell do they think they are!!!??? Till today just reliving the entire experience pisses me off all over again! I have stayed in MANY hotels throughout my life and this has never been done to me. The lack of regard for me and my family is just uncalled for and unacceptable! Also, we were being charged just $20 less than what we would have paid for the 3/3. I believe this to be a ridiculously high price given the inconvenience and aggravation the resort made us go through. The least that could have been done for us is to give us a free night. To top it all off, the 2/2 suite we received was dirty. The carpet was filthy, the kitchen floor had grease on it and slippery [luckily I did not fall]. There was hair on the supposedly clean towels (which did not smell clean at all), the pull out sofa-bed was broken, the DVD player did work and...well why bother to go on.

Although after traveling 8 hours with luggage and a stroller in the trunk with two kids, we needed some where to put our luggage to get the stroller out. First the lady at the front desk said she was going to see what she could do and another lady came over and started whispering to her... Then the lady looked up and said nope. No rooms. There all dirty. So we decided that we were just going to go ahead and go to Disney and worry about checking in later. My son then had to use the restroom and I overheard her on the phone telling somebody they could check in now but they had to pay for half a day. I then approached her and said so if I pay for a half day can we set our luggage in our room - she rolled her eyes at me and said \"What part of all the rooms are dirty did you not understand?\" I was like well okay then.. We went on about our day and returned at 8 O clock to check in. The resort looks beautiful from the outside... but once you get on the inside - its a different story. I think that this place COULD be ran nice, but they refuse to take the time and effort to do so. They want to run it cheaply apparently. . Here's a list of problems that were NOT satisfactory: -Had to go buy towels and wash clothes because all 20 towels in the room were stained and had hair all over them. -requested a pack and play upon reservation, was not able to have one until the 2nd night and was told I should have requested one sooner. How can I request a pack and play BEFORE my reservation? - Attitude of the staff is HORRIBLE - Carpet was filthy - looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks - huge hole in the roof where it appeared to be they had a leak and looked like the DUCT tapped it and painted over it. -dirty and scum in bath tub - door stoppers were old and rusted -beds were old and spring (most uncomfortable bed I EVER slept on) -Furniture in living room looked like a dog had attacked and chewed up everything. - got a \"welcome letter\" upon check in explaining the starter kit.. basically saying - they provide one roll of toilet paper, 1 small bottle of shampoo and a bar of soap and not to ask for anything else because anything else you need to provide yourself. -housekeeping doesn't come daily. if you want them to clean, depending on your resort size - it can range anywhere from $20 - $60 a day.. -TV in the master bedroom didn't work -the tvs were like 19' inch samsung \"flat screens' - cob webbs in the ceiling - fan COVERED with dust - master bedroom bathroom fan ROARED every time you turned it on - no curtains on the windows - so the lights from outside peak thru at night -my son fell down the stairs backwards because the dining room table was so close to the stairs - minor repairs made throughout the resort were done without effort -dirty smudges throughout the resort on the walls and closet doors -mildew in the refrigerator like I said, I wouldn't stay here if someone paid me. When these issues were addressed upon checkout the front desk clerk had no remorse and didn't apologize what so ever. We told her we would never stay there again and she responded \"I have heard that before and smirked.\" We stayed at Homewood Suites by Hilton Buenva Vista for 2 nights before we went to this resort, wish we would have stayed there longer!

When we arrived for our two night stay, we went in to our unit and were pleased by the fresh bleach scent. The unit appeared to be as shown on the web site (2 Bedroom Luxury Villa) and in good shape. For the money, there really wasn't a lot to complain about. A king size bed was in the master, two beds in the second room and a pull out sofa bed. We unpacked after our long trip and noticed in the second bedroom there was a blade missing from the ceiling fan and the master bedroom had no chain to shut the fan off. Well, not the end of the world, but come on. Well, we were tired and just wanted to relax. We turned the kitchen sink on to wash a few cups and unfortunately the sink faucet was leddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddaking pretty bad and flooded the counter. We called the front desk and within minutes had a maintenance person there to assist us. He couldn't repair it with us there so they moved us to a different unit. We arrived at the new unit and this time instead of a fresh clean scent, we were hit by the stench of cigarettes. Despite the smell, the place looked pretty clean, we were tired and so we stayed. So, now we get ready for bed, pull down the very worn duvets and notice some serious issues. The twin bed's box spring was absolute falling apart. Literally, the stitching was completely undone, the foam and cloth cover was off and under it was cardboard stapled to what was left of the box frame. We turned to the double bed and the box spring cover was intact, but the box spring itself was broken and bent, offering no support to the lower portion of the bed. The pullout bed was missing several springs and my 5 year old daughter actually fell through when she sat down on it. She ended up getting sandwiched in half between the frame and mattress support. For small children this is a serious injury waiting to happen. We called the front desk and asked for the manager to come to out unit to see the overall condition. We were of course told the cleaning crews noted no issues with the unit and she seemed to imply we must have done something. I quickly put an end to that implication, but she still refused to come to the unit. I was told a maintenance person be over to look at it. The guy arrived and said he'd have to go see if there were any more beds, which was a stall tactic. As we later found out, these units are individually owned timeshare/condo type units which are managed by Geneva Hospitality and marketed under Ditka's name under license. Any purchases would have to be approved by the unit's owner which wouldn't happen for days or weeks. A short while later we called the front desk again and were told it was too late in the day for them to do anything and there were no other units available for them to move us in to. I told them they needed to give us some credit or completely comp the stay because this was rediculous. I was told I had to speak with Katie Rondon the Customer Relations person in the morning and that she was the only person who could do anything. At this point we had no choice but to deal with it. I figured I'd try to make the best of it, so decided to spin the box spring on the double bed so at least the broken portion would have some support. I lifted the mattress and to my disgust there was a used comdom laying there on the box spring. YES, A USED COMDOM!!! In 16 years of business travel including several 3rd world countries, I've never been presented with such appalling sleeping conditions. This was absolutely inexcusable. Morning came, I called the front desk and of course Katie Rondon was \"unavailable\". I called back again and after a pause was told she was \"on a conference call\" and I would get a call back. 45 minutes later, still no call back, so we decided to go pay her a visit. Katie wasn't on the phone and was sitting at a desk in the office just to the left of the front desk, so it was hard for them to make any excuses. I explained the room conditions and asked her to go see it with us. She of course refused and said there's nothing she could do to credit us or comp the stay. Since she wouldn't go to the room, I showed her photos and told her of the used condom under the mattress. Amazingly she didn't seem to be in the least bit phased by it. I can only assume it's a common occurrance. Her only comment was she'd go to the room later and take her own photos, send them to her management and we should hear from her by Friday at the latest (it was Tuesday). That's it! No apology, no empathy, no nothing. NOTHING!!!!! Friday of course came and went and we never did hear from Katie Rondon or anyone else from Mike Ditka Resorts Runaway Beach Club, or Geneva Hospitality. SO....IF your expectations are low and you have no reasonable expectation of service should ANYTHING go wrong, you've got yourself a great place to stay. But if you have any reasonable expectation of quality and service, do yourself a favor and as the name suggests, \"RUNAWAY\" from this place. With so many other options in the Orlando/Kissimmee area it's simply not worth the risk or hassle. Some other notable items: The kitchen's ceiling was peeling and damaged due to a water leak from the unit above. \"top of the line appliances\" - Were not so top of the line, especially the 700watt efficiency apartment sized microwave so small you could barely get a bag of popcorn in it. \"32\u201d flat view televisions\" - Don't get these confused with modern flat panel HDTV displays, these are the 1980's Sony flat screen tube televisions. \"Gourmet Coffee Maker & Starbucks\u00ae Brand Coffee\" - This was a $17 Mr. Coffee Coffee maker and 1 bag of S&D Hotel Coffee (NOT STARBUCKS).", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooms, Pool Cold, Service Average\u201d", "Author": "SouthFloridaFamily", "ReviewID": "UR121060650", "Content": "Nice big clean rooms.

We booked a one bedroom through Expedia. Booking was easy and the room was under $80 a night even with the resort fee (which was eleven bucks a night I believe with tax). There were three adults and two kids in our group. The resort was easy to locate off of 192 in Kissimmee and nearby everything, all the Orlando parks are minutes away. Check in was quick and efficient. Half of our party was Universal Studios for the Halloween Horror event, and my husband and I were still out to dinner at 9 pm when my sister showed up with two exhausted teenagers in tow. She was given a key and a parking pass and was in the room when we showed back up, no problems, and was very impressed with the front desk staff. The one bedroom \"condo hotel\" room had a king bed in the room and two full size sofa beds in the spacious living room. It had a very nice kitchen with all appliances in good working order including the very necessary coffee maker and microwave. It had a small dining table and a tv in the bedroom and living room. The rooms were in very good shape, seemed freshly painted, clean, and the place was well furnished with plenty of closet space, etc . The one bathroom was very large, clean, and had plenty of counterspace. My suggestions for those who stay here is to remember that if you decide to book the room without paying extra for housekeeping, etc that you bring some commonhousehold supplies or pick them up at the local wal-mart across the street when you get there. The room comes with a set of clean towels and the bed and sofa beds made up with clean linen,and a starter kit of basics (little shampoo, kleenex, toilet paper etc).The kitchen has some basic dishes and a teapot, but no pots and pans. We knew this before we left. We brought paper towels, toilet paper, paper plates and cups, some utensils, etc for our short stay. They have a dishwasher and washer dryer but no soap so you will need to get that too for longer stays . The dryer was a godsend for wet towels from the pool. We bought along some extra towels too for the pool.Once again, you can find all of this cheap and local if you are flying in. We had to call the front desk for an extra blanket it arrived in minutes. We also had to request a plunger for the toilet ( not hotels problem, see the word \"teenager\"above and roll eyes appropriately they think everything can be flushed) and that showed up quickly too. The resort itself was well laid out and the pool area was beautiful and well maintained. I highly recommend the hot and bubbling jacuzzi after a day walking the parks. I would say the only negative we can point to is that all the single rooms were on the upper stories of the units ( which all look like cute little beachhouses) and there is a VERY steep set of stairs which is a good workout at the best of times and reason to cry a little after a day walking around everywhere LOL.But that was a minor thing and not unworkable for the value these rooms represent in this area. If you had elderly folks in your party I would spring some extra for one of the lower two bedrooms ( or the one with the lofts and make the kids use the stairs). You can also pay extra for several levels of houskeeping.

The villa was spacious, clean and had a full kitchen, TV with DVD player, two couches that convert into full size beds (which I found to be surprisingly comfortable) It was basically a large aparment. We parked right next to our front door. The resort has a decent pool, workout room, and a half court indoor basketball gym. There is that pesky $11 p/day resort fee which includes use of their Wifi and shuttle to and from Disneyworld. Now the bad (but not really), this resort isn\u2019t full service, it\u2019s more of an efficiency \u2018a la carte\u2019 type of place. No housekeeping is included if you are staying less than seven nights. There are no pool towels, you must use the same towels from your unit. However there is an in unit washer and dryer.

I took a group of Middle School students to the resort for four nights. The staff were so friendly, and helpful also. The evening staff took the time to look up resteraunt deals and phone numbers so that we could get the best value for our money with regard to group meals. There was a walmart within walking distance, and many different eating establishments, as well as shops for different things. The resort was very clean, and really beautiful. There were two pools, a hot tub, and athletic facilities. The gated community ensured safety, and the other patrons and residents fo the resort were very nice. The rooms were apartments, and each was well equiped to make our stay very comfortable. Each apartment had pull out couches, tvs in every room, washer and dryer, fully equped kitchens, and restocking for whatever you needed. The one thing that I learned was that since it was a resort, you need to ask for extra room supplies and towels during the day as there was noone to supply them in late evening, but this was communicated by the staff, and even when I ran out of tissue paper, the staff were very accomodating. This was a very student appropriate resort area. I felt very comfortable taking my students there, and with the apartment setup, was able to have a chaperone in one bedroom of each apartment. This was a great help and comfort in knowing that the adults were very close, yet had all the privacy they needed. I would recommend this resort to any school group, adult group, or family. It is worth the money, and the experience will be worthwhile and rewarding. The last thing to say is that it is very close to Disney and Old Towne kissimmee.

Apparently, they had given us a room that was being utilized by another guest. We could have easily stolen this person's belongings.

When this person didn't arrive we decided to head to the front desk, where we were told we had been put on a waiting list for toilet paper and towels. I informed the very rude front desk clerk that I needed to utilize the restroom and she proceeded to tell me I just had to hold it. The towels and toilet paper did arrive (hours later, after we had used the restroom at a nearby restaurant and attended dinner WITOUT showering after a day at the parks). In addition, our shower curtains were full of hair and mold, and the place is visibly dirty. We were able to speak to the manager on the following day, who gave us a gift card to be used in the future for a free night stay.

The room had recently been flooded and repairs had just been completed. We were the first ones to stay in the room after the repairs. Everything was clean and orderly. You could still smell the paint but that did not bother us. There were a number of items missing from the kitchen, but we called right after check in and someone came over and brought us everything we asked for. This was at 9pm. The living area and bedrooms were spacious, MUCH more room than a hotel. Room cleaning is available for an additional charge if you desire that. We were in town for a soccer tournament at Disney, so it was wonderful to have a washer and dryer in the room to wash uniforms every night.. Just plan ahead and bring laundry and kitchen supplies if you plan to use those parts of the room. We cooked breakfast twice while we were there. Using the OSceola parkway (with a 75 cent toll) you are on Disney property in less than 5 minutes. My only complaint about the room was that I did not sleep well. There was no noise but the bed was a little uncomfortable. I am used to that in a hotel. The real problem for me was all of the \"street lights\" outside of the bedroom (which was wonderful and safe outside at night). The windows only had blinds on them, no curtains. It was like daytime in the room all night long. Hanging room darkening blinds in the bedrooms would be a huge improvement. The kids loved the pool. There is a grill at the pool but we did not use it. The first night we were at the pool the Tiki bar was closed, apparently the bartender did not show up for work. The second night, it was open. A had a margarita, which had to be close to the worst margarita I have ever had. I would recommend bringing your own beverages. And don't forget to bring your own pool towels, they are not provided.

This was our only time to get together. I had called ahead early in the week to make sure everything was OK with the reservation and that late check in would be allowed. When we all arrived on Friday evening, we were told our 3 bedroom villa had been given to someone else in error and that we were being put up in another hotel across the street. The other hotel gave us two adjoining suites. Unfortunately, they were smoking rooms. The smell was horrible. We tried to get non-smoking rooms but the hotel had nothing available. We went back to the Beach Club and they found two single bedroom villas for us. Both upstairs. No wash cloths. Not very clean. But we were promised that we would have a 3 bedroom the next night. Early the next day, we spoke to the management. We were told that there would be three units available that night. We asked for a ground floor unit since we had some people that had difficulty with stairs. Again we were told no problem; they would check us into the room as soon as it became available. Just to be safe, I called the desk later that day to make sure everything was ready for us when we returned in the evening. I was assured it was. When we got to the Runaway Beach Club that evening to check in to our 3 bedroom villa, I was not given the room I was promised. I was given a 3 bedroom villa on the second floor. Needless to say, I was not happy, but it was late, we were tired and we took the room. When we got to the room, it was dirty. Sheets were dirty. Ceiling fans had dust caked on. The kitchen counters and dining room table were sticky and had food debris. There were hand prints on the walls and cobwebs on the ceiling and lights. So we called the front desk and the night maintenance man came to check things out. He completely agreed that the unit was not properly cleaned. He brought us fresh sheets, blankets, towels, wash cloths and some cleaning supplies. We did some minor cleaning ourselves and made the beds with the fresh sheets. (Please note that on one of the beds, the sheets looked like it had hand prints and either mouse or rat feces.) We threw the dirty sheets in the corner. The next morning, I spoke with a different manager. She handled maintenance. I told her I would not be paying for the room that night since we had to do our own housekeeping and that I expected the unit to be immaculate when we returned for our final night. She assured me it would be. So we enjoyed our final day in Orlando together and went back to our villa after dinner. It wasn't clean. The dirty sheets we had taken off the beds were put right back on (I could tell by the hand prints and the thing that looked like mouse or rat feces.) Cobwebs still there. Ceiling fans still had dust caked on. Bathrooms still had hair on the floor that didn't belong to anyone in our family. This was a disaster. To top it all off, we decided to play some cards at the dining room table. When we attempted to move the table from the wall, on leg started to fall off. It was completely broken and had been placed under the table and the table leaned on the wall for support. On our checkout, I told the person at the counter I would not be paying for any of my stay.

My condo was upstairs and featured a very large living room with 2 sofas, a big screen tv, a full kitchen with sink, dishwasher, oven, stove top, full size refrigerator, tons of cupboard storage space, a counter with barstools, and table with 4 chairs. There were 2 bedrooms in my condo, but there are larger condos on the property as well. The master bedroom comes with a king size bed, tv, chair, dresser, walk in closet and full bathroom. The other bedroom comes with 1 full bed and 1 twin bed, tv, dresser, smaller walk in closet. Every room has a ceiling fan to accompany the lovely air conditioning already provided. There is a second bathroom across the hall with a bathtub/shower, toilet and sink. And last but not least, a small laundry area with full size washer and dryer, iron and ironing board. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to feel as if they're at home while traveling or for families that need extra space for the little ones, but don't want to be in separate hotel rooms. There is also a large pool area where you can relax and listen to the reggae music that is always playing, and get a drink from the tiki bar by the pool. They have a nice fitness area inside next to the lobby, and indoor basketball area. Everything about this place is great. It's in a beautiful area, very close to Disney theme parks. It's down the street from just about everything- Walmart, Chik-fil-a, Starbucks, Target, Twistee Treat, Outlets (Gap, Old Navy, etc), Old Town. If I had to complain about anything, my only complaint would be that if you need to print something out, I'd recommend purchasing your own printer or finding a kinkos. They have a computer you can use in the lobby, which also has a printer but you have to buy a certain number of minutes to use the computer, and each time you print a page it deducts minutes from your time. But, when you go in there to print something that should take no longer than 5 minutes to do, it ends up taking 30 minutes, and you have to keep paying more money for extra minutes. Not fun.

We rented the 2 bedroom w/loft and games room for 4 adults, hoping to have lots of space for our vacation and had high expectations because Mike Ditka put his name on the place. The first floor is a small entryway and closet(closet door was broken) big enough for one person followed by a long flight of stairs(especially for the member of our party who recently had knee surgery). Once you reach the top you enter what at first glance is a very pleasant and spacious 2 bedroom apartment with two full baths and a full size washer and dryer. Another set of stairs takes you to the loft/games room which is nothing more than a pull out couch, tv and child size air hockey game(a little disappointing and a space we never used). Everything was tidy, however it was obvious that in addition to spot repairs everywhere, the place had not had a thorough cleaning in a long time. The white overhead fan was grey with black tips from dust and dirt, the couch stained with obvious efforts to spot clean making you wonder what had caused the stains to begin with. The appliances, drawers and cupboards were all very clean but when I dropped a knife on the floor I realized that the cupboard doors had not been washed down for a long while, and the floors had only been quickly mopped where you had easy access. Under the stove, in corners, etc. the tile colour was not distinguishable due to the dirt build up. For some, this level of clean would be acceptable and it was comparable to most 3 star hotels. The main bedroom had a large, comfortable king size bed, and spacious ensuite with walk in closet. The shower curtain liner was torn but it did not affect its use and the pillowcase had what we thought was lipstick on it but after stripping the bed and washing the sheets, we realized it was probably nail polish. The other bedroom had a double bed and a twin. Unfortunately, this was not suitable for our party as the double was too small for two adults and we would have preferred at least a queen size bed, however for a family, it might be perfect for three kids. This room had a full bathroom across the hall. Towels, dishes, pots and cutlery were supplied, however if you are going to stay here, you will need some basic goods in addition to your planned meal items, such as: bathroom tissue, corkscrew, frying spatula, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, kitchen sponge, dish towel, garbage bags, measuring cup, teaspoons, coffee filters, coffee, salt, pepper, water(the water has a horrible sulphur taste). Also, plan to be early risers as there is alot of \"fix up\" activity going on in the area and the sawing, hammering, etc. begins at 7:30am. The pool area was beautiful with lots of comfortable chairs, loungers and a hot tub. The pool side bar was not open and since it was off season, we had the area to ourselves. At $200.00US per night, we felt that the accommodations were acceptable but we all felt that with a little effort, these units could be so much more.

We left around 8:00 a.m. and returned at 5 p.m. There was no note, no phone message and soon, we found out, nothing had been done to our refrigerator. So my husband called the front desk and was told that they need to order a part and we would just have to move our room. Well, we were leaving the next morning and this was just not convenient so we opted to not move our room. Had we not called to check on the maintenance request, they would never have contacted us. Also, the shower was missing a plastic liner. We requested one, but never received one. So the cloth shower curtain got soaking wet each night. Also, our toilet literally wobbled when you sat down and got up. The walls are very thin and I am sure our downstairs neighbors were not happy each time we walked around. We tried to walk softly, but again, everything is thin around there. There were smudges on the walls. Dents in the walls. Dirty base boards. It really is just not the same as when we first stayed.

I checked in at almost 11pm and asked for a quiet room for myself, me being a middle aged lady. There were several building units with not a single car in front of them, yet they chose to put me in a unit with a few cars in front, which meant they were occupied. Not a big deal, but why not allow me to stay in a quiet, unrented unit? Too far for the maids to walk? I don\u2019t know. I opened the door to the unit and there was this long stairway- 21 steps up to my living area/bedroom. Now let me ask you, would you put a 50 year old lady traveling along with 2 heavy suitcases in a room where you have to hand lug your baggage up these steps? There is no elevator, keep in mind. I had driven to the unit and it was too much of a hassle to load up car and drive back to the check-in desk. It had taken 20 minutes to check in, and I was the only one there. So, I lugged them up the stairs. There was no coffee filter for my coffee pot in my room the next morning when I woke up. I called the front desk, I can barely function without my coffee in the morning. First they said that not all rooms get filters since I didn\u2019t have the daily maid service with my rental. I told the front desk that it was my first day there, and I have not used any filters to begin with. She said she would send one over. It never came. I went to Epcot and stopped by the front desk to ask them to please put a coffee filter in my room, or would I be able to grab one from there reception desk coffee area. They said they would put one in my room. Upon returning home from Epcot, I was dead tired and checked the kitchen for a coffee filter. There was none there. I called the front desk, and they said they would \u201cget one to me soon\u201d. An hour later I called back to cancel the filter drop off because it was 10pm and I was ready for bed. They said, \u201coh, it is on the way right now\u201d. !0 mintues later it was there. Why is it so hard to get a filter? I asked for one so many times, yet nothing. Very frusterating. The next day I planned on doing a little laundry and driving down to Tampa, for a conference. I put my close in the wash, and plugged in my computer to do some work online, and charge my phone. The power went out at approximately 830am. I called the front desk, they said they would fix it soon. I made it clear that I really needed the power working because of my work online, the laundry, and the dark bathroom where I still needed to shower. Also, I did not bring my phone car charger for the rental car, thinking I would have power on my trip. The power never came on, so I called back after an hour and a half, just before my computer battery ran out, and they finally agreed to let me use another room to finished my laundry and take a shower. By the way, the front desk person told me the wrong password for the high-speed internet access, and it took about an hour of guessing what it might be... (no caps, and no parenthesees, which they told me I must use to access the internet) When I checked out, I asked to speak to the manager to let him know what an inconvenience this whole stay had been, but he was conveniently in a meeting. The front desk person said he would call me within a half hour, which he never did. Thru all the confusion, I left my phone charger in the wall in the room. I called about 3 hours after checkout when I realized it was gone and they said they would check with the maid and call me back. They never did. I will NEVER stay at this place again. Not only did I have a horrible experience, but the place is shabby. There was mismatched paint, dings in the floorboards and walls the place is just put together haphazardly. There were pubic hairs on my bath towels, the light switches and other fixtures are not screwed in well, the phone in the bedroom had a cord going nowhere, when I pulled back the bed to plug it in, there was no phone outlet for it! The dresser in the bedroom was missing a knob to pull out the drawer, and the air conditioning unit was very complicated to set the right temperature, it had all these timer settings that were locked in and difficult to figure out the over-ride. I also should mention there is no restaurant, and there is no room service. Even the vending machines in the lobby were poorly stocked- completely out of bottled water.

I'd found and reserved the resort online and since I only had online information and picturess to rely on (which can sometimes be misleading), I called the resort's front desk several times before our trip for reassurance that I'd made a good choice for our stay. Each time I called, I spoke with \"ubber\" friendly staff who eagerly answered ALL of my questions in a very professional and helpful manner! Still, the price for the quality we were paying for seemed too good to be true, so as our trip's planner, I remained nervous until we checked into our condo. Check in was a breeze and the front gate security was a nice benefit to our stay. Our condo looked new and freshly painted and beautifully appointed! The kitchen was pretty; large and open, as was every room, including the bathrooms! What a relief it was after our long trip to be able to stay here; we felt pampered by the fresh (and quiet) accommodations Ditka's provided us. In fact we were refreshed to the point that once we dropped off our bags and ate some snacks, we went exploring. There is a nice shopping center within walking distance and we also found a good steak restaurant within a short drive.

Recently myself and my youth group attended a church competition in Orlando, Fl. We are from Tampa and traveled to Orlando to stay for a couple of days. Our Pastor booked this hotel for an excellent rate of $99 a room, per night. We had two, two-bedroom villas, for two nights. The total came to a little over $400. It was a great price. After staying there, I now understand why it was so cheap. The rooms were nice, spacious and fairly comfortable. Some of the beds weren't fantastic, but it wasn't unbearable. The first thing I noticed was that the guy who was working the front desk could not have been more than 22 years old. So I figured it was just a family type business and brushed it aside because he was very friendly. Later on in the first night, we realized we didn't have enough towels for all the kids. We had 10 girls in our room, which with the sleep sofas, fit pretty comfortably. So I called down to the front desk to ask for more towels, and they told me that because we had not chosen to have housekeeping for the reservation they would have to charge us for the towels. Upon asking for the price of the towels, I was told it would be 23 dollars a day. Now, our reservation confirmation listed that 10 people would be in one room. So obviously the hotel staff knew this information as well. But we were only given 6 towels. Needless to say, they were literally charging us to bathe. Obviously I declined the towel service, we just decided to recycle the towels we had. Later we ran out of toilet paper. We were originally given one roll of toilet paper per bathroom (2 bathrooms total). So we had two rolls of toilet paper for 10 girls/women to use over the course of 2 days. When we called to say we had run out of toilet paper, they charged us per roll. WHO CHARGES FOR TOILET PAPER? So by this point, we had been charged to take showers and go to the bathroom. You think that if the resort knew how many people were staying in a room withOUT the housekeeping option, they would stock it fairly well. But apparently not. The same first night, we realized we had not blankets or pillows for the sleeper sofas. It took an hour for the pillows to arrive, even though the front desk was a two-minute walk from our room. So when we requested for sheets (surprisingly they did not charge us for these) it took well over an hour, so I called again. The lady at the front desk rudely informed me that housekeeping left at 7, and it was our responsibility to call before then. Like we were supposed to know what time housekeeping went home? So I said that we need the blankets to sleep (this was well after midnight, and we had a performance early the next morning). I, and my girls, just wanted some sleep. So after waiting another hour, a knock finally arrives at the door, and it's the security guard. He brought us pillow cases. Not sheets. So we told him we didn't need those and that we asked for sheets. Needless to say I called the front desk again and the lady huffed and puffed about how the night shift literally consisted of herself and the security guard. TWO PEOPLE RUNNING AN ENTIRE RESORT. How unsafe is that? The security guard couldn't even do his actual job because he was doing housekeeping's. By about 1am we finally got our sheets and were able to go to bed. The next day I went to the front desk and asked to speak with the housekeeping manager. She once again tried to charge me for towels, at which point I said \"Okay, you didn't even give us enough towels for how many people are in the room, we're not going to let you charge us to take showers\". She finally said she would have the towels sent down. 4 HOURS LATER they had not arrived. So I called again, and when she finally brought them, she was once again very rude and was rolling her eyes at me. Now, I am a Hospitality major in college. I plan to work at a hotel one day. I know what is worthy of a complaint and what is not, considering my future career. But this was just ridiculous. I don't like complaining about service, I feel bad. But I did not feel bad at all at this \"resort\" because of how rude the staff was. It seemed like bringing us towels to bathe, toilet paper to use the bathroom, and sheets to sleep on, was such an inconvenience. THESE THINGS ARE NECESSITIES. Now, if they had told us at the beginning that we should bring our own towels and blankets because we didn't have housekeeping, we could have been more prepared and been able to avoid some of these problems. But they didn't even tell us that. It was horrible. The last day, housekeeping walks into the boys room at 7am because it was our checkout day. The decided that even though 11am was checkout time, it was okay to go into the rooms 4 hours earlier to see if we had left yet. Now, I think common sense would tell someone that if checkout is at 11am, housekeeping should not even enter the room until at least 11:15am. When we finally were leaving the room at 10:45, the maids were literally waiting outside our door to finish up. I have NEVER experienced anything like that. I travel quite frequently, and to various hotels, but I have never once seen a maid standing at the door waiting for you to leave, and again, before checkout time. It was clear that they wanted us to hurry up and get out so she could start cleaning our room. It was visibly an inconvenience for her. She clearly hated her job. After we left, two of the boys realized they left their bathing suits in the dryer. When we called to see if housekeeping found them, the hotel informed us that they had THROWN THEM AWAY. HOUSEKEEPING SHOULD NEVER THROW BELONGINGS AWAY. Especially a mere few hours after checkout! Any items found should immediately go to lost and found, and then MAYBE after a couple months, be disposed of. To say I was pissed, would be an understatement. I will never stay at this \"resort\" again. I wouldn't even call it a resort. I'd just call it a terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, not even someone I hated. The service was beyond awful, and those people don't even deserve to have that job. I think that resort should be shut down immediately, and turned into something that actually produces an enjoyable experience.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cTerrible customer Service\u201d", "Author": "chicago672", "ReviewID": "UR36026194", "Content": "While the room is wonderful, large and clean the service and the staff are terrible.

The community is gated which made me feel safer at night and the pool is open until 11pm! There is even a basketball court and workout gym. The condo was situated very close to shopping (walmart supercenter and publix within 5mins) and freeways. We were also about 10 minutes from Disney and 20 minutes from downtown Orlando.

We couldn't have been more thrilled. The staff that greeted us were friendly and very helpful. We were checked in within minutes and when we got to our Villa, we were enchanted by the adorable \"neighborhood\". There was tond of parking and everyday we were able to park right outside our door without issue. The place has a security gate so only peple staying there can drive in. The vila was even better than we had expected. It was roomy, modern, clean and the decor was quite nice. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials for cooking and dining. The beds were comfortable and the kids had a seperate bathroom from us. There was also a TV in the livingroom and each bedroom as well as a dvd player in the living room. The temperature controlls were very easy to use and were digital and also programable to your needs throughout the differnt times of the day. The pool area was very nice and clean and was never crowded. The atmosphere was great. The 2 pools were very nice and my kids and I enjoyed them immensley. The landscaping around the area was very nice and you can tell that the resort is well taken care of. We couldn't have been happier. After reading other people's reviews and seeing how some people had been disappointed because it was not what they expected, I just wanted to take a moment to tell you what to expect so that you do not find yourself in the same boat.

You cook your own meals because there is no restaurant on the premises....but there are a ton of them in the area.

They even leave you a vacuum in case you make a mess of the carpet and wish to vacuum. This is not a resort where you are pampered. If that is what you are looking for, then this is not the place for you. If you wish to stay in a relaxing area with all the amenities of home with some added perks, then you will love this place.

We went down to front desk to complain and were told to come back the next morning and talk to the general manager. We awoke the next morning and decided to look around in the kitchen when we opened the oven, to our total disgust, there was a broiling pan with hardened grease in it and a rack on top of the pan with food hanging down. GROSS!!! So we immediately went down to the front desk to find the general manger. We told him our problems and he of course apologized and said he was going to give us a \"credit\" for the nights' stay and assured us that it was an isolated incident and wanted to make it up to us. He gave us a \"special\" rate on the same room if we came back again, we reluctantly decided to give him another chance and paid for another stay set for 2 weeks later. One week went by and we did not see a credit so we called him numerous times and he never called us back, finnaly we did get him on the phone and we asked where our credit was and he told us that he gave us a partial credit of $22.60 on a $100.00 stay. Thats not what we were told so we argued our point and he said we had to pay the tax anyways on the room. I then asked him well if I was to puchase something at Wal-Mart and returned it for a refund they would also refund my tax, his response was I quote \"I do not work at Wal-Mart and I do not know their return policy\" come on!!!

This was our second stay at the hotel this year. Our first visit was for a week in Feb. We did notice some changes from our first visit to this visit. Location - the hotel is about 4-5 miles from Disney. Not a big deal for us as we weren't really going to the parks that often. There is a shuttle that can be taken from the Courtyard hotel across the street. It makes 3 trips to Epcot daily and then you would have to take the Disney transport to get around. There is a 24 hour Walmart and 24 hour Target nearby for groceries. There is sufficient dining options in the surrounding area for those who are eating out. Check-in - we arrived at 1am and the desk clerk greeted us warmly and had us on our way in minutes. We had the same clerk when we checked out and thought she was very friendly. Apartment - we had a one bedroom apartment on the second floor. It was approx 700 sq feet. The kitchen had a full stove, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, kettle, coffee maker, dishes, cutlery and pots/pans. It had a pub style dining table that sat 4. We had a sofa and chair in the living area along with a large tv. The bedroom had a queen bed with a dresser, two night tables and a large tv with dvd player. The closet was a walk in closet that also contained a safe that you could use. We managed to lock our laptop in it. The bathroom was off the bedroom. The apartment is beginning to show some wear and tear. It could use a fresh coat of paint and in some areas a full cleaning. We had spider webs and bugs above the front door that the cleaner should pick up on. One day there were leaves on the stairs in the apartment which the cleaner tracked in as they weren't there when we left. Our shower curtain rod was sagging so the shower curtain left a gap near the wall and caused the bathroom floor to get wet. We called to have it fixed and nothing was done with it. The walk-in closet had no hangers in it which makes it almost useless. We did not have a comforter on the bed, only the top sheet and a thin blanket. The frying pan was in need of replacement. The vents needed to be wiped down as they had things growing on them. We did not have these kinds of issues in Feb. We also don't understand why there is the need to clean everything out of the apartment before the next guests arrive. For example, we bought dishwasher soap for the dishwasher and left the rest behind. I am sure that it gets thrown out because no one on this post seems to indicate that there are any of this kinds of items from the previous guests. Everytime someone has to go out and purchase it. Grounds - the grounds are nice. We didn't check out the pool area but my in-laws who stayed in a different apt said they were nice. There is also a gym and workout room for guests to use.

Perhaps the title is a bit of an exaggeration, but as far as my personal experience during the time I stayed here at the Mike Ditka Resorts - Runaway Beach Club; I have to say it was more than I expected. We were a family of five, with two teenagers and one child age 5. We had the 2 bedroom 2 bath suite and it was comfortable for everyone. I doubt that we would have felt the same way, if we would have stayed at a regular boring hotel. It felt like being at home, at least to us. We relaxed while enjoying the scenery and at the same time dipped into the south beach pool. My Daughter enjoyed the key west pool specifically for kids and so did the teenagers. :-) Very nice and tranquil with Island music playing around the pool area. Not crowded at all and the staff was friendly. The Villas are nice looking and I had some time to take a few pictures of the area. I had no problems and everything seem to go very well during my stay there. The location is great! Lots of attraction and shops nearby, very close to Disney's Typhoon Lagoon park, which is where we ended up going. We stopped by a nearby grocery store and cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That helped us save money v.s. going out to eat. We had everything we needed at our reach and we left home with clean clothes as I did lite laundry. Now, I know that there is a $10 fee that the resort charges every night that you stay there and that seems to be the most common complain I hear from folks. If this is something you are not willing to pay, then look elsewhere, otherwise, I think it's worth it. My advise to any traveler is: \" Always check hidden fees while reading the fine print before booking anyplace and before it's too late to make any changes. If anything, do some research. \" That should help. As far as complaints about how this place is mediocre--although everyone is entitled to their own opinions; my opinion is that in some instances there will be times when we all have our good days and our bad days, this happens to all of us at some point; also everyone has their own likes and dislikes.

It offered plenty of space for us to spread out (we got a 1 bedroom that had 2 pull out sofas in the living area); and, 2. the summer rate was reduced to under $100 a night, which put us right in our \"sweet spot\" when getting lodging in Orlando. The complex is a series of two story \"houses\" that have units configured into a variety of sizes. Each unit has at least one full bathroom, full laundry room and fully equipped kitchen. The clubhouse and pool were a short walk away from any of the buildings. You can park right at your building, so that is a plus for us. There was a huge walmat within walking distance, so we were able to get breakfast and lunch stuff without much effort. It was clean and convenient to the Disney area, so it pretty much met our expectations. I was a little disappointed that there was an additional $10/night \"resort fee\", since it only included gym access and wireless internet. A bit excessive in my mind. The only drawback we experienced was that the walls are a bit thin, and you can hear your neighbors upstairs moving around quite a bit.

Because of the sheet incident in the main room I became suspicious and checked the sleeper sofa only to find filty sheets on the pullout. There is only one remote control for both tv's.

After looking at several hotels on travel websites, we decided on Mike Ditka's Runaway Beach Club because we got a great deal (two bedroom loft for $149 a night!) and it seemed to be pretty close to the attractions, shopping and nightlife areas that we were interested in. Let me say we absolutely made the right decision! This place was fantastic! It was literally minutes from Disney World and there was a Super WalMart right around the corner to get groceries and everything else we'd forgotten. We didn't have any problems with the staff, in fact they were extremely helpful in all the encounters we had with them. Every night when we came back we saw the security driving around the grounds and we had to use a key card to get into the gate. We didn't use the business center at all since we were there solely for pleasure, so I can't comment on that. We did, however, enjoy the pools and hot tubs and they were very relaxing. It was nice that there is a seperate kids pool so we had some quiet time in the \"adult\" pool. The room itself was wonderfully decorated in a Carribean theme with high ceilings, fans, and art. The kitchen was fully-stocked with all cutlery, dishes, cups, diswashing detergent and coffee. Plus there was laundry detergent so we could wash our clothes after spending a day in the parks. Beds were very comfortable, even the fold out couch in the loft was great. The loft option is the best way to go as it can serve as another bedroom and there's a tv, air hockey and foosball table, and Playstation hook-up up there (get it from the front desk I believe) which would keep kids occupied on the down time. I'd read other reviews where it said that you often heard noises from the other villas, we didn't hear anything during our 5 night stay but perhaps that was because we were always coming in late. Note - this place seems more like a condo than a hotel. We didn't get full cleaning and turn-down service every day, just a quick pick up. We requested more towels when we needed them, but they came right away. So it appears you need to ask if you need anything additional.

We had a garden tub/shower in our bathroom & a huge walk in closet with a safe! The bath towels were big & fluffy! The resort was centrally located near all the parks & attractions, right off Osceola Parkway! We were only 10 minutes to Disney Parks, 15 minutes to Gatorland, etc. It was close to several restaurants (Joe's Crab Shack, Chili's, Denny's, etc.) There is a Super Wal Mart literally just around the corner from the resort, which we visited several times. The fully furnished kitchen was handy & saved us some money from eating out so much! It was fully furnished with all cooking utensils, pots, pans, plates, silverware, tupperware, you name it! There was a dishwasher, a washer & a dryer in our condo. Each bedroom had it's own big tv with cable. The living room also had a pretty good sized tv & also had a dvd player, which my kids loved. The only concern I had was that the day before we left, the maid didn't bring us any clean towels & didn't come get our trash. The trash can in the kitchen was pretty small & the trash filled up rather quick. I had to do a load of towels for us to use the next day, but I didn't mind that much. After all, we had a washer & dryer right there. I didn't feel the need to call the front desk & complain. Another thing is, you have to pay a $10/day room fee up front when you check in. Both pools were very nice. The kids pool has zero depth entry, which was nice with my 2 year old son. The view from the pool was very pretty. It overlooks this big pond with a pretty fountain in the middle of it. They show a kids movie out by the pool a couple of nights a week.

It's extremely well situated, close to all the Disney parks and shopping areas, with a Super WalMart almost on it's doorstep. I had phoned the resort before travelling and requested an apartment close to the pool and that's exactly what we were given. We had an upstairs \"loft\" apartment, one bed/bath, with a well supplied kitchen. The only slight drawback was the stairs up to the apartment - although they didn't trouble us, they could possibly be a problem for some. Service was good, with a maid coming in daily to make the beds, remove trash etc, although you will be asked for a $10 per day charge to cover this (something Expedia failed to mention!). Checking in/out was painless and PC access is provided free to check in for your flight back (there is a charge to access the internet on this PC, but not for flights and wireless connectivity is free across the site). The pool area is excellent - it was never over-crowded when we were there and the children's pool was very popular with the kids. Parking was more than adequate and the grounds were never less than immaculate. All told, this is a good place to stay if you are not looking for a great deal of on-site activity - it's not a resort that provides a bar/restaurant/entertainment, but it does provide a good standard of accomodation at a very reasonable price. I would be happy to stay there again (especially as I was offered a 15% discount!), even though I did miss some of the on-site activities a resort like Sheraton's Vistana provides.

We had an upper level 2 bedroom condo and were very happy with it.

We arrived at Runaway around noon and were allowed to check in early which was great. Our unit was clean, bright and quiet. The rooms were very large, the beds comfy. My two kids shared a room which was perfect. We even had a safe in the master bedroom closet so we left some valuables in there. Some postings indicated that there was no daily housecleaning but our unit was cleaned daily to my surprise. If you stay in a condo type accomodation and are going to do any cooking/washing (especially with kids), I'd suggest bringing (or buying) the following: detergent for the dishwasher, laundry detergent, a small bottle of dishwashing liquid, coffee filters (number 2 basket) and dishtowels. Room for improvement? Sure. The music that plays at the pool should be turned off at 11PM or so. It went on all night. I think that they should leave some of the basics (like dish detergent) in the units because guests like us must constantly leave these things behind.

Our coffee maker was broken but they replaced it almost immediately.

Two big baths, great storage and a TV in every room too! I would stay again! As close to perfect as you can get and a very reasonable price! We paid about $160 per night for a 3 bedroom 2 bath upper. The stairs are a killer so if you have any issues with that get a lower. I can see where it could be noisy but our neighbors were fine. The outside noise did wake us one morning as people were leaving etc, but I wouldn't say it was a huge issue. Stay away from the pool if you need quiet like we do. The decor was nice and tropical, they did need to do some paint touch ups, but over all we highly recommend!

Our two kids are 11 and 7. They LOVED the 3bdr Loft unit. My son slept in the loft and my daughter had a bedroom to herself. So that was great, we were not on top of each other. Everything was brand new and clean. It is furnished in a pretty beach motif, with white louvered furniture. The kitchen was new with granite countertops. The only problem and it was big, was our first unit backed up to the main road right behind the hotel. THE NOISE WAS AWFUL! We could not sleep at all. So the next day we got moved to an interior unit that lined the lagoon. GORGEOUS! It was so peaceful and pretty. We could not hear the road noise at all. So definitely stay away from the buildings in the outer ring and go for an inner unit. (I want to say it was units 14-18 that were on the road, but check that out first.) The only other complaint I had was housekeeping apparently keeps their supplies for each unit in the garage. In one day they must have opened the door 6 times. I was sick in bed that day right above the garage and it was very disruptive. Finally I had to yell out the window to tell him to stop going in and out. He was very apologetic and had no way of knowing I was up there, so that was not a big deal. But if you have a baby that is trying to nap it could be an issue. Other than the traffic, we thought it was a great place. We have stayed in many disney area condo units and this was definitely one of the best. There is a super walmart right around the corner so you can get groceries, wine, sunscreen, everything you need there. The other negative I can think of is that there is no onsite restaurant or snack bar to grab a bite while at the pool. The pool was nice, and adequate, but not knock your socks off great. Near this hotel is the best seafood restaurant in the area called Landry's. Be sure to stop there for a fancy yet reasonably priced meal. Like all Disney area restaurants, you don't have to be dressed up to eat there and it is kid friendly. We really enjoyed this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

We booked a 2-bedroom, 2-bath unit in the Key West section. As expected, there were two full baths and two large bedrooms. We could have upgraded (free) to a 2-bdr, 2-bath loft suite (which would have had another loft room with a pull-out sofa bed and an air-hockey table), but one of our guests had mobility issues and couldn't climb the necessary stairs. The master had a king size bed, flat-screen TV, huge walk-in closet with electronic safe, and master bath with Jacuzzi tub and separate shower. The second bedroom had a double (full) bed and a twin (single) bed, suitable for three children but really only two adults (I personally find a double bed too small for two adults). This bedroom also had a huge walk-in closet, flat-screen TV, and a bathroom across the hall with a shower/tub combo (so it wasn't part of the room, but instead the main bathroom for the whole unit; if guests were visiting in the living room, they would use this bathroom). The living room/dining room/kitchen combination was a good size. The living room are had two sofas (each may have pulled out to sofa beds, but I didn't check) and another flat-screen TV. There was a large dining table, along with a nice-size kitchen with a breakfast bar (I think there were three or four chairs at the bar, and four chairs at the table). The kitchen was equipped with everything you would need to make meals. All appliances were regular sized. The d\u00e9cor was attractive--lots of blue and white. The lamps were a nice quality--not the standard motel-room type--as were the framed prints/artwork. Small bottles of toiletries are provided (shampoo and lotion), as are all linens. We had our linens changed once during a 3-night stay (so we had new linens at check in, and then they replaced them on our second night). Light housekeeping was provided--trash removal, linen replacement, and on one morning (but not the other), our beds were made. My only complaint about our suite was that it could have been a little cleaner--a shame, really, because this place has everything else in its favor. The first room we checked into still had the previous guests birthday cake remnants on the kitchen counter (granted, the counters were a dark granite pattern, but it was still evident that no one from housekeeping made even a cursory attempt at wiping them down); the carpets also didn't appear thoroughly vacuumed, and we had some tiny ants that other reviewers had complained about. They moved us to another unit that was cleaner, but not perfectly so. It WAS apparent that the sheets had been changed in both rooms, however, which is really the most important factor. There is coffee provided in the hotel lobby. The pool is attractive, with plenty of chairs. There is also an outdoor Jacuzzi. The fitness center is small but adequate. There is a business center with free internet access--I used it each morning and there was never a wait. The property is quite large, and you could be assigned to a building block that is some distance from the pool/office. Buildings 1 and 2 are connected to the office building itself, so the lower numbers are better located, in my opinion. The numbering of the units within each building block is a bit odd, because the doors for the upper units are next to the doors for the lower units, so there will be \"100\" and \"200\" series doors next to each other. Once we figured it out, it made perfect sense, but provided a bit of frustration initially. We did have some trouble with the key-card gate needed to access the parking lots after 8:00 pm. The card only seemed to work from OUTSIDE your vehicle. If you tried to insert the card while sitting in the car, it did not work. Sounds strange, but the trick seemed to be getting out of the card before inserting the card--must be some kind of positioning issue. We saw other guests having the same problem, so it wasn't just our own stupidity! With our first-floor unit, there WAS a big issue of noise from above. The sound of every step of the guests above us was magnified at all hours of the day and night (and they didn't have children, so it was just adults walking around normally.) Keep that in mind--I would recommend asking for a second-floor room for this reason. The location is convenient to access Walt Disney World each day. You can enter the Disney property within 5 minutes or so, but just the entrance--then you have to drive a few more minutes to the parks (but the location isn't much farther than some of the Disney value resorts). There was a shuttle provided, but guests of RBC had to cross the street to catch the shuttle at the Country Inn and Suites (Carlson/Radisson). The shuttle departed the hotel at 8:30, 10:30, and 12:30, returning at 6:30, 8:30, and 10:30. Because our time was limited, we chose to drive ourselves. The cost for parking is $11.00 per day, but the convenience and time-savings was worth it to us. The hotel is located near Route 172, so it's quite easy to get to restaurants and souvenir shops. (EVERY chain restaurant imaginable is within a 2-mile drive, but I didn't see many original non-chain restaurants.) There is a 24-hour super Wal-Mart in the other direction from 172, convenient for picking up groceries and sundry items. The hotel is near Celebration (the real-life town that Disney created), which is a beautiful little spot to walk around, shop, see a movie, and eat in an original restaurant. We didn't have time for more than a drive through on this trip, but it was really pretty. All-in-all, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again--just make sure your room is clean. We paid $99 per night for the 2-bedroom unit, and it was great to have the extra space that a condo unit provided over a regular hotel room.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ewing, nj", "Title": "\u201cHome Away From Home !!!\u201d", "Author": "CANTWAIT2GO074", "ReviewID": "UR12689280", "Content": "My family stayed 12/01 to 12/09.

We stayed in a St. Johns unit. It had 3 bedrooms. It was perfect for our family. There was plenty of space for each person to relax and be comfortable. There were tvs in every bedroom and one in the front room. Our unit showed minor wear and tear. There were scratches on the coffee table in the living room. A headboard on one of the beds came unattached when my son sat on the bed. Some of the bedding had stains on the comforters. The roominess of the unit and the excellent price we got by booking 6 months in advance on the hotel website made those problems not even bother us. The front desk staff were great. They were very friendly and helpful. We needed directions to one of the theme parks and they printed the directions up for us. When we checked into the unit my husband wanted to put something in the room safe, but it was locked. We called the front desk and a maintenance man came over in less the 10 minutes. The pool, hot tub, and spray pool were very nice. The kids loved them. There was always plenty of parking near our unit. The Runaway Beach Club was close enough to the theme parks to be convenient, but far enough away that you felt like you were in a nice quiet place away from the hustle and bustle. We did hear a helicopter nearby everyday. I don't know if it was for tours or what. It was loud enough so you did notice it during the day, but not so loud that it was bothersome.

The condo was huge (it would sleep 11!) and immaculate with all the comforts of home. For $99 a night, it was THE bargain in the Orlando area. Because we had a full kitchen, we saved a bundle on food by eating breakfast at \"home\" each day and packing lunches to take to the parks. We had free light housekeeping each day while we were gone. They took out the trash, gave us fresh towels, and changed the sheets one day as per our request. We did not have a single problem from any employee of this resort - they were all so helpful and friendly. Since we were at the parks all day every day, we only went to the pool/hottub one night. It was lovely, however. I cannot stress enough how close to Disney this resort really is. It was about 10 minutes from door to the welcome gate of Disney. We did not try the shuttle service but it was available to Epcot a few times a day. The price of the condo was to go up on the weekend to $239 (Dec. 21, the start of the \"high\" season at Disney), so we were going to go to check out and go to another hotel.

However please see the \u201cdos and donts\u201d section of this review if you plan to go the timeshare discount route. This \u201cresort\u201d is nice and fits the 3 star rating accordingly. Guests can enjoy resort amenities like the outdoor heated pool, hot tub, fitness center, and a business center in the reception area. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with 1 king bed, second bedroom with one full bed and one twin bed, separate living room, and kitchen, ceiling fans, full-sized washer & dryer, in-room safe, and covered-private entrance. It seems that one of the sofas folded out into another bed as well. THE GOOD Price! The location is just a few miles from Walt Disney World, restaurants and other attractions. The rooms are nicely decorated and provide ample space. The kitchen seems to have all of the conveniences of home (appliances, dishes, and items for cooking). There is ample parking and the resort is gated at night (access only available with room key). The heated pool was very kid-friendly and gym and work out facility were first class. Once we knew where we were going check-in seemed to be a breeze (see dos and donts). When we discussed some of the issues that we had, the resort offered to move us to a new room but we declined. THE BAD We booked the room through a third party marketing firm so the room wasn\u2019t what they said it would be (don\u2019t get me wrong, the place is nice). There were a few places that were unclean. We did have dirty linens and trash piled up from the cleaning crew in front of our suite. Despite repeated calls and promises it took about 16 hours for them to remove it. Half of the staff at the beach club seemed friendly and the other half acted as if they would rather kill you than deal with you. The staff at the other locations on the Calypso Cay property were incredibly rude and should not be working with tourists. There are no black out shades like most hotels. The property is well lit which causes issues for people who cant sleep in bright rooms. Beware of the extra charges. The resort charges $8 a day for the use of amenities and around $20 a day for a light maid service. DOS Book directly through the resort or a major booking agency like Priceline. Call and let the front desk know if you do not wish to have the extra services. Report all problems to the front desk only. Go directly to the Beach Club to check in and NOT the Calypso Cay guest services desk or the big \u201cpink\" building. Go to Wal-Mart down the street for dish soap, detergent, food, and a really good selection of Disney stuff at great prices. DONTS Do not report your problems to the timeshare promo people. They will promise you the world until you don\u2019t buy in. My wife notices that when the shower steamed up, the mirror read \u201credrum\u201d or murder backwards. She reported this and a few other issues with the bathroom being dirty. We were told that someone would clean it up but no one ever came. We stayed 5 nights. Regardless of what we experienced we would probably stay at the Beach Club again. It is a good value.

A few broken machines. Pool area and hot-tub area was nice. Very pretty place to walk for exercise, around the lake. Overall, for the price, the condo was nice. In a 3 bedroom w/ loft unit, up to 14 people could have stayed there. The condo was very roomy. Easily affordable for 2 or 3 families. Grounds were kept neat. Location was good. Walmart across the street. Several restaurants within a mile from the resort. Outlets across street from Walmart. Convenience was a plus. In the future, we'd probably stay at the resort. Just plan to bring food, trash bags, toilet paper and supplies to wash clothes and dishes you'll be fine. I'd rather stay at a condo type resort than a hotel any day! For people who are very picky like me, I would recommend this place to stay while in Orlando.

First - they could have done a bit better when cleaning. We did a bit of touch up in the kitchen after arriving, but the bathrooms were great. The other issue did not really affect us - but the walls do seem to be very thin. We were there during the week, for the most part. But, on the final night (sat) when there were more people, it was easy to hear the people below and next to us. However, this happened in the morning as we were getting ready to go to Disney - so we were up anyway. There were NO problems at night. This is an EXCELLENT location - 10 mins from DIsney, and 15 from Sea World. There are MANY places to eat within 10 mins as well - in several directions. We shopped at a WalMart for basic supplies, which was very close and convenient.

The closets are HUGE and the safe is really nice and we felt very secure leaving our valuables in it.

It was nice to have though; and if we we had stayed longer, it would've been great. The pool area was very nice and the kid pool was a terrific spot for my daughter to play. We even went to the park late one day so she could play in it. The whole pool/deck area was so nice and they played the best music. We didn't experience any problems at all with the front desk staff. They were extremely pleasant and very helpful. One even pulled up a ticket location (where we bought tickets and had to pick them up) on Mapquest for us while we were checking in. I only have one negative. There was a small stain on the comforter, sheet and pillow in the bedroom. (It looked like a coffee stain.) Luckily, there was an extra set of sheets and I just changed them myself and used another pillow. Since we weren't in the unit that much, I didn't bring it to the attention of management. I'm sure they would have corrected it if I had. However; everything else in the unit was sparkling clean, including the bathroom. Oh, and the bed...one of the most comfortable beds I have EVER slept on...not sure if it was a Tempur Pedic or Dux, but it was sooooooooooooo comfy! My husband travels for business and only stays at 5 stars...like Four Seasons, etc...
