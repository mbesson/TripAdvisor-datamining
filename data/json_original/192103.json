For start I booked twin room en-suit a few weeks in advance. I know that area a little bit and all \u201chotels\u201d there are the same. Then I called them and booked the room I was surprised because they charged me \u00a360 pn however their website said \u00a350 (I checked their website today and the prices were adjusted recently \u2013 now it\u2019s \u00a365 pn twin room en-suit.) When we arrived (Joyce knew we would arrive something around 13:00) the room was not ready for us and we have been told the room would be ready by 14:15. Ok, we had to go around the area wasting time away however we travelled from Cornwall by a coach for 8:45 hours. We were exhausted. We were desperate to have a rest. We came back at 14:16 and \u2026 the room was not ready yet. So we had to go outside for wondering around. Fortunately we were allowed to leave our luggage in the room, so our wondering around was a little bit easier. About 3pm we managed to get in the room. The room was for three people \u2013 one single bed and one double, however I booked twin room. The room is so tiny \u2013 no chance to open the door without moving a suitcase. The bathroom is tiny maybe not bigger then 2,5 sq.m. The bathroom door had the lock which was broken inside, therefore you can\u2019t lock the door from outside and if you do you can\u2019t release yourself and need the help of the person who is in the room at this moment. The shower curtain is dirty down the bottom. The shower itself is covered with lime scale. The sink is straight in front of the face of the person who is engaged the single bed, so when you wash your face and brush your teeth the splashing reaches the single bed and the person\u2019s face. The TV \u2013 in fact there is not TV as such because the room is maintained with the analogy TV which is out of date and as the result you can watch only 5 channels with showing pictures. As far as I know the TVs should be replaced for a digital reception and it was imposed on all hoteliers if they are big or small. We booked the English breakfast which contained one fried egg, two slices of bacon (bacon was over cooked and it was more like crisp with bacon flavour rather than a cooked bacon). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast#Full_English_breakfast In fact it was only partially English breakfast. Toasts were ok. On the second day the marmalade tub has been served unsealed and it has been used before it reached our room. Additionally the next door guests were very noisy and disturbed all guests around. When I made a gentile complaint to Joyce she replied they were people with children. I do not care they were with or without children! The public order is applicable to everyone \u2013 with or without children. Due to behaviour of the next door guests my friend could not fall asleep for half of the night as her bed was next to the wall which divided our room with their one.

We were served breakfast to our room at a requested time. The staff especially Joyce is very pleasant and kind enough to accommodate to our demand. We even left our luggage at the safe hand even after we checked out. Cause we still wanna do a lil bit of small trips around London before heading off to Heathrow. We requested early check-in and later check-out prior to that too. I know we are demanding but she made it. This hotel is very accommodative and that is something I like about it. The ensuite room is adequate. The bed is to our comfort. Yes the decoration might be a lil bit outdated but it's still fine. I actually thought it kinda define a lil bit of Victorian, which is incredible. Me and friend had an amazing stay. Thank you Joyce and Limegrove Hotel!

The fact that when you are a tourist in a place you tend to be out most of the time sightseeing, so are only in your room for a minimal time to sleep and change your clothes, so this place is very good. The breakfast was satisfactory and for the price of the accomodation i was suprised that we were getting a cooked breakfast in australia for the same cost of lodgings you dont get a cooked breakfast included unless you pay extra , you only get toast and cereal with tea or coffee, so hot bacon and eggs was a welcome treat, as i was suffering jet lag i only had my husband and daughters reccomendation on the breakfast, which were high accolades. we liked the place so much we have decided to stay there again when we return to the uk in october 2011, this time we will stay for a week, and we are happy with the service we got last time we are happy to return again and again. well done I have already recommended this place to friends who prefer budget holidays.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Damascus, Syria", "Title": "\u201cVery good location and value for money with an excellent, friendlier and prompt service\u201d", "Author": "Sam_Eddie", "ReviewID": "UR84885492", "Content": "I travelled to London with my family (wife + 3 young kids at the ages 7, 8 & 10) during 4th to 11th June 2010 and opted to stay in this hotel only due to its close proximity to the Victoria stations (coach, rail & underground). It was only about 100-200 meters away from all these stations. However, with the amazing hospitality and friendlier service of the manageress Joyce & her staff gave us a feeling that we got much more than what we expected. On the first night (on the day we arrived) we were given two rooms since the only family room they had at the time was not vacant. It was a little hassle for us to use sharing toilets as we had to attend children as and when they wanted to use toilets. But since the second night we got the family room with attached bathroom which was very convenient and also with privacy. So, if I booked earlier it would be much better. The breakfast was served exactly on time at the time we requested; Continental and/or English breakfast as we ordered in the day before. Towels, bed linen were changed daily. I assume that the room service was exceeded requirement of a B&B hotel. The room was facing the Warwick way but noise was not disturbing us as the road was not much busy in the night. Carrying suitcases in the narrow stairway was difficult. The Joyce\u2019s staff was kind enoug to offer their help as they can. Thanks girls. Since our return flight was in the evening, we were allowed keep our baggage (after checking out) in a safe chamber at the basement, free of charge.

The Tv in the room was also filty with half the buttons missing and Im sure no PAT certificate.
