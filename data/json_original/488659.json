Anhalter Bahnof ruins - 50 m. Prinz Albrechtsrasse Gestapo HQ - now a museum Topography of terror - about 200 m, with a section of The Wall adjacent to the museum. Hermann Goering's Reich Air Ministry - now the German Finance Ministry - bang opposite the Topography of Terror. Hitler's Fuhrer Bunker location - now a car park - about 300 - 400 m. The Holocaust Memorial and museum - about 100 m from the car park. Brandbenburg Tor and Hotel Adlon - another 100 m. Soviet War Memorial - about 200 m from Brandenburg Tor. Reichstag. Siegesaul - another 3 - 400 m from Tor. You can lazily walk it up and finish all of these in half a day - as I did (though I would have loved to spend more time in the Holocaust and Topography of Terror museums) . Don't forget Checkpoint Charlie which is about half to 1 km from this hotel. If you are not the Cold War or WW2 buff tyoes - and its hard to escape both these 20th Century events in Berlin - then go to Potsdamer Platz which is about 200 m from the hotel, buy a Hop on Hop off ticket - as I did - and you can tour Berlin and see the other historical sites. As an Indian , I found the \"all you can eat for 10 Euro \" breakfast , absolutely monotonous (same spread for 3 days ) and even pathetic but I am sure most Westerners will like the breakfast . Its no frills stay and no room service but that's why the hotel is so cheap (about 130 Euro for 2 nights three days for a couple ! ) It was comfortablebut again the room is no frills - you want tea or coffee or anything to east , you have to go down to the restaurant on the ground floor.

We had four destinations in Germany and our goal was to find in each one an acceptable hotel for under $100 per night. This is not an easy task, especially in expensive cities like Berlin! The IBIS Potsdamer Platz was a great option. IBIS is one of the hotel chains now owned by Accor Hotels. On the IBIS website we booked a double room for 49 Euros per night! (Full disclosure: this rate was restricted to payment in advance and was non-refundable, but we had trip insurance so it was worth taking the risk). The rate did not include breakfast but we paid the 10 Euros each to eat breakfast there -- a great buffet. We both need at least three cups of coffee to get going in the morning, and when you consider that a single cup of coffee on the street is 2 Euros or more, the buffet with all the coffee you can drink is a relative bargain! So with breakfasts our daily rate was 69 Euros per night which is still a fantastic price for two people. Many of the hostel/hotels in Berlin were considerably more expensive than that for two people in a private room. This appears to be one of the newer IBIS hotels -- both the room and the bathroom (en suite) were very spacious with adequate closet and storage space. Our room was on the 7th floor on the street side. The street is very quiet and we often had the window open overnight without experiencing street noise. The front desk staff were universally friendly and helpful. There are two computers in the lobby offering free internet access. From the window we could see Potsdamer Platz and the Bundestag dome. The \"Topography of Terror\" museum is a block away. The hotel is about a 15 minute leisurely walk to Potsdamer platz. There is a subway line 1/2 block from the hotel. Bus No. 41, also 1/2 block away, connects the hotel to the main train station (only about 15 minutes in normal traffic or about 10 minutes in light traffic), Bus No. 29, also 1/2 block away, takes you to Nollendorf Platz where KDW is located (Europe's largest department store with a food section not-to-be-missed!).

The hotel boasts about all rooms being air conditioned, and they all are. what they don't tell you is that they only turn it on when the temperature outside climbs over 25 Celsius. We stayed at the hotel in July, and I can tell that when it's 23 degrees outside the room gets warm. The reception told me the reason for having the air conditioner turned of was environmental. This is very noble, but if I am to pay for an air conditioned room I think it would be up to me how much of an environmentalist I like to be. The recommendation I got was to open a window, the room we had was facing the street and having the window open made the room very noisy from all the traffic outside.

This hotel like many Ibis Hotels already stayed in was very good indeed. This was one of the most spacious Ibis hotels. The room was larger and more modern. Breakfast was typical Ibis with hot boiled eggs and omelette. Probably more choice actually with fruit yoghurts, fresh fruits, various rolls and breads, cheese, ham, dips etc. Anhalter Bahnhof practically on the doorstep with one stop to Potsdamer Platz and 3 to Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof which is the gateway to many underground lines. We got a Berlin Welcome Card which was fantastic - travel on all transport plus discount on tours, museums etc. If you wanted a change from Ibis breakfast then Cafe Streseman just on the corner of the street. Varied choice - eggs and ham, toast and butter and omelette very good. Bit cheaper than Ibis but of course at Ibis you can choose and eat as much as you want. Also have as many top-ups on fruit juice, tea, coffee etc. Also at Ibis is a garden at the back where meals can be taken. Internet access is via two computers in reception this is free. If you take your own laptop then wifi is only available in reception and on 6th floor. This is chargeable. If coming to Berlin again would defnitely stay at this hotel.

From there Get on the U2 to Potsdamer Platz, transfer to the S2 to Anhalter Bahnhof and you are then right around the corner. We road the S2 quite often as we really like the Berlin Insider Tours which meet outside of Zoologischer Garden in front of the Dunkin Donuts across from the station. I would recommend getting a tour with Nigel as he is the most entertaining and knowledgeable of the lot. The hotel room was super clean and exactly what we expected. When we registered we opted out of the breakfast, as there are many places to eat at the stations or at our destinations. The service is great too, when we needed extra towels they seemed to arrive rather quickly. This particular hotel has many international travelers, but with the amount of traffic in and out it was extremely quiet. Our particular room had a bizarre shower/restroom with a revolving type door. This eccentricity was interesting. It worked well and no problems with water temp etc. Overall the value was great and you really couldn't beat the price.

Rooms are fine for one person but a couple might find it a little cramped, especially if you have a lot of luggage. The bathroom is a kind of prefabricated, plastic cubicle but the shower is surprisingly spacious. No toiletries provided apart from soap. The T.V. has no English channels (I don't think it even had CNN, though I'm not absolutely sure), but you must have better things to do than watch T.V. The receptionists and bar staff speak English, as you'd expect. The road where it is located, Anhalter Strasse, is not very busy, so even though I had a room right at the front I was not troubled by noise at night. There is a small restaurant. The buffet breakfast has a good selection of bread, cold meats, cheese, and fruit, with juice and coffee from a machine, but there's no hot food apart from boiled eggs. You have to pay in advance. When you check in, the receptionist will ask you if you want breakfast . If you say yes, she will assume you mean every day and charge you accordingly. I don't know if you can choose to have it some days but not others. So if you like to pig out on cooked breakfasts, it's probably better to say no and go to the excellent Cafe Stresemann opposite. I didn't eat dinner at the hotel, but the menu looked quite good and I overheard another guest saying his steak was the best he'd ever had. Location is excellent provided you are reasonably healthy. Potsdamer Platz is about 5 minutes walk and Friedrichstrasse/Checkpoint Charlie about 10 minutes walk. The Anhalter Bahnhof S-Bahn station is about 2 minutes walk and there is a taxi rank by the side of it (in front of the Movenpick Hotel). Lots of places to eat nearby - I like the Cafe Stresemann but there is also an Italian restaurant that has been favourably reviewed elsewhere. There is a small convenience store a few doors up and a supermarket round the corner. In the lobby there are two PCs with free Internet access. One of them has a French keyboard, which threw me for a while until I realised what it was. But can't complain - Ibis is a French company.

The restaurant also doubles up as the bar in the evening, we found this surprisingly atmospheric for a 3 star hotel bar, so well worth popping in for one last drink at the end of the evening! As for location, there isnt loads around the hotel, apart from a bar/cafe across the road on the corner, which was fine, and there is also an Italian restaurant nearby, which we did not try. There is an Aldi supermarket just round the corner too. Aanhalter Bahnhoff (station) is 1 minute walk from the hotel, from here, a train will take you to the centre in just 5 or 10 minutes. I do recommend the tourist pass 3 day train ticket for just under 20 Euros. Alternatively, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to Potsdamer Platz, some nice cafes/bars/restaurants there.
