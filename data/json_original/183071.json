It was too late to back out since we've already paid our room and we were too tired. If you are driving here, be prepared to pay $45 for their valet parking. But here's a tip, beside the hotel is an overnight parking space where you only pay $25 until 6pm of the next morning. You can just walk from there to the hotel's main door. A few steps will save you 20 bucks. This is actually great because even if you've checked out from the hotel the next morning (around 11am), you can still roam around downtown without worrying where to park. You can grab an \"All Day\" pass for the subway and street cars for a better tour of the city. Staffs are friendly and nice - no complains.

My mother was going to take care of our 3 and 4 year old children for the night so I did not want to leave anything to chance. We don't get out as much as before we had children so it was important to book the right hotel. I had decided on the King Eddie because of it's location right on the subway line. Also, we would only need to take a streetcar to get to the Toronto Symphony at Roy Thomson Hall later that evening. So with this in mind, and not wanting to leave anything to chance, I trudged on down a few days before to check out the various rooms that I would consider for our evening out. I met Adi and Janice at the Front Desk and explained my situation. They could not have been more helpful. They found someone to show me the various rooms available and give me a tour of the Royal Club Lounge. After the tour, I was pretty sure I had made the right choice to stay here. However as with all Hotels, rooms are subject to availability so I would not know which room would be available for my stay. I arrived a few days later with my wife to check in and was pleasantly surprised to find that my room had been upgraded and I would be getting a corner suite on the 11th floor which is the same floor as the Royal Club Lounge. The room was very bright, with a nice view and was elegantly furnished. The bed looked very inviting and comfortable and there was bottled water on our night tables. Shortly after our check in there was a knock at the door and a cheese cake was presented to my wife. I had mentioned to Janice at the front desk about my wife's birthday and she had arranged this for us. Totally unexpected and such a thoughtful gesture. My wife said she wanted to take a quick nap before we had a bite in the Royal Club Lounge. First mistake when you have a bed more comfortable than at home. She did not want to get out of bed and subsequently said she would meet me in the lounge a little later. So I headed off to the Club Lounge solo not knowing what to expect. We were prepared to eat in the Consort Bar downstairs depending on the food available in the lounge. I was in for quite a surprise as the food available was delectable. Perhaps a little to good to be honest. I knew that dinner would not be necessary this evening. I chose from two different types of quiches, pita with Hummus, Tzatziki and Baba Ganoush, a lovely meat dish, brie, cheddar and swiss cheeses. Various olives and crisp vegetable slices, ( different peppers, carrots, etc ). There were nuts and chips and tortilla chips available as well. White and red wine and different beers were also available for us. My wife finally arose from her nap and seconded my opinion of the \"snacks\". After a few glasses of wine, some more food and some of her cheesecake we were stuffed. We would not be needing to eat dinner out tonight. We returned to a great night's sleep and I awoke in the morning ready for a workout in the gym. It is equipped with assorted exercise machines, ( rowing, elliptical, bikes etc. ), weight machines, free weights, exercise balls and more. I had a great workout and enjoyed more of the hotel's included bottled water. My wife stayed in bed again as I headed for the breakfast buffet. Again, I was not disappointed as I chose from eggs, cheese, ham, croissants, bagels, muffins, cereals and lots of fresh fruit. It was accompanied by fresh squeezed orange juice, tea and coffee. I had more than enough to last me until well after lunch. My wife arrived a little later and was similarly impressed with the breakfast buffet. We made our way back to the room but not before using the computer and printer provided in the Royal Club Lounge. I needed to print a document and this was done in seconds. We have stayed at the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto, as well as the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth in Montreal and the Fairmont Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City. We were on the Gold floor at these hotels which is the equivalent of the Royal Club. The King Edward was every bit as nice with more affordable prices. If you are wavering about whether it is worth staying in a Royal Club Room, don't hesitate as it is worth every penny. Of course, the staff are always so important and they did not disappoint at all. I would highly commend Janice and Adi at the Front Desk for their great service. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my family and friends and my wife is already planning a return with her mother for another stay at the hotel.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but past its prime\u201d", "Author": "Adavidson1", "ReviewID": "UR125109599", "Content": "Got into town late for business and got to the hotel and was greeted by very friendly staff.

Staying here is a treat. I go back and forth between here and the Sheraton. My wife likes the Sheraton; I like it here. No doubt the club lounge is nicer and food better at the Sheraton, and my wife likes the rooms there better. I like the free booze in the lounge at the Eddie.

It's one of those under-lit darkwood jobs that passes for old-fashioned and exclusive on this side of the Atlantic. At fifty I was the youngest patron by a good decade. This is definitley the go-to venue in Toronto if you have a new Zimmer-frame to show off. As in the rest of the hotel attention to detail is poor. An excellent local draft beer was served with a small bowl of rather stale broken biscuits. I finally had a very good piece of poached salmon from the bar menu, although I did wonder half an hour after ordering it and still waiting, whether the chef hadn't dispatched an angler off to the Yukon to catch it. I had a good tarte tatin for dessert but despite waiting another twenty minutes to get it, it was served cold. This hotel doesn't live up to its pretensions or its prices.

If you do not want to pay the $40 for parking there is indoor parking a few minutes away just south of King on Church at Ideal parking. It was $6 flat rate for Saturday and the same for Sunday. This hotel has a very elegant peaceful lobby which I admired while my husband was getting the car.

We hadn't stayed there for several years, not since it had been renovated. As a child growing up in Niagara in the 50's, my Dad would get a room there and take us for the weekend to see the Santa Claus parade and Eatons windows. We all thought it was really grand. We had a family wedding at Ontario Place last weekend. The bridal party was booked into the Westin Harbour Castle, and they suggested that to the rest of the out-of-town guests. We thought of the King Eddie........and were we pleased!!!! First: Westin $169 vs King Eddie $109. We took four rooms. Our room was one of the huge older rooms that today would be called a suite. It was totally re-furbished and modernized, but still had that old elegant feel. It was very luxurious and well appointed.The morning after the wedding we opted to have brunch in King Eddie's Grand Ballroom. This was one of the finest Brunches we had ever enjoyed. Shrimp, crab, scallops, smoked salmon and trout, Beef Wellington, Glazed Ham, Eggs Benedict, salads,desserts etc., all accompanied by the soft strings of the harpist. At one point my wife ask, 'did you ask how much the Brunch is ?' I replied,'who cares, how much could it be?' When the bill arrived for the ten of us, including 2 granchildren at 1/2 price and no alcohol at all.....it was $658.00 including tax and built-in gratuity. We all enjoyed a good laugh at ourselves the \"Country Cousins\" from Grimsby,....and decided to do it again the next time we had an occasion to stay in Toronto.

Our bathroom was also spacious and had a bidet, but was lacking in terms of hangers or shelf space to put our stuff.

I went to Nouvelle Maria Spa at the King Edward Hotel because I used to go there quite frequently before I moved away 10 years ago. I have since returned to the area. I arrived to a friendly welcome and was asked if I had been there before and was given a quick overview of how to use the locker key and was given a towel, flip flops and robe. My coat was taken and hung up and an employee escorted me to the change room and I was shown where the lounge was to await my treatment. Change Room: Upon entering the change room, I couldn't help but notice in how disrepair it was. The whole room and the bathroom needs to be gutted and updated. The shower was unappealing and I didn't dare set foot in the sauna. Robe and Flip flops: The robe was a very comfortable size and seemed of decent quality (I didn't read the label). The flip flops were something you would find in Chinatown for probably $5 for 20 pairs. Not very attractive and made my feet sweat which was uncomfortable as inevitably, my RMT would be touching them. Lounge: Dated. Looked like the same furniture I remember 10 years ago, even had the same material. The furniture was old and uncomfortable - the cushions desperately needed replacement as they sagged terribly when you sat on them. It was a very cold day and I wasn't offered any hot honey water with lemon until about 2 minutes before the RMT came to get me for my treatment so I couldn't enjoy it. RMT/Treatment: The treatment room was nothing to be inspired about. The music through the sound system was relaxing but the treatment room left much to be desired. It wasn't a soothing relaxing enviroment as it needed a new paint job badly, and the rest of the room just needed sprucing up and was not very tidy. There wasn't even a hook on the wall for me to hang my robe - I had to place it on a stool of some sort. I could also hear clearly from the treatment room beside me. RMT was nice enough, listened to what I needed and went forward in administering the treatment. A few minutes in I heard sniffling and every so often I would feel one hand or the other leaving my body to what I had to assume was so that the RMT would wipe his nose. There were tissues right on the counter and I didn't even know what to say. First, you'd think that the spa would have informed me that the RMT had a cold and asked if I wanted a different RMT! The RMT should have also told me, so now he's wiping his excressions as he's touching me - very unprofessional. I really should have stopped the treatment and said something looking back now but I guess I was just in shock. I was asked if I had any services booked afterwards and said no. I wasn't offered cold water or hot honey water with lemon to enjoy in the lounge and relax after the treatment. I went back to the change room and got dressed then proceeded to pay. No issue with the payment process. So in closing, I could go to The Stillwater Spa or The Elmwood Spa and get the same treatment for the same money but actually be in a relaxing enviroment and enjoy other free amenities that the Nouvelle Maria Spa does not offer. There is a lot of competition out there and there are a lot of people with generous company health benefits (like myself) who can go to the spa monthly for free. Nouvelle Maria Spa needs to invest in the actual spa facility, make it inviting and enjoyable enviroment for visitors and ensure visitors feel as though they don't have to leave right after their treatment(s). There is a lot of competition out there - I recommend that the spa do some research and bring it's facility into the 21st century - the 80s are over. Repeat business is the bread and butter these days but maybe they're surviving on the one offs the King Edward hotel provides. With the new King Edward hotel condominums being built now is the time for a fantastic referb! Imagine the hundreds of prospective clients the Nouvelle Maria Spa could have as repeat visitors.

Also no WIFI available in the guest rooms. I believe the rooms are due to be refurbished soon which is definitely needed. A good 4 star hotel in a great location.

I think the reason it gets such mixed reviews is that it has the look (from the outside and lobby) of a grand, five star property, but the rooms and facilities have not been kept up to five star standard. And, in fact, this hotel is only rated as four stars so I think this should be kept in mind when reviewing it. If it were passing itself off today as a five star property I would have felt ripped off even at the discounted rate that I paid. However, for a four star, I was satisfied with our quiet, spacious, east facing room on the 12th floor (Club level). The bed was very comfortable and the bed linens of a high quality. The bedroom and bathroom were decorated in a classic way that was probably the height of luxury in the 80s/90s but now just looks a bit old-fashioned. I probably wouldn't have even noticed the dated decor, except there was a noticeable stain on the carpet and another stain on the ottoman at the end of the bed which made me look around and realise the property probably hasn't been updated in about 25 years. One other criticism about the rooms - you are charged a daily rate for wi-fi (I think it was $13 or so?) but wi-fi is free in the club lounge so if you stay in a room on the club floors you can take your laptop along to the lounge. That's what we did - no big deal, but it would have been more convenient in the room! On the plus side, we were happy with the (included) continental breakfast provided on the 11th floor club lounge, which included a range of cereals (including oatmeal! yum!), fresh fruit, pastries, toast, juices, cold meats and cheese, boiled eggs, juice etc. The only downside to the breakfast was the coffee, but then I had a hard time finding a good cup of coffee in Toronto (if, like me, you find Starbucks coffee too weak/tasteless, go to Bulldog on the corner of Church & Granby or Crema on Bloor just east of Yonge). The club lounge also has a happy hour with free wine/beer/canapes every evening but we were always out at that time. Aside from breakfast in the club lounge, we didn't go to the hotel restaurants so my room service club sandwich was the only other hotel food that I tried -- it was big and tasty and the accompanying fries were excellent. Service at the King Edward was very friendly, prompt and efficient - my room service order arrived promptly. This hotel is in a good location, right next to King St subway station and walking distance from lots of shopping and tourist attractions.

We have many friends in Toronto and when we told them that we were staying in the King Edward, they all told us how it was \"6 star\" hotel and how it represented the royalty of Toronto. When we pressed our friends for more detail none of them could vouch for these rumors with first hand accounts. Anyway, despite that, our expectations were elated. When we first arrived through the large revolving door, we were beholden with an opulent lobby that one would expect in a four star traditional hotel - similar to what one see in a classic Ritz-Carlton or Fairmont hotel. One thing was visibly absent however...the staff, customers and the typical hustle and bustle of this class of hotel. Strange but we didn't think much of it until later on. Check in was prompt and courteous if nothing special and we were assigned to a king bed room on the 6th floor. The room was not large but was comfortable enough for the two of us. It was reasonably clean but one could tell that it was a very old hotel that has been refurbished multiple times in attempts to stay competitive. In any case, it was in the bathroom, I had my first surprise...plastic disposable cups! Normally I don't care about these things but it certainly reflects badly on a supposed \"4-star\" hotel. Just not expected in such a venue...It just makes me wonder, what other corners are they cutting? The shower water pressure was strong and the provided toiletries were of decent quality. The bed was decent with a thin pillow top layer and I was able to get a good night's sleep on it...at least until 8AM in the morning when we were woken to a very loud drilling noise which seemed to happen 1 wall away from our room! First of all, who starts this so early in the morning when some people are obviously still sleeping? Second of all, why didn't they put a notice or sign in the lobby about this construction or at least tell us about it during check in? Finally, why did they even put us anywhere near the construction? Upsetting and unacceptable to say the least. It also happened on both mornings of our stay! On the multiple trips up in and out of the hotel, I can safely say that they must run their hotel very short staffed since I didn't see too many folks too often in the lobby including at the concierge. They obviously couldn't afford the staff to do an evening turn down service as well which is typical of many 4-star hotels. In conclusion, this hotel is average at best and needs to work on it's communication and perception to its customers.

Having done this in June (where everything was terrific) I was so looking forward to a repeat experience. Let me preface this by stating that the staff on call during the afternoon, evening hours was wonderful, however......... as my travelling companion is claustrophobic and unable to get into elevators I had requested a room on a lower floor ( I am also a Starwood member). Upon signing in we were given our room cards for the 6th floor. I took the luggage and my friend proceeded up the stairwells. I reached the designated room and found my card did not work. Returning to the front desk \"Toya\" proceeded to check again and issue me new cards, back to the room I went. This time I got in with no difficulty...But..imagine my surprise when I found not only a suite, but rooms obviously occupied. I quickly retreated and returned to the front desk. Toya was very concerned and rechecked the envelopes which had been prepared earlier in the morning. We both agreed that the room number was written as 678. However, then we tried 673 and it was up and running. Now my concern is regarding safety. Obviously the staff member who processed this room on the morning shift needs guidance in penmanship. Due to his/her carelessness that room could have been robbed! It did make me think twice about room security in the future. My friend navigating the stairwell did notice that perhaps a little sweeping would be helpful. We realize that this is mainly a fire route or staff access stairwell but there may well be other patrons who can not take an elevator who would need to take the stairs. As to the room itself, I was so surprised. Unlike my room in June this time the broadloom definitely needed a good cleaning, as did the stains on the chairs. Also, while we were out at the theatre the air conditioning broke. Upon our return we spoke to \"Oscar\" who was very apologetic---as there were no other rooms on this muggy evening he did arrange for two fans to be sent to the room. Oscar also offered us a complimentary breakfast in the lounge but upon realizing it was on the 11th floor ( which in the morning would have been quite a trek up the stairs and down) he changed it to room service. He was in an awkward position and we did appreciate his apology and graciousness. I do hope to return but I will be concerned about the security as well as hoping for one of the more updated and 'fresher' rooms in the future.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Toronto hotel\u201d", "Author": "darrennelson", "ReviewID": "UR116872316", "Content": "I stay here quite often while in Toronto depending on their rates.

As previous reviewers have stated, the King Edward hotel is probably past it's prime and an update of the guest-rooms and of public spaces might be a good idea, so if you want a state-of-the-art top-luxury hotel, look elsewhere and be prepared to pay much more. Taking into account our room-rate, our experience at the King Edward was excellent: The lobby is classic and impressive and must have been even more elegant before they put the internet-station smack in the middle of it. Check-in was smooth and friendly, our room very spacious, clean and nicely appointed, showing only minor signs of wear and tear. The bed was maybe a little too soft for us. We noticed that the door to the corridor as well as the connecting door to another guest room were not very well sound-proofed but fortunately, there was no noise in the corridor and the family next door switched off their tv soon and went to bed early (hope they had a good sleep as well as we were jet-lagged and got up at 4am to a good long shower). Internet access was rather expensive as expected and other extras (room-service, breakfast, parking) probably would have been expensive as well, but due to the excellent location of the hotel you can get everything you need nearby and at better prices, if only you are prepared to walk a few steps. Also, a subway-station is conveniently located just one block away which greatly improved our sightseeing-range. On our last day, a very nice girl at the front-desk kindly let us have our room until almost 4 pm so that we could thoroughly enjoy our lunch at nearby Canoe restaurant and then come back, change and pack.

Our only negative comment was about the club lounge (we are platinum members) due to the fact that I went in their on two separate days to get some water and soda but the refrigerator was empty. On the second day I called down and to their credit they sent up to our room a bucket off ice filled with water and soda. Very classy. The only other comment is that they do not have wireless in the room, only a hookup. I only travel with my iPad so that was a little inconvenient.

As it was our honeymoon, I had requested a small fridge and a coffee maker for our room, both of which were there when we arrived.

Nothing to really complain about, but also nothing to write home about. Stayed in July in a Club Level Queen-sized room, so internet (wi-fi) was complimentary. The service overall was great - check-in/out was fast and efficient, while room service staff was prompt and polite. Although the doormen may need to be reminded that they are there to assist guests with luggage up and down the stairs, as opposed to standing and staring while I struggled with my bags. My room was on the 10th floor facing an internal courtyard. When the elevator door opened on the 10th floor, the hallway was stuffy and hot, as there was no air conditioning or air flow of any sort. The room itself was spacious with a seating area, large walk-in closet, work desk and queen-sized bed. While the decor matched the majestic-feel that it was trying to convey, I can't help but notice that the wall paper and paint were peeling, the carpet was old and certain furniture could use some repair. There is no central light switch; rather, you have to switch each lamp on in order to get sufficient light at night. The bathroom was standard - nothing to rave or complain about. However, the water pressure of the toilet was rather weak, so you have to press down longer to ensure that it completely flushes. The Club Lounge has a great coffee machine and offers continental breakfast from 7 a.m., along with a reception with hors d'oeuvres and wine/beer from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. It's not crowded and is quite convenient for those who need to continue working.

From an access point of view, it is very convenient. 2) The very friendly staff who went out of there to meet your requests. For instance, my tv remote was working intermittantly. I had to leave the tv on one morning because I couldn't shut it off or change the channels. I called in to have it fixed and when I returned from my morning coffee run, I had a new remote and everything worked as it should. 3) I love the complimentary water bottle and newspaper that they provide daily. The two things I didn't like about the room were: 1) the tv sits in a stand with cabinets opening out and they stay out like flaps or wings, they don't roll back into the cabinet. So this means, you can only watch tv from your bed, as watching from any other angle is impossible due to the cabinet flaps 2) the bathroom is oddly shaped in that the toilet is far from the sink and the toilet paper holder on the far wall.

For what they offer, it is quite affordable. In fact, I feel that I got more than my money's worth. I live in Toronto, but stayed here on the night before my wedding day and used it as a place for my bridesmaids and me to get ready in before the wedding. I also stayed for a second night (my wedding night.) My husband (fiance at the time) and I got two separate rooms and we checked in at 11 at night. Check-in was a breeze as the concierge staff were very competent and professional. They were considerate about the fact that it was the night before our wedding and wanted us to get to our comfortable rooms as soon as possible. My husband requested a full-length mirror to be placed in my suite, and within five minutes of our entering our room, a staff member arrived with the full-length mirror. Wonderful and quick service! My own suite was very clean, spacious and aesthetically pleasing. This was my second time staying at this hotel and the reason why I chose it for my wedding photos is because of the charming decor. The bed was also incredibly comfortable. I was extremely tired all day from running around doing last-minute wedding errands but as soon as I crawled under the covers after a nice hot shower in the well-equipped bathroom, I felt immediately relaxed. The room was also fully stocked with luxurious toiletries. My husband and I returned to my suite after our wedding reception. The next morning I realized that the cover bag for my wedding dress had been lost due to shuffling around and switching rooms. I called the front desk and asked if they had seen a large garment cover bag and they called me back thirty minutes later to inform me that they could not locate my cover bag, but that they would send someone up to give me a replacement bag that I can carry my wedding dress in. I really appreciated that. Had this been a lower-class hotel, the staff would probably not given a care about my lost garment bag. This is one classy establishment! I also have to mention that the housekeeping staff are so kind and friendly! I ended up having a conversation with one of the cleaning ladies and she gave me some kind advice on my new marriage :) I really had a wonderful experience at this hotel and would not hesitate to return for another stay. In fact, I can't wait to have an excuse to stay here again, I live just 45 minutes away, but I would book a night at this hotel just for some luxury and comfort. Highly recommended!!! I have to add that this hotel is two-minutes walking distance from a subway station in Toronto. It is also a 15-minute walking distance from the busiest part of Toronto (tourist attraction - Eaton Centre and Dundas Square. The hotel is surrounded by many classy and delicious restaurants. It's lobby is so very beautiful (ideal for photo-taking.) Oh, and they give you plush bathrobes and comfy slippers in your room.

The overall attitude seems to be that 'King Eddie's' reputation is what you pay for (a lot), rather than it's service. The general problem with the place is just how expensive everything is. OK, you accept the higher rate, but you get NOTHING for that rate. Internet is very expensive, room service is crippling, food in the restaurants extortionate. You should be grateful for being in this hotel and pay what this privilege costs in all areas! The hotel itself is alright, very grand in appearance and the rooms are spacious. But at the same time it's very old and tired, needing a revamp. Our A/C would be on full some days, off the next, regardless of what you do with the dial! Bathrooms tired and basic. Parking was too high, we parked round the block in a public garage for the whole stay for less than one night rate here. Staff were not overly helpful, didn't like to be bothered. On a final note, what really annoyed me most were the bar staff at the $**,000 wedding reception we attended. Miserable, surly and full of attitude; like being served drinks by those who didn't make the cut into Tony Soprano's gang! It seemed serving a drink was the most offensive act to be asked of them, despite that being what they were hired for. To cap it off they started creating rules at 10pm (bar was paid for until midnight), stopped serving altogether at 11pm and at midnight were a dot on the horizon. We'd paid a fortune to come over from England for this wedding and at 10pm felt like naughty students trying to drink beyond closing time in some dive bar. Such Gestapo drink service was ironic as hell considering the entire hotel reeked of weed the whole stay, wafting out of every room all day long while the Caribbean Madis Gras was on...

The wall paper was curling up in spots and the paint was bubbling and peeling on the ceiling of the bathroom. It may seem picky to mention these things but one would think that a luxury hotel starting at $230 per night would be on top of these issues.

As we were lying in bed naked, waiting for the fire alarm to stop going off, a man burst into our supposedly double locked room with no warning, other than the rattle of the lock.

He calmly walked into the middle of the room, without even acknowledging that we were there, or apologising for walking in on two people in bed naked; looked up at the ceiling (where the alarm was) for a few seconds and then turned and walked back out as if nothing had happened.

According to my wife, they make a really fine straight-up martini, and I can speak enthusiastically about the on-tap Tankhouse ale from the local Mill Street Microbrewery. The food served in the bar has really improved since our last visits although not up to Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard on either Sunday evening. Like many, we regret the passing of the Victoria Cafe and the resulting changes to the Lobby that this loss precipitated. But, on balance, the King Eddy was always, and remains, a very special place. To those who do not know Toronto, I suggest that it is difficult to imagine a better location. The King Street Subway is steps away and from there you can easily get to such locations as the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Bloor Street high-end shopping venues. You can walk to the St. Lawrence Market, the Eaton Centre, and the Opera House (Four Seasons Centre), and Union Station in 10 minutes. You can also access the underground walkways (The PATH) from the King Street Subway Station in case of inclement weather. By the way, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste time trying to get a good map of the PATH. There is no such thing. You just have to walk it and learn it.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cA for effort, B for performance.\u201d", "Author": "aero_world", "ReviewID": "UR96389281", "Content": "The service is excellent - among one of the best I have ever encountered. The room was large and spacious even if parts of it were worn and outdated. The plumbing was an issue - with very finicky hot and cold water temperature settings. It was disappointing the rooms don't come with a coffeemaker. The hotel is located pretty close to the financial district which is very good but not as good as the Sheraton because you have to walk outside before you can get to the underground PATH system which connects most of downtown Toronto (very important during the cold winters). Overall, this hotel is pretty good but it definitely isn't as luxurious or high-class as it tries to be. The parts which are renovated look stunning. But it's the parts that were glossed over in the renovations and the little amenities unavailable (like coffee) which betray this hotel's \"trying hard but just can't seem to get there\" dilemma.

What a fabulous deal - 2 nights and King Tut all for $250. All the staff were helpful (thanks Oscar and Sophia). We were upgraded to a gigantic suite and had access to the Royal Club Lounge. Restaurants and shopping were excellent in the area, and we dropped by the new Distillery District to buy chocolate at the new SOMA chocolatemaker - delish.

The King Eddy hotel has been a fixture in the Toronto landscape for decades, and it's good to see that Starwood has continued to maintain the quality service and rooms. From the moment you enter the ornate, elegant lobby, you really are transported to a distant realm, away from the modern hustle and bustle of Toronto. And that's the main piece of advice about this hotel. This is an \"old-school\" hotel, with hanging chandeliers, Victorian-era sofas and chairs, and valets in tuxedos. If you're looking for a modern, clean feel in a Toronto hotel, you're better off in a Westin or Hilton or 1 King West. In particular, the furnishings in the room, while clean and professional, did feel like something from a Jane Austen novel. If you're just looking for a place to sleep, this could be bothersome. That said, with the exception of a flaky television, the room was fully functional and comfortable. The bathroom was large and spacious, with good clean facilities. The view from my room was nothing great -- the hotel is surrounded by skyscrapers. I did not have a car. This may be the largest weakness at this hotel, as downtown parking is at a very high premium. You are close to subway and streetcars everywhere, and taxi rides are relatively inexpensive, so a vehicle is not totally necessary. Being right off King Street, you are in the heart of downtown, and in the midst of the Financial District. The King Street Entertainment area is just a few blocks to the West, and Eaton Centre and Yonge-Dundas square is a few blocks north. Don't wander too far East -- while it is better than in previous years, you should keep your wits about you if you head East of Church St. Everywhere else is perfectly safe. I really liked this hotel, as it really did transport me to a different time in the past. But you've got to be in that type of mood.

We initially booked a basic room at the conference rate... I then received an email from Le Meridien with an offer to \"upgrade to a Deluxe Suite including access to our Club Lounge\"...and for an additional $50 per night, I took the upgrade. It turns out the upgrade to the Deluxe Suite on the Club level was totally worth it! It happened that our anniversary was that same week as the conference, so I felt I should do what I could to make our stay a bit more luxurious and comfortable. When we arrived we found a plate of complimentary chocolate covered strawberries in our room (we were offered champagne as well -- but declined since we don't drink alcohol.) Main reasons the upgrade to the Club Level was worth it: - The added luxury of having personal robes, turn down service, large bathroom and closets. - The bottles of water! My wife is always buying bottled water when we travel but we didn't have to purchase a single one this trip! they provided two free bottles every night in our room, in addition, we could always grab extra water from the workout room as well as the Club Lounge - FREE INTERNET with the upgrade! with hotels charging so much per day for internet, this made the upgrade worth almost by itself - All-hours access to the workout room, even in the middle of the night - The free continental breakfast in the mornings in the Club Lounge: pastries, breads, fruit, lox & bagels, tasty oatmeal, several kinds of juices - The Free light meal in the Club Lounge served every day in the late afternoon: dips and veggies, hummus & bread, crackers & cheese, bruschetta, juices, tea & coffee - Access to the Club Lounge in general: a great place to chill, I had a meeting with a colleague and just took him up with me to the Club Lounge during the afternoon meal, we snacked, drank our drinks, sat in nice chairs - Access to the business center located in the Club Lounge The cool thing about the King Edward also is that its quite a historic hotel... its neat to be in such a glamorous place and imagine what it must've been like back in the day.. One (slight) issue I had with the place was its location...

My bid of $80 a night was accepted (looks like it could have been lower around $65 according to other reviews). After this experience, I learned one trick for bidding. To make sure you get the lowest price that would be accepted, make sure to go to tripadvisor, do a search for the city you want to stay in and the word \"priceline\" in your search. You'll get a bunch of reviews with people telling you what they bid. Using those numbers, you'll get an idea what would be accepted by Priceline. Anyway, back to the hotel, like any first timers, I was worried after reading the reviews for this hotel. But I got my fingers crossed hoping things will work out well and they did. For eighty dollars a night, we can't really complain. And there wasn't much to complain about except for 2 things: 1) we had to wait an hour before our room was ready, and that was only we nagged the front desk. We arrived for check-in at 3:30. They kept telling us the room would be ready in 20 minutes. After the third time, my husband got upset and that was when they really called up housekeeping and got them to start cleaning the room. 2) None of the doormen were very friendly. No \"hello\", no \"welcome\".. but whatever.. I didn't really care. The room itself was big with high ceiling. It was clean. The bathroom was good size. It's just like any other hotel for its normal price range. It's right in the middle of downtown Torronto, one block to a Catholic Church, 2-3 blocks a farmer's market (St. Laurence Market--which I didn't really care for). 6 blocks to Eaton shopping center. We never ran out of hot water in our bathroom nor did we think the water pressure was low like other reviewers had said. I had a bath full of hot water to soak in every night. But I think we were lucky because we met another young couple in the elevator and they mentioned their hot water ran out. We also received a notice saying that they would have some one to come and fix the hot water/electrical problems in the building. I don't understand why people were complaining about the cost of meals, valet parking, internet connection, and of the minibar drinks. It's a hotel! Any of such thing is expensive! What did they expect?! And from my experience at staying at 4-star hotels, I had always been charged for internet connection, so I'm pretty use to the charge.. No complaints from me here. I also learned that $40 valet parking is actually comparable to any downtown parking. Because we went to Chicago the next week and the hotel we stayed at hat valet parking for $51, self parking was $36. That puts things into perspective, doesn't it.

We walked to Rogers Centre for a blue jays game and it took about 15 minutes tops. 2nd thing is this hotel is very elegant. As soon as you walk through the front door, you are blown away by how beautiful it is inside the lobby. It really is a grand lobby... Some reviews have mentioned that they felt they weren't treated well because they booked through Priceline.. I was expecting to receive the same treatment.. but we weren't treated like second class customers. The front staff were very nice.. and we were given a nice Deluxe King Non-Smoking room.. The room was very large.. Room #623... maybe a little too large... and very clean! Bed was so nice and comfy... Very nice marble bathroom... What I really liked about the bedroom was that when we were in there, we felt like we were transported to another time period.. It wasn't the typical cookie cutter hotel rooms. The bedroom was very elegant.. A few things that could have made it better.. the walls are kind of thin.. you can easily hear everything that goes on in the hallways.. also the sheets were not tucked in really well on the mattress so after sleeping, the sheets were falling off the bed and exposing the mattress. The TV is in an awkward position.. Kind of hard to watch TV while lying on the bed. Also.... if you don't want to pay 40$ for valet parking at the hotel.. just park one block east on King Street East at City Park. It's opened 24 hours and the price is much cheaper than valet parking.

Having been to Toronto numerous times before, I have stayed in several hotels in the city including the Fairmont, Intercontinental, Grand, Sheraton, etc. As are most people at this time, we were trying to save a buck by booking a 4-star hotel via Priceline. We were very happy to find that our offer of $51/night was accepted. We then looked up and saw it was the King Edward Royal Meridien. Knowing the Starwood reputation we were looking forward to a nice hotel with the history and luxury appointed with this hotel. Upon arrival the staff treated us as if we were not even human beings. I was carrying a couple bags and struggled to get them up the stairs as the bellman in the front looked at me...was it because I hadn't shaved in a day so I was a little scruffy? Was it because I was in my comfortable clothing not my shirt and tie? Or was it just because they didn't care. In any case, we arrived at noon and asked if there was any way that we could check in early (before 3pm) to which they said \"no rooms are ready for you\". I even said it was my birthday and they shrugged it off as if I said I was wearing a black shirt. We came back after heading over to the market at roughly 2:40pm to which we were told...nope no rooms ready yet. Ironically though they magically were able to check in people at 3pm. Why not just tell the truth, we don't want you in the room at any time before 3pm (obviously in a more professional manner) rather than lie to your face...well rather lie to the screen as they wouldn't even look you us the face. The front desk staff was just as unaccommodating as the bellman at the front door. Honestly, I seriously have had better treatment and more enjoyable experiences when stopping on a road trip in the middle of the night at a Comfort Inn out in the middle of nowhere. At least there they were pleasant, accommodating, helpful and seemed to care. The only thing going for this hotel is the rooms are very large and the one to which we stayed had a nice view. Additionally, it is in a nice location in the city. Next was the harassment by the security guard. My wife and I went out for a nice night on the town and came back and were looking at some of the nice things in the lobby when we were stopped by a security guard. Now we each had 1 drink, were not loud, not crazy but he got in front of us between the elevators and where we were standing and asked for my ID, then when I asked \"what?\" he said I need your room card to be sure you belong here. Mind you, the 4 young kids walking in the hotel with candy, ice cream dripping, etc were not asked for a thing! When I called to the front desk and asked if the security always harassed their guests, they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. I explained the situation and he said, well on the weekends after 1:30am we check anyone/everyone in the hotel...so if you want to go outside of your room in the evening be prepared to feel like you are a hardened criminal and are going to be profiled and harassed no matter how nice you are dressed (yes I had a sports coat on!). All that said, I honestly would have to tell anyone who is thinking of paying full price to not even think about staying here.

The room was lovely and large. I had a great view of the CN Tower. After the check in episodel I was just pleased to be in. I found the rooms very comfortable, great bed and nice and quiet. The room was kept nicely by the cleaners and I was very happy overall. I travel quite a bit with work and this is the first place I really slept in well.

I can recommend the Beer Bistro across the road as a close place to eat, but within 5 or so minutes there are plenty of places to go out and eat rather than in the hotel (which I didn't eat anything in at all) I would defiantly recommend the CN Tower for dinner and the distillery district.

Booked this hotel as there was a third-off discount on Expedia, otherwise wouldn't usually stay in such an expensive place! It was a nice hotel overall.

The hotel is in an old fashioned style though, which some people might not like. My friend and I were given rooms without a view (only looking across to the other side of the hotel) to begin with but my air con stopped working and, as you couldn't open the window and it was pretty humid, you really needed the AC. I called reception to tell them about the problem and they sent a maintenance guy. When he eventually turned up, after first going to the wrong room and me having to call them back, he just looked at it for 2 mins and said it'll be fine if I just wait a bit for it to cool down. I knew it wouldn't work but it was getting late and I just wanted to sleep so left it till the next day. I told them at reception in the morning that it was actually broken and could they sort something out for me. When I came back in the afternoon they said they'd move me to another room. This 2nd room had a view, only over some buildings, but it was ok (and had working AC!). Here the hair dryer made some screeching noise that sounded really dodgy so I just used the one in my friend's room instead. Couldn't be bothered to complain again! Breakfast was a bit expensive for us (even on expenses -my boss gets grumpy having to pay for anything!) so we walked a couple of minutes and found a cafe.

That said, we were extremely pleased with the hotel and its service. We were checked in quickly by a fantastic King Edward employee named Julius. We were in no way treated like \"Priceline guests\"- the hotel staff was welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay. Our room was on the 14th floor, and overlooked the East side of Toronto. It was quiet, the hallways were bright and well kept, and the room accommodations were lovely: nice bedding, a large lounge chair, clean and bright bathroom, bathrobe, etc. The hotel elevators were not working well during our stay, but hotel staff did their best to call them as they were needed and to aid in the repair process in a timely way. To save money, we avoided the in-house restaurants and ate breakfast at Tim Horton's, which is less than a block away. There is also a small restaurant across the street called the \"Melting Pot\" that serves a bacon/eggs/toast breakfast for less than $4. We parked about 3 blocks East from the hotel on King St. (sorry- can't remember the cross road!) at an underground parking center, and saved a good deal of money leaving our car there during our stay. The hotel location is excellent. The hotel is in easy walking distance to the Harbourfront, and the city is easy to navigate from King St. or Younge St. The financial district is very inviting, with many restaurants and activities nearby.

The dining facilities and the food itself stand out. Sunday Brunch in its historical dining room is an unbelievable array of eating pleasures and the setting makes one feel special. This hotel, because of its staff and their guest attitude truly make the facility a home away from home - a standout in a world-class city...A&B, Elora ON", "Date": "February 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "king city, ontario", "Title": "\u201cwonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "sweettooth84", "ReviewID": "UR13679391", "Content": "My husband and I were given a weekend at the King Edward in Toronto by my father-in-law.

No having to talk to the Manager or any other nonsense.

We visited Toronto, Niagara, Vancouver, Jasper, Field, Lake Louise and then Calgary. The Meridien is an extremely nice hotel. Cleanliness, spaciousness, luxury and excellent service are all very important to us and we couldn't fault this hotel at all. We only stayed the one night but the check in and out went without a hitch, bags were delivered to our room, service in the bar and at the desk was prompt and friendly. Very nice. Definitely 5 star. We would recommend very highly. And the location is nice and central too. We spent the Saturday afternoon, evening and Sunday in Toronto. Unfortunately the restaurant at the top of the CN tower is very busy and so when we went along in the afternoon on Saturday the earliest table we could get was at 10pm, so we had a long time to kill in the evening along the waterfront. It's very nice, with beautiful views and the odd band or musical entertainer. Mostly though it's just nice for a slow walk watching the boats. The Tower is great, and the restaurant is very nice. Don't dress too casually though. The photo opportunity when you go into the restaurant is rather poor - they just paste your photo onto a background picture of the restaurant so I'd save my money and ask someone to take an actual photo inside. Food was excellent - one of the nicest steaks my husband said, and my fish was superb. Main course with a little wine was CAD$130. We spent the whole of Sunday walking around Toronto. Gloriously hot day with a dog fair to start, then a visit to the first Post Office, off to China Town then up to the University, Royal Ontario Museum and a little shopping. For those not familiar with Canada it's a little odd because the shops are mostly underground - but once you've found that out it's pretty convenient because the shopping malls just stretch along under the main roads. We walked all day, but that was quite tough in the heat and if we went back we'd probably use the bus more.

Myself and my family (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed there for one night - we had a 2 double bed room which was about 360 square feet and had a nice long bathroom with room for more than one person. The beds were very comfortable with very nice linen and a great duvet. There were foot couches at the end of each bed in light dusty blue (nice colour) and two decent sitting chairs whose colour (dark dark green) left much to be desired. There were two closets in the room that were both decent sized for a hotel stay, a flat screen TV, a work desk, two full bath robes and three windows - one had a partial view of Lake Ontario, the other two out over a parking lot, and some minor streets. The hotel has an amazing lobby with lots of detail and great staff - right from the valet to check-in to cleaning staff and restaurant, the staff were friendly, helpful, had the right amount of grace and were empowered to deal with requests. The public hotel spaces were in good shape - fitness area small (older hotel) but clean and good equipment present. The public washrooms were clean, inviting and well designed with privacy in mind. The bathroom was long - had the commode then the shower/tub combination than the vanity area - great lighting, the vanity area was a touch on the small side and had one sink. The towels could have been a little thicker and less scratchy. The area is quite nice - lots of good to excellent restaurants, street car line out front, one block walk to the subway and close to the waterfront and right near the Toronto downtown skyscraper scene. The room was in good shape and clean - there were some nicks and dents here and there - nothing significant. The aforementioned green sitting chairs had seen better days though and the foot couches had been banged up in the legs a bit. The bathroom floors, walls, appliances and vanity were all clean - the ceiling looked like a bit of a jerrymandering and could use some finishing work. We were on a package that included valet parking, late check-out and breakfast for two of us. The hotel does not have a pool nor any specific kid-friendly areas in the same way that a Sheraton or large Westin would have but we were quite happy with the property and loved the easy walk out the lobby to the streetcar line.

Next, the hotel itself shows it's age. The historic internior has been polished up, but there's only so much polishing you can do to make an old place look somewhat newer, cleaner and more inviting. You can walk 2 blocks West to catch the King station subway. There's always a taxi waiting around to the corner to service hotel guests, and you can catch the King Street streetcar 1/2 a block away from the hotel's entrance. There's a handful of good restaurants 1 block South on Wellington and several more if you venture 2 blocks South on Church.

When I said that we were checking in I was asked if we needed help with our luggage. Check in was fast and the desk clerk was very friendly. Our room was ready even though it was only 1:00 pm. We were taken to a Club Level junior suite and we were very surprised at how large the room was. We were fortunate to have a corner room so it gave it a very airy feeling. The room was absolutely immaculate. I made a point of checking every \"nook and cranny\" after reading some of the reviews. I did call down to housekeeping and requested another robe as there was only one in the room. The amenities in the bathroom were very nice and we found that there was plenty for both of us. The only \"complaint\" that I would have (if I had to have one) is that the television is not very big. Not a big deal for us though since we were not planning on watching much TV anyway. I do admit that the air conditioning was not perfect. That being said, when the AC would have been installed in the hotel it would have been and \"add on\" so therefore it was done in the best way possible. Not a big deal. Housekeeping was fantastic. She saw us bring in a bag of ice for our cooler and immediately said that she could get ice for us. Not only did we not have to pay the $3 she made sure that our cooler stayed full. Very impressed. We definately gave her a little extra. After we unpacked, we went down to speak with the concierge in regards to restaurants for dinner. Brandon recommended the hotel dining room as well as Barberians. Barberians had been recommended to me by various people on the Toronto forum. We decided to stay in the hotel for dinner on Friday night and we were very glad that we did. The food was excellent as was the service. I loved the soup that I had for a starter and mentioned to them that I would really like to have the recipe. The head chef was not in but I was given his e-mail address in order to request the recipe. I will be doing that today. I asked if it would be at all possible to take a couple of servings home with me on Monday and they were more than happy to arrange it. All that I really cared about was the basic soup as there were a number of \"finishing touches\" that was done to it before serving. When we were checking out I was told that the soup was in the fridge waiting for me and did I still want it. Absolutely! I was very surprised to see that I was given enough for 4 servings, all of the extras to go with it as well as being told that there was no charge! Guess what we had for dinner last night?! :D We did not have breakfast while we were there. Since we were on the Club Level we were able to have a light meal in the Club Lounge. It was perfect for us before we went out for the day. We found that all of the staff was very friendly and helpful.

I write this review from the perspective of having spent our Wedding night here - we live in Toronto, and had always wanted to stay at the \"King Eddie\" - it's got such a storied reputation and air of glamour. We booked a room months in advance online, and followed up several times with calls to ensure the room was indeed ready and that yes, this was our wedding night etc etc. and we would be made to feel welcome - they couldn't wait to host us, blah blah blah. Arriving by cab was the first sign things weren't going to go well when the doorman didn't even offer to help myself or my wife,( still in wedding dress!)out of the car. He just . . .stood there. It was wierd. Check in staff was indifferent and obviously wanted to be anywhere rather than working the front desk @ 10:30 PM. We were given our room keys and sent on our way. Not even an eyebrow raised or an acknowledgement that this was indeed a special night for us. We weren't looking for anything special, but we were the only ones in the lobby in wedding attire . . . I guess they just get a lot of weddings, so are pretty indifferent overall. As for the first room (thats right, they mixed up rooms) - we were shown a tiny room overlooking a back street, but, get this - 2 twin beds! On our wedding night. Luckily we'd kept our booking receipt, which clearly stated a king bed. A call downstairs resulting in 15 minutes later a security guard showing up and leading us to another room. No apology, just a curt acknowledgement of an error. The new room, while large, must surely have been slated for a renovation in the next week - tired, faded dusky rose furniture, chipped and cracked armoire, mismatching desk chair - At this point I felt we were surely getting punished for something we'd done in a previous life. It got worse: One would assume with a King bed that there would be amenities for 2. Nope. No dice. There was only one set of towels, one robe, one glass, heck, there was only one bar of soap! The bathroom was cold and extremely dimly-lit, and the ceiling over the shower was actully rotted in places and you could see exposed framework in behind! Extraordinary. One other item of note: If you are planning to arrive late (provided you're even unlucky enough to still be staying here) and you get peckish, by all means make every effort to look for something to eat or drink AWAY from the hotel. Go searching! A pot of tea (4 cups) and 4 peek frean cookies cost us a whopping 29.00! Tea and coffee service wasnt even included! Overall, this hotel seemed to do its very best in consistently disappointing us with its indifference, overpriced room service, messing up with our rooms, and sub-par amenities within the room. If you are looking to stay in downtown Toronto, please please please consider NOT staying at the King Edward. You've been warned! (As an aside, my parents stayed at The Suites at 1 King West just down the street, paid half the price we did, were provided complementary drinks on arrival, full valet service, had in room coffee and tea service, fresh flowers, a full kitchenette with washer/dryer, AND FINALLY a complementary drive to our wedding that afternoon in the hotel's restored 1960 Cadillac! )", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford,UK", "Title": "\u201cStaff let the Hotel down\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5188124", "Content": "I stayed at the Le Royal Meridien King Edward last October for 6 nights.

The concierge was not eager to assist in directing us to the \"place to check our bags\" while we wait to check in. He was without emotion and seemed very bored by us. The room was spacious with high ceilings and appointed very tastefully. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and the shower was wonderful. But that's where it ends! The most rude, unaccomodating staff from the front desk through to the dining room. Two room service experiences were pleasant...attendants were polite and gracious...food was disappointing. There is a fabulous full service spa on the mezzanine level, but don't expect to be told about it. Brochures were not in the room. I stumbled upon the tag board placard that was resting on an easel near the stairs to the mezzanine level. Apparently, there is no relationship between spa owner and hotel. Nonentheless, it is a wonderful amenity that each guest should be made aware of. When I approached the front desk about \"why there wasn't a brochure in the room for the spa\", their response was...\"they're not a part of us.\" Their response led me to believe that there was a bitter battle between the two entities. We checked out today and chose to have breakfast in their dining room. We were greated by Mortisha (not her name, but was her posture). She slithered through the dining room past a dozen of open tables, landing us in the corner between two occupied tables. When our server approached the table I smiled and said good morning and asked how are you today? The server's response, or should I say, reaction was....\"I'M BUSY.\" She stopped me in my tracks, dead! Minutes passed when two diners to my left asked me \"Do you sense a little bit of an attitude here this morning with the service?\" We shared reviews of both our stays and we all summed it up the same...\"HORRIBLE\".

We were in room 893 and the two double beds were quite comfortable. The size of the room and the amenities were what I expected for this price range. I too objected to having to pay $15 a day for internet access. Given the room rate, I think it should have been included. The fitness room had a weight machine and several treadmills - adequate, but nothing special. Use of their sauna requires a reservation and a fee of ten dollars so I did not get around to trying it. Again, it would be nice if this were a little more accesible and included in the room rate. One thing that I have not seen mentioned is the artwork. There is an art gallery on the ground floor. Paintings and sculpture by their artists are on display in the lobby, the restaurant and the hotel's first floor windows. The quality is good and it adds a lot to the atmosphere. Another amenity that is somewhat unusual in its format is the bar. One wall is windowed and faces King street. The space is furnished with comfortable chairs arranged in living room configurations rather than restaurant-style tables. It reminded me of an English club and, from what I could see from the door, I had the expectation of finding elderly Etonians dribbling gin on their ties. But, when I actually got around to checking it out, I liked sitting in there nursing a drink and watching people walk by outside. The patrons ran the gamut from a trio of Jamaicans in dreadlocks to a successful-looking, 60-ish couple who were dressed like they just came from a Republican fund-raiser. The restaurant was fine but pricey with breakfast ringing in at $100US for three people. The artwork definitely added to the appeal of the room. The service was consistently polite but reserved, which seemed the norm in Toronto. The pressured effusiveness that has become the US standard doesn't seem to exist and, by comparison, the matter of fact service seemed almost grudging at times. But I think that is a perception distorted by the manic US style that I'm used to. The people at the front desk seemed to be chummier than the other staff. The front door is half a block from a subway entrance so it was easy to get to the trains and the underground warren of shops and passageways that goes on for blocks and blocks and can be a pleasant relief from walking in the weather.

We spent two nights in Toronto. One night we did sit in the bar, and had a bite to eat and a couple of drinks. The lighting was low and there are many places to sit privately, so it was intimate. Everything was great. The King Edward is close to so much shopping and quite a few little restaurants. You can pretty much walk to wherever you want to go. We did not use the valet service so I can't comment on that. I did notice there was self parking everywhere. You could self park for less than 1/2 the price of the valet, if you are money conscious or don't like to call for your car every time you want to use it.

Efficient and friendly desk staff. Quiet, even subdued, ambiance, as one might expect from this type of hotel (no \"hip\" here - although a group of youngish entrepreneurs was having its meeting here during my stay, and elevator conversations suggest they really loved the place...). During my three-day stay, the elevators - there are five of them - were generally on the slow side (and at least one always kept mysteriously stopping on the sixth floor). My room was spacious and comfortable enough, with a queen-size bed, in a very traditional, English-style decor (dark woods, floral fabrics); one basically viewless window couldn't be opened (of interest to those of us who do not want air-conditioning all the time). Too bad there was no coffee maker (or CD player - the clock radio was pretty so-so...). Decent size bathroom with window; less-than-great lighting, slow flush and run-of-the-mill fixtures, but spotless.

I was there for 9 nts from Aug.18-27 and there was 3 rooms that my family stayed in. We got the rooms for $65 ea. on priceline and were placed in the twin rooms upon arrival. Two of the rooms are spacious and the 3rd is your average size. For a 4-star hotel it did not live up to its reputation. The lobby is gorgeous but once in the room the beds, furnishings, etc are very basic and bare. Everything in the rooms shows its' age. There was not even a coffeemaker and when I requested it and tea I was charge $5 for the tea bags each time. I did not realize of the charge until check-out. I also called ahead to request a microwave & mini-fridge and had also mentioned it at check-in. I come back to the room that night and still no microwave/fridge. I called several times the next morning and finally got them delivered to my room the next evening. Housekeeping is spotty. The whole time I was there we only receive shampoo in the bathroom. On the day of check-out the housekeeper placed shampoo, conditioner, and liquid soap. I thought the hotel did not provide them so I had gone out and bought them on my own. There are cards that you can place on your bed so the linings are not changed out. However, on days when I did not place the card on the bed the sheets are still not changed out. Two days before checkout I come back in the evening to find the door to my room open. The front desk blamed it on housekeeping but did not offer an apology. Thank goodness my family and I did not bring anything of value. The valet parking is pretty bad too. It cost $30/day but actually adds up to $40/day including tips each time you go in/out. They say to call ahead in your room for the car and to give them 15-30 mins. but each time I called for the car the line is busy or I get placed on hold. The one time I got thru I waited my 15 minutes then went down to the lobby. There I waited some more until I question the valet guy and he said no had one told him. This is not the kind of service I expect from a 4-star hotel. Overall I am disappointed with the service. The only nice thing about this hotel is location.", "Date": "September 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, N.Y.", "Title": "\u201cgreat location and Royal Club worth it\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2496311", "Content": "This is a great location if you want to be near everything yet out of the chaos of downtown ---a few blocks from St. Lawrence marketplace, one of the best food markets/eating places anywhere - also walking distance from everything...Rooms fine; somewhat dated but comfortable and good beds.
