People who worked at the hotel were extremely kind. Getting from the center to the hotel takes, for example to Termini, 15 mins walk + 25 mins subway. It's OK if you intend to leave in the morning and come back at the end of the day only. There's also a shuttle bus from 9.15 to 10.15 am and another one in the evening-night until 10.45 pm, which is fine if your plans coincide with the timeline. But if you decide to go back later at night, walking through the industrial area around the hotel may be a bit scary, since it's a dark empty road with no houses around. Room was very clean, but we were put in the disabled adapted room with no shower plate, so the whole bathroom would be flooded whenever we showered and had to lay towels on the floor to be able to enter again without wetting our feet. We were also next to the cafeteria, so at 7am it was very noisy with all the people having breakfast. We could also hear everything from the room next to ours. Breakfast was VERY limited. All sweets, sweets, sweets. Only 1 type of bread, very chewy and hard to eat, only toasts available were industrial ones on package and only one type of coffee (filter/American coffee) with no option of expresso. Excluding drinks, I guess the only non sweets that were available was the cheese, ham, bread, toast, butter, corn flakes, muesli and natural yoghurt. We'd think twice about being hosted at that hotel again. But it ain't the worst hotel, though. Environment is good, service is good, rooms are nice and clean, free Internet available. Location and breakfast were the most negative aspects. And also ain't a bad idea of getting hungry at night, since there's no kitchen available at the hotel (at least at 9.30pm there wasn't) and there's no one near enough to go get something to eat.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTravellers beware\u201d", "Author": "Kevin M", "ReviewID": "UR120358444", "Content": "My wife and I accompanied by 2 other couples arranged a stay at the Park Hotel Ginevra.

Clean, quiet and with very good service. Location is really a subject, though, since it is found way far from the historical center or the closest metro station, but you can either use the free shuttle bus to Metro station Battistini or walk for 5 minutes and get bus No 889 that gets you to Metro Station Cornelia. The morning itierearies of the bus are very helpful (09.30, 09.50, 10.10) but the night ones really don't come in handy, since they begin at 21.15 while the metro closes at 21.00. So, be careful and organize your transportation thoroughly, especially if walking -a lot- is really an important issue for you. Apart from that, we were very satisfied from our option! Breakfast sufficient, staff very helpful (speaking english), rooms clean (we had our towels changed every 2 days), TV, safety box (no mini bar though), free WiFi connection (on demand) and quiet environment that really gave us some very relaxing hours of sleep that would take us through the very demanding and exhausting daytime with all the sightseeing.

More like a motel with the size of it but very well priced considering its in Rome. The rooms are just about big enough although the bathroom is tiny, enough room for the essentials and that's it! Breakfast is basic but good. Service is friendly and efficient. I had problems with the safe not locking and it was soon sorted. To get to the hotel I'd recommend the 45 Euro shuttle taxi that they can organise if you email them, they need about 2 days notice for this. Its the same price whether you fly into Fuimicino or Ciampino. The big downside of this hotel is the time it takes to get in and out of the heart of Rome. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the nearest Metro (and nearest restaurant). You have to go up and down the hill to the hotel and the route is not exactly well lit at night! You then have another 20 minutes to get to the centre of Rome on the Metro. Its not the end of the world but certainly makes it a drag if you want to come back to the hotel after a days sightseeing, freshen up and then go out again in the evening. However, this is certainly reflected in the price, if you want to be a short stroll from the Trevi fountain etc be prepared to pay 2 or 3 times a night what this hotel is charging. Overall, I'd recommend it if you only have a day or so in Rome. If you want the 4 or 5 day full experience with Rome by night you would probably get fed up with the 'commuting'. The comments on here about the hotel shuttle service are also very true, this next to useless because of the times.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cPerfect outpost for Rome exploration\u201d", "Author": "NWWildTurtle", "ReviewID": "UR115909873", "Content": "Located off the road circling Rome (GRA off Uscita 2) the Park Hotel was a quiet base for our exploration of Rome. The Battistini Metro station is only a few blocks away - walkable or there is a morning and evening shuttle - that takes you directly to the center of the city. Rome is expensive, there's no way around it. The room rate was \"city\" reasonable, and included continental breakfast, in-room wifi, and covered parking. Located in a primarily residential area, the hotel is quiet at night. There are no restaurants in the immediate area - some seemed to be near the metro - but you're in Rome, so go into the city to eat. There is a small bar in the hotel with coffee and what looked like the potential for mixed drinks, although nobody was partaking while we were there. There is a rooftop patio for those interested in getting some sun or relaxing in the evening. The one downside goes back to the location - because it isn't in an area filled with hotels, the access street could be a little iffy to walk if in the dark. The shuttle runs to and from the metro stop in the evening between 9 and 10, and I would recommend using it if you're getting back that late from the city. We walked in the early morning and evening and were fine. The airport is only about 20 minutes from the hotel, which made our car return and departure easy.
