We supposed to stay 3 nights with corporate rate (Sunday to Wednesday) but we decided to add one more night from Saturday which I booked from booking.com for EUR 90.88 weekend rate. Location, like others said, it's very far from historic areas (Sultanahmet). It cost us 90 Lira (EUR 40) by taxi at night to get here from the Ataturk airport. When we arrived, we informed the reception staff that we would stay until Wednesday but he said that the corporate rate (EUR 144/night included breakfast) is only for 1 person and we have to pay EUR 30 extra per night for 2 occupancy. Usually 5 star hotels will never charge you extra for double occupancy, as long as only 1 person who get the breakfast (we used to stay at Hyatt) but he insisted that we have to pay whether I take the breakfast or not. The next morning, we decided to cancel the remaining stays since we thought it's not worth to pay additional EUR 90 in total and I still have to pay for the taxi to the historic parts everyday because there is no other transportation, not even a shuttle from the hotel to the nearest metro bus station. And with the awful traffic in Istanbul, I don't think I could stand it. We finally move to other hotel in Sultanahmet area and we glad we did it! One more thing, my husband left his IPhone charger in the room when we check out, and the next day he came back to the hotel and asked about this, but they could not find it.

I must admit I was prepared for a let down- the typical \"I could be anywhere Marriot vanilla hotel in place from Key West to Athens\"- but I was surprised, pleasantly, and continue to be surprised. I write the Title having stayed in Marriots in almost every US state, Tokyo, London, Germany, Amsterdam and Greece (and probably other Marriotts that my brain cells cannot summon). So what makes it special? Well the location is about a 10 minute (maybe 15 minute) ride from the Water Taxis that will take you straight to old town docking just in front of the \"New\" (new for 1700 that is) Mosque. So it is very convenient to Old and New Town. Second the facility itself- I thought it was new (maybe 6 months old) but it is three years old- but the housekeeping and maintenance (I assume) are so good that it appears as if it opened a few months prior. Rooms- are spacious (for Turkey or Europe) desks and sitting areas comfortable. Executive lounge is the best- with Asian Views two or three klicks away from the Bosphorus. Room are ultra quite- Marriott put a lot of thought into how they are arranged on a floor and the materials are absolutely soundproof! Staff is eager, and I mean eager to please. Had to send my laundry out (two week trip- one of those kind of trips) and the laundry returned the same night, beautifully packaged in a basket and on top was an envelope containing the 60 liras I had left stuffed on one or more of my pockets. Restaurant and Bar are beautiful - service for breakfast excellent. One lunch and it was super (so far). Health Club is co-sponsored by Johns Hopkins- state of the art- better than the club I belong to in the states- with trainers, kids programs (also a kids program if you are eating dinner I failed to mention) and every Pilate, Yoga, Stretching class, course you could imagine. Pool beautifully done with the bottom of the pool tiled in different shades of blue representing a crescent shape. Lobby excellent for meetings- conference rooms large and modern.
