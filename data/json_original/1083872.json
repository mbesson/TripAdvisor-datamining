I feel that this place is even better than Fraser Suites. I chose Ascott over Fraser this time round so that I can have a basis for comparison and boy, I've found my favorite service apartment in Singapore. The reception was great, fast and hassle free. It took me less than 10 minutes and I'm already in the room allocated to me. The room smells really good, is really clean and has symphony music when you entered the room. The amenities in the room is good too. There's a washing machine with dryer (together with detergent), microwave oven, cooker and hood, dish washer. Basically, a well equipped kitchen. The kitchen was fully utilized by me because my partner has food allergy so we always eat in. One negative point was one of the cooker was faulty and I'm left with the smallest one. It's really inconvenient. You have the option of closing the door that separates the kitchen and the room so that the room won't smell. The room is huge as compared to normal hotels in Singapore. The room comes with a working desk too. I love the toilet the most. It's huge. There's rain shower, normal shower and a tub. There is a glass panel separating the bath tub area and the bed room, if you're worried about privacy, you can always pull the blinds. They have this awesome infinity pool on the 19th story and when I was there, I had the pool to myself and my partner had the whole gym to himself. He said the gym had really high end equipment. The view from the 19th floor was fantastic, especially at night. The Jacuzzi is on the 21st floor, you've got to climb up a stairway before reaching. The offices beside the hotel will be able to see you in the jaccuzi if you don't mind. It is near the famous food place called lao pat sat. Sells really good food.

At the time of construction it was the tallest building in Singapore and is a fabulous example of colonial twenties / thirties architecture. Today it is rather dwarfed by the towers of the surrounding business district. It is down towards Marina Bay, in the central business district and opposite Raffles Place MTS, so it is well located. At the time of booking I hadn't realised it was an apartment-hotel. But this turned out to be a bit of good luck. The room was sizeable, great bedroom area, with a small but acceptable desk and seating area, huge bathroom and a small galley kitchen. All very well appointed, I wanted for nothing in the galley kitchen, even had a washer-dryer, and the fridge was enormous. The bathroom is a delight with a wet-room comprising shower and bath. Plenty of storage space. Breakfast is available and there is a small bar, but the expectation I think is you self-cater or go out. Breakfast was buffet in style but not hugely exciting and there aren't many tables. That said service was helpful and friendly. There is an 'on-roof' pool and gym. I used the pool which was great if slightly unnerving as it is a complete glass construction that looks out across the neighbouring towers. But a nice place to relax. My only reservation is I had significant problems with sending emails via the hotels internet system. Email was showing as sent but was never received. This is not a problem I have ever experienced before. That said the hotel's IT support did their best to resolve things. I've had correspondence with the hotel management and they have been helpful and responsive so I can't do anything other than praise their attitude. I didn't have any problems with Internet access and email seemed to arrive ok, so it may be I was just 'unlucky', but might be an idea to cc your self on email sends so you know they've been sent. Staff were very friendly and helpful, and there is excellent maintenance. I received a visit from the maintenance engineer to repair a light which I was completely unaware had failed. Demonstrates a great pro-active attitude by housekeeping staff.

The hotel is in the Singapore CBD, but about a 10 minute walk to the Marina Bay Sands and associated shops etc. Service was impeccable. Reception was happy to print a document for me free, which you won't always find. Free wifi was included with my package - it wasn't obvious at first what the tiny scraps of paper with random codes on them were for - which is always nice. The room, a studio premier twin, was spacious and quiet (well, the air conditioning made a bit of noise but nothing disturbing). It was well fitted out with quality appliances in the kitchenette (which I didn't really use), a clothes washer/drier, and even a Bose sound system (no iPod dock, though). The bed was very hard - I like that - and for a single, 4 foot wide is pretty big! The pool on the 19th floor was quite something - glass walls all round, and a good view through gaps in the buildings to the bay. Tall office building all round though so you can't help but feel you are on full view to all the adjoining office workers during the day! The building had a nice feel to it, it had a bit of character, unlike lots of concrete and glass towers. The train station entry just outside the door was very handy (trains every 3.5 minutes, wow...). Complaints? Nothing major. When I checked in about 10 pm, I asked if there was anywhere nearby where I could buy a local mobile SIM card. The reception desk directed me to \"the seven eleven next door\" but I was unable to find this. (Hint, later exploration reveals there is no seven eleven next door - there is one in the underpass on the way to the MRT station, though! Ended up buying a Singtel SIM from a Singtel shop though, as iPhone micro SIMs are harder to find. Taxi from the airport was $27 Singaporean, I think this varies widely with the type of taxi and whether you pay by card or not. It was a 18 minute trip.

It does not have room service or a dedicated concierge (though the front desk staff are very helpful). The best part is that despite missing only a few services and having superior rooms, the Ascott is usually cheaper than comparable hotels.

You also get free bottled water and some soda! The gym is small but well equipped, and the pool is an amazing large rooftop glass-walled design that makes you feel like you're swimming in an aquarium.

If you're a tourist, it's slightly removed, but still within walking distance from core tourist areas like Boat Quay, the Esplanade, and the Marina Bay Sands.

Rooms: If you're looking for five star, then you really do get it with the overall ambience and design of the rooms. The beds are super comfy. The room offers all the mod cons expected in a self contained 5 star unit and more - huge flat screen TV, espresso maker, Microwave, desk, lots of cupboard space and washing machine/dryer (note: it's a combo so give yourself a good 3 hour turnaround time). The bathrooms are very plush with wall to floor granite, separate bath, rain shower, lovely l'occitane products. Hotel: They have really managed to keep the old world charm when upgrading this place. The only thing to note is the musky smell of the corridors. It's not unusual, especially coming from Bangkok, but should note as I am a little touchy on the nose when it comes to smoking in hotels etc. But it didn't effect me that much. Staff: Always courteous and helpful. Nothing was ever a problem. They're very attentive, so if you're looking around, they'll make an effort to assist. Pool/Gym: Pool was pretty cool. But just a pool to cool off in. The Gym was nothing to rave about. We are gym goers so didn't find it adequate enough. But if you just want to do a couple of exercises or cardio, then it's fine. Nearby: La Pa Sat one block away which is open to late - great for a snack if you arrive back to the hotel hungry late evenings. MRT across the road made it very accessible to all the other locations. We only had one day so chose shopping at Bugis Junction - covered air-con and street complex with cineplex, fresh groceries, restaurants and lots of cool clothing bargains. Then Clarke Quay for dinner. That was more expensive than I thought it would be but the atmosphere was upbeat and fun with some outdoor bars and some indoor night clubs. The Marina Bay Sands and city flyer walking distance or short taxi ride. Cons: I wouldn't normally base my decision to stay at a hotel by what they offer for breakfast, but it was not 5 star. It wasn't the quality that was the problem, it was the variety. Basically they don't have a kitchen so it was a very small buffet of cold food. Of course a toaster, but just white bread. couple of cereals, some cold meat, boiled eggs, muffins and fruit. Coffee/Tea and Juice. The only reason I'm complaining about that is we spent more money on accommodation for final romantic weekend to end our holiday than we did for 4 days at other 5 star hotels in Thailand, where we travelled for 3 weeks. We wanted to be pampered and it was just disappointing. No views from the studio rooms, but we only ever sleep and rest so didn't miss it.

No one ever greets you \"welcome\" or \"Good Morning.\" They use the Concierge as a working office. They seem simply too busy to notice any complaints by customers. The staffs were ever so rude. Made me wonder why they would bother staying in the hospitality industry. I have made many suggestions and provided feedback during my stay for one month. I was trying to constructive. However, I was punished by the staff for complaining. They gave me a dirty look every time they saw me, standing behind the Concierge desk--hoping to threaten me?? I am quite impressed though about how strong the ties were amongst the staffs--clearly they are protecting one another. But this is not a spirit of the hospitality industry. The doorman/ bell boys were never to be seen outside of the door. They stay in a nice cool air-conditioned environment behind the Concierge with Concierge staff gossiping the customers. I was puzzled by how no one seems to manage this hotel at all. But then I realized this hotel is NOT owned by a hotelier, but owned by Capital Land--a property developer in Singapore. The cultures are different here. I said repeatedly to the management in writing, what is the point of spending so much money to impress the customers with the fine linens and impressive bathrooms, when they cannot even provide a simple services? When you need any service, no one is ever around. The only thing worked was the Housekeeping's cleaning services. Nothing ever works around there.

Completed in 10th December 1955 with an Art-Deco finish, the building was a prominent landmark of the Singapore skyline during the 1950s. Crowned with a stainless steel \u2018wedding cake\u2019 and clad in black marble, this historical structure still retains the grandeur of the Old Singapore. Although the Asia Insurance Company no longer resides in this building, the A.I Building remained as a significant landmark in Singapore\u2019s Building History when it overtook Cathay Building upon completion. It was a sign of the rapid development that was to engulf Singapore. I had the opportunity to stay over in this urban getaway due to a friend\u2019s birthday being held there. Being a fan of things nostalgic and historical, the Ascott Raffles Place is a place I would love to live in. The receptionists and security guards were very friendly and polite, marking a pleasant start to the Ascott Raffles Place experience. From the earlier enquires via email and face to face, I was satisfied with the service. The lobby area has a bar for the residents and guests alike to chill out and munch on light snacks as well as a lounge area to chat or just to spend some time in the classy environment. An attempt to instil some art into this building can be seen in modern sculpture and paintings decorating the walls around the hotel. Old photographs of Singapore link the historical significance of this building to Singapore\u2019s heritage. The internet price of this 75 Square Meter Room is 430++ SGD, and Citibank card holders get to book it online for about 406++ SGD. The toilet was gorgeous too with toiletries complemented by L\u2019Occitane products and a big bath tub to spend our time away with the soothing waters. Sound was contained within the room quite effectively only loud booming music or extremely loud crowds can be heard along the corridor. Beyond the suite, one can also do some work out in the Gym. The Swimming Pool, measuring 1.2m high is more of relaxation rather than serious swimming. Nonetheless the experience would be interesting as would be able to see the city in the pool through its transparent glass walls. After a nice work out at the gym or a good swim, you could chill out at the Residents\u2019 Lounge area and sip on coffee as you read magazines or chat with your friends. If that is not enough, head upwards to the 21st storey and enjoy the Jacuzzi or vista the Ascott Raffles has to offer during the day and night with views of Raffles Place, partial views of Marina Bay and the harbour. Dining is being catered for by the in-house Julien Bompard Restaurant, you could choose to be lazy and just order via room service or make your way down to the restaurant, located on the second storey for a meal. However, be prepared to pay quite a bit for the meal. Here is a preview of what is on the Snack Menu that can be found in the rooms, you have the Beef Burger with Fries going for about 22++ SGD, Chicken Consomm\u00e9 with Herbs for 12++ SGD, Tiramisu for 16++ SGD or you could request for their Tapas, ala-carte items by calling them. We only tried the breakfast items, because it is not cheap. Throughout our one night stay at the Ascott Raffles Place, there are a few points that I thought might provide some valuable feedback. Firstly, the Lounge area was not maintained often enough, used coffee cups were everywhere in the later part of the day, resulting in an unpleasant environment. Secondly, we had problems with the bathroom facilities, the bathtub cold water tap wasn\u2019t working and the dining area light wasn\u2019t working (but they fixed it after calling them up). Lastly, some of the reception for the TV channels weren\u2019t strong such as KBC and History Channel. Nonetheless, the overnight stay was a great one. The Night View was Beautiful The Room was Great. The people at Ascott Raffles Place were friendly even for the people at Julien Bompard. The Facilities and Amenities were decent. The place is highly accessible via Raffles Place MRT The Location is good. Lau Pa Sat, Market Street Food Centre and Boat Quay is just nearby. The Reservation is not limited to a 7-Day Minimum Outside Catering was allowed. Security is decent as only people with key cards can access the upper floors. Negative Points: the Lounge area was not maintained often enough, used coffee cups were everywhere in the later part of the day, resulting in an unpleasant environment.

Stayed in a studio room and this are my feedbacks. Positive Points: 1. Apartment's safety is ensured as you need your room key to access any level in the building via the elevator. 2. Amazing room equipments and amenities. They have : Washing machine, crockeries for cooking, a good fridge, full set of cutleries (incl. of can openers, bottle openers, peeler), mini sofa, tv, computer table, large bed, wide stylish wash basin in the toilet, separate toilet and bath area, rain shower... Excellent room amenitites really. 3. Good TV channels (Starhub cable TV available. Has Korean channel , HBO and stuff.) 4. AMAZING ESPRESSO machine! I love that very much because I love a good cup of coffee and it's really very easy to make yourself a good cup of thick, authentic espresso! 5. A beautiful pool if it's not crowded with more than 4 people. 6. Well equipped gym. 7. Comfortable rooftop lounging area (no sale of food/drinks) 8. Nice towels provided by the pool for drying off. NEGATIVE POINTS: 1. Upon entering the lobby, there wasn't any security standing at the door or anyone who was willing to help us to carry our stuff. It will be nice if they have someone to offer their service for patrons. 2. The check in staff wasn't very friendly and she made me feel very uncomfortable with her looks when she said, \"1 night?\" Like, what the hell is wrong with that? Can't I stay over in an APARTMENT for JUST ONE NIGHT? She even forgot to return my identity card after filling up the details! I had to remind her. 3. The room is too dim. As my room 's windows are facing another building, we got NO SUNLIGHT at all. Basically, with the blinds down, we probably will never know what time of the day is it. 4. Instruction manual for washing machine will be good. 5. No supermart anywhere nearby. Closest eating area will be LAU PA SAT which is a good 10 min walk away. 6. Kitchen area too small. You can't even put a bottle of oil on the table, and cut something on the cutting board. It is extremely cramp. Basically, the whole stay was pleasant except for the 6 negative points I pointed out. Checking out was a breeze although the lady was also not really friendly and just said, \"ok, you can go now.\" Like, what the.... There was nothing like, \"thank you for staying with us.\" Nothing like that. Felt unwelcomed when I meet the staff. I would actually recommend friends to live in another hotel with the same price or lower. This apartment is way too expensive for such service and a dark room.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "2020", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel alternative in Singapore.\u201d", "Author": "wallyQ", "ReviewID": "UR63028893", "Content": "Great Stay at the Ascott.

Don't expect too much of the Bose sound system either.

Meetings after meetings naturally I get tired. guess what? i can't even have a nice sleep as I can hear the cars and buses from the street. I guess their windows aren't sound proof! few hours before checking out I told them to prepare the bill as I will be in a tight schedule before my flight. when i came to the reception they have not prepared my bill! and charged me for breakfasts that should be included with my room rate! when i told the staff about the breakfast, she even argued with me! so i asked for the manager, guess what no manager came! the supervisor corrected my bill but took so long add that to the fact that i will be late for my flight. it was a horrible experience in the ascott. i wont even talk to them or listen to them anymore for all the trouble they caused me.

My wife had to go for her office conference and I accompanied her with our son. Ended up at Ascott Singapore Raffles Place. Since it was my first trip to Singapore and I was not very familiar with the landscape, I did not know much about the location of this hotel. Took a taxi from the airport and it took us a while to explain which hotel we want to go to. We wanted to hold the taxi to finish the check in and for my wife to carry on to her office, and it was a tough one. Even though it is located at a corner, the entry is not convenient for cars to stop and wait. Taxi driver had some hassel in that. The check in time is very strange - 2 PM. For anyone who wants to get in for a meeting, it just does not work. The co-ordinator had asked for an early check in but it took us some time at the reception to work that out. The first thing staff told us was to wait! After a long haul flight, no one wants to hear that! That sorted, we went into the room. Once in the room, it was a very nice experience. Even after having stayed at many hotels (including Ritz), I was pleased with the room. It had all the items needed for a comfortable stay and most of it was state of the art. We stayed there for two days and spent most of the time outside, but was still able to use the pool for some time. The pool is situated on the 19th floor (and is visible even from Marina Bay) and made of glass. Looks extermely nice and flattering but has very low utility value. My son and I did take a dip but it was not one where we could splash around. The gym was nice, small but well equipped. The breakfast at the Julien Bompard restaurant was again very stylish, luxurious, but had a little less utility value. It was a set breakfast, with fixed quantity of fruits, cereal, ham and cheese and breads. Not the nice spread one would want to see and select from. The kitchenette in the room was well stocked with all the cutlery and utensils, but some stock of food options would have made it better. Overall, we had a nice and comfortable stay at Ascott, but found the utility value to be left wanting.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ascott Raffles Place Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1083872-Reviews-Ascott_Raffles_Place_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$261 - $349*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2 Finlayson Green</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">049247</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1083872", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/25/a4/25a4be5d0ca44a3d9659ba08680d31778large.jpg"}}
