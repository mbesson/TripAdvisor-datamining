When we arrived at the hotel to check in, we were told that in fact we would be staying in their \"other wing\" - two doors down. We found ourselves going down some narrow stairs, along a shabby corridor, to our room. I expect it to be a bit cramped due to the extra bed, but was disappointed to find that in fact it was a dedicated double room with an addition TWO beds squeezed in. The bathroom was less than basic, the shower leaked (the floor was soaked by the morning) and the sink was not as clean as it might have been. All night the hairdryer made a \"popping\" sound, and although the beds were comfortable enough, I slept very little. The following morning, we headed upstairs for the \"full english breakfast\" which was included in the price of our room. Having helped ourselves to tea/coffee and a glass of orange juice (choice of juice was orange or orange), we each ordered our \"full english\". This turned out to be one tinned plum tomato, a spoonful of baked beans, a fried egg (no choice how you liked it cooked) and one rasher of bacon.

It was my birthday so we wanted a nice weekend away in London, something basic, not too far away from the main attractions and not too expensive. The hotel we booked was called the Admiral Hotel. It says on the website that you have to check in at the Kingsway Park hotel, which was situted a few steps away. This was fine. The Admiral looked nice on the website pictures, showing a nice modern bar, and clean rooms. It was this hotel we had booked! Once into the Kingsway Park hotel, we where then told thats where we would be staying. It seems that's where everyone stays! It appeared the nice clean Admiral Hotel was not having guests! This was indeed empty! We checked in early, and where told where our rooms where. As other reviews say, the stairs where very steep and there was no lift or warning which didnt help someone in my party that had a knee complaint, but i havent let that interfere with the review, as i could of enquired upon booking. My room had a terrible smell as soon as i walked in. I wasnt expecting anything less though, as the hotel upon entry was tired, shabby, had a smell to it, and had dirty woodwork and walls, and frayed carpets. The divan bed was 2 singles together, with a badly stained base. The lamps had stained and burnt lampshades. The furniture was dated and didnt fit in the room. There was no fancy chairs and furniture like the i've just seen on the Kingsway Park Hotel website! We kepting hurting ourselves when walking around the crammed room on the furniture. The portable tv did work, but the picture wasnt quite viewable, i felt like i had double vision after looking at it. The main critisim is aimed at the toilet which was a portocabin shower and loo in one type of thing, which was placed in the room, but then was incorporated into the paintwork. It smelt, had mould on the shower, and when sitting on the loo, your foot was in the shower area, which was very small. The bottom of the door was also covered in rust. I did not use the shower at all, as it was very off putting. My partner did, and he was fine with it. The other room we booked, for other parties, was very similar but they had a bath, and a more normal bathroom, which had a terrible smell of damp in it. I didnt sleep well during my two night stay. The bedding was a sheet, and then an extremely 'itchy' blanket, with a floral throw over the top. This was covered in stains. Me and my partner had one small pillow each, there was no other bedding to use. Breakfast was included in the price described as a 'full english' we went down for breakfast which was served in small room crammed with tables in the basement. Two ladies, whom we saw cleaning rooms served breakfast. The option was cereal, toast and the cooked breakfast was a boiled slice of bacon, egg (scrambled,fried or boiled) plum tomato and a sausage. I did not recieve what i ordered for breakfast on both mornings, and didnt rectify it as the person serving breakfast could not fully understand my english. Our bed was made while we where out, and there where towels left in the room. The manager/owner was around for most of the time, and there seemed to be approx 6-7 other guest there, excluding my party. There was no problem returning. The front door was unlocked and there was a gentleman on the desk. The latest we returned was around 11pm. The area of this hotel sussex gardens, has a whole host of hotels similar to this one. They all had vacancies in there window, but did look a lot cleaner and friendlier. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. It did us for the weekend, because we had no choice once we got there. Location was great for us, lots of restuarants, and paddington station near by, but for the price, which can seem cheap, im sure there are others for the same price in better condition. In my opinion, it wasnt clean, wasnt comfortable, the food wasnt good, so it was a huge let down for me. Luckily the great company i had, and London being so fantastic didnt make my weekend a complete let down. I have written this review within 7 hours of returning as i would hate anyone to have a weekend ruined, and this hotel would do that! Don't be fooled thinking they put you up in the Admiral hotel, when infact your staying at the Kingsway Park. The website for the Kingsway Park Hotel says it has recently been refurbished!

I had an ensuite double bed (basement level) , but it's still small. There is however a little table to put your stuff/laptop/write letters on (Plus a small wall mounted TV) The ensuite is a small porta-plastic kit type, simply installed in the room. It is really tiny, but I wanted an ensuite instead of shared showers, so again, it did the job, and was kept clean. The room was kept clean - very clean - Fresh towels daily, and sheets changed, so although very small, it was comfortable, and the room never felt grotty. Breakfast was, ummm, \"average\". It served it's purpose in filling you up for the morning, but being mass produced by only 1 or 2 people, it's more in line with what you'd cook for yourself at home if you were in a hurry. The food standard is not fantastic, but it fills you up.. After day 5, it got a bit blah for me to stomach, so I'd eat out at places around the corner (which you can find for a good price... just look for specials) Staff are helpful, and I had no problems. Stairs were painful, but really only for getting your suitcase up and down.. Apart from that I didn't mind - Walked all over London so an extra set of steps made no difference. If you have bone/hip/joint problems you might think twice. Location is great - Close to Paddongton Tube, 2 mins walk (which has the Heathrow Express Link) and there's a whole bunch of places to eat at within 1 minutes walk. Plus some shops 5-10 minutes walk up the road and around the corner for groceries. Wireless Internet was available, thought from the basement room, my laptop needed to be right near the window to get reception. Central heating worked ok, and you could control it, and also open the windows for fresh air (Well at least in my room on the basement you could) In summary - It served its purpose in that it was close to Paddington Station, and handy as food was close by, and grocery shops were around the corner. The staff were friendly and answered any inquiries. It is small, but I was by myself so it didn't bother me - If you're sharing, you might get in the way of each other a fair bit.

Not the girls fault that the management expected her to be taking care of 20+ guests alone. While we were there, a second person came to assist.

As we arrived we went into the lobby that was full of cigarette smoke. Our room (1 queen bed and 2 twin beds) was actually in the hotel 2 doors down (The Admiral) and was in the basement next to a kitchen. The room was so small that the 3 beds took up the entire room. We had nowhere to put our luggage! They promised us a larger room in the morning. The next day, they said they didn't have any larger rooms, but they did give us an additional single room down the hall for free! It was the size of a closet and the bathroom was the size of a phone booth, but our 20 yr old daughter was thrilled. The bathroom in our room was updated and very clean. Never enough toilet paper or towels and the pillows were 2 very thin ones inside a pillowcase. Our non-smoking room also smelled like smoke. Thank goodness I brought Febreeze. The breakfast was good and made to order. As our room was in the basement and a bar/restaurant above us (not carpeted), we were awoken 2 or 3 times during our stay by the noise of people walking around. One time was at 3 am. We reported it and the people were quickly asked to leave the bar. Our telephone never worked our entire stay. The internet access did not work in either of our rooms. My kids used the lobby. The staff was helpful though, but the accomodations were not what I expected from a AAA approved hotel. The location however could not be better. 2 short blocks to Paddington station which is a major tube stop and train station. There was even shopping there and 2 grocery stores. Lots of pubs and reasonably priced restaurants in the area.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fareham, Hants", "Title": "\u201cLots of Stairs\u201d", "Author": "blueskilamb", "ReviewID": "UR6917367", "Content": "We booked the hotel through one of the many on line booking agencies. When we checked in we were shown to another building next door but one. Our rooms happened to beon the top floor (4th Floor). There was no lift & the stairs were very narrow & steep in places making it very difficult for unfit people or people with difficulty climbing stairs. It was also difficult carrying luggage. The rooms were clean with a double & a twin bed - rooms 15 & 16. Although the gap between the bed & the wall nearest the window was raher cramped. The bathroom was also rather cramped & the shower was a bit feeble but at least it did work. The loo was OK if you could fit your knees under the basin. One of the rooms had a nice gesture being supplied a couple of Ferot Rochet chocalates but this did not apply to both rooms. Went to use the kettle the first morning but it did not work. I reported it to the reception & they promised to replace. We subsequently tried swapping the kettles between rooms & found it was not the kettle but the base unit it sits on. Also reported this to the reception. Arrived back late the next night after seeing a show but the kettle was just the same. Next morning our friends brought us a kettle full of hot water so that we could have a drink. We then found that the cleaner only left one bath & one hand towel so one of us had to dry ourselves on the hand towel. Just one guess who took priority. Reported Kettle problem again & also towel issue. They promised to resolve & told me to call reception if any problems. There was & I did. The reception brought up a kettle & some towels fairly quickly. But the kettle still did not work. After a bit of fiddling we managed to find that if you wiggled the kettle & put some pressure at a certain point & kept it there it was possible to make the kettle work. Not ideal but at least we could have a drink in the morning. Our friends did not have this problem. Guess who had to hold the kettle until it boiled?. We had a bit of a concern at the wiring underneath the kettle which consisted of a couple of multi plug adaptors pushed together to cope with the number of plugs although this was not the cause of the problems with the kettle. I even tried swapping the fuses in desperation. These were not the problem. It was definately the base unit. It was difficult removing or returning the kettle to its place anyway due to the close proximity of the hairdryer. The breakfast was not too bad considering the prices for London. It consisted of Orange juice, tea or coffee, Toast & jam, Muesli and/or cornflakes plus a cooked breakfast of egg, sausage, bacon, tomato & beans. The location was pretty good, just a short walk to Paddington Underground. we bought a daily travel card which gave us unlimited travel on the tube or buses for the day which was excellent. Despite the problems we would probably go back as it was so convenient & it was a reasonable base at a reasonable price. I would make sure I took my own kettle though.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201coverpriced, run-down place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1792434", "Content": "This hotel in no way resembled what is advertised on websites. It doesn't appear to have been renovated within the last 30 years.When we walked in we were almost choked by the thick smoke in the lobby 'room'. When I asked about a non smoking room, the man behind the counter laughed and said \"its up to you whether the room is non smoking or not\".The \"mattress\" was a hard box spring that had already sprung. There were big stains, peeling wall paint. Little heat. We almost froze the first night. No hot water the next morning... etc.The hotel must be family run because there were always random men sitting about in the lobby and they all appeared to be related. My sister found them 'creepy' sometimes because they would always stare at us (females) when we came in or went out. One of the men winked at my sister. That's not the kind of attention we want from hotel staff or random and everpresent family/friends of hotel staff.This placed is extremely overpriced and run-down. We paid an extra $20 or so a night under the impression that we would get a slightly better hotel. That was not the case and we feel doubly ripped off. With the horrible exchange rate, basically $175/night for a dumpy room. We will not be staying there again! Avoid!Paddington area seemed a bit rougher than I remember from a trip a couple of years back. Hostile homeless men and regular crazies on the street sometimes. Stay in Westminster or Belgravia.
