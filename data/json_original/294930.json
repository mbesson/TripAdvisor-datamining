The hotel staff is absolutely great! They are extremely helpful and friendly, and they always offered us coffee or tea. Everything they recommended like restaurants, stores, etc. was perfect. We stayed there 4 nights and we loved it! The hotel has a nice indoor garden that is nicely decorated, as well as the rooms. The bed was excellent and the bathroom very neat. It is overall impecable. Complimentary breakfast with view to the Blue Mosque is wonderful. From 5-7pm they have complimentary snacks arranged in a little buffet that is also very tasty. We also had dinner at the hotel and I ordered the Sea Bream; the fish and the side dishes were luscious. I only have good things to say about our experience, and I am ready to go back to Istanbul and stay again at Hotel Nena.

I had hardly any time to prepare for this trip and found it was practically impossible not to hit the major sights just walking down the street. The price is very fair, but my room was also quite noisy - I heard my neighbors and any commotion in the hall or lobby - and awkwardly set up. As someone who wanted to have a more comfortable space to unwind, the room and the cramped lobby were not ideal. I wish I had stayed somewhere with a more relaxed and communal atmosphere, even if it had cost more. Also, if I return to Istanbul, I will certainly want to try out a less touristy neighborhood as it is easy to get to Sultanhamet but hard to escape the throngs once there. That said, the staff were very kind, even giving me tea and smiling patiently as I re-packed my bags in the lobby before an evening flight, and the young man even chased down a taxi for me in the rain. I can't say it was the best hotel experience ever, but I would surely recommend it to anyone looking for simple, comfortable accommodation in the heart of Istanbul's old city.

Our room had its own private balcony which we also enjoyed very much. The location of the hotel is spectacular, particularly for the first time visitor to Istanbul. It is right on the tram line near Sultanhamet but it's a super easy and enjoyable walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Spice (Egyptian) Market and the Grand Bazaar. The hotel restaurant offered an incredible variety of international and Turkish offerings at their breakfast buffet which we enjoyed while sitting on the 5th floor balcony with an incredible view of the Blue Mosque. The staff of the Hotel Nena really cared that we had an enjoyable stay. They clearly take a lot of pride in their city and their hotel. They quickly became trusted partners in helping us navigate all the exciting choices in the city. They were never pushy, in fact they did not offer us advice proactively on activities, restaurants or a place to get a great massage, but when we asked they always came through with a great suggestion. The restaurant staff were lovely and attentive and made sure that breakfast was enjoyable. It's hard to be more positive about our stay. We can't recommend the hotel enough. It's a wonderful, relaxing place to unwind in one of the world's most fascinating cities.

Close to almost all major tourist attractions and a tram stop that you can take to Beyoglu area across the Galata bridge. We were also very close to Cemberlitas Turkish bath, which was an amazing experience. Muzi, who welcomed us to the hotel (I think he's the manager), was very nice and gave us lots of great pointers about Istanbul.

This was our third time back to Istanbul and the Nena as we were heading on to Bulgaria and Romania. We spent two nights in the Nena on the way to Bulgaria/Romania and then one night before heading home. We were greeted as old friends by the the staff of the Nena and as always treated so well. From the offer of coffee/tea to the beautiful rooms to dinner on the rooftop overlooking the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorus, one cannot go wrong staying at this boutique hotel. I love the discounts that the Nena offers. If we booked by Oct. 2011, we received a 10% discount. If you pay with cash, you receive a 5% discount and you are offered a coupon for 50% in their dining room for dinner. We used all of the above. They also offer pickup and dropoff service to/from the airport. Depending on the number of nights one stays the pickup is included. As we left the Nena, all came out to see us off. We will be back to Istanbul and the Nena in 2013 on our way to the five \"stans\" (Uzbeckistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) and look forward to staying in our favorite hotel in our favorite city:-) To us, this is the perfect place to stay.

Lots of others have commented on the view from the dining room, it is indeed breathtaking, and the location is superb, being 5 minutes from the 2 main attractions, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. It is also a few metres from the main tram route taking you to Galata Bridge/Tower. However, many other hotels are in similar locations, what I was most impressed with about Nena was the exceptional service, advice and assistance given, above and beyond the what is normally found. We arrived very early after the complimentary airport pick-up, and were immediately offered breakfast until our room was readied, again much earlier than is usual. The standard of service throughout the stay was maintained, and felt very genuine. I have booked again for later in the year.

The hotel is a few buildings down from the main street in sultanhamet that the tram is on - this means GREAT location! You can walk to the Sultanhamet tram stop in 5 minutes or less, the Grand Bazaar in 10 minutes, Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia and Cistern in 5-10 minutes, and you are just steps from tons of shops and restaurants. Also, a couple doors down, right before the main street is a little shop that sells water, soda and snacks. We always got our water here becuase it was cheap - 5 liters for 1.75 lira! The rooms themselves were really nice and as pictured in the main picture here on trip advsior and on the hotel website. We had just a standard room, not the deluxe one that has extra space. The room was a little small maybe, but that is how all rooms are in Sultanhamet unless you pay extra for a deluxe room or a suite. We did just fine. The room even had a desk/vanity and a fridge. The room also had a flat screen tv and a safe. The decor was modern and the bathroom was updated. The rooms have individual heating/cooling controls. We found that our room was always a bit warm, but not big deal becuase we would just crack open the window for a bit and cool it down. We did think the walls were a little thin. We heard the kid talking and crying in the room next door, but this wasn't a huge bother. When the next people moved into that room, we didn't hear noise, so perhaps the first family was just a little loud in general. The outside noise was never a problem and a couple mornings we didn't even hear the call to prayer. We were in room 107 and our room was at the back of the hotel directly above the enclosed sunroom of the hotel. This was nevery noisy or a problem. Someone's review said that this view was awful, but we didn't think so. Sure we couldn't see the sights from our window, but neither can most rooms becuase there are other 5 or 6 story buildings around. The rooftop of the hotel is amazing!!! This was one of the main reasons we chose to stay here becuase we wanted to watch the new year's eve fireworks from the hotel roof. We were not disappointed! The views of the blue mosque are incredible and you can see the sea of marmar, the bosphorus, the bosphorus bridge and Hagia Sofia. We watched the sunrise over the Blue Mosque in the morning as we ate breakfast - georgous! Breakfast is included and is served on the top floor of the hotel. There are a few tables outside and many inside. There are floor to ceiling doors/windows between the two so you can sit inside and still have the view. Breakfast was good with many hot and cold choices. There were hard boiled eggs, cooked eggs, sausage, olives, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, breads, pastries, crepes, jams, honey, cereal, fruit juice, water, coffee, tea, etc. We always enjoyed breakfast. The hot options change slightly each day so you won't get bored. They also have tea time each afternoon with free tea (turkish or apple), coffee and cakes. We ate dinner at the roof top restaurant one night and thought it was really good. You also get a 25% discount on food (not alcohol), so it was a good deal. Overall, we really liked this hotel. It was really nice and was cheaper than many other options. Can't beat the location and the views either.

They met us at the cruise ship port with a van. We can't say enough for the quality of this hotel, staff and its wonderful location. When we arrived, the staff brought us into their pretty interior courtyard and brought us hot tea. They wanted to make sure that we knew everything about exploring Istanbul and offered to help us in any way! As we had just stayed, pre-cruise, in a modern, rather unhelpful, hotel in the New Town, we didn't need much help finding our way around Istanbul but we were really touched with their earnestness to be helpful. Later, they offered to print our boarding passes for our return flights and they persisted until they achieved success despite the usual roadblocks on the computer. Their location was very easy walking distance to the main sights in the Old Town- much better than the location in the New Town of our other hotel. For our last night in Istanbul, we had dinner in their wonderful rooftop restaurant which has possibly the best view in Istanbul of the Blue Mosque. The pictures we took became the cover of our photo book of Turkey. Our room was on a lower floor, which we initially thought might be noisy, but it wasn't - it was clean and neat and had a comfortable king bed. We didn't care about the location because the view from the restaurant upstairs was easily available. When we asked the front desk for a scale so we could adjust our baggage to accomodate the weight restrictions of our airline, they handed over a bathroom scale which more than adequately addressed our needs- we were so happy they had a solution to the problem! We were sure that the other hotel would have been totally baffled at such a request. The next morning we enjoyed the most spectacular full breakfast buffet, with the same wonderful view of Istanbul. It would be hard to describe all of the hot and cold offerings. We had requested a transfer to the airport and they not only drove us to the terminal- they drove to the upstairs of the parking garage, found a cart for our luggage and then wheeled us up to the first security gate.

Our fourth visit offered all of these and more! Those preferring a Sheraton or Hilton hotel should not stay at the Nena. The Nena is a smaller hotel with 29 rooms. But therein lies its charm. All rooms have very recently been remodeled and feature new furniture and a brand new lighter and brighter color scheme. Rooms and bathrooms are spotless and the front desk employees could not be more helpful! And Muzaffer and Hotel Nena have not been resting on their laurels. Since my visit last year, I have noticed an amazing increase in the number of new employees at the hotel. Service levels at the Nena are now at a new high. As our shuttle bus from the cruise terminal appeared at the Nena, several employees greeted us and assured us that they would take all of our luggage from street to lobby to rooms. An employee seems always available in the downstairs lobby area--awaiting any request. Service in the upstairs restaurant (where you will enjoy a recently upgraded array of breakfast foods) is wonderful. Two ladies are there to pour your coffee or to bring any additional food items to your table--and their smiles will help start off your day! By the way, carpets and wall treatments in the upstairs restaurant have also been updated since my last visit. During my groups three day trip to Cappadocia, Muzaffer arranged to store all of our large luggage downstairs at no additional cost (we carried only our carry-on bags on the trip). In addition, Muzaffer arranged a cruise terminal pick-up, transfers to and from the airport for our flights to Cappadocia, and even found us an excellent, affordable private guide for our three days in Istanbul. As fate would have it, I was fortunate to encounter a couple from the U.S. who were at the Nena due one of my past Tripadvisor reviews. They, too, loved their stay at the hotel. When staying in Istanbul, don't pass up this jewel of a hotel in the heart of Sultanahmet.

My wife and I chose Istanbul for our honeymoon because I am an Architect, and my favorite buildings are the old Byzantine Churches in Istanbul. One of my guide books recommmended the Nena Hotel, and after reading views on this site and checking out the Hotel's website, I decided it looked like a reasonable place. However the accomidations were well above and beyond reasonable. After a very minor incident meeting the shuttle at the airport that was quickly remedied by calling the hotel, we were welcomed by Mehmet with apple tea and an unobtrusive offering of tour guide options and brochures. We decided to hire a tour guide for our first day, and not only was the guide about 1/3 of the cost of the tour guide I booked for a later day of our trip, but he was just as knowledgeable and pleasant. Perhaps I am talking a bit too much about things outside the hotel, but it was Mehmet and the other staff members guidance that helped us have such a wonderful time in Istanbul. Like other European hotels, the rooms were a bit smaller than one might be used to in the USA, but still comfortable. We stayed in room 401, which is the suite with the view used in ther ads. The view is as good as advertised. We almost didn't even need to leave the hotel to get good pictures of the city (though you should because while crowded, the people of Istanbul are very friendly). Some reviews I'd read complained about the noise, especially in the suites below the roof top restaurant. While we could hear some noise in our room, it was only during normal operating hours, and never kept us from sleeping since the restaurant tends to slow down around 8 or 9PM and doesn't open until about 7:30 AM. All told the noise really wasn't any worse than a typical hotel in terms of noise from other guests, so other reviews that complain about the noise in the hotel I found to be exagerated. Also, I read some reviews that complained about the air conditioning. It was a bit warm all week while we were there (80 F), and the air conditioning worked perfectly for us. On top of the great service, I found the rooms to be extremely affordable. I think we payed an average of $266 US dollars a night. It was a 5 minute walk from the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque and basically the best vacation experience of my life.

If you wanna be in the heart of Sultanahment within walking distance of just about all the cultural icons of Istanbul, this place can't be beat. With a staff that's extremely courteous and helpful, and prices well within most budgets Nena Hotel can be a strong contender for your stay in Istanbul. However, a couple of key factors for me that take away 2 stars are: the hotel itself feels more like a hostel, expect with older residents, the room walls are paper thin so if you have noisy neighbors, you may not enjoy your stay. Hotel staff are up early to begin their chores so you should expect to hear conversations and doors opening and shutting starting at 7am. Add to this the fact that the hotel room itself is extremely small and for 2 people it's a very tight squeeze in my opinion. Let's put it this way, if you view your hotel room simply as a place to lay down to try and get some zzzzs on your vacation, this is the place for you. But, if you are a traveler accustomed to staying at the \"chain\" hotels like the Hyatts & Hiltons of the world, this would not be the place for you.

Muzaffer helped us out with giving us his istanbulkart travel card to get us on our way. The room was a triple- spacious, very quiet and had a small balcony looking on to the back. My wife commented that the decor was traditional and a bit dated- yes compared to some of the ultra modern minimalist hotels out there- but perfectly acceptable. Likewise the bathroom was clean and functional- ideal for a family. All the usual appliances/conveniences were accounted for and working just fine. The beds were on the firm side but that was what we preferred at home. The views from the roof top terrace restuarant were stunning with the Blue mosque and Aya Sophia dominating.

Staff - All welcoming, friendly, helpful and chatty.

Rooms - since I stayed 3 years ago many rooms have been overhauled and are much improved as a result. Comfortable beds, tea/coffee, tv with plenty of channels, decent shower and aircon. Dining - The breakfast (& dinner) room is on the top floor with sliding glazed panels onto a terrace looking out to the Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque and the Sea of Marmara. The best view in Istanbul. For dinner there are plenty of good restaurants off the nearby main street (with the tram running down it). Public areas - A small hotel in general, but the the lobby/reception is a welcome rest-bite from the busy streets. The courtyard area is rather pleasant too and perhaps you'll be offered a gratis tea/coffee whilst you're there too. Other points - With hard floors on the stairs and corridors it's occasionally quite noisy when fellow guests return to their rooms in the early hours - particularly as some guests seem to need to have loud group conversations outside other people's rooms at 2am.

As for restaurants in the area, plentiful, my favorite though the EL FARO restaurant on the main street, about one half block from the hotel.

I am happy to say that such was the case again in October when i brought another travel group back to Istanbul and the Nena Hotel. For once again Manager Muzaffer Sahin and his staff went \"above and beyond\" in taking care of the details that always make for a memorable vacation stay in this amazing city. After the long and tiring air flight from Phoenix, it's always comforting to find Muzaffer's driver waiting in the arrivals hall to shuttle our group directly to the Nena. And once there, we never stand in a long line at the main reception desk to obtain room keys. Instead, Muzaffer escorts us all to the upstairs restaurant balcony where he offers us his sincere welcome along with a cup of hot Turkish Tea, our room keys, and a spectacular view that encompasses the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia and the Bosphorus. It's always a memorable welcome for all! Muzaffer and his staff also again arranged for a first-evening \"welcome dinner\" in the upstairs restaurant. The optional (delicious!) 4-course Turkish meal was this time served out on the balcony where we were able to dine as we gazed out on the lights of Istanbul below. And upon arrival to our rooms it was nice to discover that the Nena Hotel has recently completed a very successful remodel. Rooms now sport light and bright colors, along with new beds and furnishings. Room floors are now covered in attractive hardwood. But it was also nice to note that the management wisely chose to leave the reception area, the Winter Garden and the hallways in their traditional (attractive) original condition. Great service again prevailed when one of my group members (with mobility difficulties) asked to take a cab to the nearby Grand Bazaar. Worried that she might not meet up with the rest of our group members who were already there, Muzaffer insisted that a Nena staff member accompany the lady in the cab! So once again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Manager Muzaffer and his entire Nena staff for taking such good of our group. I'm already in the process of organizing another return trip to Istanbul for 2011, and you can be assured that we will again be staying at the Nena. I highly recommend that others do the same!

I loved the deluxe rooms as they have their own private balcony with an outstanding view over the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya and right over the water to the Bosphorous Bridge. It is lovely to sit there first thing in the morning with a coffee, planning your day, or to watch the city lighted up while enjoying a nightcap (or rice pudding from one of the many take away pudding shops!) This time we needed a triple room, which limited our choice somewhat. Much though I loved the Nena on our last visit, I do like to try new places, and hunted pretty widely, before deciding that nowhere else decent seemed to offer a triple room, with a balcony, for anything like as good a price. When checking the Nena prices be sure to enter your dates on their website as they offer several discounts, restaurant voucher and airport transfers which substantially reduce their initial published rate. The Nena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secure booking section of the website is very good and they are very prompt at answering any queries you may have. We certainly were not disappointed with our second visit, being met at the airport by the same member of staff as last time and driven right to the hotel door. Entering we were met by some more familiar faces, before being shown to our room. The rooms have just been renovated and are looking extremely smart and clean (though this is not reflected on their website pics yet) The room was big enough for us and it is a great bonus to be able to sit comfortably at a proper table and chairs out on the balcony. It must be said that the triple rooms do not have such an outstanding view as the deluxe rooms but they are muh cheaper and we still enjoyed it. The rooms are well equipped with sidelights, tablelamps, wardrobe, desk, fridge, TV and safety box. The only thing lacking was a bedlight for the third bed but we just moved one from the opposite side of the room. The bathroom is also quite spacious with a good shower in the bath. The side of the bath seems higher than normal, and although we had no problem, it could be a little tricky for an elderly person. The front entrance area is very attractive with computers available for guest use and the large covered conservatory is a lovely spot to relax with a drink. There is an elevator/ lift, too, which many hotels in Sultanahmet lack, but it is really welcome when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re weary after a long day sightseeing. Staff are always friendly and helpful, too. Speaking of sightseeing, the Nena is ideally located just a few steps from the main street Divan Yolu and the tram stop. Many sights auch as the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, the Cisterns and the Grand Bazaar are only a few minutes walk. The selection at breakfast was huge with cereal, bread, cakes, fruit, typical Turkish cold meat, cheese and veg selection, and also hot sausage, eggs and potato dishes. The view from the breakfast room/ restauarant match that of the deluxe rooms so dinner here is also enjoyable in a lovely setting with good fresh meat and fish. If I had one criticism, it is that the Nena does not provide tea/ coffee making facilities in the room, although the fridge is stocked with cold drinks and tea/ coffee are always available from reception.

It is really a good place to stay in Istanbul. We made the reservation through their website and paid 100 euros per night including breakfast and transportation from Ataturk airport to the hotel. We arrived late at night but it was no problem. The hotel is very conveniently located, it is within walking distance of the blue mosque, the cisterns and the aya sofia. There is a tram stop nearby which can take you directly to the ferry port (3 stops) from where you can enjoy a boat trip on the bosphorus or take a ferry to Uskudar etcetera (public transportation is extremely cheap!). The roof terrace offers wonderful views of the city and the bosphorus and beyond. You can enjoy breakfast there. The roof terrace is not very big, sometimes it is full and you have to sit inside but then you still have a great view through the windows. If you stay at this hotel, it is worth considering what kind of room you want- I read in one of the other reviews that the rooms ending with a 4 or 5 digit don't have a view outside. I mentioned it when I made the reservation and we got a good room, and when we were there I found out that indeed the rooms ending with a 4 or 5 have almost no daylight. However, the room we got was very nice! It is true that you can sometimes hear other guests (in the hallway, not in the other rooms) but it did not bother me at all. I was pleasantly surprised by the LCD tv which could be viewed from the bed and also offered foreign channels such as the BBC, as well as many sports channels. Very relaxing after a long day of walking. Things from the mini bar were not too expensive. The restaurant which is open in the evening (same location where breakfast is served) is a bit expensive but if you make your reservation at the nena website you get a discount coupon which you can use once (50% off). You can also just go there for drinks, they also have alcoholic drinks (not all restaurants in Istanbul do). There is wireless internet in the hotel, which was very helpful. Service was good. All staff speaks English very well and was friendly, for example, when we needed to print our boarding passes, they helped us print them in their office. All in all, the hotel is not very cheap but also not too expensive, and definitely good value for money.

Room: A bit on the small size, but in a city like Istanbul the hotel room should really only be for sleeping, so the size was not important. The room was very clean. Breakfast is served on the top floor with a really lovely view of Istanbul. The breakfast was help yourself buffet style with a good variety of hot and cold selection, fresh bread and fruit. The hot selection was tasty. The hotel has also free internet access which is very usefull as Mobile phone call in Turkey are really expensive with a UK mobile. Recomendation for Istanbul. A must for every vistor is the 'bread and fish' sold on the docks near the spice market. The locals flock to it daily and for 4 Lira you get a freshly grilled fish (mackerel) in fresh bread. The secret is alo to get the pickles to eat with the fish. Its a great meal for next to nothing. I found the locals very friendly (overtly sometimes), but not aggresive, and once they understood that i was not going to buy anything they left you alone) I would come back to Istanbul, and Hotel Nena.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weinstadt", "Title": "\u201cVery Satisfied!\u201d", "Author": "Tossi", "ReviewID": "UR33764785", "Content": "Free Airport Pick-Up, free Internet access, very friendly and helpful hotel staff, a rooftop terrace with a breathtaking view over the Marmara Sea, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Bosporus.

We had a deluxe room (room 401)which was right below the restaurant and our wall was common to the restaurant stairway. As the floors and hallways are uncarpeted our room became extremely noisy from the patrons coming and going. We could also hear every clink of cutlery from breakfast preparation time to end of night and every conversation. Not so good. Our bed was a pile of rocks - the mattress is too thin for the bed base. We walked extensively each day and would wake up aching from our rock bed. There is no individual temperature control so if the hotel is being heated then you can't switch to cooling. Consequently our room was rather hot and uncomfortable. We left our balcony door open as much as possible. As this door was below the restaurant deck it also allowed much more noise into our room and smoke from the interminable smoking machines who stood about on the deck. The staff were very nice and attentive although one got quite snippy with us when we complained about the heat in our room. Still, generally they were of a very high standard. The breakfast is probably more suited to Europeans. We had one yoghurt to choose from. One hot dish of scrambled egg (burnt beyond eating one day and not replaced) and some sausages cooked in a tomato sauce. There were sugary cereals and one mueslie sort of thing. Some sliced orange and grapefruit and fruitsalad. The rest were salads and breads and some cake slices. There is no toast. It's OK but not as advertised in their publicity. The rooms are probably about the normal size for this kind of hotel, our deluxe room was reasonable and we could move around without bumping into each other but the furnishings are very old , tired and shabby. The stupid bedhead has the light switched set into it so when you move your pillow it turns the lights on and off, a real nuisance. And the TV is a tiny old set, too small to watch from the bed and very poor sound quality. We were out of our room each day all day sightseeing but we didn't look forward to returning each day.

For the price we felt it is an average hotel in an excellent location (Sultanahmet), and were a little disappointed. However, this could be because we had just come from Santorini where we stayed in an excellent apartment (Enigma Apartments), and Athens where we stayed in a great hotel (Hotel Parthenon), and the building next door to the Nena in Istanbul was a construction site (it was being renovated). The rooms were at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd end of the range, were on the 1st floor just above reception area, were a bit of a squeeze for 2 people, and without tea/coffee and ironing facilities. The bathroom in our room was small and had small areas of mould in some places in the shower cubicle, but had a great shower height which is important for tall people who get sick of having to bend over to shower in hotel rooms. The corridors on each floor are marble lined without carpet on the floor so any voices above normal quiet conversation level echo very loudly, particularly late at night. Also, unfortunately for us, the building next door was being renovated so there was a lot of drilling and jack-hammering noise both during the day and well into the evening. For those like us who like to race around until mid-afternoon sight-seeing, and go back to the hotel for a siesta before taking off for the evening/night meal and entertainment, this was pretty well out of the question. Having said this, the reception staff were excellent - always helpful, pleasant, and courteous, and they provide internet access for free. We had pre-arranged airport transfers through the hotel which were prompt and well worth it. The Roof Terrace breakfast/dining area has views of the Sea of Marmara and the Blue Mosque to rival any hotel in the area, and the breakfast buffet (included in our room price) had a great range of both cold and hot foods. Breakfast on the terrace every morning was a great treat, and the location of the hotel is an absolute winner. Istanbul is absolutely mental, and for those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been there it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Must Do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for your travel list. The people are friendly (particularly as most of them are trying to sell you something), although the younger men seem to have a bad tendency of standing uncomfortably close to western women, and take opportunities for the odd grope in big packed crowds when they think they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be caught. All in all the location of the Nena is its strong point, an absolute winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very close to the tramway on the main street (which is part of an excellent and cheap public transport system) and within walking distance of all the major historical sights within the Eminonu/Sultanahmet/Bazaar districts. Would we go back to Istanbul? Absolutely. Would we go during Ramadan? Absolutely. Would we stay in Hotel Nena? Maybe, maybe not.

My review is colored by the double room we were in the first night. My husband described it as a \"dank hole\" and it prompted me to frantically search availability at the Istanbul Four Seasons - no matter the cost! It was terribly small with almost no light from the outside (or inside for that matter). The bath/shower was very rusty/unkept looking and I was afraid to look too closely. To the hotel's credit, we were moved to a different, triple room for the following 2 nights, which was much better size and light-wise, although still very basic. For example, I could feel the springs in what was a not-very-comfortable bed. The service was, on the whole, quite good. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

Central AC runs constantly in summer creating continuous white noise at night. Very thin interior walls so voices neighboring guests can be heard fairly clearly.

We had asked for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153triple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room on an upper floor and it was quite large, especially by European standards. We had plenty of room to lay out our suitcases on the floor without them being in the way. There was a small wardrobe unit for hanging clothes, but very little drawer storage for folded clothes. The bathroom was small but nicely done with newer tile, a good sized tub/shower and the only wall-hung hair dryer I have ever used that puts out enough heat and power to do a good job. We loved the wonderfully thick Turkish towels, too. Our room also had a small balcony but we never used it because the view was of other buildings. We were in the back of the hotel; had our room faced the other direction, we would probably have had a nice view of the Bosphorus and Sutlanahmet sites. Still, it was nice to have all the light that came through the balcony door. The ground floor of the hotel has a nice sized lobby with big tables and chairs, the front desk, a back room with a small bar, a TV and several couches, a desk with a computer and the free internet access. Behind this is an enclosed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area with tables and chairs and greenhouse-like windows and roof - the perfect place to relax with a glass of wine.

We also ate dinner two nights up there on the balcony just to see the magically lit Sultanahmet buildings. One of the best things about the Nena is the staff.

As for breakfeasts, they were ample, self service on the top floor, which also presented dramatic views. The staff to the person was courteous and helpful, making reservations when requested, including for the popular 360 restaurant in the Beyoglu district. Easy to get there by tram, a block or so from the hotel. Incidentally, the public transportation was excellent, and preferable to the exhorting taxis.

We stayed at the Hotel Nena and had a wholly positive and highly enjoyable experience. To give you full appreciation of our stay, please allow me to give you some details on how I originally came to choose the Hotel Nena... In anticipation of this trip, I traveled to Istanbul last year to scout it out. Part of my scouting involved visiting virtually all of the hotels in Sultanahmet and Beyoglu (if it's in one of the main guide books, I've seen it). By far, my first impression of the Hotel Nena stood above and beyond the rest. The staff was incredibly helpful, the rooms looked great, the hotel had more comfortable common areas than others (three separate lounging areas on the ground floor alone), and it was in the perfect central location. For me, the Hotel Nena was the definite choice for my group. Bringing such a large group requires a lot of extra planning, and the manager, Muzaffer Sahin, was incredibly helpful over the many months prior to our arrival. Anytime I needed to adjust the number/size of the rooms he immediately responded with whatever assistance I needed. So great was his help, that I decided to book a special dinner in the hotel and a half-day custom Byzantine tour through their agency (this tour included sites not normally offered on the package tours of the city). Again, each of these extra arrangements were managed perfectly and easily through Muzaffer (the manager) and the hotel staff. It was just over a week ago that we arrived in Istanbul, and, as promised the driver was waiting for us with a large bus capable of handling our large group and all our luggage. The students and my colleagues were especially impressed by the fact that the manager, Muzaffer, actually met us at the airport and accompanied us back to the hotel - first class service to say the least! Check in went quickly and easily, and we started our wonderful week at the Hotel Nena. It was an excellent week there, but let me give the highlights for those who are looking for the perfect hotel: Location: 1 minute from the Sultanahmet tram stop. All sites in Sultanahmet within easy walking distance. No one in our group ever used a cab. On a quiet side street, with plenty of great restaurants, bars, and stores nearby. Service: First class. All members of the hotel staff are excellent! All very helpful, attentive, and responsive to any needs one might have. Additionally, my students all remarked about how friendly they were; they thoroughly enjoyed their conversations with the staff. Anytime my wife returned to the hotel with our children in the stroller, a member of the staff would help her up the stairs into the lobby. Rooms: Well appointed, comfortable, and exceptionally clean. Not a single complaint from the 31 people in my group. All remarked on how comfortable the rooms are. Also, I read some reviews about the walls being thin - to the contrary, no one in my group mentioned this (actually one remarked how amazed he was about how quiet his room was once he closed the door). My room was the deluxe on the fourth floor. Great view of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia from the balcony - very quiet and comfortable. Restaurant: Great!! Excellent view of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Sea of Marmara etc. We had a special group dinner the first night, which was of the highest quality. The 50% coupon in the restaurant means a high quality meal for a great price in comparison to many other restaurants. The breakfast was always delicious, plentiful, and well tended to by staff. One additional thing to mention - with my two small children in tow, the staff were especially helpful in warming up leftovers we had, providing milk and hot water, and always volunteering to bring anything we needed to the room. Exceptional service!! Manager: Muzaffer Sahin is the best hotel manager you will find in Istanbul!! Professional, courteous, and extremely helpful, his personal attention to our group was incredible. On the last night of our stay, my whole group thanked him and offered a round of applause for all that he and his staff did. Overall: It is rare, indeed, that you will find a hotel of this quality for such a great price (we received one night free due to the length of our stay). I take my college students abroad every year to locations across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and I would rank the Hotel Nena as the best, most personalized hotel experience I've ever had. I plan to take a group back to Istanbul sometime in the next year or two - rest assured that I have already mentioned to Muzaffer Sahin that he can expect us back in the lovely Hotel Nena, as I would not stay anywhere else in Istanbul!!!!!!!!!!

I booked directly at the hotel's website, and received a free roundtrip to/from the airport due to staying for several days, a 10% discount for booking so far in advance; and another 5% for paying in cash. My wife and I booked one of the two suites for 4 nights. Location: right in the heart of the old city, this is a great location if you are here for a short time, and/or plan on spending most of your time here. Everything is within walking distance, and the tram stop is just minutes away. I do want to add my own insight...staying in the old town is not for everyone. Why? Because once the sun goes down and attractions close, there is not a lot to do. There are lots of turkish restaurants, but most of them are very similar. There are no night attractions, very few bars/social activities, and not much else to do at the hotel. Knowing what I know now, I would have stayed closer to Taksim square, where I could have gotten a much nicer room for the money and been close to the action, commuting to the old city during the day. Room: my room was clean, and as it was one of the two suites it had a view of the Blue Mosque. It had a queen-sized bed and a very tiny television, and a small bathroom. It was small for a suite but adequate for 2 people. Overall the room was fine, but I cannot in good faith compare it with that of a 5-star hotel. The one big drawback is its location in the hotel. The hotel has 5 floors, with an elevator going up to floor 4 (where the suites are located) and stairs to the 5th floor. The 5th floor is where the breakfast buffet is served. The walls and door are very thin, so if you're not the first one up for breakfast, everyone's walking/talking up the stairs will get you up. I also presume that the sound of the morning call to prayer by the mosques is louder, as this floor is the only one in the hotel with rooms above the other buildings, so nothing blocks the sound. Breakfast: it is included, with a moderate variety. It was adequate and average. We also received a 50% off dinner coupon, but we did not use it. Service: absolutely top notch. The staff here will help you any way they can. Extremely friendly, will cater to any special requests or needs, I concur completely with the other reviews that say they are the best. It is exceeds service at 5-star hotels. Overall, I heartily recommend this hotel, but in my opinion I don't think it warrants 5 stars, or that it is a top 1% hotel, as the ratings suggest.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "AmiNaz", "ReviewID": "UR11923927", "Content": "The location is prime within Sultanahmet area (tram station is 1 minute walk).

When we got back from sightseeing, the manager called me and asked if the shower was alright. It was much better than it was the day before, but each day it got cleaner and cleaner. They also kept asking me each day if it was alright. They \"aim to please\". When you take advantage of the online booking, paying cash and other offerings, the PRICE is great....it also includes pickup from airport and return.

Firstly, the free airport transfer offered on the web site. Contacting the hotel a few days before our arrival we were told this only applies to guests who book directly with the hotel. No mention of this on the web site. OK, not the end of the world so we arranged to pay for a transfer organised by the hotel - which was more than an hour late. When we finally got to the hotel, after crawling through Ramadan traffic, we opened the door to a tiny, noisy, drab room with probably the smallest shower/bathroom we have ever seen. While the room was spotless with clean bed linen, we were bitten by bedbugs. We dreaded getting into the bed but didn't know how to explain the problem. OK, we were there for just a few nights and on a visit to Istanbul you don't spend much time in the bedroom. But there was always the much-lauded breakfast in the rooftop restaurant with views of the Blue Mosque and the Bospherous to look forward to. Breakfast was ok but there are only three tables on the balcony which was always nabbed by smokers who appeared to sit there forever. Perhaps we shouldn't have stayed in Sultanahmet during Ramadan. Fascinating to see the number of pilgrims but getting in and out of the hotel and trying to use public transport like trams and taxis was a complete nightmare due to the sheer number of people. If we return to Istanbul we will avoid the 'touristy' areas and stay a few miles out of the centre. We would go further along the Bospherous around Ortokoy or beyond.

The service was friendly and we really appreciated the free airport pick up and drop off service the hotel provides for stays of 3 days or more. We stayed 4 nights and really enjoyed it. Breakfast on the terrace was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go to all the nearby attractions. Our children stayed elsewhere and they were always over with us at Nena. The breakfast is a lovely buffet and the views from the terrace were stunning.

I booked with the hotel using their website and opted for cash payment when settling my bill (5% discount). Location: Its a nice little hotel located smack dab in the middle of the sultanahment area and within easy walking distance of all the tourist attractions here. For those looking to roam outside of sultanahment e.g. to go to Taksim; there are two tram stops within 5 minutes walking distance of the hotel i.e. Sultanahmet and Cemberlitas. By the way, there is also a cinema showing English movies inside a pseudo clothing mall at Cemberlitas (directly opposite the tram stop). There are lots of restaurants around the hotel including a Mcdonalds (open till midnight). Rooms: For the first night, we stayed at in Deluxe room which has a balcony overlooking the blue mosque. Since these were not available after the first night; we moved to a standard double room for the rest of our trip. The standard rooms are small when compared to American/Far East lodging standards but in line with European rooms. The Deluxe rooms are much larger. However both types of rooms are clean with most of the amenities required. There are no in-room safes, however there is a safety deposit box maintained at reception which you can use for no extra charge. As a tip, the view from the rooftop terrace restaurant is much better than the one you get from the balcony of the deluxe rooms. Secondly, the restaurant closes down around 10:00 at night but the place upstairs is kept open so you can sit on the terrace and enjoy the cool breeze with a few drinks etc. Most of the times, you will be the only people there. Others: We really enjoyed our stay here. There were a few minor blips e.g. the driver was late picking us up from the airport due to the traffic etc but these dont matter. The breakfast (on the rooftop terrace) is good with different types of teas, fruits etc, however if you expect big breakfasts ala omelettes, pancakes and the like, you are in for a disappointment (pretty much in every hotel in Istanbul except for the big 4-5 star ones). The hotel restaurant which is \"officially\" located in the basement (but since all patrons prefer to eat on the rooftop terrace so its empty all the time and waiters take orders from people on the rooftop and work the lifts) is quite good but is closed on Sunday. You get a 50% discount for your first time here and I suggest you avail it for dinner. There is nothing like a dinner at night overlooking the panorama of the Sea/Blue Mosque etc. The big plus about this hotel besides the location, are the staff who are really friendly and go out of their way to help you out.

I arrived aboard a red-eye from Jeddah, which touched down at 6:10 am. The driver was running late, so he called the Information Desk at Ataturk Airport and had me paged to tell me he was on his way. This really impressed me. I got me to the door of the hotel at 7:30. My room wasn't ready, but then again, I didn't expect that it would be. So, the delightful staff at the reception desk invited me to take breakfast upstairs while I waited -- a nice touch. The room I had, facing the street, was small but very nice. The bed was king size and quite comfortable for the price. Everything was spotlessly clean. Opening the window, you face a building across the street where people both live and work, so if are thinking of wandering about naked with the window open, you might be giving someone a show! For me, the best thing about this hotel is the staff: the guys at the front desk are second to none. Each of them, within a day, became a friend. One in particular became a very important friend to have, and this brings me to the rug merchants across the street. They are persistent, loud, obnoxious and annoying as hell. I have lived in Saudi Arabia for the past 8 years, and I thought I was immune to this sort of thing, but the behavior of one of them went far beyond the pale of what is acceptable. He would see me on the main street and follow me to the hotel, all the while trying to make conversation with me, while I was, frankly, not interested. I was not raised to be rude to people, but this was getting ridiculous, so I told him to please go away and leave me alone. He didn't relent. I came stumbling into the lobby and told the guys at the reception desk. Immediately, the new friend of whom I speak ran outside and confronted the guy. Well, unfortunately, the rug merchant defended himself with shouts of, \"I'll do as I like, this is my business\" and the punches started flying. The police were summoned to the scene, and the tempers subsided. I felt terrible for saying anything, especially because the guy at the hotel got his shirt ripped open in the fracas, but when I told the guy how sorry I was, he said with s a smile, \"You are our guest and our friend, and you're here to be comfortable, so we have to make sure you're comfortable.\" I thoroughly recommend this hotel.

The bill was not broken down and so it was difficult for us to be certain what we had paid for, hence a few telephone calls to us in the car whilst being transferred to the airport which we found rather jaded the end of our visit.

All suggestions and tips from other travellers on the tripadvisor site showed to be very valuable. Location : Perfect !!! - the hotel is perfectly situated at walking distance of all tourist attractions in Sulthanamet (Bleue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Ayasofia, the Grand Bazar and Egyptian Bazar) and there is a tram/tramway station at 200 meters distance. It is very easy to visit the city by tram and it is extremely comfortable. Rooms : given that we booked well upfront we were lucky ! - we had room 402 and this was fantastic - the room has adequate space, the bathroom is small but very functional and there is a small terrace - from the room and the terrace you've a nice view on the blue mosque and on the Bosphore - just marvelous ! Two small remarks : 1\u00c2\u00b0 noise of doors being slammed during the night (people get in drunk or do not pay attention... - bring your earplugs - like I did - it works just perfectly well !! - and 2\u00c2\u00b0 the curtains were just a bit small and very transparent.... The room and bathroom - as the whole hotel - were very clean ! Staff : staff was extremely friendly and helpfull ! Due to the fact that we made our reservation via the hotel internetsite, we were picked up at the airport on arrival and dropped off upon departure - this all for free - just fantastic ! Breakfast : is taken in the rooftop restaurant - nice view on part of Sulthanamet - and the food is adequate - service is very friendly. We did not have lunch or dinner in the hotel given the numerous possibilities in the hotel area (all at walking distance). Restaurants in the area : Restaurant Sarni\u00c3\u00a7 (restaurant of hotel Ayasofya Pansiyonlari) - FANTASTIC experience - great foodt, great wines, great service, genuinely historic surroundings - we felt privileged having been able to have dinner there - we even went twice - do make a reservation however particularly during weekends. A must ! Restaurant Rumeli Caf\u00c3\u00a9 - nice - good food, good wines, good service, surroundings just fine - please make a reservation. Restaurant Balikci Sabahattin - primarily fish restaurant - food just just ok, service unfriendly, surrounding very noisy with a lot of drunk people in the restaurant. A never again experience. For lunch you can choose from a lot of small restaurants. When in the Grand Bazar environment however, try the Havuzlu restaurant in the Grand Bazar itself - a very nice local experience with decent food and very friendly and helpful staff.

We booked a deluxe room and a regular double. The reviews for this hotel are fairly accurate--the location is excellent for sightseeing and using public transport, plus it's simple to walk to the Grand Bazaar and spice markets. The deluxe room (we had 401) was comfortable and we had lovely views, but the double rooms are small, dark, and the sole window opens to an interior air vent. And because the hotel is quite small and the hallway is mostly uncarpeted, you can hear the other guests coming in and out of their rooms. The hotel staff is pleasant, but unexceptional. We asked them to arrange for a car to take us to the airport on the Asian side (which Easyjet uses) and, as they had when we arrived, put it on our bill. However, the driver expected us to pay him directly, which posed a bit of a problem as we were out of Euros by that time. I was unaware that the hotel did not follow our directions as the desk clerk did not give me an itemized bill or even a receipt on departure. I was also very displeased with the one restaurant recommendation from the hotel. We asked them to make reservations at a particular fish restaurant, but they told us it was booked and suggested a restaurant called Yenge\u00c3\u00a7. I ought to have been wary as this restaurant sends a shuttle to pick up customers, but it was getting late and we decided to ignore our instincts. I still can't figure out where this place is located, but the neighborhood was definately dodgy. The restaurant itself was not particularly comfortable. The food was okay, but over-priced (one \"large\" shrimp was five pounds!|). I realize the hotel gets a commission and I don't mind as long as I don't feel taken, but I strongly recommend that you do not let the hotel send you there. The food in Istanbul is wonderful and there are many terrific places to eat from modest meatball and kebab cafes to white tablecloth restaurants such as Hamdi, where you don't mind spending more for dinner because the atmosphere (as well as the food) is worth it. I do think the Nena offers good value for money, but it is a 3 star establishment in every respect so keep your expectations in line.

A short walk to the tram, grand bazaar, blue mosque, etc. With the A/C turned on, you could not hear the tram nor the 5am prayer. Others we spoke to in other hotels were woken up every morning, not us. I think this is because our room didn't face the mosques that were close by. Friendly staff. Access to internet in the lobby. Good breakfast on the rooftop, with views of Topkapi, Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque. Clean room. Inexpensive mini bar. Good shower. Free transfers in both directions if you stay a minimum # of nights. You can use the roof deck at night. I grabbed a drink from the minibar every night and went to the room and took in the sights. If you pay in cash, you can pay in Lira, Euro or Dollars with a very good exchange rate. Cons: If you get up late, you will hear people going to the roof top for breakfast and they usually make a lot of noise. The bedspread didn't fit the bed completely. Needed to use the extra one provided so we didn't fight over it every night. The light switches in the room are fixed to the headboard of the bed.

Here are my few points on the hotel: The hotel was in a good location in Sultanhamet (so were all the other hotels in the area!!!). Breakfast was ok to poor. I heard some people at breakfast time say it was exellent. I could not think of one thing exellent about it. I don't like places that serve orange squash for breakfast (I think it is tight). We stayed in a small room with NO external light. It was miserable. Luckily (and kindly - after a bit of discussion) they moved to the room 401 \"suite\" on the 3rd day. Suite? They must be joking - this was the room I would expect all rooms in this \"highly recommended\" hotel to be like. Avoid rooms with room numbers: xx5 Restaurant was totally overpriced, and only made somewhat reasonable when we used the 50% discount coupon. Maybe the other hotels at this price in Istanbul were so bad, that's why this hotel is highly recommended (relatively speaking) by trip advisor. Overall- it did the job. It provided us with a bed, a shower. No more. Would I recommend: If you like simple accomodation, then is suitable. If you have low standards, then you will think this is place is heaven.

Situated in the heart of Sultanahmet, the famous historic district of Istanbul, we could walk most everywhere the guidebook mentioned and felt instantly at home. When we arrived we were promptly greeted with welcome signs at the airport and immediately felt at ease in what could have been an overwhelmingly vast city. Once at the hotel, the staff was eager to be attentive. We found their friendship and efficiency really heartwarming and helpful during our multiple stays in the hotel, as we took off for more remote areas of Turkey a couple times and used Hotel Nena as our home base to leave things and get messages while we were off exploring. THey made an effort to remember us and our requests, and were always ready and waiting on our return. (The pick ups and send offs to the airport were so convenient and reliable!) The rooms at Hotel Nena are modest but nicely arranged, with beautiful sheets and comforters! Hair dryers in the bathroom were an unexpected plus! The hotel is situated on a little narrow street off the main drag so traffic and noises of the night are minimal ,which is quite a contrast to other small places we've stayed where sleep is limited because of night life and relaxation is never really an option. The desk people made helpful suggestions, used maps to orient us and taught us the important landmarks for finding our way back 'home\" each time we ventured out. In addition to being able to walk to so many of the guidebook sites in Sultanahmet, we also found using the tram made visiting more distant sites a real joy and it was so close to the hotel! And, it was cool and easy to use. There is a terrace restaurant upstairs at Hotel Nena with views of historic Istanbul that rival any postcard! Each morning a colorful array of fruits, cheeses, meats, and eggs were laid out beautifully and generously. Breads, juices, teas and coffee as well are served without limit. This we found was most unusual and setting out with a healthy and complete breakfast made all the difference to our energy and stamina during the day. Dinner was served downstairs or up, at our will. The food was delicious, well prepared and beautifully served... and overlooking the mosques and palaces, what ask could you more??? The staff were so amenable to our requests and so warmly relating. Service to all the guests was just exceptional!!. Obviously Hotel Nena is taking great care in training and maintaining high standards of hospitality! Using the internet freely, when and as needed, was most appreciated and very helpful when we ran into a few complications at home and needed contact quickly. A thoughtful gesture to provide it for guests and make it so easy to use night or day. Congratulations on the English efforts of the staff as well!! We don't always expect it when we travel, but when resolving issues, planning a day and making decisions it was so helpful! The men and women were always so conscientious, respectful, and careful in most professional ways. Attention to small details can make or break a stay! It certainly enhanced ours at Hotel Nena. They made us feel like family. We also noticed that those working there seem very heppy to be at Hotel Nena. It comes through in their spirit and service. We were very sorry when our stay had to come to an end! But we now look forward to a return visit, and in the meantime have recommended it to several we know who will be going there soon.

On our first night, our room was very nice but small. We asked if other rooms were available but there were none that night. We were upgraded for the rest of our stay however at no extra charge. The upgrade room was fantastic - large and spacious, with the highlight being the enormous balcony overlooking the Blue Mosque. As nice as the rooms were, our stay was made most memorable by the reception staff. Nothing was too much trouble, from suggesting sights to see, to loaning us their Lonely Planet book. The service was quick, efficient, and very friendly. The breakfasts were lovely with a wide range of items to choose from - again, you could eat on a large balcony over looking the Mosque if you wished.

I chose this hotel after reading the reviews posted here and all the good things people have said about this hotel are true. We were too late getting one of the four deluxe rooms with balcony, so had two doubles instead. A bit of a squeeze, but fine considering we were out most fo the day. So if you want the bigger rooms, book early. The Nena is hard to beat on these counts: Location: If you're a tourist, you want to be in Sultanahmet. Several of the major sights are in this historic district and within a short walking distance of the Nena - the Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar ... or you just hop on the easy-to-use tramway two minutes from the hotel and get around. There's no shortage of good places to eat in the area too. Cleanliness: The hotel and the rooms are clean and kept spotless. It was great coming back to made-up rooms and fresh towels every day. Staff: On my last (business) trip to Istanbul in 2004, I stayed at the Hilton. I can't remember a soul from there. Several people at the Nena made an impression, and one I know will last, because of their friendliness and a great service attitude. From Muzaffer and Emre at the front office to the cheery young women at breakfast, people were simply fab. By the end of our stay, we felt we were leaving friends. The worst thing happened when we missed our flight home and had to make new arrangements late at night. I was most grateful then, that we were dealing with the good people at this hotel, who made things easier, and got us the extra nights' stay we needed. I love Istanbul as a place to visit. Great sights, great food, great people. The one downer? The city's taxi drivers. Four of the six we took were dishonest and unashamedly out to rip off tourists. The two who used their meters showed up the rest. Learn to use the public transport and save yourself some burst blood vessels. My son and I wanted to do a half day excursion and the choice was hiring a taxi or going with a driver recommended by the Nena. We went with the latter. Hassan proved to be a courteous, friendly chap who stayed cool through horrendous traffic and unexpected diversions that made our drive longer than anticipated. He also brought back the camera we left in the car. If you need a car and driver, ask Mr Muzaffer at the front office for Hassan.", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cgreat disappointment\u201d", "Author": "AucklandKat", "ReviewID": "UR5376317", "Content": "Having read all the reviews about Nena hotel we cancelled our original booking and decided to stay there for the entire week of our visit to Instanbul.

The Nena was lovely, it looks great (outside and in) and it's in a perfect location near the Blue Mosque. Our room (402) was large enough, spotless, comfortable and had a nice bathroom (good shower). The balcony was big enough to have a table and two chairs, with a view of the mosque; though the floors below would have their view obscured by a 3-story building opposite. Breakfast was above average - a buffet on the top floor restaurant, with three of the tables on an outside balcony; beautiful view overlooking the Mosques and Bosporus. The staff were fantastic - friendly without being ingratiating, professionally dealing with every request that a bunch of fussy tourists could throw at them. They even throw in free transfers to/from the airport if you stay for three nights or longer.

Because of my work, I travel too frequently including Europe and Eastern Asia and I do not ever hesitate to recommend you this hotel : Here are the reasons : 1- In Hotel Nena, you pay less than what you have to pay in other cities of Europe and the service you get is much much better. 2- In addition to being located in a perfect touristic venue, it is close to business centers as well. (Well, Istanbul is BIG. If your business is in the other corner of the city, I have nothing to say :) ) 3- Breakfast and terrace restaurant are perfect !!! Nothing could be a better start to a day. 4- Excellent staff ! Both friendly and professional. Their reservation system is cool. You can see all the details of your reservation by logging into your personal space with your password. You can make special requests there and book any extra services if you like. 5- What they offer : Airport wellcoming (I have booked from their own web page and got this offer.), hot water 24 hours, a working A/C, discount coupon for restaurant, VERY clean rooms and a cosy garden cafe. Well, I have more to list. But I think above 5 items are enough for you to get an insight about to hotel. Go there and experience !

It's fabulously located in the Old City smack in the middle of all the tourist sites and a perfect place to stay if you only have a few days to see Istanbul's major tourist attractions. They have a computer system whereby you can state your preferences and they give you a private space before you arrive to confirm your booking and make special requests etc...I found this the most efficient reservations system I have ever used especially because they respond immediately.In general this gave me a very good, if somewhat overly optimistic, impression of the hotel way before we arrived. However they knew ,because they were told through this great computer system, I was disabled ,and yet they sent a van to pick us up at the airport whose driver was outside the arrivals hall, this was very good , but who made us walk a quite long distance to the garage instead( he saw I needed 2 sticks to walk ) of telling us to wait and bringing the van around to the front of the airport. This, despite my companion telling him I couldn't walk. He didn't offer to help with the trolley either but did, in all fairness load the suitcases onto the van ( hmmmm...did he have a choice?) So negatives were beginning. Arrival at the hotel late at night was OK and went as smoothly as to be expected. The room was exactly as pictured on the web site and they had provided the extra pillows we had requested ( for my legs). The lighting in the room was awful, though, and they did not provide the reading lamp I had requested(having read some comments on this web site)...the receptionist simply came up and took the shades off some wall sconces! Be careful, though, I suspect we had one of 2 best rooms in the house (room 401) as the others most probably are dark and facing walls etc... Our room, being on the top floor, had an adequate but not fabulous view of St Sophia and the Blue Mosque as allot of the roof tops are in the way. But we had a lovely balcony but as it rained constantly during our visit, we didn't use it. Would be excellent in the summer. The room is perfectly OK for a 3 star hotel, except for the lighting, as mentioned above. It had a very comfortable bed, nice sheets, (terrible cheap acrylic pillows though)and the small bathroom had excellent towels some amenities and a beautiful bathrobe ...but only one bathrobe for 2 people! The bed has switches to control the room lighting but they are located just behind your head so I turned them on and off all night! The most annoying thing about the room was that the curtains didn't draw all the way and there was no way of preventing being woken up by the light of day, especially as we were on the top floor. This is something I have never had to deal with in a hotel ever before and is a definite negative. Housekeeping was just OK as they forgot to empty full wastebaskets and sweep the floor on the 2nd day. The best and worst was the restaurant. Breakfast (included in the room rate)was , to put it mildly, terrific! The breakfast waitresses were the friendliest I have experienced for a long time( one even loaned us her stored value public transportation card) and the buffet was varied and good. Altogether a marvelous way to start the day. Dinner was another story. They gave us on arrival a 50% discount voucher in the restaurant.This encouraged us to try it. Mistake. Almost 2/3 of the comprehensive menu was not available...and what we had was not good. The maitre D' was more interested in selling carpets to us than taking care of the food and the waiter stood over us as we signed the bill and made sure we knew service was not included. A terrble and most forgettable dinner experience. Other than that I can't say I do NOT recommend this hotel. I do recommend it , if only because of the location ,and, in general, the staff ...not overly friendly (except for the breakfast staff) but certainly adequate.
