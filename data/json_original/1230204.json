The room, even though we stayed in a junior suite was lacking in the basics ie iPod dock, free English speaking TV channels, effective air-con and was not as clean as it should have been. Major annoyances: House keeping, on check-in we had to wait until 15:30hrs for the room and on the Saturday our room wasn't cleaned until 19:00hrs! House music at breakfast, I mean come on, is boom boom boom really necessary? The overall dirtyness of the spa area, the hot tub, hmmm, cold and the sauna too small. We couldn't get a wifi signal in our room (3rd floor) but it was free, as it should be as the hotel is not cheap. On the plus side, the staff, very welcoming and friendly.

A few examples: The first morning there was a lot of noise in the corrider from cleaning or service persons (hoovering?!). The shower head was so big (or the cabin so small), that it was impossible to find a place out of the shower. The light buttons were dark, like the walls and the rest of the interior, so it was hard to find the switches. Furthermore, there was no indication on or logic behind the switches. So each time, you had to find the switches again and try them all to see which was the right one. The space between the foot end of the bed and the (round!) wall would have been barely enough to pass inattentively without the TV; with the mounted flat screen you really had to pay attention when passing. WiFi was free, but then the hassle with the log-on screen, usernames and passwords. Only valid for 24 hours and we stayed 3 nights. Why not just a password?! Several times the cleaners were already close too being in our room, when we were still in bed. The red wine I took from the mini bar was not replaced by a new one. A glass had a crack and they had me get a new one myself.

Their feedback was also very good and we would all come back. Good bits: -Great beds, I had a twin room, my friends had king size beds, my room was on the 5th floor, overlooking the courtyard, very quiet, exactly as I wanted. -Lovely bath, wide and large, with good water pressure to fill it quick, -The breakfast was very tasty, good quality bread, salmon and eggs, not a huge selection but there was more than enough and everything I tried tasted good, the tables were clean and tidy and it must be great in summer. -Bathroom was a bit odd as it was in full view of the room, but as I was staying alone, that wasn't a problem. I wouldn't mind sharing a room with a partner but less likely to do so with a friend. There was enough shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, soap for the stay plus a nail file, shower cap, sewing kit and cotton buds/pads in a nice looking box. The bath robe and slippers were a nice touch and very usefull to use at the spa. There were 6 towels in total, 2 hand, 2 bath and 2 large ones for the spa. -The Spa area was nice too, I'm sure they could improve a bit, but all in all I had a good time in the jacuzzi, steam and sauna. There were some guys getting lucky in the jacuzzi but nothing too heavy, really this isn't a place for conservative people or families, specially with underage kids. -My room had enough floor space around the bed and was above my expectation. My friend's rooms were a bit smaller, but one had a jacuzzi and the other a fantastic power shower with lots of water jets. -The staff were efficient but not over friendly, they seemed to do their job well but kept chit chat to a minimum. I'm ok with that. The music on the loddy was nice too. -Free wifi, although it wasn't very fast. I really hope they can re-think the wifi voucher policy, maybe offer codes lasting for 2 and 3 nights, so we don't have to walk all the way to the reception and ask for a new code after 24 hours. Now a bit of constructive criticism: -The jacuzzi wasn't as hot as the ones I tried in Spain and in the UK. In fact, it was the coldest I've ever tried. It could only fit 6 people and was very busy in the evenings. There was space in the solarium for an external hot tub, maybe as an overspill for busy weekends, hopefully management is reading this and can keep it in mind. I really hoped the jacuzzi was bigger. Also, the jacuzzi is outside and the wind was really strong, so bear this in mind if you're not used to the cold. -The floor between the jacuzzi and gym area can get very wet. This is a tricky area as there are showers near the chairs and people walk dripping water all over the place. The steam room could have been hotter and the lighting in the sauna is too bright. -Mirrors in the corridors with black walls... i knew my friends would walk into the mirror after a night out and it happened! It can look stylish but it's a bit over the top. -the bar was always empty, which is a shame as it's a lovely space, maybe the hotel could promote some nights/events, like guest speed dating or happy hour / meet and greet. Anyway, I was nit picking and would love to return to this hotel for another weekend if the price is right. It can be expensive at times and it would compete with 5 star hotels nearby but for people looking to go out and enjoy Berlin's gay nightlife, this is a great option.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, nice service but a sting in the tail\u201d", "Author": "TheGoldenMidas", "ReviewID": "UR122863909", "Content": "Had a short stay at this hotel in early January.

I usually stay in a guest house in Schoneberg but decided to try out the Axel Hotel (also in Schoneberg) for a change. And I'm glad we did. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed and the staff were really friendly. They made sure everyone had what they needed to enjoy their stay. We booked months in advance to take advantage of a 22% rate discount. But on the day we checked in the rate for our rooms was actually lower than the rate we pre-paid. So over Christmas you could wait to get a cheaper rate. The hotel appeared not to be busy when we were there. We stayed a week and I wish we could have stayed longer. We booked the junior suites. They were actually bigger than I expected. Nice big and comfy beds, a big walk through wardrobe, desk area, lounge area, and a massive bathroom with a big bathtub, and lots of clean towels each day. The rooms are cleaned very well every day. The only thing I did not like about my room was that no kettle/tea/coffee making facilities. I asked the desk about where I could get a tea, and they said I could order one through room service. Room service charges 4.50 euro delivery fee on top of the cost of the item. So I wasn't going to pay that much for cups of tea. Even a self serve communal tea/coffee facility would also be nice. Also, the WiFi set up is a bit crazy. You have to get a code from the front desk every 24 hours to keep your internet access going and you have to type the codes in every time you want to access the internet. They print them out on an A4 piece of paper, and you get one for each device. So the two of us had 2 devices each, so over the 8 days we went through 32 codes on 32 sheets of paper. The internet was also pretty sketchy. I had slow internet in room 502 and my friend could not get internet at all inside 302 and ended up buying a stick from the Vodaphone. The rooms are doubled glazed so the traffic noise on Lietzenburger Str is not too bad. But best to ask for a high level room if you stay on the street side. The hotel has a gym with minimal equipment. We used the Fitness First down the road mostly. But on the top floor is also a sauna, steam room and outdoor hot tub. Being a mostly gay hotel we liked the social side of staying there. We met people from all over the world. Everyone is really friendly! I should also mention that the Axel is very well located to the massive department store KaDaWe and the busy shopping strip on Kurfurstendam Str. We shopped a lot and found it easy to bring back bags. It is also very close to a Post Office so we could send some things home. The Axel is also very close to some very nice restaurants and bars. We had some of the best food we've ever eaten in that area.

Check-in was efficient, not exactly friendly, but did the job. We were able to check into our room at 11.30am which was welcomed after a trans-atlantic flight. The Junior Suite was excellent - great color scheme, well-sized, good amenities and a great, comfortable bed. The wireless didn't seem to work in our room because we were pretty far from the router, I believe - but it worked fine in the common areas. There are public computers to use.

After check-in early on a Saturday afternoon for a three-night stay, we went to our room and discovered that the light bulb in the toilet room was burned out (the bathroom is divided with the toilet in a separate room). We called down and the front desk clerk himself (named Mathias, according to his badge) came up to the room. He took a quick look at the bulb and announced it was a \"special\" bulb that could not be easily changed. He said there was \"absolutely nothing\" that could be done about it until Monday as there would be no technician available until then. We informed Mathias that we were not going to stay in a room for two nights going to the toilet in the pitch dark. He said \"perhaps\" we could change rooms the next day (Sunday) but said it was \"impossible\" to change rooms that day (Saturday) because the hotel was all sold out. \"All the other guests have checked in?\" I asked. \"No,\" he said. \"Well then put us in another room and give the room with the burnt out bulb to someone else,\" I demanded. Mathias sighed. \"I cannot possibly do that. It wouldn't be fair to those other guests.\" I informed Mathias that we were not going to stay in the room and that we were going to re-assemble all our belongings and go down to the lobby until they put us in another room. We went down to the lobby, where we were subjected to insults and sarcasm by Mathias, who continued to insist there was nothing that could be done until Monday. When I suggested that he call someone and have them explain how to change the bulb so he could do it himself, he was aghast. \"Do I look like I wear a blue uniform like a mechanic?\" he asked. When I continued to insist that we were not going anywhere until the bulb or room was changed, he grew sarcastic. \"Do you think you are the king?\" he asked. \"No,\" I responded. \"I am a paying guest who expects a light in the bathroom.\" As Mathias was continuing to insist there was nothing that good be done, another person (not in a hotel uniform) intervened and tried to help Mathias explain why it was perfectly reasonable for hotel guests to stay in a room with no light in the bathroom. \"Who are you?\" I finally asked this other person. He informed me that his was Mathias' \"friend.\" (The hotel manager later told me he also works for the hotel as a part-time masseur.) After several more minutes of drama, the ever-surly Mathias made a phone call, got a ladder and went up to the room. Five minutes later he returned, threw the room key at me and announced the light bulb had been changed. Throughout this adventure I repeatedly asked to speak with the manager. Mathias said the manager was off and would not be back until Monday. I asked to speak with him by phone. Mathias refused. \"It's a private number,\" he announced. I told him he could call the number himself and just give me the phone. Mathias still refused. I asked for the manager's business card. Mathias gave me a hotel business card that did not have any individual's name on it. He told me to call the number on the card. \"The manager will answer that number?\" I asked. \"No,\" he said. \"If you call that number it will ring here and I will answer it.\" I declined to call the number. Had the room not been pre-paid, I would have checked into another hotel, but we ended up staying for the entire three nights. On Monday I spoke with the hotel manager, who admitted that his desk clerk had acted inappropriately, but made excuses for him. \"That doesn't sound like him. Maybe he was tired or in a bad mood.\" For our trouble, we got breakfast included in the rate. The only good thing I can say about the whole incident is that the waiter from the restaurant (named Michael) who came to cover the desk was professional and polite. All the drama we endured from his colleague, Mathias, over a lightbulb that (it turned out) could be changed in five minutes was unacceptable. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and never experienced like what I experienced at the Axel Hotel in Berlin. Despite the manager's efforts to make excuses, there is no excuse for the treatment we received. We will never stay in that hotel, or any Axel Hotel, again. The free breakfast was nice.

Not having a comfortable sleep and not being able to find a comfortable temperature are two big issues and whilst the Axel Hotel in Berlin was quite OK in all other respects, I would probably stay elsewhere next time because of these reasons.

I know the hotel chain goes with the tag-line \"heterofriendly\" and there were quite a few straight couples staying, but if I'm honest I'd probably warn straight people off staying unless they are comfortably open minded! We paid a little bit more for a superior room and to be honest, I'm not sure if it was worth it. The room was oppressively dark and didn't have a wardrobe but it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable with good quality linen. Slightly annoying that there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers although I'm sure they would have provided another if asked. The 6th floor spa/gym was very pleasant with a small gym, showers, sauna, steam room and hot tub. Be warned most guests are men and the spa (despite requests for people to be appropriately attired) tended to be a \"naked zone\" for many of the guests. However, we didn't see anything untoward going on so fortunately it wasn't like a gay sauna. Also it was slightly disappointing that the hot tub was more a \"lukewarm tub\" and that there were no additional towels available.

Big mistake - the Berlin property was horrible! I won't even speak about design or decor of the hotel - that's subjective and some people would like it and some won't - it's an all black hotel - probably to hide the dirt. I didn't like the design but that's not my issue with this hotel at all. The issue was with the complete garbage they call service. The General Manager, Oliver Boehme likes to respond to trip advisor reviews I see, but perhaps he should focus on training his staff or getting rid of them and hiring better ones to make better use of his time. There are the same few people working at the front desk every day - they have no Concierge, or any other services to speak of besides a rooftop fitness room/sauna. The lobby bar and restaurant never had a soul in them - even on the weekends in the summer ....in a gay hotel...in the gay neighborhood - kind of a sign right there that it's a poorly run establishment. I arrived around 9am and the front desk clerk looked at me and said \"you're too early, you can't check in\" - not, \"I'm sorry, we have no rooms available\", not, \"let me see how long it will be\" - just - \"you're too early, you can't check in\". Later in my stay I asked that same clerk some reccommendations on where to go out. I was floored when his response was \"I don't know\". You're gay, working in a gay hotel, in a gay area and a paying guest asks for some suggestions and you say \"I don't know\"?? - I mean even if you don't go out yourself - being a hotel employee you should be aware of your area so you can help guests (a far cry from what they do at Axel). One morning asked a female desk clerk directions, which she rattled off as if I was born and raised in Berlin. When I asked her to write them down, she rolled her eyes like it was the greatest chore. The other female desk clerk never looked up from the desk - she would keep her head down even when guests approached. I asked the original desk clerk for a wake up call on my final night which he confirmed. When I got home later that evening and double checked, sure enough - no wake up call noted. The evening clerk's response to my dismay was \"I don't know - I've been on vacation and just got back\" - Thank god I double checked knowing the shoddy service levels. I cannot believe the Axel chain tolerates this kind of poor service. Hopefully before you respond to my review, you'll have some good news about staff turnover, training and a better presence from senior management Mr. Boehme.

From the very beginning I experienced the poor level of maintenance at the hotel and overall my stay was a resounding disappointment. Check-in: I was informed that my \u201cunchangeable & non-cancellable\u201d pre-paid reservation was in fact not pre-paid, because, and I quote:, \"what our website says and does is two different things\". So Axel's administrative procedures are misleading and not clear. And of course it gets worse, much worse. Standard room: Extremely small and not cheap. Don\u2019t even think about renting this type of room if you are 2 persons, because even with only one suitcase, you could hardly move around the room. Junior suite: I later moved to a junior suite and while this type of room is larger, if you happen to be 2 people, only 1 person can sit down as there is only one chair (again, this is in a junior suite). Other: The hotel's TV system does not work properly at all. At the gym/spa area, the training equipment is not in good order and make so much noise that it disturbs the other guests. The air conditioning system in the hotel simply did NOT work. This is important, as you cannot really open the windows and the hotel is located on a busy street. The Spa area in general is not well maintained at all. The air is poor and the only air duct present in the gym is so dirty and completely filled with dust and grime that it is probably a breeding ground for mould and mildew and who knows what other air borne bacteria! See attached picture. And this in an area where you are supposed to be breathing heavily and exercising. The whole SPA floor area was covered in cold water (uncomfortable, very slippery and dangerous). The hot sauna was not hot at all and the steam sauna was so cold that nobody stayed in it. The outdoor Jacuzzi was also very cold and made staying outside impossible as well. This is without a doubt, the worst spa area of any hotel I have ever been in. Very very disappointing, especially if you consider the type of clientele are trying to appeal to. Room service: Ineffective & rude. I had to order some ice as there were no ice machines on any of the floors (this is 2011 by the way\u2026). After waiting for over 30 minutes, I decided to go down and get it myself. I was informed by a very rude waiter that he had been to my room 3 times (obviously he had gone to the wrong room). To penalize ME, he adds: \u201cnormally the ice is free, but because I had to go upstairs 3 times, I am going to charge you 4.50 Euros for the ice. Nice \u201con the fly\u201d policy making and flexible pricing if you ask me. Housekeeping: Highly inefficient and disorganized. Two days in a row, after leaving the \"clean room\" sign on our door at 9am, it was still not clean when we returned to the hotel at 5pm!!!. I had to move the bed slightly because I dropped something behind it - the walls behind the bed where stained and dirty and the floor was full of dust (see picture). There were also some very nasty (and very visible) stains on the bedcover = gross (see pic). The carpets in the hallways were dirty. When returning to my room one day, I found a letter and a fax on my desk that was not even addressed to me. A member of staff had left confidential correspondence addressed to the hotel on the desk of a hotel guest. Nice move. There was also a break and large cracks in a large mirror that no one thought was necessary to fix or replace. I was so frustrated by my stay at this hotel that I asked to speak with the hotel manager. I was informed that he was not in, but given his business card. I then took the time to write Mr. Olivier Boehme a detailed complaint and recommendation letter that was sent on the 10th of July. I specifically asked him to get back to me with his reactions and reply. It is now the 16th of August \u2013 so more than a month later and he didn\u2019t even have the professionalism or decency to respond. Hence that is the reason I have decided to make this review public on Trip Advisor. I believe Axel hotels could have been on to something with the positioning of their chain, but frankly, it appears more like they are trying to take advantage of a clientele that they consider won over in advance and not worth working too hard for. What they fail to recognize is that this is also a well travelled and demanding clientele.

Additionally, the fancy design meant that the power shower leaked all the way across the bathroom onto the carpet. Great design is only great when it works ....

We stayed in a junior suite having already heard the standard rooms are on the small side, and I'm glad we did, though the suite was really small & badly organised in terms of layout. The bathrooms are pleasant with a good shower, although I distinctly disliked the clear red Perspex wall between the bathroom and the head of the bed in the bedroom - it gives you no sense of privacy at all. Storage wise, well there is none really apart from 6 hangers & 3 tiny draws for clothes, so if on more than a 2 night stay it would be frustrating. An annoying part of the room was that whilst the room had good blackout curtains, there was a window in the bathroom that then let's the early morning light in because of the red Perspex between the 2 rooms. There's a small bar on the roof although because of the rain we didn't have chance to try it. The gym/sauna/ steam room area were quite nice,though there's not much in the way of equipment and the sauna & steam room are on the small side. The downstairs bar area is quite a nice place to chill out because of the relaxing music & lack of people.\u00a0 We\u00a0had pre booked the breakfast for our 3 night stay & whilst the first mornings breakfast was pleasant & reasonably well stocked, the Sunday morning breakfast was a farce, it was not especially busy, nor were we late, however there was either no \u00a0food available or when it actually got replenished, there was then no crockery!

In our jr suite, the bathroom, shower and sink were in area separated from bed by strange see-through wall; the access point on either side was curved mirrored walls (think circus Fun House) that I literally walked into twice -- in daylight. The high-tech chrome shower was so confusing that, with some embarrassment, we had to ask for help from the front desk to adjust the water (a need that has surely never surfaced in 30 years of travels). The fact that the desk clerk had trouble, too, and could only adjust the water after wrapping a towel around one of the knobs was small consolation.

I thoroughly enjoyed the central location from which the majority of bars and clubs in Berlin's gay commuinty are only few minutes walking distance from the hotel's front door. The neighbourhood is a tree filled section of the city and across the street in the next \"platz\" is the subway, and Berlin's finest Department Store \"KaDeWe\" (keep your eye out for US celebrities shopping in the stores vast floors). The hotel was great value for the money. I stayed in a junior suite (Buenos Aires suite) that was large, had an excellent views from it's 5 floor perch, and a great bathroom with large jazcuzzi tub and seperate toilet area with a large seperate glass shower. Staff were very gracious and helpful in offering maps, club and sight seeing tips etc. The restaurant on the main floor offered a good but nothing special bfast in the morning that \"is not included\" in your room rate. This hotel is \"hetero\" friendly, but make no mistake about it....they are targeting the LGBT community and the vast majority of guests were gay. The top floor of the hotel housed a spa area with good wieghts and equipment, a sauna (too hot), steam room (too cold) and outdoor jacuzzi overlooking the city (way too cold water temperature). The area was often strewn with used towels and sometimes garbage, the hotel should have staff checking and cleaning the area hourly. Also the hotel provides a computer with internet access on floor 2 and 3 but not 4 and 5. This means that often you are waiting or can not access the computer. I would recommend that the hotel include work stations on the other two floors as well. While I did not get charged for wirless internet in my room, the hotel literature says there is a charge. Perhaps they stopped actually charging as the system is often \"overloaded\" and you can't log on unless its very early in the morning or late at night. I can not understand how a city the size of Berlin and a hotel in the heart of that city can not offer wirless access free of charge that works properly. Also you must pay to watch TV. Again I found this odd, movies I understand being charged for for regular television? Be prepared their King size beds are simply two standard beds taped by the legs together. This means that unless you sleep on either side of the bed you slip in the crack that runs down the middle. Again in a country like Germany and a city the size of Berlin do they not manufacture King size beds? Would I stay there again? Absolutely, but in hopes that the spa area, wirless service and bed issue be attended to.

The breakfast was okay to the price but nothing special and not what you normally get at a 4 star hotel. The spa area is nice but sometimes it gets to sexualised. That made us stay away from the nice spa area, as it is not relaxing to be in a spa where people are very directly aproaching people. If that is what the hotel wants then it is fine, but then it is not a hetero friendly hotel as it advertise to be. Even I who is gay found it a bit to much. The spa would have got 5 if it was more \"family\" friendly. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and the hotel is in overall quiet nice. There was a nice warm up party to the CSD parade.

I booked a superior room for my stay which on arrival was disappointing. I was told that the room is the same size as a standard room but has a jacuzzi bath. It was small, particularly the bathroom. It took all of about two minutes to decide on paying the extra for a Junior Suite. The space in the Junior Suite was much more comfortable. The rooms would be your worst cleaning nightmare at home. They are definately chic with black featuring throughout the room and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The shower leaks water all over the bathroom but there were quite a few towels in the room that could be used to mop it up. The cleaning is not great. We found a sock belonging to someone else caught up below the curtain and the black obviously shows up all the missed areas. The black is not an excuse though ... the window at the end of the fourth floor corridor was absolutely dust ridden and makes you wonder if that level of attention manifests elsewhere in the hotel? Breakfast at the hotel was over priced for what was availble and with just one waiter and the cook the buffet went unstocked as more guests arrived to eat. I would suggest going out locally for breakfast. There is plently to chose from. I never ate dinner at the hotel. I did go into the restaurant on one evening but as there was no staff on hand again we decided to eat out instead. Without doubt the best thing about this hotel is the location. It is excellently located for the underground system as the station is about a five minute walk across the road and the main sights are a very short journey away. The station is in a wonderful square with excellent restaurants and shops. I would recommend breakfast at the cake shop on the left as you enter the square. The cakes are good too! I am a fitness fanatic so it was useful to have a fitness facility at the hotel. A treadmill, cross trainer, bike and weights were satisfactory to maintain a regime on a short trip away. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpul. To summarise, I would say that the hotel is OK but lacks the attention to detail to make it great. It would do better if it ensured staff were always visible and on hand for guests and the cleaning needs improving.

WTF. Berlin is a late city...I don't need a mother to check on me while I'm on vacation. They stop cleaning rooms by 3pm...a little early by my liking *They allowed a film company to take over most of the rooms on my floor and shoot a porn in the halls, etc...annoying (well maybe it would have been less annoying if the porn stars were hot...but they weren't so it was annoying) *the kitchen is effecitvely closed...they have signs posted that the kitchen is only open thurs-sunday - i guess this is due to the fact they don't do enough business...but it gives the \"public\" spaces a very empty feeling *Charging for WiFi. In todays era when you can get free WiFi at a coffee shop across the street and everywhere else, hotels that still charge (and 9 euro a day) for it seem out of touch. Also don't you hate it when a hotel lists WiFi as one of the room ammenities but they don't mention you have to pay for it? Me too! *the worst part was the front desk guy Luis. He had such a sour attitude. when i checked in he seemed almost like I was bothering him.

They have tried to make the hotel seem larger with an extensive use of black walls and mirrors, in fact they are everywhere and they can be a bit disconcerting after a late night! It all looks very 'designer' which is what they think urban queens like, but comfort and practicality are also appreciated. The rooms have a ridiculously small amount of storage space (bring your own hangers as you only get three per person) and there are very few cupboards or drawers, presumably as this would spoil the chi-chi desiger space - again a triumph of style over practicality. We stayed in a double room and yet they only provide one dressing gown and one pair of slippers. The rooms are generally quiet (thanks to the drone of the air conditioning masking background noise) and the beds comfortable. However, doors slam at all hours. Why couldn't they install doors that close quietly? The gym and spa were OK, but didn't seem to be serviced very well - no water or cups on a couple of occasions and no air conditioning. The breakfast was good quality, but over priced, particularly if you haven't booked it in advance. There are much cheaper places to eat down the road, including 'Windows' restaurant where you can get a huge breakfast at a fraction of the cost. The best thing about the Axel is the location. It is only a modest walk from the U-bahn station to get into the centre and it is close to the heart of the Shoneberg gay district, which has a wonderfully relaxed feel to it. Several bars are literally just a staggering distance away, together with many good restaurants. The staff at the Axel are mostly friendly and helpful and hotel is clean.

This new hotel is well situated on the edge of the popular Schoneberg gay district. The d\u00e9cor is modern and classy if you like lots of black and gold. Squeezing a hotel of this size on such a small site was clearly a challenge for the designers. The result has not been particularly successful in terms of how some of the rooms actually work. Our 6th floor City room cost a fortune and was so small that it could only be used for sleeping. Given this is supposedly a 4 star hotel, we were surprised our room did not include: \u2022 Chair(s) \u2022 Table or desk \u2022 Luggage stand \u2022 Kettle/ mugs/ tea or coffee \u2022 Minibar or fridge \u2022 Ironing board & iron \u2022 Wardrobe The room has a large comfortable double bed which takes up most of the floorspace. There is no headboard as there is a furniture unit behind. Circulation space in the room is approx 4 feet to the bottom and to one side only of the bed, which is almost hard-up against the external glass wall. This makes getting in and out of bed for the person on that side awkward. Also, the window cannot open properly as the foot of the bed is in the way. The extensive use of black d\u00e9cor in such a small room gave it a claustrophobic feel at times. There is no separate bathroom. Instead there is a shower space and WC compartment. The wash basin is more in the body of the room next to the clothes hanging/ drawer space. The shower space has an internal glass partition onto the entrance way \u2013 so if someone opens the door to your room when you\u2019re in the shower, the view could be interesting! The clear glass shower door opens near the bed \u2013 so not much privacy when washing. There are not enough hooks/ rails for hanging bathtowels, so they have to be slung over the shower door making the room look untidy. The WC compartment is cramped and is in clear view of the bed. It has a flimsy sliding door which doesn\u2019t afford much privacy if you\u2019re sharing. We preferred to use the larger WC in the wellness centre across the hall. Temperature control in the room was not good \u2013 it seemed stuffy and warm regardless of whether the thermostat was set at 10 or 25 degrees. There are heavy black curtains on the window \u2013 no blinds. In summer, with the sun shining directly you\u2019d have to keep the curtains closed and I guess it could get sticky. There was a background stale (bad drain) smell in our room throughout our stay. There is a narrow decked walkway outside the window with no fixed barriers to prevent someone from another room walking right by your window or coming in if you\u2019ve left it open. Wireless internet was \u20ac9 for 24 hours \u2013 slow connection. Front of house service was dispassionate, and staff seemed more intent on looking glamorous than actually doing anything useful. Housekeeping was discreet and of a reasonable standard. The City room is billed as a double but would work best for single occupancy. If you\u2019re a couple and intent on staying at the Axel, go for a suite \u2013 but it\u2019ll cost you the other arm and the other leg. There are better Berlin hotels you could spend your money on than this one. Setting aside the stylish gloss, the Axel City room was one of the smallest most expensive and impractical rooms we\u2019ve encountered.

The hotel location is convenient and easy to get to. The neighborhood surrounding is filled with restaurants and shopping opportunities - including KaDeWie - Germany's largest shopping center. There is also easy access to nightlife including the local gay scene. The room itself was quite nice and had a modern feel. There was a big garden tub which I found relaxing and a shower as well. The bathroom was roomy and had nice amenities. The room design was unique with a tinted window above the bed that looked into the bathroom. In the morning the light from the bathroom window would shine into the room through the window and wake me up. I could never sleep in. There was no way to cover the window. The property has a nice feature of a roof top jacuzzi, steam, sauna and gym. This area was quite nicely appointed and maintained. Definitely one of the finer perks of the hotel. The breakfast was nice and with rich, tasty coffee. Otherwise it was a buffet to cater to the tastes of travelers from various parts of the world. Again, the service was poor. The waiter I most often interacted with seemed to absolutely hate the clients (tourists) and hate his job. I had a nice enough experience - but mostly I am as indifferent as the staff. Customer service wins with me over the features of the property any day.

The problems we had with the hotel came from the quality of service. There is a message system attached to the TV, each night at 6 pm the TV would switch on or switch over to show you the specials at the restaurant. So it would either wake us from a nap or turn our TV programme off. The front desk seemed to no nothing about this and I asked them to disable it from our room, which they obviously did not because it happened 4 times during our stay. One time it was like a fire alarm throughout the building just to notify us of the diner specials! It lasted 1 hour. During these problems no one at the front desk seemed able to explain what was going on or be able to apologise for the problem. The hotel has potential but needs to be run in a more professional manner. Most of the problems are easy fixes. This is not just some gay guest house, this is an expensive hotel and should be run like one. More staff training on customer service is needed to bring this hotel up scratch.

They also didnt change my sheets in 5 nights - longest I have seen is 3 days at other hotels! They only changed towels when you leave them on the floor (common among hotels today). But the pubic hairs on walls, splatter on side and back walls around toilet and unwashed flat surfaces like the desk are NOT acceptable cleaning standards. Also, the wifi signal is spotty at best (it costs 9 Euros for 24 hours and you have to eques codes for log in from the front desk).

As the hotel is so new, it is very quiet at the moment and there are a couple of teething problems but hopefully these will be sorted out soon. LOCATION - Excellent location within easy walking distance (1-2 minutes) to gay district and very close by to the second largest department store in Europe (Ka-De-We). Attractions are 10 minutes away on the underground. STAFF/SERVICE - Very friendly staff who were helpful and knowledgeable when we asked where to go for drinks in the local area. Some members of staff on reception were more chatty than others but on the whole they all spoke very good English. Look out for Pedro - he is very hot! ROOM - We stayed in a Junior Suite and we were not disappointed. We had a king-sized bed, flatscreen TV and sofa area within the 'living' area of the room and the bathroom contained a jacuzzi-bath and a spacious walk-in shower that had several settings including one where you could be hit by 3 streamd of water from the side - very interesting! The bathroom was a bit dark - the walls were painted black - and we thought that more lighting was needed. Also, the water streams out of the shower in to the bathroom if you turn it up to the most powerful setting. The room was large, clean and tidy with a nice view towards the road with Berlin's buildings in the background. WELLNESS - The top floor contained a gym area, sauna, steamroom and outside jacuzzi. It was fairly quiet most of the time which was great for us. We could relax in relative peace with no lecherous men around. The gym equipment was fairly up to date but the sauna and steamroom could be bigger. The outdoor jacuzzi was fairly cold (not even likewarm) which was a shame and you could tell it wasn't the best jacuzzi, unlike the one in Axel Barcelona. Neverthless, the fact that there were not too many guests was great as it was pretty quiet most of the time. FOOD/DRINK - A word of warning, do not eat in the restaurant. Breakfast was standard and was ok but go elsewhere for dinner. We ate in the htel restaurant one night where it was Spanish tapas and paella night. However, none of the miniscule dishes that were brought to or table were remotely Spanish and we got the feeling that we were being given leftovers from the previous day. Also, less than half the advertised dishes on the set tapas menu arrived on our table. Substitute 'treats' were given to us and the waitress didn't seem to be aware of any perculiarity! The bar is ok but it is dead at the moment - maybe the fact that the hotel is so new is a reason for this but it seemed a shame for such a trendy and cosy bar. If you want a trendy and busy gay restaurant, definitely go to 'More' around the corner on Motzstrasse - this is the best gay restaurant in Berlin by a mile. OVERALL - Not as efficient as the Axel in Barcelona but given time, it could be. The location is perfect, the hotel is clean and trendy and the Junior Suite was amazing.

On two separate nights, I stayed in two types of rooms, mostly out of curiosity on what they were like, and if they were worth the money. On one night I stayed in the nicest room the hotel offers, I think it was called the \"Berlin Suite\". At any rate, the room was nice, and was in the circular portion of the hotel, so it was kind of different and funky. The room had a separate sitting area with sofa and it's own flat screen TV. it also had a computer with \"free\" internet. (In other words, no separate charge for it, since you are paying twice what a regular room goes for). The Junior Suite was also in a circular part of the hotel, but without the sitting area and computer. but it also had a plenty of windows and a jacuzzi bathtub. The only complaints I had about the suite rooms, both types, were that they are all in the front of the hotel, so if you open a window, lots of street noise. And when I was there for this trip, the AC ws not on, so you either had to endure the street noise, or a very stuffy, hot room. The other complaint I would have about both suites is the shower is much smaller, since they include a jacuzzi type bathtub in both types of suites. (Though they only give you the free bath salts in the in big suite, no the junior suite for some reason). Also, a BIG complaint I have was that in both suites, the floor to ceiling window in the bathroom did not have a curtain! I know German's have a less of a hang up on public nudity, but I like a little more privacy when getting in and out of a shower!

There was seven in our group, and having stayed several times at Axel Barcelona, we were expecting a similarly well run, professional establishment with charm, style, good service... and of course specifically aimed at a gay market. Unfortunately Axel Berlin did not live up to expectation. The black and gold themed decor has resulted in a rather bleak environment. It is not a pretty building and the rooms are fairly small. I stayed in a Superior Room and whilst the bed was a good size, the room was fairly small and the black bathroom very small. You will need to upgrade to a Junior Suite to get anything like the standard of one of the superior rooms in Barcelona. At 152 euros per night the room was fairly basic. Perhaps a little unfair to go as far as saying it was budget level but a fair way short of luxury. Yes, there was a mini-bar, but it was empty. The four coat hangers and 2 small drawers for storage are unlikely to accomodate the needs of any single traveller let alone the needs of a gay couple for a 3 night stay! Atmosphere was lacking in the bar and restaurant but with the hotel very quiet this may well improve with time. The roof top area is not yet finished and with no pool, there is only a jacuzzi tub for taking a dip. Lastly, the service needs some attention, particualrly in the restaurant which was really quite amateurish - nothing that couldn't be improved with a little training. It is obviously very early days for this new hotel, but certainly at the prices that we paid, we felt that we were sacrificing a fair amount of quality and service for the benefit of staying in a gay establishment.
