The beds were comfortable, there was more than adequate wardrobe and floor space and an endless supply of towels, bathrobes and slippers. This did irk me a bit as Moevenpick pride themselves on green credentials but the towels and bathrobes were changed daily even when we put them in the 'please don't change' rail in the bathroom. There were some nice touches - a bottle of water and a chocolate every night when we got back. The decor of the hotel was a bit bland/characterless - there was no feeling of being in Holland, which was a shame. The reception service was patchy - some staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, others were curtly professional. The concierge staff were helpful. The breakfast (which was included) offered a huge array of fresh produce to suit most tastes - Caffe Ipo a few doors along from the hotel offers fantastic coffee, sandwiches and pastries at a reasonable price as an alternative. The junior executive option offered access to the executive lounge, with free coffee, chocolates and computers plus a quiet environment to relax. The food and wine in the restaurant was very good, if a little pricey. I was glad we booked as people were being turned away when we ate there. The location of the hotel wasn't the greatest for sightseeing, although there is a regular shuttle (which you need to pre-book) to and from the station and it is one tram stop to the station. Jamie Oliver's Fifteen is a short walk away (booking necessary) and there was an Italian restaurant close by (which we didn't try).

We travelled from the Airport to Central station by train (please note you need coins for the ticket machines which also translates into English but also tickets can be bought from the desk.) We arranged for the hotel shuttle bus to collect us from the station. We arrived early and checked in but could not gain access to our room until 3pm. Which was fine as we went out exploring. The weather was hit and miss whilst we was there but it did not stop us sightseeing. There is so much to see and do whilst you are there. The rooms/bathrooms are exceptionally clean with tea/coffee making facilities. Towels & toiletries are replenished daily and the rooms are cleaned. There is a minibar in the room but you have to notify reception if you wish to use it and they will stock it for you. There is also a safe which can be used free of charge. Our room was very cold and we asked that this be checked but apparently room 630 had a problem with the air con turning to heat. We were given extra duvets for warmth. We ate in the Silk Bar one evening (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 per head for a bowl of noodles) but chose to eat out for the rest of the time. The Silk Restaurant (Al la carte) is available for dining but I think you have to make reservations. We used the shuttle bus on a number of occasions which runs from the hotel on the hour and half hour and from Central station every 5 past and 35 past the hour. Reservations must be made for this service as the shuttle only holds 8 people. If you choose to walk it is a good 20 minute walk into the city centre. We use to walk back in the evenings (a very safe walk) as the shuttle runs from 7am to 7.30pm. Both my husband and I used the gym. Small but useful. My husband used the spa facilities and was surprised that many people using this facility were unclothed. A little off putting if you are not use to this.

Unfortunately both my wife and I were thoroughly disappointed with the experience and will most definitely not be staying there again. This is for the reasons that I have summarised below. 1) The location. One of he main attractions to this hotel was the supposedly 'amazing' location and its proximity to the station. Frankly, other than the views from the hotel, I was not impressed with the location. There is very little adjacent to the hotel and it is a good solid twenty minute walk from the station and a good half an hour walk to the city centre (if you walk at a brisk pace). Alternatively it was 15 euros for a taxi or a ten minute bike ride. For the price, I personally would rather stay in the city centre itself and be far closer to the action and fail to see why there have been so many reviews that rave about the location of this hotel. 2) The room. For some reason, we were given a room right next to the lifts on the seventeenth floor. This was incredibly noisy and both my wife and I had about two hours sleep due to the sheer noise of the lifts whizzing up and down all night. We asked to change the room after the first night and the staff at the desk seemed somewhat begrudging to provide us with a different room. Firstly they stated that they were fully booked then literally five seconds later they said that they had a room available on the fifteenth floor. When we arrived in the second room, we were disappointed to note that the double bed consisted on two single beds pushed together. Not particulalry spectacular considering that I paid in excess of \u00c2\u00a3100 a night. It also transpired that the safe in the room was broken. After fifty minutes of waiting around, we were simply told that the safe would remain that way and that as an alternative we could put our goods in the safe at the front desk. Again we were not particularly impressed with this. The decor in the room was very modern and in my opinion, not particulalry homely. There were also no additional pillows in the room, which is something that we found particulalry unusual. We were also disappointed to note that there were no baths in either room, only a shower. This is despite there being a huge space that would have easily allowed for the installation of a bath. Despite the size of the shower(s), the water pressure was very low and not what I would reasonably expect from a shower of that size. 3) The maids. Neither of us were particularly impressed by the performance of the maids. During the course of our stay the hotel staff: - Failed to replace, clean or even move any of the cups/glasses that we used; - Did not empty the bins in the room; - Failed to replace the empty boxes of tissues in the bathroom. Neither of us are particulalry messy or indeed fussy people, but when you pay that much for a room, then you do expect a reasonably high standard of service. 4) The Room Service. The one positive thing that I would have to say is that when we ordered room service, both the food and the service were excellent. The member of staff that delivered the food was an absolute pleasure to deal with. We have been to Amsterdam numerous times and I can categorically state that we will not be staying here again.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warwick", "Title": "\u201cStunning views & first class room\u201d", "Author": "Caroline P", "ReviewID": "UR127419334", "Content": "We had a wonderful 3 night stay in a 20th floor suite (not for the faint hearted!) overlooking the cruise terminal, river, docks area and far beyond.

The hotel's location was actually good, on the water with a great view toward the North Sea. The Moevenpick provides a shuttle to the Centraal Station every half hour (make sure to reserve your seats!) which is very convenient. There is also a tram stop in front. The hotel was very modern, clean with everything we needed. The breakfast buffet was included with our stay -- great service, wonderful selection of tasty food. The staff at the concierge desk was wonderful: ready to help with luggage, reservations, directions, information. The shuttles were so convenient and on time. There are two concierge staff that I want to compliment, Frits and Daniel. They went out of their way to make our first stay in Amsterdam more enjoyable. Also, when we had a problem with our television (brand new Philips HD flatscreens), the security oficer came up on Saturday night and fixed it with a smile. Also a plus, just down the street from a great restaurant, Fifteen owned by Jaime Oliver. We would definitely stay there again.

The hotel is 20 minutes walk from the central station and runs a free shuttle bus between 7am and 7pm on the half hour. The route 26 tram runs past the hotel every five minutes and the trip to the central hotel takes 5 minutes. On arrival the greeting was warm and even though we were early, check in is 3pm, staff went to great lengths to find a room for us. The first Executive suite we were offered was small and a bit tatty. No bath. We pointed this out to the concierge who had brought our bags up and he immediately phoned our concerns to reception. we were then offered a free upgrade to a junior suite on the same floor (19th) This was bigger, 3 rooms, with a bath and shower but still a bit jaded/tatty. Very clean. I am type 2 diabetic so I can't drink regular beer and when we mentioned this to the guest services they immediately changed the beer in the fridge to complementary Pilsner which I can drink. The only meal we ate in the hotel was breakfast which is an extensive buffet from served until 10.30am. Unfortunately the hot food was usually only lukewarm and daily we had to ask for it to be reheated or cooked fresh. This was not to much trouble for the staff, they were happy to oblige. The Executive lounge is a bit small but the staff were excellent. On Monday and Tuesday we could not access the internet on their desktop computers. After a couple of attempts we managed to connect via the hotels wireless network but access is only free for 24 hours. The daily hot/cold snacks in the Executive Lounge were excellent and included palma ham, goats cheese, caviare, smoked fish, chicken, prawns and fruit. When my wife expressed a preference for pinot grigio wine it was provided as was a plentiful supply of pilsner beer. Staff have a friendly 'can do' attitude and nothing is to much trouble for them.

The concierge run a shuttle to the train station every 30 minutes which you need to book in advance, so this was a good option a couple of times as there are good connections to trams at the station, or there is one tram that comes more infrequently outside the hotel.

The location is the most controversial issue. It can be perceived as perfect or unacceptable, it all depends on your needs. Its a 15 minute walk to Centraal station and there is a free shuttle every 30 mins from the hotel until 19:30. If you want to be close to everything and in the middle of the hustle or Amsterdam, then this hotel is not for you. However, if you want to spend time in the center and then want to get away from it all at night, then the location is perfect. Personally for me, it wasn't ideal. The room service and restaurant were pretty expensive in my opinion but there is a subway down the road. One thing I really did like about the hotel was that it is part of a green scheme called Green Key. So they are actively trying to go green. One way this is done is they change bedsheets every other day and dont wash towels unless you leave them off the rails. The rooms were well lit, with a kettle, safe, fridge, tea bags etc. The one thing I did expect was complimentary water bottles but they didn't provide this. There is a nice sofa like place to sit in the room which I really liked and the tv has many english channels including BBC and ITV. The bath and shower were good as well and housekeeping overall did a good job. This hotel is a strictly non smoking hotel.

We visit Amsterdam often and always book via Priceline Name Your Own Price as we know the city well and nowhere would be a bad location for us. This is the first time we've 'won' the Movenpick, I was hoping for the Amrath or NH Centre as they are both great hotels. I was a little dissapointed when I 'won' the Movenpick as I know the location isn't perfect. The hotel was very nice, we requested a high up room with a view which is exactly what we got, a 9th floor room with a city and river view. Typical high quality that you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Very modern room, kettle, nice bathroom, the best TV and range of English channels we've had on holiday. The big drawback is the location, we hired bikes from Star bikes which is a couple of minutes from the hotel. Cycling in Amsterdam is brilliant once you get used to the foot brakes! On foot things aren't too far, central station is about 8 mins, red light district 10 mins, dam square 15/20 mins so nothing too far. However, when raining it's quite a trek and one day it rained all day. On our rainy day we ordered room service, this was poor quality and I wouldn't recommend, the restaurant looked nice though. There is a tram stop nearby so transport isn't impossible. It is quite isolated though, there is a Subway nearby but nothing else within 10 mins.

We arrived a few hours earlier than the 3pm check in but this was no problem we checked in straight away. The front staff were very friendly. On check in we had been given an executive room on the top (20th) floor. We were in room 2002 and would ask to stay in this room again. The views over the city were stunning. We could see central station which was only a 15 minute walk away, the town and the boats on the canal tours. Probably the best view possible for all the fireworks at new year. The room was spacious and beds very comfortable. You have a choice of five pillows, I choose the anti allergy pillow as the ones on the bed had feather in them. (as soon as I went to reception to get changed they came straight to my room and offered to change all the bedding at the same time) Rooms are light, very clean and had a flat screen TV. Being in an executive room also came with extra's. We had free use of the mini bar within the room which had apple juice, water, coke and cans of heineken in it. We had fresh apples and fresh bottles of water left on the bedside tables each evening. Our curtains got closed each evening and the weather forcast for the following day was left along with two chocolates. If you are in the hotel between 5-7pm you can go down to the exective lounge on the second floor for free drinks, wine and snacks which we felt was a great extra. The food in the hotel is very good quality. It may seem a little expensive but I found amsterdam in general to be more pricey than back home. You can eat in the bar which is near the reception and where we choose to eat. I ordered a toasted chicken and bacon sandwich with egg and tomato a side of chips and a dip. My partner ordered chicken stir fry and for drinks a vodka and coke and pint of beer. The total cost was 41 euro. The other restuarant is on the 2nd floor and sells items like steak and veal. The location of the hotel is slightly out of the centre. You can see the main train station from the hotel and as mentioned above is a 15 minute walk. The station is then very close to dam square for its coffee shops and gift stores. Across the road from the hotel is a tram stop. You can catch the number 26 to central station.

It is a modern new building with all that that entails, such as decent sized rooms and good sound insulation. My friends were the ones who booked this and I was not sure about the location at the start as I thought it was a little out of the way. However I need not have worried as it was very accessible. The tram stops outside and is only one stop from the station. The 25 tram goes down near the main street- Spuistraat- so its easy to get into the heart of the old city. There was also a taxi rank outside which we used at night- it was a tenner to get to the Supperclub and Kantjil from the hotel. Another review mentions that its an ugly industrial area but I thought it was a nice walk along the waterfront. You can walk through the red light district but this is after the station so not necessary. All the staff were very courteous and professional. I asked one of the check-in staff to confirm our restaurant booking at Kantjil -I couldn't get through on my mobile -which he promptly did. Very helpful. I had my own room- I got a good rate from booking through the hotel website. The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable. The tvs were being changed to flatscreens on my floor- the 16th - the day I arrived. There were several English channels according to my friends- I didnt check this out though. The bathroom was very clean and the shower was good. There was shower gel and shampoo provided as well as plenty of towels. There was loads of storage space for clothes as well as a safe. The view from my room was lovely too- it helped that it was sunny outside. We had a drink in the bar when we arrived. The barman was friendly and it was busy when were there. It wasnt that cheap but it was good for a quick drink on the way out. There were eight of us staying in 5 rooms and everyone really liked the hotel. I think it is a little out of the center but you have to balance this against the building being modern and quiet. I have stayed in Amsterdam twice before and there was a lot of street noise on the weekends. I slept really well here too and never heard any noise from other rooms or the corridor. There are four lifts and they could be quite busy but I never seemed to wait more than a minute. They were very quick at getting between the lobby and the 16th floor too. We all arrived at different times but we were all checked in immediately despite all arriving before the 3pm check-in time. One of my friends arrived at 10am and still got into his room straight away. One odd thing was that I arrived with one of my friends and she was upgraded to the Executive floor with her husband. She said she didnt request this so it seemed a bit arbitrary. I think she had a Nespresso machine in her room. The check-in assistant did comment as she checked her in, saying that they didnt realise we were all together. Strange but nice for my friends. We were all able to leave our baggage in storage after check-out. We did have the option to keep the room until 6pm for an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50.

Firstly, although not far from Centraal Station (900m to be precise), it is not close enough to pop back to drop off shopping bags or quickly change. Yes they do put on a shuttle minibus to the station, but it's just as handy to take the tram which is more or less opposite the hotel (we bought a travel pass which we used more than we thought we would). The hotel room was quiet and spacious, which was good as 3 of us were sharing. On the down side, the third bed was a sofa bed, which we knew about in advance so it wasn't a surprise, what was a surprise was how uncomfortable it was. When making the reservation we asked for a room on a high floor (we'd heard the views were particularly good) - when checking-in we repeated this wish, but we were told the room was already made up and we were on the 3rd floor. We went along with it, but it wasn't really said very nicely and it is a 4* hotel after all, and the hotel certainly wasn't full. A little effort would have gone a long way. The bar was very comfy and the service good, as was the food. Don't expect lots of restaurants and animation around the hotel though, there is Jamie Oliver's 15 restaurant a 5-minute walk away and what looked like a nice Italian restaurant, but that is basically it. I don't know if I would stay there again if I were to return to Amsterdam (which is a fabulous city by the way, so much to see and do - definitely worth getting the IAmsterdam card or Holland Pass).

The location - TERRIBLE. The only reason you would want to stay here is if you were attending a conference at this hotel. Or if you were using the ferry port nearby. It is definitely not city center. The walk into the Amsterdam center is not far - only 10-15 minutes. To be fair the hotel also does offer a shuttle to the Central Train Station. You will definitely not be in the middle of the action, and walking back and forth gets tiresome. The rooms was very nice, obviously recently renovated. It was a bit odd as there was two single beds pushed together - we were told at the front desk that if pushed together they make the double bed. Well - it's not really a double bed if you wake up in a crack between two beds in the middle of the night. Another odd thing was the TV was very old. For such a modern facility and nice room, it didn't seem to fit. They need to invest in some new, modern TVs. It adds a lot to the atmosphere and status of a room, in my opinion. Further more the bath product was terrible. There was shampoo/body wash. Two in one. And it smelled very definitely like male bath product. Very masculine. In addition, there was no conditioner. Room service was actually quite reasonable, and we often ordered a pot of coffee (6 Euros) to start our day. Don't bother with the restaurant. It is overpriced and not that great. On one occasion the wrong meal arrived at our table. The waiter offered to give me a drink, which I said I wasn't interested in, but perhaps a dessert. We received dessert, which was on the bill. Very disappointing. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant is 23euros per person. There is no other option for breakfast. If you want something small and quick, you are much better off ordering room service to be delivered. The fitness facility is very good. There is a variety of exercise equipment. There are two separate saunas - Traditional Finnish and more humid biosauna. There is no pool of any kind. We don't really care for a pool anyway, but if you had children there they would probably not have much fun! There is literally nothing nearby, unless you fancy Subway for dinner.

Firstly 'City Centre' is a bit of a misnomer as the hotel is at least a 1km walk to Centraal Station (and henceforth onto the real centre) and some of this being uphill as you have to cross a bridge. True, one can take the tram there as a stop is quite near but it seems a bit of a waste. Secondly entrance to the hotel for pedestrians is a little awkward as you have to walk around a 'dock' (so to speak) in front of the hotel to reach it. Obviously neither of these two things would be a problem for anyone arriving via car. We arrived from Centraal Station and made our way to the hotel, arriving at 12pm. Although check-in was a few hours away we hoped that our room would be ready so we could go and freshen up. However, this was not the case even though the preceeding couple checking in before us were given their card keys. Odd. I'm a pretty laid back guy so I saw no need to kick up a fuss, but I did find this strange. After a bit of sight seeing we returned and were able to check in. Our room was on the 18th floor and had a (not very spectacular!) view of the City. The room however, was large with a comfortable bed with space in the mini-bar for our own food and drink. The bathroom was equally spacious and had a bath (always good to have a soak after traipsing round all day! Breakfast wasn't included so I can't comment upon that. But the desk staff were polite and the concierges were effortlessly friendly and helpful. As previously reviewers have noted the WiFi in the room is a bit slow but we were only using our smart phones so it wasn't a big deal. The hotel is adjacent to the new passenger terminal so the hotel is an ideal place to stay for anyone embarking or disembarking from one of the many cruise ships which dock there. Be warned though - we were awoken on our first morning by a PA annoucement on the ship which had arrived during the night!

The first 2 nights were great, my room was very nice, much better appointed than the average business hotel and very quiet, despite overlooking a busy road, railway and tramline. Breakfast, room service etc were all very good, staff were helpful and there was free wi-fi. Colleagues in higher rooms had lovely views along the main shipping canal, although otherwise the hotel is in an industrial area with nothing around unless you travel into the city centre, 10 mins away by tram. However, on the 3rd night (a Thursday) I returned to my room at 11pm and discovered that there was a nightclub playing incredibly loud music in the building next door. It was so loud that the whole room was shaking with the bass notes. Sleep would have been absolutely impossible. On ringing reception I discovered that the building with the club was normally a passenger terminal for cruise liners (so no soundproofing, as a normal nightclub would have) but 3 or 4 times a year it hosts a series of dance events. The really bad news was the music would go on until 5am and this would continue for the next 2 nights. I was told at first that there were no free rooms, but I persisted and eventually was offered a room on the same side as the club but 12 floors higher. This was no better, and the bathroom smelt of sewage, so I complained again, asking to be moved to the other side of the hotel. Once more I was told there were no free rooms, but then one was found - smaller than my original room but I didn't care. Even on the 19th floor and the other side, the music was still audible, but was sufficiently quiet that I was able to sleep - briefly, as by now it was past 1am and I had to be up again for a meeting at 6am. Several of my colleagues, who were less pushy than I, had been told there were no rooms elswhere and had been fobbed off with earplugs. They hadn't slept at all. The staff were very apologetic and said they hadn't known about the club event. This surprised me, as there were large billboards outside the passenger terminal advertising 'Battle of 100 DJs'. I hadn't noticed them on my arrival at the hotel, but surely the manager should make it their business to notice, especially if these music events occur at intervals throughout the year? If I had been warned in advance I would have moved hotels and ensured my colleagues did likewise. At the very least, having asked for a quiet room, I should have been booked into the other side of the hotel in the first place. I was left exhausted for the remainder of the trip.

My criteria are quite strict on liking a hotel, probably because I work in a sphere of five star hotels, usually leading hotels of the world, and I am used to expecting the best service, food and accommodation, that is why my comments are based truly in comparison with a lot of other hotels, and from a hotelier perspective. The check-in was good, not extremely welcoming I could say, but very efficient, informative and pleasant. The room is absolutely fantastic: modern, comfortable beds (from which it was so difficult to get up at 6am!), nice standing shower and a beautiful view to the Amstel from my room on the 18th floor! The conference facilities are modern, but quite typical in a good way. The food - absolutely incredible; both room service and the Silk Road restaurant. Now the service, deserves a separate paragraph. Honestly - it got me to say a 'wow' at one point. At the restaurant, the girls where extremely friendly, engaged on a personal level with me, and where very efficient. The room service - not only did they greet me by name, asked how my sleep was, but also engaged in a friendly manner some questions about my stay and why I was up this early. And bravo to that! Many leading hotels have a standard of service - i.e, always use guest's name etc and ask some standard questions, but that's what I loved about this hotel is that, even not being part of them, they were completely within the frames of the standards, and they still exceeded my expectations. So my honest suggestion to you is, if your traveling - stay here. It's easy to get to the center, a beautiful hotel and fantastic service. Oh, and free Wi-Fi.

First the price. We took advantage of a \"stay 7 nights, pay only 5\". VERY convenient, in practice it gave us a 4-stars hotel for the price of a 3-stars. The Moevenpick is a 2005 20-storey building on the IJ (Amsterdam harbor) near the new music hall and the maritime passenger terminal. Not you tytpical \"postcard Amsterdam\", but a beautiful place, if you like modern architecture. The view from our room at the 19th floor was spectacular, ranging from the IJ harbor to the eastern part of central Amsterdam. Suffice it to say that we took dozens of pictures from our window at all times of the day. The room was modern and spacious, even for 3 persons, with several amenities: besides the customary TV and mini bar there was a free espresso/tea machine, iron and ironing board, free Internet (not tested), and a complimentary bottle of mineral water each day. For those who, like my wife, find fixed windows oppressive, one of the panels could be opened (transom/vasistas-style). The bathroom was nice and spacious, with combo bathtub/shower (no bidet, obviously). Breakfast was our next priority, alas it was not included in our offer and it was expensive (23 Euros per person), but it was HUGE, with everything you could want, including some of those Ducth foods that you usually ask for in cafes and restaurants, like cheeses, herrings and poffertjes (mini-pancakes), and obviously some Swiss touches (Moevenpick is a Swiss chain), like rosti and plenty of mueslis. We returned three times, and each time we skipped lunch and had a light dinner, in practice we saved money... The lower floors of the hotel house several services, some that we used (free Internet, screens with real-time train timetable), some that we did not use (restaurant, bar, concierge, ATM, gym), plus a free shuttle to the train station that you better book well in advance (let's say more than 24 hours before you preferred time). Outside the hotel you can always find taxis (thanks also to the passenger terminal nearby) and two trams, 25 and 26, both go to the railway station and the 25 then goes to Dam square and near the museums area. On the tram you can buy hourly tickets and daily passes.

I booked this hotel using a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type web-site, so was unable to pinpoint the location prior to making my reservation. The hotel is a ten minute walk from Central Station, however, unlike other properties the walk is alongside open water with no welcome distractions such as shops, bars, etc. so it feels an awful lot longer than ten minutes and as a result becomes rather tedious each time one is returning to the hotel. They do run a shuttle service every half hour to Central Station, but one needs to reserve popular times in advance otherwise there is no guarantee of a space on it! Furthermore, due to roadworks at the station, the shuttle service stops operating at half past seven each evening. Check-in was efficient, but virtually all of the staff that I encountered, whilst being polite seemed entirely indifferent, there was no warm, friendly and genuine welcome. The room itself was a comfortable size, and had a pleasant view over the city. They are rather mean on toiletries, one receives the usual small sized bottle of shampoo, bar of soap, but there is a shower gel dispenser on the wall by the shower; this is really not the sort of thing one expects in a four star property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c individual toiletries should be standard. Bizarrely for a hotel that was finished less than six years ago there is an old fashioned CRT television, this dates the otherwise relatively timeless and contemporary style of the room. Another strange feature was the king size bed having two single duvets rather than one large one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why!? The housekeeping was not of an high standard. On my first day, the cleaner knocked on my door (my fault as I did not have a do not disturb sign on the door) and I told him to come back in five minutes as I was just about to leave. Instead of listening to what I had just said, he knocked on the door again a minute later. I repeated my original message, and yet again he continued to knock on the door. Another day I returned to my room to find a couple of wet towels on the floor next to the bed; I had certainly not deposited them there! The hotel has a separate concierge desk, but the concierges were often not at their desk, either driving the shuttle bus, or elsewhere in the hotel. If an hotel is going to commit to a concierge desk, then at least one concierge should be visibly on duty at all times. It would be far more useful to the guest if the shuttle bus operated every quarter of an hour (it is a five minute drive) and had a dedicated driver. Also it seemed strange that such a modern purpose built property did not include a swimming pool, only a small fitness suite. This hotel is probably most suited, and most convenient for cruise ship passengers. If you end up with this property via a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd web-site for under GBP65 a night then you could do a lot worse, however, if you are considering paying published rates, you can find somewhere far better located and with more character elsewhere.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cThe Ice Cold Beer at Silk Bar, you gotta try it!!!\u201d", "Author": "Yadush", "ReviewID": "UR117171290", "Content": "The Moevenpick Hotel at Amsterdam is one of the better hotels I have been to.

The rooms are modern, stylish and very comfortable. They provide a superb panoramic view of the old harbour area, especially if you have a north facing room on the upper floors (16 in total). The hotel is very conveniently located for the city centre, being a short walk, or one tram stop, away from Central Station. Since the Station is also the main terminus for nearly all the tram routes around the city as well as canal tours and sightseeing busses, everything you need is near to hand. The hotel itself also provides a free shuttle bus upon request to the station, which provides a cheap and fast link for the airport. We stayed on a room only basis having got a good deal by booking in advance with Expedia. The breakfast, although not cheap at 23 Euros per person, is quite simply fantastic! The range of hot and cold offerings is vast and will suit every taste. Additionally, being a buffet style, you can return for more if you are feeling really hungry. The quality of the food is also excellent with the bread range and cooked foods freshly made and delicious. It will set you up for the rest of the day! We didn't eat in the hotel in the evenings as there are a good number and variety of restaurants available in the city itself and they are easily accessible by tram or on foot. The hotel also has a nice little bar/cafe providing alcoholic drinks, hot and cold beverages and snacks all served in comfortable surroundings by friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is sighted beside the main passenger cruise ship terminal which may put some people off as there are daily visits from cruise liners in the summer season and they tie up directly alongside the hotel on the seaward side. This means that if you are in the restaurant or lower floors on that side you may find yourself looking into the cabins on the top decks in the morning or during the day.

This may be the case but it involves walking along a construction site on very poor roads or sidewalks. The hotel is there to accomodate passengers from the cruise boats that land on the neighboring ship terminal. The only way to get to town is to either take the hotel shuttle, that is usually booked up, or tram 26 for one stop and change tram at the train station. This makes difficult the commute between the hotel and the tourist sites in town, Further, when you arrive wheeling your suitcase, you realize that from the tram stop, you have to either make a 200 m detour around a canal or to walk up a bridge over the canal and walk down steps on the other side to reach the hotel. The access to the hotel has been very poorly planned. The lobby is unimpressive for a 4-star hotel, there is no complimentary newspaper nor even a place to buy a newspaper. The rooms are spartan. A good point, the hotel is entirely non-smoking unless someone smokes on your level and smells up the whole corridor, as we experienced. The service in the hotel leaves to be desired. A request to make up the room was not satisfied. The magnetic room keys fail often. Finally, booking on the Moevenpick web site was very difficult and was only possible with explorer on a PC. None of the other browsers on a Mac would work. After we finalized our booking, it took one telephone call and several e-mails to finalize the payment by credit card.

Moevenpick had great reviews and we decided to go ahead with this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and clean with fabulous water-front views of the passenger cruise terminal (if you're on the top floors). The rooms are equipped with a kettle, coffee / tea / creamer sachets, TV, electronic safe, an iron with an ironing board, mini refrigerator (the mini bar is empty and is filled on request) and plenty of storage space. The beds are extremely comfortable. The bathroom has a tub (but no lock!). The service levels were more than what we had expected / read on TripAdvisor.

Away from the noise of the bustling city centre, yet very accessible (Tram No. 25 from the hotel's doorstep takes you to Central Station in less than 5 minutes and to other places of tourist interest such as the Dam Square {7 minutes}, Flower Market {10 minutes} and the Heineken Experience {15 minutes}). We stayed at the hotel for 3 days and 4 nights and at the end of the first day itself we were glad to have chosen Moevenpick. And then, just when we thought that the service levels were good, they went a step ahead and bettered it. Just the night before our departure, our 5-year old daughter, twisted her angle during one of our sight-seeing tours . The hotel's staff (both, at the front desk and at the security) were extremely helpful - from giving her first aid, providing a wheelchair, calling a cab and guiding us to the hospital. While we certainly didn't expect all this from them, they went beyond the call of duty and this truly moved us. We got back to the hotel room from the hospital at the stroke of midnight and found that it was too late to order from the restaurant as the chefs had left. Even then, the room service staff were more than helpful in getting us something to eat at that hour. While all hotels talk about providing good service (at least their brochures do), not many live up to the promise. Moevenpick Amsterdam was simply A-class.

We had read the various reviews on here and had also had quite a few trips to Amsterdam previously so had an idea of the location and decided that we would give it a go. We had read about the shuttle service so decided to email in advance to book 2 places on the 5.35 shuttle, also making them aware that we needed additional space for the wheelchair (incase that was not possible) there was a swift reply from the concierge to inform us that there was not a problem and the shuttle had been booked. We also emailed to ask about accessible rooms and to request a room with a view (a previous review had suggested it) and again received a swift reply telling us an accessible room was now pre-booked for us on the 3rd floor, and apologising for the fact it was not on one of the higher floors with better views. We usually pre-book wheelchair assistance for the train journey to/ from Schiphol - the train costs e3.70 pp each way - and this trip was no exception. On arrival at Centraal station (20 mins by train from schiphol) there was the porter with a ramp to help us disembark and off we went. We had arrived onto platform 15a so were near to the Noord exit, which leads to the river, and where we had instructions to meet the minibus to transport us to the hotel. The rear of the station is currently undergoing some refurbishments and due to the works, temporary ramps/walkways we were unable to locate the minibus stop, so decided that we would just walk to the hotel ourselves. The walk, which was a straight road, although up a steadily inclining 'ramped' bridge, was easy (even in the squally winds and rain that were greeting us) and took between 5 - 7 minutes, having timed it but stopping to look over the river at one point hence the between times. On arrival at check-in we told the staff we had been unable to locate the minibus so had walked, there reply 'ok' so not sure that they had understood that we were telling them so that there staff need not look for us, or even if they cared, but it was 'ok' anyway. We were checked in quickly and directed to the lifts. Our room 325 was indeed on the 3rd floor, and directly overlooking the passenger terminal dock - which was literately outside our window about 10-15m away, and the river, so we were happy with the view anyway, and spent time following all the river traffic over the coming days. The room had more than enough room for my wheelchair to go at any side of the bed and around the room freely, there was a large double bed - as requested- and as previously noted in other reviews,the bed is covered in 2 single duvets, strange but saved us fighting about who had the lions share of the duvet when we roll over! There were tea and coffee supplied, and when we ran out a quick visit to reception re-stocked our supply in a minute without any complaints; the tv, whilst not the most modern style, had several english language stations(including BBC1 & 2, BBC news & CNN) plus some dutch stations had english programmes with dutch subtitles, so we were happy with the selection; again, as mentioned in other reveiws, the minibar is just a fridge which enables you to store your own goodies in it, which was very welcome as we bought sandwiches and bottles of coke from Albert Heijn and Hema (cheaper, and nicer - imho) so we could keep them fresh for supper, there was also a free electronic safe in the room. The bathroom was large, with wheel- in shower, rails around shower, toilet and a low sink with angled mirror so the adaptations were good, there was one problem though, there was a shower seat - but it was on the floor with nothing to attach it to to make it the correct hight to actually use, if i could get onto the floor to sit on it,and get back up from it, I wouldn't have needed it, it really needs a stool or frame to attach to, but we managed with the rails and my chair covered in towels. There are amenities supplied including shampoo, shower gel, body lotion and a soap, and they are replenished daily, ideal when travelling with carry on only for a few days break. We did not have breakfast - it was not included in our rate and we did not get up to have it, as we usually have a brunch at Teddys Cafe on Warmoesstraat (9e for full english with toast and it is delicious!) so that's were we went two days, but we did notice that the room service menu offered individual items for breakfast for less that you would pay for the buffet breakfast, so next time we would get an omelette for approx 6e and make a cup of tea in our room. I think breakfast finished at 11am, just check out the options if you are on a budget. We had a meal in the hotels restaurant, Silk Road; the waiter was very nice and found us a nice table with easy access to it,with a good view over the terrace (which was closed due to the weather) and on to the Ij, which would have been beautiful had it not been for the rain bouncing off the terrace, he also asked if I wished to transfer to a dining chair or remain in my own chair, prior to moving the unneeded chair out of our way completely, again showing excellent customer service. The menu is very much a fusion, and the chicken noodle soup we both chose for starter was absolutely delicious and well worth the 7.5e cost, for main course I had braised chicken with linguine in a lobster sauce with crayfish - this was served with 3 or 4 huge cooked crayfish and the sauce was very rich, cost 20 e and I could not finish it, hubby had steak with salad and choose a beetroot and nut salad with his steak - which were also accompanied by a 'tower' of home made style chunky chips, cost approx 23e. The restaurant also had an extensive wine list, and my favourite accompaniment to my meal was the glass of black muscat dessert wine I had instead of an actual dessert - very sweet and syrupy and nicely chilled, just how I like it - and at 7e a glass I wish I had had another. The weather was not nice for the length of our stay which curtailed some of our plans, and made the walk into/from the centre a little less appealing than it would have been had it not been so windy/rainy but we again timed our walk back towards the station at just over 5 mins (my husband is a quick walker, used to pushing me, and overtakes many people usually anyway, so this would be gauged on a fit person walking well, rather than strolling and wouldn't be expected of everyone - just an idea of how quickly it can be done). The tram stop is close to the hotel (we did not use it as we have had problems in getting on at the designated wheelchair area in the past and the strees that it caused then has left us unwanting to try it again, and we wont unless we have no other alternative, but for the regular tourist I would think they would be an excellent choice, and very efficiant), and there isalso a hop on hop off boat stop just in front of the hotel- to the right - at the concert hall stop, so access to the rest of the city IS easy. There is also a taxi rank just outside the hotel - to the left - between the bar and the passanger terminal. We used the taxi's on several occasions (purely because of weather) and found them (all except 1) to be trustworthy, the one driver that tried to take us on a detour soon went back on track when we asked why we were going the way we were - luckily we had an idea where we were going. All in all we had a lovely stay at the hotel Moevenpick in Amsterdam and would recommend it to people who are not phased by a 10 minute walk to the station each day to start out for the day or who are happy to use the trams. There is a short cut into the centre from the lift near the tram stop and then heading left over a bridge with a novel bike ramp, and passing by the library - try the restaurant on the top floor for good but reasonably priced high quality fresh cooked food - and the floating chinese restaurant Sea Palace - recommend the dim sum lunch, book in advance to get a window table, well worth it - then continue passed the new mint hotel, before either continuing for the station area with numerous boat tour operators there and on Damrak or turning left to head towards the tourist areas of the rld or the many Chinese restaurants - plus the temple - on zeedijk, leading to de waag - lit by candlelight - at Nieuwnmarkt, just before De Waag on the right as you go up Zeedijk try happy hour at Sake and Co, lovely cocktails for 6e each before 9pm! If in the Dam Sqaure area, try lunch/afternoon tea at the restaurant on the 5th floor of De Bijenkorf - another quality outlet at reasonable prices, the place is a little like a greenhouse on the roof of the top department store in amsterdam, so can combine a break and some shopping.

Prices were at the higher end but we booked at a time where there were holidays in Germany so everything was about to be booked out. Breakfast was included in our rate. As we came by train we did not need any parking spot but there is a garage at the hotel. However it is not free. We went by foot with our trolleys from the main train station Amsterdam Centraal to the hotel. Three things about going by foot: 1. it is not that far but 5 minutes by foot is not enough. You need around 15 minutes. 2. there currently are construction works in and around the main station. So make sure you get the way right. 3. get out at the back of the station, otherwise you will not reach the hotel easily So as you have realized, the hotel is far away from the center. It takes about 25 minutes by foot. However you have other possibilities: - rent a bike. The hotel itself rents bikes but you can rent bikes at one of the various other bike rentals there are plenty. - rent a segway. There is a rental next to the hotel. - go by tram. Near to the hotel there is a tram stop. You can go with line 25 and 24 as far as I remember. - go by taxi. There are always some taxis in front of the hotel, waiting. - go by hotel shuttle. There is a shuttle every 30 minutes. However you have to make reservations and have to wait. The location of the hotel is very nice. It is quite and offers beautiful views over the harbour of Amsterdam. There are no disturbing noises or anything which would make the location less worthy. Checkin was without problems. The checkout however - although also without problems - took a while. The problem was that we checked out at the general checkout time it seemed. As they take great care of their customers, it took some time. Still they were prepared and put up some ropes so that it was obvious where to que in line. The room was nice (see pictures), it had a safe, an iron with ironing board, a kettle with some tea and coffee, a complimentary water, a TV and AC. The rooms could be darkened out completely. The bed was big and comfortable. The bathroom was also good, however when showering we always flooded the room. The only downturn in this hotel was cleanliness. Don't get me wrong, that hotel is not dirty. However there were some minor things. The room had not been vacuumed during our stay. Normally I do not care but it was obvious as there were small snippets from whatever disintegrated in our bags. That is why I noticed it. The bathroom had a toilet brush. When I used it i noticed that the container which normally holds the brush was not in its hinges anymore, it just stood on the floor with the brush leaning to the holder. Taking out the brush the cotainer tilted with water coming out of it. As I did not want to touch it, I put the brush on top of the container, leaning it to the holder. The next day after the room service was there it still was the same. This leads me to the following conclusions: Maybe they did not see it, then the toilet has not been cleaned. If they saw it, they simply did not care that the container was laying on the floor. This really should be improved. Breakfast was nice, they had many choices: sausages, bacon, eggs, yoghurt, fruits, bread, rolls, croissants, cake, other sweet breakfast things, jam and so on. You could get your coffee and tea by yourself or order a fresh cappucino for example. They managed the breakfast area well, opening up more space before it was too crowded. Tip: After the checkout we went to the train station and locked our luggage there as we still had 6 hours before our train left. It costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 7.50 for 24 hours. Locks are operated by maestro (with PIN) or credit card only, no cash. Just follow the signs in the train station. The hotel also offers to keep your luggage on a closed room, however as we did not feel like walking all the way back, we used the one in the station. So I can recommend this hotel who like to be a little bit away from the hustle and bustle of the city.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cNice Modern Hotel\u201d", "Author": "AAS", "ReviewID": "UR114803561", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights at the Movenpick which they list as being in the city center...not so much.

The room service food was pretty fabulous. There is a bit of a walk into the city center (Central Station) - about 1.5km, but if you take a tram (which is right outside the hotel), it's less than 5 minutes to the central station. However, there was a problem with using our traveller's checks (in Euros) to pay our final bill (at check out). The day prior, we specifically asked the front desk staff if we could use our traveller's checks (in the local Euro currency) as payment for our room bill. The staff on hand said \"Yes, as long as you use it for your room total and it's in the local Euro. There is no problem or commission charged.\" Upon check out, a different staffer told us that we'd be charged a 5% commisson (or 50 Euros) for using our traveller's checks as payment, which was completely different than what we were told the previous day. Since we checked out at 8 AM, there was no chance of going to a bank or foreign exchange place to change our travller's checks. The staffer on duty also told us that \"we were misinformed\" the day before and he was highly unprofessional while helping us. We were then charged the 50 Euro extra and no other apologies were given to us for being misled the previous day.

The city centre is about a 10 - 20 minute walk from the hotel but there is also a tram that departs daily & hourly from outside the Movenpick Hotel (Tram number 25). It is 2.25 Euros per person for an hours pass or you can buy a 24 hour pass for 7 euros per person whick is great value. I would reccomend this if you are going as far down as the museum district. Lastly to save money avoid taxis at all costs! dont get a taxi from outside of the Airport - we got one and it was 60 euros from the airport to the Movenpick hotel. Use the train station that is accesible from inside the airport terminal and you will get to the Central station for 4 euros per person - bargin!

Renting a bike on the 2nd day of our stay, and not towards the end, was a very good decision!! I have two negative comments about the hotel, and both are regarding room service. On 1 occasion, the tea cup and an empty bottle left the night before were not discarded, and in the case of the tea, not replaced. On another occasion, we left dirty towels on the floor of the bathroom when we left in the morning, and found them folded again when we came back in the evening. From previous experience I understood that leaving dirty towels on the floor is a request for clean ones? It was surely my expectation, which was not met.

We arrived late on Thursday night as our flight was delayed and walked from Centraal station. This is not a great idea, whilst it is only a 15 minute walk, with bags and with several of the roads under construction and with an entrance that appears much nearer than it is (you have to walk 400 metres-ish round instead of taking a direct bridge as there is for the neighbouring concert hall). When we checked in the service was rushed and un-friendly (an older gentleman with shaved head and glasses), and actually unhelpful when asking about ways to get about. We got to our room to find it was a twin-room, not a double as specifically requested but by this time we were so shattered that we just wanted to sleep. The inside of the toilet was absolutely disgusting, brown almost all over, as if they hadn't been cleaned in weeks or months. More fitting of a scene from trainspotting than a supposed 4 star hotel?! We assumed this would be sorted out when we left the following day (I indeed left a note for the cleaners written in Dutch and English), however it was still the same when we returned. The following morning I went to reception to tell them about this problem (and that we had run out of shower gel on the inbuilt dispenser), they said they would look into it immediately. When we returned there was an additional pile of towels, and various other bathroom accessories but no shower gel and still the same dirty toilet. This time I called reception by phone, around 30 minutes later a lady arrived from housekeeping that saw the toilet and told me she couldn't clean it as it required something stronger that would leave a bad smell in the room for us, I explained that I didn't mind as we were about to leave, but she insisted it couldn't be done. It was as if she didn't feel this was a problem (also still no shower gel despite another request). By this time I had given up and admitted defeat, it was pretty disgusting to have a filthy toilet in your room but they were not going to do anything about and I didn't want to spend my whole weekend complaining, they clearly didn't care. I also did not want to clean it myself and have to fork out for cleaning equipment that I would only use once. Until this point we also received no apology or explanation. There were also chips in the woodwork in the room and some of the shower panels were a bit dirty. When we checked out for the sake of the next guests I told them about the problem again which they finally apologised for but no idea if anything was done. In the hot weather a few extra waters in the fridge might be a nice suggestion too, as well more than one (normal) tea bag supplied each day. Positive points were a nice view of the harbour, and being quiet away from any street noise and good air con and shower. The was free internet (slow unless you paid extra) and we never made it to the fitness suite as in the hot weather a pool would have been nice, not a sauna.The single beds although not what was asked for were comfortable and clean. Also you can get the 35 tram from a 5 minute walk away to a large chunk of the city. There were no near shops or bars (apart from ones in the bar) so you felt also a bit isolated. For 150 euros a night this hotel doesn't come close to other hotels in terms of comfort. It is quite convenient for centraal station which you can get about easily from but it you are looking to pay around this amount per evening I have stayed at much nicer, and much better located places, where you will be treated with respect. Another minor thing is to check the Hotels.com small print, although it says all taxes included in the main text the small print says city tax is to be paid at the hotel, which was around an extra 5 euros a day. We had a really nice weekend despite these points but I would not recommend this place to any friends or family.

The room was very clean and it had a nice bathroom, there are tea and coffee facilities which are refilled each day. Breakfast wasn't included in our tarrif but 23 euros is alot for breakfast but you can get some cheaper breakfast options in the bar or just eat breakfast in town.If you have teenagers there are two free playstations outside the restaurant if they want that sort of entertainment. Don't bother with the expensive transfer bus from the airport that goes around all the hotels just get the train from the airport to central station and exit on the river side, ring the hotel and the free shuttle bus arrives twice and hour and will take you to the hotel it's very easy and much cheaper. You have to book the shuttle bus so if you are using it for your flight back book it in advance as it only carries about 6 to 8 pax on each journey.The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the centre of town but it's a nice walk if you want to be in the centre of Amsterdam you need to stay elsewhere or use the trams No 25 and 26 stop next to the hotel. Tram 25 goes to Dam square in two or 3 stops, you can buy the tram passes from the gift shop in the hotel 7 euros for 24 hours.Remember you have to pay a 5% hotel tax on check out. We really enjoyed staying at this hotel and it was quite nice to return to the peace and quiet at night and watch the boats on the river and then be refreshed to see the sights of Amsterdam the next day.

From the first when you see the hotel from outside looks very elegant and yes it is. We stay here for two days in a double, breakfast included room. The staff was very polite and always happy to help as for any question we have and especially the employ at the concierge. The hotel provides a free shuttle to the main train station but if you want you can walk there it is just a 10 minutes by the sea walk. The room was great with a breath taking view to the sea. The bed as I have already said it is a double one not two twins together like some other hotels do. The breakfast was very nice and has everything we ask for. Also the free Wifi is a plus and have very good speed. I must write something about the parking and help travellers by car like me. The hotel hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any parking itself but there is an underground municipal parking in front of the hotel but it cost 48 Euros per day. I believe that there is a lot of money so I can give you another much cheaper option. At the Amsterdam there are the P+R parking that cost 8 euro per day and also they give you, for how many you are, tram tickets to and from the city centre. The nearest P+R parking is the Zeeburg and by tram No 26 it is only 3 stops to Moevenpick. Just do not forget to validate your tickets at the tram because if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you lose the discount. A nice to see Amsterdam is the 7 euro daily tram ticket; if you buy one you will remember my words. The Moevenpick Amsterdam is a great hotel with great employs and, this is my opinion, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very far from city centre and i believe that in the summer staying at this hotel will be the best choise for a stay at the beautiful town of Amsterdam.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "KSW1", "ReviewID": "UR95738576", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel for the weekend and had a really great stay. 15 mins away from station but nice walk along the river, impressive hotel nice and clean with friendly staff, the room was modern and a great view over city.

Pros: * polished and efficient reception staff, * spacious, clean and comfortable room with sitting area, sufficient storage and good and plentiful lighting, * great views from the room (ask for a higher floor), * comfortable bed with good linen, * flat-screen TV with a good selection of channels, * very nice and clean bathroom (although the toiletries provided are limited), * no noise issues, * free shuttle to/from the central train station (needs to be pre-booked). Cons: * location wise, it is not in the thick of things; thus a little bit of a hassle getting into the historical centre (via shuttle, tram or long-ish walk) and there is a lack of restaurants nearby.

First point is take the back (riverside) exit, as it leads you out onto the main road, and then if you look right you can see the movenpick. I would stay that with a suitcase, I would definitely consider a cab, as it is more like a 5 to 10 minute walk over cobbled streets and felt a little far. The room itself was fine, I liked the hello Mr and Mrs Jones message on the TV, considering I was there with my girlfriend.

We were not at all disappointed. The hotel is only a 10-15 minute walk from Centraal Station or one stop on the tram (line 25 or 26). Being slightly out of the centre meant a really peaceful nights sleep but everything is very easily accessible. An unlimited 24 hour travelcard costs 7 euro and can be used on trams and buses (I think water buses too but we only used the tram). Upon check-in we found the staff the be incredibly helpful and friendly. We were initially told that the king bed we'd booked wasn't available however we could wait to see if this changed: we decided to wait and have a drink in the bar and within 10 minutes a king room had been found. If you do visit the bar I recommend the chocomel with whipped cream! Our room was on the 14th floor with amazing views over the river and city (I just wish we'd been lucky enough to experience clearer skies). Our room and bathroom were spotlessly clean throughout our stay. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms spacious. I used the free wi-fi several times and found the connection to be fast and reliable. We had breakfast both mornings and it was delicious with lots of choice, ranging from fruit and yoghurt to cold meats and cheese to bacon and eggs. We also had room service and ordered four cheese pizza and a chicken sandwich (from the night menu), both of which were delicious. Check-out was smooth and fast, and when we came back in the evening to collect our bags they were brought out to us very quickly. The only downside I can think of is a very minor complaint - the shower was quite weak, possible due to us being on such a high floor, and one of the main things I usually love about hotels is the power shower.

Because we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the middle of the city on a busy street, we were able to open our window a bit at night for fresh air, without any noise problems. The bathroom was a good size, with a great shower, and a speaker so you could listen to the television or radio from the room. The bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frosted glass door seemed a little odd at first, but although it let some light through, it gave as much visual privacy as a regular, solid door. Both the room and the bathroom, in fact, all areas of the hotel that we saw, were very clean. The hotels wireless internet worked well - it had a good strong signal and a fast connection. It was raining on the day we checked out, so we took the shuttle to the train station instead of walking.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value modern hotel!\u201d", "Author": "DJWH", "ReviewID": "UR87907370", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights in October and really loved this hotel.

The Tram - No25 passes by the hotel and stops at central station, then heads down to Dam Square, its about 2.60 Euro one way or get a 24/48/72 hr pass from the gift shop in the hotel for 7 Euros. we walked the first evening and its a good 30 mins till your in Dam Square, but if the weather is fine the walk is quite pleasant.

The hotel is next the the cruise terminal so would be handy if you were joining a cruise the next day or fancied a few nights before or after.

We booked this hotel with late rooms as a top secret hotel room only, 2 night 170 euros, otherwise I don't think I would have actually picked it to stay - but it actually was a fabulous choice. I always prefer to have breakfast included in the room rate, but as there are ample tea and coffee making facilities in the room - plus a large mini-fridge it too worked out perfectly! We were picked up at the central station by the very welcoming shuttle driver and then checked in with another warm welcome by Joyce who was so efficient and friendly and told us that we had been given a room with a fabulous view on the 15th floor. Joyce then rang us to check that we liked our room - such a nice and thoughtful touch, we felt very welcome! Our room was super romantic with amazing views, chic minamalist decor, lovely bathroom with shower/bath and good in-house movie selection. Most of all our room was nice and spacious which I know can be rare commodity in Amsterdam - so that was wonderful! The Movenpick was also spotlessly clean, neat, with everything looking brand spanking new, flawless and glossy. The thing that put me off before we visted were the reviews saying the hotel is too far out. Not true! It is a only 10 minute walk to the central station which is right in the thick of things. Plus with the 30 minutely shuttles you fly in to the centre in moments. Also the dockland area which is enjoying rejuvination is so very scenic and much quieter than most areas really is the best of both worlds. So ideal and scenic location, glamorous ultra modern hotel with fitness & sauna facilities, great staff , free broadband and super shuttle makes it the perfect choice! A big thank you to Joyce and Sylvia and the shuttle bus drivers who make our stay so memorable and thoroughly enjoyable! - Our only complaint was that we found the beds rather hard and the pillow rather unsubstantial and also there were two single duvets instead of one king sized one and the bathroom lighting was scarily bright and very unflattering!", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glossop / Derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly located away from the hustle & bustle\u201d", "Author": "SunnyGlossop", "ReviewID": "UR84751111", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night stay at The Moevenpick, (2 couples in there late 40s) Getting There Tip 1 - Get the train from the airport to Central Station it cost 4.20 Euros per person each way as opposed to 55/60 Euros in a taxi. The Hotel is only a 10 / 15 mins walk from Central Station or a couple of stops on the tram (No. 26) we decided to walk as it was such a nice day (leaving the station at the main entrance, turning left, following the road around a bend and then turning right, the hotel can then be seen dead ahead) Tip 1 - Watch out for bicycles! They are everywhere, and not to keen on slowing for pedestrians!! Keep out of the cycle lanes!! The hotel is large, modern, & comfortable, we found (in no particular order) - Free wi-fi in the rooms - 2 free Internet access points in the lobby - Excellent views of the Amstel River - Carpeted corridors (nice and quite) - Excellent breakfast choice - Shower over bath had good pressure - Iron & board - Hairdryer - Fridge (not stocked so ideal for filling with your own beers and choccies!!) - + all the usual complimentary toiletries - TV had BBC1, Sky News, CNN, Bloomberg + other foreign channels - Sauna & Gym (although not used by us) Tip 2 - A must for getting about is a Tram / Bus pass, get your ticket at the shop in the hotel, it cost 11.5 Euros for a 48 hr pass, the tram stop is over the road from the hotel. Pass becomes active from your 1st journey (note - every time you get on AND off the tram you must place you pass in front of the scanner located at exits on the trams) There is a free bus ran by the hotel into the centre but we used the trams as we often went further afield. Tip 3 - We found the 8 Euro canal boat tour (forgot the name but were brown Teak wooden boats) to be very good value for money, they are located close to the train station next to the Thomson Canal boat tours which were 2 and 3 times the price Staff - All very helpful throughout our stay, very attentive. If you want a hotel where you walk straight out onto the canals then this is not for you, if you are looking for a hotel that is away from the hustle & bustle, yet still within easy reach of all that Amsterdam offers then you wont go far wrong with The Moevenpick.

The restaurant was quite pricey, and had limited choices, but was very good. The bar food was excellent, as was room service, which surprisingly only cost 50c more than the bar prices - quite unusual for a hotel of this quality. Our only issues were the pretty useless coffee machine, the reluctance of the housekeeping staff to replenish the tea and coffee items, their strange habit of leaving clean towels on the side, while the used ones were on the rail - rather defeating the 'Please leave your towels on the rail if you are happy to re-use them' message! There was also a reluctance to change bed-linen. we commented on this when we left, and the management took the time to e-mail us with their apologies. This hotel more than lived up to its 4 stars.

First things first, the name is misleading - this hotel is definitely not located at the city center, in fact quite the contrary. However, this is actually not a problem at all - in fact, quite the reverse. Read on to find out why I am saying so.... Location: The hotel is located about ten minutes walk from Amsterdam's Central Station (which is where you will be arriving if you take the train into town from Schiphol airport). It's located just on the canal's edge, and large cruise-ships dock right in front of the hotel! The location is by no means central - however, in a city like Amsterdam with its boisterous nightlife, this can actually be a blessing in disguise. After a long day of walking around and seeing the sights, being kept awake by rowdy partying till the wee hours of the morning, is not my idea of a great location :) - which is why we chose not to stay at the Swissotel Amsterdam (located at Dam Square, right in the heart of the nightlife area). Transportation: The hotel runs a complimentary shuttle service to and from the Central Station every half-hour. Upon arriving at Central station, we called the reception and were given precise instructions on where to exit and wait for the van to pick us up, and right on the dot at 5 minutes past the hour, there it was to take us to the hotel! Very efficient. I think it runs right till 10pm. We used the shuttle service a few times to get to the Central Station. It is always better to call the reception in advance and let them know that you intend to use the shuttle, though, as they will not run in case there aren't any people wanting to go to-and-fro. There is also a tram-stop right next to the hotel, and the number 26 (?) takes you conveniently into town. From Central Station - Dam Rak, the Olde Kerk, Madame Tussauds, and the famed red-light district is a short walk away. While coming back to the hotel on the tram, do remember to alight at the Piet Heinkade stop, rather than at the one-stop-earlier MusikGebouw stop - while the latter stop looks (deceptively so) like right in front of the hotel, because of the layout of the overbridge you actually end up walking more, to get to the entrance. I spent quite a bit of time and text on transportation. This is because we had read the reviews here on Tripadvisor while planning our trip, and were a bit concerned with the frequent mentions about location and the fact that it was away from the city centre. But after staying there, I can safely opine that location will not be a hindrance to any of our touring plans. The hotel even helped book us an airport-transfer at an unearthly 430am at a very nominal price. Check-in: we were greeted at the reception with a warm smile and the check-in process was very efficient. We had booked a package directly with the hotel wherein if you stayed over a weekend, you get to stay for 3nights while paying for only 2. It also included an option of either a free breakfast or an upgrade to the executive room - we chose the latter and were given one of their executive rooms on the 20th floor. Throughout our stay, we found all the members of the staff to be not only efficient, but friendly - which is not something you would always find in similarly large hotels (the Moevenpick has 400+ rooms.) Room: the room was very spacious - not only could we lay out both our large suitcases, there was enough room to walk around them! The bed was huge. And so was the bathroom. After the rather-cramped room in Lucerne (our previous stop), the generous proportions of the Moevenpick room was very welcome! But I have saved the best for last :) - and that is, the view! Our room gave us an expansive view of the Amsterdam skyline and the main canal. See one of the pictures and judge for yourself. My wife and I loved to come back to the room and sit by the window admiring the view. Other amenities: the rooms come with free wi-fi access. We used this a couple of times and found the access speed to be decent enough. We ordered from their room-service menu a few times, and the quality of most of the items was definitely above average. Service was prompt and efficient. Their prices are not too high - which is good, because I must caution you that there are no other eateries nearby other than a Subway sandwich outlet, so if you choose not to dine at the hotel you will need to find your way back to town. We did not use any of the other amenities, as we were out much of the time. Overall, we had a most enjoyable and comfortable stay at the Moevenpick Amsterdam. Try and book directly with the hotel website, as they often have value-for-money deals/packages advertised on their site. I would most definitely recommend this hotel without the slightest hesitation to all.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood choice!\u201d", "Author": "Dan1113", "ReviewID": "UR80465219", "Content": "We stayed here over the New Year.

You will end up having to pay a ridiculous amount for a taxi or walking home and wishing you picked a placer closer to the city. First, there was no trash can in our bathroom, then we had to call down for the robes. But I could forgive that if it wasn't for the fact that we had a tv in our room from the 80's and even worse the picture was scrambled on the tv. The first night we asked the concierge to fix it and we were promised that it would be done by the next day. Unfortunately, the next day the tv was the same. Despite 2 more requests, the tv from the 80's was still not fixed. Everytime we complained about the tv, the staff seemed so concerned but each time we went back to tell them the tv was not fixed, they looked at us llike there was something wrong with us. Moving onto to other far worse details about this hotel, there was HAIR IN OUR BEDS!!

It simply does not worth it to pay extra money. Poor wine selection, only house wines, white and red without variants, tea or coffee and some snacks. It is better to save 50-70 euros and to drink in a bar. The stuff is also not so friendly. Woman from housekeeping asked us to leave the room for cleaning.

Pros: Gorgeous rooms are congruent with the elegant lobby. Met with welcoming letter from hotel GM, a very nice touch. Comfortable beds, modern furniture, stylish artwork and a (small) plasma TV highlight the room, which is also a good size for Amsterdam. Great views of the harbor from almost any floor. Breakfast buffet was superb, with an impressive variety of hot and cold items. Away from the main road, there is no exterior noise to contend with. Oversized, well-lit bathroom with a large mirror, good shower pressure with immediate hot water. Top-quality toiletries, as one would expect here. Two fast internet PCs in the lobby with free internet and printing services was definitely appreciated. Nice card insert concept upon room room entry to activate lights; this energy preservation initiative should be adopted in North America. For a fast meal, there's a Subway restaurant about 200m east of the hotel. Cons: Key card given upon arrival to room did not work. After 36 hours up and a long flight, this was annoying. Office chair and sinking sofa in the room were not terribly comfortable. Quality of staff is hit and miss, though the front line staff are evidently well-trained. Most working the breakfast were cold and indifferent. Upon check-in, they will try to sell you upgraded rooms; I felt the Glengarry Glen Ross 'ABC' mentality was pervasive here, and somewhat deceptive. For example, rooms with a \"fully stocked bar\" actually receive two cans of coke and two Heinekens for the entire duration of your stay, which is worth about $5 U.S., so be warned. For non-Europeans, you will find stepping in/out of the elevated shower rather awkward, but get used to it in Europe.

When we arrived in Amterdam we had to wait around the town with our bags as the check-in isn't until 3pm and we arrived at 7:30am.

(this is something we wern't aware of) but was told it was only about 5% of the price. So it wasn't a major issue. The room was very nice and spacious. With a large comfy bed, sofa and desk and a very nice shower. The views were beautiful out of the large windows. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was a bit too pricey and we just waited until we got in to the centre.

Unless you are too cheap to pay for a pass then location isn't a problem. The trams that stop outside the hotel are 25/26. 25 goes as far as the Rijksmuseum so you can do most things without changing at Centraal. The hotel itself is outstanding. Free WiFi (albeit on a limited connection but you likely won't need to download 1GB of data), extremely modern and most importantly it's spotless. I can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat there. As usual for hotels it's overpriced. Go outside and enjoy a local restaurant. We had room 1402 which was 2 single beds with an absolutely stunning view overlooking the water and Centraal Station. The hotel is quite near the train tracks but we did not hear a thing - the windows are fabulous. The only slight criticism I have was that the beds were a little firm for my taste.

While it is not located in the center of the city ( 10 minute walk to central station) you can use their shuttle for free on the 1/2 hour to the central train station. From there you can reach anywhere in the city easily either by walking or taking the trams. We purchased the I am Amsterdam card for two days and it paid off as we visited 4 museums and two days of the tram travel plus a canal ride. It is a modern hotel with great service. Free wifi in the room. For large downloads you have the choice to pay for an upgrade. Recommend it for before the cruise or after. They let us check in at noon. Also you can leave your luggage in their baggage check before check in which is great for after the cruise, as you can leave the ship in no hurry, go next door, do a baggage check, take their shuttle for free and visit the city avoiding taxi ques and fares or take a 15 minute ride on the train plus 10-15 minute walk to visit the windmills at Zaanse Schans, a good side trip and come back later to check in. Or reverse, check out take, do a baggage check, go to Zaanse Schans for a visit which you can do in 3-4 hours depending on how long you want to stay and then go back and check in for the cruise. I cannot recommend it enough for cruise people. However if you are into bed and breakfast, older hotels, or if you want to walk out your door an be in the center of the city itis not for you. Make sure you ask for a room with tub some only have showers. Lastly you can take the train from the airport to Central Station for 5--$6 per person 15-20 minutes. You do have to lug your luggage, hopefully yours is on wheels, then go to the water side of the terminal and wait for their shuttle or call them (take their number with you, although I could not find a pay phone) and they will pick you up for free.

Yes just a 50yds walk and you are on the ship. The Room was large enough almost US standars and we had with us two large suitcases and had all the space we needed for hanging those gala outfits for the cruise.

All those friends recommendations. Food and drink service might feel a little expensive but the standars of service and quality you get is worth the price. The staff was great and friendly fluent in english and spanish gave us tips and maps for our visit.

Have a look around! A BIG ADVANTAGE HERE - The Movenpick Hotel runs a free shuttle bus service both to and from the hotel every half-hour. You can pre-book yourself on to this by asking a member of staff, and then they will drop you off at Central Station; where you can also arrange for them to collect you on the return journey at a later time in the day/evening. The Movenpick Hotel is absolutely stunning inside with modern fittings and furniture, all well maintained and extremely clean. The staff are some of the best I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, are always happy to talk and help you should you need assistance in finding your way around the city or any general room enquiries you may have. You enter the hotel into a large open reception / seating area (which also has computers with internet access - the hotel also has free WiFi throughout the rooms), and also a concierge service. The rooms are extremely well laid out and the room I stayed in had a lovely king size bed (the bedding itself was heavenly!). The room consisted of the bed, sofa bed, table and chairs, lights eight side of the bed, a telephone, television (with British channels too e.g. Sky News), electronic safe (extremely useful and included in the price) and plenty of storage for clothes. The bathroom again was superb, with a large shower area including a glass screen and tiled throughout. The bathroom was also equipped with a speaker, which was located under the basin, which carried the audio from the television into the bathroom...very nice touch. We also ordered room service on a number of occasions, including breakfast and dinner. For breakfast we ordered a range of items such as cereal, toast and sausages. Each day you can fill out a breakfast order slip, specifying what you would like and a time at which you want it, and leave this on your door handle for them to collect. Each time our order arrived EXACTLY on time and always gave a couple of knocks on the door to make sure you were awake. I loved the experience of room service here as they were so polite and punctual with your ordering process. Prices can be viewed on the more pricey side, but room service generally is a bit more. I would definitely recommend you try it at least once just to experience it. There is also a health and spa facility including a gym and sauna; but I did not use any of these facilities. Although I did go up there and look around and it all looked very clean and high quality throughout. To sum up my experience of The Movenpick Hotel, it was by far the nicest place I have stayed and would most definately stay there again - I HIGHLY recommend you stay here.

The canal boats are very good value for money and you get to see around the city in comfort. Highly recommended. When we went, the Euro vs GBP was not favourable and everything seemed very expensive. For example: One bar called \"The Euro Bar\" in the Centre, charged us the equivalent of \u00c2\u00a320.00 for one Vodka & Coke (single) and one beer.

What an awesome stay! The service from the entire staff, and most especially concierge Remko, was about the best we have ever had (and we've travelled a lot). The hotel itself was great - comfortable bed, plenty of room, powerful shower, free internet, good location, very good restaurant (we had dinner there our last night). The day of our cruise (and 11 days before our hotel stay was to begin), we arrived early so went to the hotel lobby to wait. Remko was very helpful right out of the gate when we arrived for our cruise later that day, even though we were only waiting in the lobby - and he did not yet know we were staying there post-cruise. He took our baggage, and (after we told him we would be staying afterwards) gave us plenty of advice about our upcoming stay after our cruise. When we returned post-cruise, the very helpful receptionist at the front desk cheerfully checked us in early before 11am, allowing my tired wife to take a nap. We've had many difficulties on other trips getting early check-in, so this was a welcome change. I wish I had noted her name! We also had trouble with a broken wheelchair wheel. We got back to the hotel late on that night, and one of the staff at the front desk saw the broken wheel and immediately did some web searches to find a wheelchair supply facility. I did some additional web research that night, and then in the morning Remko once again stepped in and made many calls for us, ultimately recommending the place (and providing directions there) that in fact was able to fix our chair. Remko also gave us lots of good advice about restaurants, travel and do's/don'ts. Remko's colleague was also quite helpful. The Movenpick has an outstanding set of people at the Movenpick Amsterdam, with Remko simply the best concierge we have ever encountered. Tip: Use the train to/from the airport. A 10-minute walk to hotel, or the use the free hotel shuttle van. 8 euro train (for 2), vs 60-70 euro taxi! The hotel & cruise terminal is about a 10 minute walk to the main downtown area, just outside the train station.

Our bathroom had a large tub and separate shower with top notch Bulgari amenities. Heated floor was a nice feature when we experienced temparetures up to -10\u00c2\u00b0 at night outside. Bed is king size but a bit to soft to my taste. It comes with 2 single duvets instead of a large one. Kind of odd but you got used to it. The room also had a Nespresso machine, free wi fi and a music system. Sound proof is good although we could hear the noisy lift's engine at night so be aware if you are a light sleeper. I would imagine this was due to being on the top floor. Moevenpick is definitely a great option for Amsterdam.

This is a beautiful and nearly new hotel. The desk staff were friendly and spoke perfect English. The views from my 20th floor room (an upgraded floor due to a hotel promotion) were simply gorgeous, and it was fun to look down on an immense cruise ship docked next to the hotel as well as watch all the boat and ship traffic on the Ij. I didn't eat or drink at the hotel (probably my loss), so I can't comment on the room service, the restaurants, or the bar. The main issue that might concern some people is location, but I didn't find that to be an issue. First of all, the No. 25 and 26 trams both run to and from Centaal Station, and both stop right near the hotel. The one trick one has to learn to ride the trans to or from the Musiekgebouw stop is how to get to the hotel from that stop. After one figures it out, it's a simple matter of crossing an interesting footbridge and using the stairs at the west end of the Musiekgebouw, but that route could be difficult to find if one didn't already know where to look. An alternative to the Musiekgebouw stop is the Passenger Terminal Amsterdam (PTA) stop on tram No, 25 -- the stop after Musiekgebouw on the route from Centraal Station. The PTA stop is impossible to miss, because it is the teminus of Line 25. From the PTA stop, it is a short easy walk to the hotel (circa one city block, if that), and the hotel dominates the landscape and therefore is easy to find.. My recommendation: If you are traveling from Centraal Station to the hotel for the first time, take the No, 25 tram to the PTA stop, and walk from there. One thing that is nice about the No. 25 line is that it runs through much of Amsterdam, roughly from north to south. If you hop on this tram at the PTA or Musiekgebouw stop, you can grab a seat before the tram loads up with passengers at Centraal Station. (The No. 26 tram, going west, runs only to Centaal Station. However, heading east it runs all the way out to Ijburg.) The hotel shuttle proved convenient as a way to get to Centraal Station. (I didn't try it as a way to get from the station to the hotel, but probably would have called the hotel for a ride had I not been such a mass transportation addict.) It's true that one needs to make a \"reservation\" for the shuttle, but that is not a major hassle. Basically, the shuttle runs at any given time only if there are people who want to ride in it, and making a \"reservation\" means only that one needs to tell the concierge that one would like a ride. I showed up in the lobby at just a few minutes before the hour one day, and simply asked for a ride in the shuttle -- and there was no problem at all.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201ctoo far away from mostly everything you want to see\u201d", "Author": "TinaNYC", "ReviewID": "UR50065893", "Content": "Nice, clean, functional hotel.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the major problem and I know it has been mentioned before, but you really, really need to consider it before you stay here: you are a good ten minute walk from anything in the parts of Amsterdam you want to see.

There are no restaurants, clubs, stores, anything nearby except Muziekgebouw aan \u00e2\u20ac\u2122t IJ, the new concert hall. (Tip, if you are staying at the Movenpick, you can walk up the footbridge to the concert hall and then walk down a few flights of steps to get to the entrance of the hotel. Otherwise, you actually have to walk by the hotel to get to the front and that just exacerbates your annoyance.). My other tip is to stock up on snacks and drinks at either the AH or HEMA outposts in Central Station before your trek.

My one gripe- the lobby is quite small and it can seem like the concierge and desk staff are staring you down as you walk though- a bit overbearing for my tastes. The hotel also has underground parking which is very convenient (and rare to find in central Amsterdam).

We found a great buy 2 nights - get 1 night free rate, and since we split the room we each payed only like $10 more than our buddies who were slumming it. And boy, what a wonderful hotel. ON the waterfront, with a WONDERFUL view of the water and the incomin cruiseships - very serene especially when you're relaxing after a full day of debauchery. There was a tram stop right arcross the hotel, but even at 3am when I walked back alone from Centraal (a 5-10min walk) there was no danger at all - very nice walk on brightly lit main roads. There is also a free shuttle every half hour to centraal. The room itself was very spacious, and very modern in design which I loved. The funky unclosable glass door was a bit weird at first but hell, you're in AMsterdam so lose your inhibitions! There is also a nice sofa in the room. We opted to go in for the free breakfast over being upgraded to the next level of room - and what a good choice that way. The breakfast buffet was EXPANSIVe to say the leave, with tons of fresh bread, salads, meats, yogurts and a fresh omelette station. All 3 days we ended up eating so much at the breakfast (it closes at 11, but we woke up at 10:45 and rushed there, and they let us stay till we finished, no rush) that we never had to eat again till the evening! Seeing the cramped quarters my friends ended up, i was glad we chose this hotel! it may not be a very 'happening' place like the other hostels in the center of town, but believe me - you'll do fine drinking and partying there but having a nice quiet, posh place to come back to (especially if you have company ;)). There is a great gym that we didnt take advatange of, and there are free computers you can use near the lobby.

I was a little skittish about the location because this was my first trip to Amsterdam and wasn't so sure about being out of the City Center. So I split my 10 day visit between here and another hotel inside the city center and I have to say this was a far better choice. Service from check in to check out is excellent, there was ALWAYS someone in the lobby to greet me and they had a very efficient and friendly concierge service. The room is FANTASTIC! Big, modern and incredible views of the city and the port. I would say the rooms are comparable to the \"W\" chain in the US. Free wifi and all sorts of great details, a nice little fridge, gorgeous huge bathroom (with speakers wired to the TV! hidden under the sink, nice touch.) The only slight negative is the European fetish for pushing two twin beds together and declaring it one bed. The room was also decorated with very light colors, so it was a very relaxing feel. Room Service! The prices for room service were actually reasonable! And the food was really good! I ordered breakfast through room service every morning, an omelette and sasuage and toast was around 11 Euros, very well prepared and always delivered in about 10 minutes. I also had a sandwich one afternoon and it was pretty good as well. I did try the bar and the food in the bar and it was fine, actually pretty good, service is slow down there though. They also have a free gym, though it's a small fitness room, and not much equipment for such a large hotel. It will take about 15 lonely minutes to get to Central Station walking. They have a shuttle that goes there every 30 minutes, but you have to sign up for it, even if it's just a few minutes before it leaves. There are two tram stops as well in the vicinity. After a night of \"activity\" in the city, I usually took a cab back at about 3 or 4am and it cost me 10Euro from Dam Square, although some cab drivers told me 15 so I walked away until they said 10. I also decided I would take the challenge and did manage to get back to the hotel at 4 am pretty snockered with no trouble whatsoever. I cannot imagine doing this during an Amsterdam winter. I found that coming back to the hotel after a day of chaos in the city was actually the perfect relaxation. They provide a very calming and prefessional environment. It was the best antidote to the craziness that goes on when you're in the city. Also there is absolutely NOTHING around the hotel except for a lonely little gift shop next door and a rather sad Subway Sandwich shop next to the cruise terminal, so be prepared and use the fridge if you need some snacks.

I must comment on the room safe - maybe this type is common now, but it was so easy to use with a digital coding system. Also, the cleaning crew was so kind, they actually tucked in my daughters teddy bears for us. She loved it when we would return to the room after they had been there. At one point, I called down to the front desk for extra towels and they were there in less than three minutes. I was surprised.

The hotel has spectacular views of the IJ (I ws on the 17th floor). It sits over the water and the rooms face either north or south overlooking the river. It is very clean. Wifi in the room is free and in my room it was strong. The room layouts vary. I had a king bed, a desk and \"couch\" (more on that later). I noticed in two hotels in Amsterdam that they had a split duvet on the bed. It is two twin size duvets, which I found annoying. I am used to one large covering for the entire bed. If my wife was there, I would have hated it, but I did get used to it (sort of) after a couple of nights. The inordinately firm \"couch\" is the hardest couch I ever sat on. Not particularly comfortable for lounging. The bathroom is a nice size. but has this not-so-ingenious glass partition with a hinged end (I have no idea why). After every shower I had to mop the floor. Same thing at another Amsterdam hotel. I guess if you keep the water at a trickle, the floor might stay dry. Also, the tub has a very high side - be careful getting in and out. I had breakfast every day (it was included with our corporate plan) in the restaurant, which has an unusual layout. You can sit at high tables with tall chairs or low tables with awkward benches. The food was good and there was a decent selection. I did like that they left a pot of coffee on the table (most days). The room service menu seemed to be pretty limited. I only ordered in one time and it was delivered promptly. If you cannot get out, you are pretty restricted there. For the budget conscious, there is a Subway in the same building past the passenger terminal entrance. Interestingly enough, it is cheaper than in the US. Service is somewhat spartan. Laudry? You have to bring it down to them- unheard of in better hotels. Shuttle? They tell you it runs every 30 minutes to Central Station between the station and the Water Taxi landing.

The hotel was perfectly situated for us, a short, pleasant walk from the city center (10 minutes), but far enough away that we weren't assaulted by noise and traffic at all hours. We chose the hotel because we got a great rate online, but we were surprised at how personal and comfortable this hotel was for a \"business class\" hotel. The rooms were extremely soundproof, and the cleaning staff was very respectful and quiet in the hallways in the morning, so we slept soundly. We requested a view of the River Ij and got one. The panoramic view from our window on the 12th floor was breathtaking: we could see the river and the entire city spread out before us. Every morning on our way out, we grabbed an apple from the front desk, and in the evening when we returned, we helped ourselves to a refreshing glass of mineral or sparkling water in the lobby. Bottled water was also complimentary in our room...a nice change from the American model of charging $5 a bottle! We very much appreciated the security safe in our room, the coffee and tea service, and the free wi-fi for our laptop. As we never eat breakfast in the hotel, the high price of breakfast didn't bother us at all. It's a better deal, and more fun, to find a cafe in town anyway. For late-starters (like us), eat the Cafe Panorama, on Raadhuisstaat--they have a great fried-egg, spinach, and feta on toast deal that is scrumptious! Probably the best thing about the Movenpick, for us, was the ability to rent bikes downstairs, in the parking garage, from Amsterbike. We were blessed with great weather all week, so we decided to explore the city like the natives, on two wheels. Our friendly and helpful bike rental guy, \"Rad,\" set us up with sturdy three-speed cruisers, complete with bike locks and head- and rear lights. He even set me up with a basket one day, so I could shop at the outdoor market on Saturday. I would HIGHLY recommend renting from Amsterbike, even if you don't stay at the Movenpick. Rad was super helpful, his bikes are top-notch, and they have a special underground bike lockup area that made it easy to get in and out.

The only negative was the location, but the positives far outweighed this and we would definitely stay here again. In fact we immediately booked it upon returning to Amsterdam the following week. Positives: Rooms and beds: The rooms are a great size, and well designed for comfort. We thought the beds were extremely comfortable, nice and firm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than many of the European beds one tends to sink into and wake up with back pain. Bedding was not top of the line like some other major hotel chains, but perfectly comfortable and very clean. The window seat/couch allowing you to gaze out on the great views was very well placed. I imagine every hotel room must have a good view at this hotel. The rooms had every typical amenity \u00e2\u20ac\u201csafe, coffee maker, complimentary water, fridge, iron. The best part for us was the extremely thick door which killed all noise from the hallway. The rooms are built to isolate you away from noise. Bathrooms: Wonderful. Thoroughly modern, with great amenities, fantastic hot water, and nice water pressure. Even better, they were always cleaned impeccably. The only thing I would change would be the towel quality. Lobby: Adequate and modern. There was ice water, apples or various treats available each day at the reception. Nice touch usually found with Moevenpick. (Now if they could get the staff to smile more....) Internet: Free wireless access in rooms! What more could one ask for! Negatives: Staff: While some of the staff were very helpful and nice most seemed cold and unfriendly. Smiling did not seem to be an option. We spent a long time arguing with one such staff member that we would not be paying an additional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on top of our priceline fees. He was adamant in wanting to charge us a nightly fee \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unique to Moevenpick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that priceline and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some customers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot understand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The level of condescension toward us could not have been made more clear in this conversation. Needless to say, as per our priceline agreement, we did NOT pay any additional fees. Location and Access: This is really the only major flaw with this hotel. You definitely cannot walk from this hotel to central Amsterdam \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you must take the tram. It comes very regularly but not in front of the hotel. In fact getting to and from the tram stop was quite irritating. You have to either cross a dangerous highway-like street to get to the hotel, or use an overpass that actually takes you to another building -and because of the crazy construction obstructing the way to the front doors, you have two choices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c going up a long series of stairs to a platform and then down another series to get to the hotel doors, or walking all the way around the construction. Either way we always found ourselves nearly run over by the bicyclists that use this street while attempting to quickly cross it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then trying to choose the best route to the hotel. Were the other merits of this hotel less, the location issues would have caused me to give it a lower rating.

It was our birthday celebration and they left a Best Wishes Birthday note, a box of cookies and a 72% chocolate bar for us. Very nice. The reviews here are spot on with comfort zones that will please Americans and English speakers, so I won't repeat them. Seems we heard more English than Dutch while visiting. The one down side to this visit was taking the first shower. I couldn't figure out the water spout switch between the tub and shower head. As I was bending over the faucets, I inadvertantly used the right handed control which controls the hot/cold water and not the direction of the water. What happened next is that scalding hot water fell from the shower head and burned my back and feet. My spouse had to come in and turn the water off because I was screaming in pain, nearly slipping on the wet floor from the lack of a shower curtain. It took over 30 minutes to recover from the burn and I had marks on my back the rest of the day. I don't understand why scalding water is allowed to the guest rooms or why they insist on these new fangled switches with no instructions on which way to turn them for a shower or tub filling. The second negative is that we had breakfast in the restaurant at 9am the first morning which was 23 euros each and the hot food was cold which is obscene for the price. Everything was self serve, so the price is way out of the reality of 'typical breakfast service'. We didn't return for another meal.

A Hotel review is based on a personal and subjective opinion. What may be acceptable to you, may not be to me, and vice versa. Location: 5 mins from Central Station next to the Ferry Terminal. Some find it inconvenient. It really isn't, and I actually find it an advantage. Great river views from the higher floors...no city noise or drunk British people, larger modern rooms. I have stayed in many central Amsterdam Hotels, and this is my new favorite. Do as I did and rent a black granny bike for your entire stay....from Linda at STAR CYCLES, literally visible from your room window, and a 5 min walk away. There is the Hotel affilliated Yellow Cycles in the Hotel basement parking lot, but lots more Euro's and not as funky. Besides, Linda makes great coffee. Safety: Very good. This is Amsterdam. Well lit pedestrian pathway from Station to Hotel, or go one stop on Tram #26 from Central Station. It can't be easier. 8/10 Property: 20 floor modern construction. Swiss owned chain. Nice, clean, modern... oh, did I say modern? Well, it is Swiss. Check in: Good. Arrived early, but was assigned a room on arrival. Helpful international staff. Asked for, and was given high floor away from elevator etc. Great view of the passenger ferries going across to N Amsterdam, plus all the regular Euro barge traffic and river cruise ships. Bar: Enjoyed several cups of excellent coffee on morning of arrival. Restaurant menu and breakfast looked pretty god, although I didn't eat there. Extensive room service menu at reasonable (for a Hotel) prices. Room: Ahh...at last a room size comparable to the USA. Curiously a king bed, with 2 separate duvet sets. Bed is one base unit, not a euro splitter special. Good pillow choices. Mid quality sheets. Bed way too hard..... Great bathroom, sleek and modern. Towels, surprisingly threadbare. Nice personal care products. Useful sofa area under window. Shower good....had a little fun working out the bath/shower mixer tap...beware, this water is HOT. Free use In-room safe, ironing board and iron etc. Excellent in-room tea and coffee making facilities. A great touch. An empty fridge for all your room swag ! More kudos ....can it get better ? ....yes, read on. Could do with a flat screen tv upgrade. Tons of CNN/Bloomberg stuff but english speaking channels a bit limited. 500 satellite channels available for eurox5 per day. Internet: Free wifi in room and public areas. At last a Hotel that recognizes that wifi is essential today, and does not abuse their customers with ridiculous overcharging for puny 11mbs connections masquerading as broadband. That in itself will keep business amd tourist travelers alike coming back. WTG Movenpick! 9/10 Conclusion: An unexpected impressive experience.

We agree that the hotel experience is one of the highlights of our exciting trip. We give it a 4.5 stars rating, not a 5, for some minor flaws. Pros: 1. Hotel and Room: The hotel is new unlike many other hotels in Amsterdam. The contemporary design of the hotel building together with its neighboring Muziekgebouw (Music Hall) makes a new landmark. The room is coherently designed also with minimalist concepts. The hotel is built by the water and each room has a beautiful water view through a large window. Its washroom is roomy. I however find its 1/4\" frosty glass washroom door with no lock an odd idea. 2. Foods and Room Service: Its Silk Road restaurant offers excellent dining experience. But if you are lazy like we were, do not miss its room service. It has an extensive menu. The food is excellent, especially the deserts - hands down! 3. Service: The staff is polite and genuinely helpful and seems always available when you need them. There also is training staff on site in hotel's exercise room. All phone requests are nicely handled by knowledgeable staff. 4. Location: It takes 15 minutes to walk to the Central Station, which takes you to the airport in another 20 minutes. It's convenient for those stay for a short period of time. It's neighboring \"Music Hall\" offers frequent music events (up to 4 events a day) covering classical, jazz and \"world/folk\". The Concertgebouw, which is quite distant from the hotel, often offers more interesting musical alternatives. Cons: 1. TV and TV Programming: Its TV is very small. It's difficult to enjoy movies (10 Euro each) on such a small screen. The hotel offers about 32 channels in 8 languages. English speakers get CNN world, BBC world, Bloomberg Channel and MSNBC world only. 2. Location: For those who love to stroll in the city, it might be wise to pick a hotel in the city centre. It takes 15 minutes to walk to the Central Station and might take another half an hour just to get to the Dam Square. The hotel however offers free shuttle services to the Central Station by request. There are also two tram (street car - 1.6 Euro per zone per person) lines that have stops near the hotel. 3. Gym: Its gym is more like an exercise room. It has fancy equipment and dumbbells up to 10kg. Bodybuilders will not find this facility useful. 4. Price: Moevenpick Hotel is expensive, but all good hotels in Amsterdam are expensive. I've stayed in a few hotels at the same price range.

Previous reviews of this hotel are spot on. If you arrive at Central Station and plan to walk to the hotel, exit out the back (towards the water), cross the road and turn right. You will see the hotel as you take a leisurely (10-15 minute) walk along the water. If you plan on taking the 25 tram, exit the front of the station and turn left. Tram 25 departs from the end of the station. We found it easier to disembark the tram at the second stop (going past the hotel) as you did not need to cross the road or walk the ramp. Also, the hotel runs a shuttle service to the station every thirty minutes (hour and half hour) dropping off at the loading area at the back of the station. This is by request and it does not operate if no one is coming from the hotel, but we were able to catch a ride back to the hotel by waiting for the shuttle one day. Definitely use the shuttle to the station as an alternative to walking or the tram. Tram tickets are good for two hours. The staff at this hotel is superb. Very friendly, willing to assist with any questions and there is an adequate number of people in the lobby. We arrived early (8:00am) and knew our room was not ready. The cordial desk clerk gave us keys to the fitness center so we could shower, change clothes and then check our luggage prior to heading into the city. Stopped back after 3:00 pm and our room was ready for us on the 17th floor. Our room overlooked the city and harbor. Marvelous view with boats coming and going, cruise ships docking and the lights of the city. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, great Dutch cheese and crackers in the room each evening just to take in the view. As others have mentioned, the rooms are basic but comfortable. In room safe, refrig, tea and coffee packets provided. Nice size modern bathroom with tub/shower. I still am trying to figure out the crazy half glass shower wall as each time I used the shower the bathroom floor ended up wet. Could use an upgrade on the locker room quality towels. Bed was comfortable but surprised there were no mattress pads. Duvets were o.k. Heat/AC is easily controlled on wall thermostat. TV had many stations in Dutch but a few English speaking stations as well. Lobby has two free computers with internet connections and printer for those who do not want to haul a laptop. Spent our time visiting sites in Amsterdam, a day trip to Harlem (great/charming city) and walking the canals. If you want a great dining experience, have the staff make a reservation at the Fifteen restaurant. Fifteen is located in walking distance from the hotel and was started by Jamie Oliver, The Naked Chef, in late 2004. Fun environment, great food and wine and pleasant young staff.

The check in process was friendly and efficient. My booking request for a high floor had been noted and I was given a room on the 16th floor. No cruise ship in dock that night unfortunately but really amazing views. The room was absolutely top notch, just beautiful. Really nicely designed, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was equally impressive apart from the strange lack of washcloths and an extractor fan that whistled constantly like a haunted house. I used the (very welcome) free wi-fi and it seemed to work fine. I slept well and woke up to a beautiful sunrise over the river. So far, pretty good but now for the bad part. Breakfast was included in my room rate and what happened in the restaurant totally soured the entire experience. Without doubt it was the worst service I've ever had in a 4 star hotel. I arrived at 0930 and it was not busy but seemed very disorganised. The range of food and quality couldn't be faulted. The tables were not laid properly so I had to ask for cutlery. I'd been been sat and eating for 10 minutes but not one of the three waiting staff had offered me coffee. Again I had to ask. I had to ask again for a refill (have NEVER had that in any hotel, the waiters are usually falling over themselves to top your cup up). All the time I was there, I didn't see any of the waiters instigate any communication with the diners. Everything had to be asked for. But this is the strangest thing - 20 mins before the end of breakfast service, there was a sudden flurry of activity and the staff started to lay all the tables! They must have laid for about 40 covers when there was only maybe 5 people that came through the door in that time. Unfortunately they didn't even do it properly so a man opposite sat down and had a coffee mug and placemat but had to awkwardly ask for some cutlery. It really was an amazing shambles.

The only advantage I saw to this place is that if you come post-cruise, it's right next door to the cruise terminal. Its location is otherwise a problem. The nearest place of interest, the train station, is a 15-minute walk. The hotel charges 25 Euro for breakfast (yikes!), and there's nothing within close reach. Well, for two of the mornings, we went to station and bough sandwiches for 2 Euro or less. There is a tour boat, but since it comes only every 40 minutes, it's not very practical (and really only serves as a slow leisurely tour). The best that I can say for the place is that it was clean. We got two thin hand towels and two thin bath towels--not even any washcloths! You have to leave your key in the room for the A/C or heat to work, so there was no way to avoid walking into a stuffy room every day. The wireless worked intermittently. Despite being outside the main part of town, it wasn't that quiet because the hotel is near train tracks against which the train wheels squeal as they come into the station. But our biggest nightmare was the service. Since our ship came in the morning, we had to leave our luggage in storage. Some dufus put my carry-on back on the ship, despite the name on our tags (which also had the earlier sailing date)! As horrible as that was, I'm not as upset by the stupid mistake as by the hotel employees' response to it. When I asked them to attempt to locate the bags by calling the ship, they told me they were forbidden by Dutch law to call the ship, and they only contacted port authorities who claimed they couldn't find the bag--a preposterous claim since the bag had my name and former cabin number on it. All the help I received came from the cruise line, whom I had to contact myself (they did locate the bag, of course--although it was on its way to Norway). The bag had my medication (and travelers' checks, reading glasses, and other stuff). Although none of them were controlled substances, the hotel said they couldn't replace it, claiming \"Dutch law\" prevented them from doing so, and only offered to have me waste a day going to a doctor and a pharmacy myself (I decided to suffer for the sake of my traveling companion). The management even refused to write a letter explaining the situation so that I could make a claim with my travel insurance company. All the manager could ever say was \"I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do,\" although I finally said at one point \"You could offer us breakfast on our last day,\" which he seemed taken aback by but did oblige. Even a week after we got back, the hotel refused to contact us to confirm they had sent the bag back. What information I received came from the cruise company, whose helpfulness was a sharp contrast to the hotel's. Would it have killed them to take 60 seconds to let us know by responding to my e-mail that they received the bag, and give us a tracking code? Without cooperation from the hotel, I wasn't even able to get refunds on my American Express travelers' checks--which came in three weeks after our return. If you click on my screen name, you'll see that I'm a very seasoned traveler with lots of reviews to my name, and I very rarely give a hotel 2 dots. I have Gold status with Hilton and Starwood, and Platinum with the Intercontinental Hotel Group.

It is a ten minute walk from Central station. ~~HINT: Buy Tram pass at Central Station. (There is a 24 hour option, punch card or week long option. Use it right away to get to hotel.) Take # 25 tram to \"Passenger Terminal\" from Central Station and you only have to walk about 1-2 minutes to hotel. ~~If you are trying to get into town, the 25 is your best bet. (26 is also option.)

I had to give the reception staff a copy of what the package included - fortunately I had printed this from the Movenpick website.

I wouldn't reccomend anyone try to walk to the hotel from the station with their bags - a shuttlebus is available (phone the concierge to arrange), and it is not as near as it looks! If you are going by Air, take the train from the airport to Centraal station, then a shuttlebus or tram 25 or 26 (stop at Bimhuis Musikegebaum or the cruiseship terminal next door) to get to the hotel - expensive airport transfers are a bit unneccessary if you have luggage you can manage.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cBad manners and unable to give a solution\u201d", "Author": "PedroSS_2008", "ReviewID": "UR19888326", "Content": "We had a very sad and disappointing experience in this hotel.

Of course, it is presumed a minimum of comfortability for the three people in the room, but it was a sad surprise when we arrived and the bed for two people was fine, as expected, nut not the third one. We already knew that the third person had to sleep in a sofa bed but we could not imagine that such \"bed\" was in fact a plank with a very thin mattress!! It was so surprising that I took pictures of it. We explained to the person in the front desk that it was really impossible to sleep there. The only reply (with very very bad manners) was that some people had complained about this issue before but this was not a major problem, according to this employee. We asked to talk to the managing director: he went with us to the room and he recognized that the sofa bed is not suitable to sleep. But the only solution given was either put another mattress of the same thickness (obviously it was not a solution), or to pay 80 euros for upgrading to a junior suite. Finally we had to be reallocated in another hotel, of lower category and far from the city center. We consider defrauded by Moevenpick, since this is not the service you expect of a 4-star hotel.

The combination of the modern design, the many amenities and the friendly staff make this a great hotel. Here's my breakdown: Check in: Was smooth and quick. They spoke excellent English which made it more comfortable for me. The card key is required to operate the elevator which puzzled me at first because I didn't know it required it. Some other guests I ran into also had the same difficulties. I guess it's for security reasons. Hotel: A relatively new hotel so expect it to be modern. Includes a bar, restaurant, gym, sauna and conference rooms. A business centre is available free of charge to guests on the main floor. The lobby has comfy couches, a flat screen displaying the news and a screen displaying train information from central station. A nice touch. Rooms: I can't say enough about these rooms. Again, you need the card key to turn on the electricity in the room. A great idea to prevent wasting electricity. The design of the room is a modern one. Rooms offer a safe, fridge, bottled water and all other amenities expected. Take a look at the photos on this site to get a better idea. The glass door to the bathroom does not fully close or lock (twin rooms). The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows. One neat thing they offer is a variety of different pillows that may better suit your needs. Call the guest services and you can receive a different pillow. View from the room was good too. A cruise ship docked next door and was quite nice to look at. Location: This is the only part about the hotel that did not exceed my expectations. Located on the harbour, about 10 - 15 mins walking from central station. The area surrounding it has close to no shops or restaurants within easy walking distance. The hotel has made available a shuttle service that runs every 30 mins to the central station that was very convenient for me and my family. Getting back depends on preference. People can arrange a pickup around the same time the shuttle makes the round to the station, or the can take the tram (#26). I took the tram each time to get back and it took 1.60 euros and 5 mins of my time. Taxi is a more costly option. A great alternative is to rent a bike. I think there is a rental spot in front of the hotel. Most (about half) of people in Amsterdam ride bikes because it is the most effective way to get around. Staff: The people who work there are true professionals in the hotel industry. They were always courteous and helpful when approached. Staff were top notch, especially those at the concierge. Conclusion:This is a great hotel for almost anyone. If you can get a good price then it is definitely worth it. During rainy days we looked forward to heading back to the hotel. The location is not great but there are many options available to get back and forth.

You can take tram 26 (right in front of Centraal Station) or tram 25 (across the street from the south east corner of Centraal Station).

They stop right in front of the hotel (1st stop after CS), but there is a canal in between so you have to make about a 2.5 minute walk around it to get to hotel entrance. I timed the walk from centraal station and it took 9 minutes at a brisk pace. For reference, the hotel is almost exactly the same distance from Centraal Station as Dam Square is. The walk was scenic but windy and cold at this time of year. The hotel staff are great and I was always treated with a friendly smile. I was given a standard room on the 8th floor. It had a great city view (facing west). It was very quiet, and I did not hear any noise from the other rooms, outside traffic, or cruise ships. The room itself was very clean and in good condition.

I could not get the WiFi or Ethernet internet to work, but did not follow up with this to the staff as I did not really care. TV had probably about 25 channels that came in with good reception.

We booked the hotel on Priceline about a month in advance, using [--] to give us an idea of what price we could get. At 85 Euros per night over a holiday weekend, we thought this was quite lucky...I saw the prices just before the weekend, and they were several times as much. The Moevenpick is easy to get to from Centraal Station. The easiest way is simply to walk. Head East from the station and follow the coast...the Moevenpick looks just like the picture on its website, and is very easy to spot once you hit the harbor. The second thing to do is to take the #25 (to PTA) or #26 (to IJBurg) tram and get off at the first stop. These trams run every 15 minutes apiece and stop in front of the hotel. However, since there is a canal in between the tram line and the hotel, you'll have to walk an awkward route for another 5 minutes to get there. The staff at the Moevenpick were very friendly. We arrived 2 hours before our 3 pm check-in and they gave us a room. The hotel is only 2 years old, so it has a very modern look with great furniture. The rooms were very clean and quiet. They were also larger than any 'standard' room I had stayed in while in Amsterdam. A few pluses and minuses: PLUSES --Location. Its away from the action, so its very quiet. As I'm no longer in my 20's and out for a raucous time, this was a plus. If you catch the tram as it pulls into Centraal Station, you're just minutes away from the hotel. --Elevators. Amazingly fast and efficient. A minor thing that was a nice touch. --Staff. Really seemed to go out of their way to be friendly. Alex and Mohammad, in particular, were a credit to Moevenpick. --Shuttle. They have a shuttle van that goes to Centraal every 30 minutes. If you're going there, you need to sign up, as they only have 8 spaces per trip. If you're getting picked up, there usually isn't a need to sign up. If you happen to be leaving the hotel at the top of the hour, its very convenient. --Non-smoking. The entire hotel was non-smoking, which we both personally liked. MINUSES --Location. Its away from the action, so its very quiet. As I was trying to pretend I was in my 20's again, this was a double-edged sword. --Phone assistance. I had to call the Front Desk a few times during my stay, and each time it took at least 15 rings for someone to answer. They need more dedicated staff. --No robes, and the towels were pretty flimsy. Invest in better towels, Moevenpick!

There was no place close by as an alternative to eating in the hotel restaurant, so the frig came in handy if you wanted to bring and keep your own water, juice and snacks. My room was on the 10th floor which gave me a wonderful view of the IJ. However, it is a bit away from the action of Amsterdam. The hotel provided a shuttle to Centrale Station every hour (depending on if they had enough gas for the van) or if there is enough space. I called to have the van pick me up and was told they had no gas. 20 minutes later while trying to hail a cab, the van driver waves at me from a stop light - and keeps heading back toward the hotel. It costs 8 Euro to cab from Centrale Station but tram line 26 will put you about 5 minutes walking away from the hotel for 1.60 Euro.

The look is well done but very spartan. You will stare at a big, unbroken blank wall from your bed. You may think that's cool, but it just looks like a blank wall to me. I would strongly recommend against booking the Club/exec rooms. We chose these because the price differential is small and the website virtual tour clearly implies you get a mini suite with separate living room. Not true! It is just a regular room. And also, it indicates that this tariff gives you free wireless. However, the whole hotel has free wireless. Bottom line, do not bother. Club rooms are also on a low floor (3rd) so you'll miss the lovely views. Pot luck whether you get a bath and a shower or just a shower. Silly curved glass desk which is not practical for work. Not really good enough TBH. The club lounge was OK but something of an afterthought. None of the \"freshly cooked snacks\" as promised. Now you can also take your breakfast in this club lounge if you wish, but all they will bring you is a pre-plated continental breakfast. If you want to go next door to the regular buffet, they try to charge you another 12,50e! One of the oddest things about this hotel, which I never saw anywhere else, is the complete lack of toilets. If you're in the bar (ground floor) and need the loo, you have to walk across the lobby, get in the lift, and go up to the 1st floor. If you're in the restaurant (3rd floor) and need the loo, you have to leave the restaurant, get in the lift, and go down to the 2nd floor. (You get the picture). Baffling really. Anyway, the hotel is essentially OK but no more. Service is very mixed. Orders were confused and in some cases forgotten in the Asian restaurant. Slow slow service in the bar. If you're coming to a conference, you will queue for a long time as the lunchtime buffet set-up is completely inadequate for the task.

At about 6.p.m I came down again to ask and room was ready but they forgot the room number to call me?!?.. Next day we wanted to take a boat trip, I took brochure at the hotel and found out there is a timetable until 4th November only - so went to concierge and asked if they have a new one or this is still valid and there is no change - concierge stared at me..this is not possible , checked it twice, went to back office and brought a pack of new actual brochures saying thank you for information sir...I thought OK but there were enough staff there they could notice - we have met lots of other people at the hotel dealing with same problem...Finally we wanted to go to Heineken brewery for a tour - we have double checked directions with concierge and went there - we were quite surprised the exhibition was closed more than 1 month ago until end May 2008 and they did not know about it at the hotel... Rooms were OK, nice view over city but it was quite cold even we set up a heating for maximum. All in all I was very dissapointed with this Moevenpick property and will definitely not stay here again - will choose one of the NH hotels in the centre - Krasnopolsky, City center or NH Schiller. I would not write this review if I would experienced at least an interest from staff and a short word of apology or any other signal they do care I am a guest at their hotel.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Orange NJ", "Title": "\u201cBeware of Low Prices\u201d", "Author": "MrsMaytag", "ReviewID": "UR11059061", "Content": "Booked our stay on Priceline ($105 per night) and as usual Priceline deceives by stating that this is in City Centre which it surely isn't.

The shower/tub is strange and I left after staying 5 days there without understanding how to use the shampoo dispenser. The beds are small and a king sized bed isnt a king sized bed.

I travel a lot to Europe -- so I do know this is a nice hotel with pretty spacious rooms compared to most hotels. The Movenpick is a chain of hotels owned by the Swiss and it reflects the Swiss charm nicely - very clean and sleek (think upscale IKEA). My problems included VERY spotty service from the staff (some where knowledgable, some had no clue -- including the concierges!) An example - on one day I asked about the tram and was immediatelty told that the shuttle didn't run except on the half hour and you needed a reservation. That seemed very odd to me -- that you would need a reservation for public transport. So I asked again, in a different manner (I thought perhaps a language barrier) and then was told \"OH -- you mean the TRAM. -- yes, it does run often\" -- he pointed out the tram station (about a block away) and off I went. So he had jumped to the conclusion that I wanted the hotel shuttle and gave me wrong info. Later that day a co-worker (I was there with a large convention) told me you could get a public transportation pass and/or a \"strip\" ticket -- so you could ride the tram often, and at a lower price. (Why hadn't the concierge offered that earlier?) So I went to go buy one and was told that no, they didn't sell them. Luckily, another staff member overheard us and countered that now they DID sell them. So I went to the front desk and bought one from him. Later that day, another co-worker had the same experience. Other problems - our towels had HOLES in them! The bed linens were never changed (and we were there for a week!) I complained 2x to no avail. One of the days I did not receive my wake up call. The next day I got THREE of them!! 2 of my coworkers had reservations -- (we had confirmations in writing, thank goodness) -- but they hotel had them on the wrong day (started a day late). They tried to tell me that it was full and nothing could be done -- but when I was firm -- they were able to find rooms (had to upgrade one co-worker -- and wanted to charge us -- but I refused). But my shy co-workers (these 3 were from the Czech Republic) would have taken this crap if I wasn't there to insist. Other things: the phone system was a bit hard to use (no instructions on the phone, the info in the binder was wrong). No easy way to call room service or get your messages. (My co workers phones were all different -- some were ok, some not -- again, very varied in the way things work!). The gym was nice but while they offered services (massage) -- I could not schedule one to save my life. The maids sometimes left new shampoo/soap and sometimes did not. (Why? Why the randomness??). Etc., etc. Anyway -- I hope the management reads this and the comment form I filled out (but I had the feeling it was being shredded the moment I turned it in... there wasn't a \"safe\" place to submit it that I could see...) and works out these kinks. On the positive side -- the food is delicious. Its not at city center (can be a plus) but easy to use tram 25 or 26, canal boats, or taxis (and the shuttle if you make a reservation). The conference crew was quite good (Simone and Peter made my life VERY easy during this week). It is clean and quiet.

To be honest it's a step up in class from the hotel I would normally stay at, mainly due to us getting a fantastic '3 nights for 2' deal via Expedia for booking 'early', though I only booked about 4 weeks in advance. The hotel itself I believe is fairly new, opened in Nov 2006 (?), so it's all very clean and fresh looking. The staff who greeted us at the front desk were polite, helpful and spoke very good English. The room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable. Although we had booked a room with a King-size bed we were informed when we booked in that this was now unavailable and 2 twin beds were all they could offer. Although the bathroom was clean and the shower worked well there was no lock on the glass (!) bathroom door, which I think is taking the traditional Dutch relaxed feel a little too far. That said we had no real complaints about the standard of the hotel, and despite being situated next to a busy port and what appeared to be a main road there was no noise at night. My only real grumble with the hotel is that it is situated about 15 mins walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station. To find the hotel, if you're coming by train, take a left out of the station until you reach the end of the large, grand station building. Take another left underneath a bridge then a right. You should be able to see the Moevenpick somewhere in the distance. While I dont mind a good walk it was a bit of a pain with the suitcases, and cost 10 Euro in a taxi to get to/from the city centre. Also I feel that for the price the Moevenpick charge there may be better and more central alternatives, such as the Victoria which is right outside Centraal station. Although to be fair there is a tram stop almost directly outside the hotel which I did not even attempt to use as it seemed impossible to buy tickets anywhere. All in all I would recommend the Moevenpick, but only if you are not put off by a bit of a walk, or if you are able to find a good deal on the internet. There are fantastic views on the port and the city if you get a room high enough and the rooms are comfy and clean.

The hotel offers large rooms with beautiful bathrooms and a splendid view of the harbour. In our experience, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful - room cleaning very efficient. There is no mini-bar (can be ordered), but there is a small refrigerator - very useful for stocking a few beers or sodas... The hotel also offers a buffet breakfast (at 15 Euro per person - evidently a summer special, normal price 21 E), which was worth every cent. Otherwise it's absolutely no problem getting a hearty breakfast (at practically any time!) in town. Travelers should be advised that the hotel is not exactly in the city centre, but rather a ten minute-walk from Central Station - which is really no problem if you're used to walking a bit, but elderly people might find it uncomfortable. On the other hand, there is a free shuttle service (from 7.30am - 11pm), but you have to book in advance. The 25 and 26 trams also run outside the hotel. It is a bit difficult actually seeing the entrance, but there was a lot of construction work going on, so probably some solution to this is planned. There is also a lack of just about everything in close vicinity, so you can forget about 'just stepping outside' to grab a morning coffee (or beer!). Taxi from Schipol will set you back about 50-60 Euro, but the train ride from the airport to Central Station is only 3,5E and takes 15 minutes, so if you have heavy luggage (and would prefer to spend your Euros elsewhere) it's probably best to take a cab from the station. All in all, the great standard of the hotel offsets its disadvantageous location - but only just. I would recommend the hotel to others, but might not be staying there when I return to Amsterdam - and I definitely will return. If you haven't been - go.

The hotel was chosen for me. After reading several reviews before my trip, I was worried about the distance of the hotel. It's not that bad. 10-15 min. to Centraal Station, or a couple of stops on the tram. It worked out well for me, since I was couped up in the hotel all day in a conference. A nice 15 min. walk to dinner was welcome. And walking to and from the train station was quite safe, even when I had to catch the 4am train to Schipol for an early flight. I do agree with some that it is inconvenient to get from the hotel entrance to the main road. Not sure if this is something that will ever be remedied. The hotel was clean and modern. Check-in staff was VERY nice and helpful. My luggage was 24 hours late in arriving. Both the front desk and concierge helped to keep me informed of the location of my bag, and provide me with any essentials I needed until it arrived. The hotel restaurant was delicious, and the bar was comfortable. I'm a big fan of the non-smoking policy in the hotel. My room was clean and in a great location. I recommend an upper floor room with even number room. This will give you a view of the waterway and city center. I found it quite relaxing to sit at the window and watch the water traffic. The cruise ship dock is right next to the hotel, and it was quite impressive to watch these large ships navigate the waterway. So why only 4 stars? A combination of several little things, and there is no option for 4.5 stars. House cleaning was spotty. Maybe they just do it late in the day, but one time they didn't stop by to clean my room until 7pm. I was already in for the night.

For this price I would like much better service. We arrived at the hotel at 6 p.m. not too late, not too early for check-in. The check-in was however ridiculous. We - a group of twelve - entered, nobody at the door said a hello or hi. In fact there was no doorman or boy, who would help with the luggages or parking the cars. The only entrance is a revolving door, it's really fast, and I had to watch out even without luggages not to get hit by it. In my opinion there is a great risk of accident at the door for old or disabled people or guests with huge and heavy luggages. At the reception we had to wait approximately 30 minutes to get our keys. There were three girls at the desks, two of them didn't seem to care of the guests at all. The third one was illeterate. She said, she couldn't make the check-in, because she couldn't spell the names because of the foreign characters. The following characters are in my colleague's name: A, B, C, J, L, S, Y, Z, all printed in Latin capital characters is his passport. I'm still curious which of those is \"foreign\" in the Netherlands. There were beautiful clean windows everywhere in Amsterdam, except my hotelroom. In M\u00c3\u00b6venpick windows has not been cleaned for at least half a year, or maybe since the hotel was built. It is a non-smoking hotel, and if you smoke a cigarette, you have to pay a penalty of 150 euros for \"cleaning\". However I don't think rooms are cleaned very often. My desk was dusty, and there were unidentifiable brown stains (faeces, puke, blood?) in my bathroom. The brochure promises free wireless internet in the rooms. But my laptop couldn't find any wireless network, and other guests also complained that there were no wireless internet in their rooms. We could only use cabel internet, for which guests have to pay. The most ridiculous is that the receptionist distrained 300 euros on the guests' credit cards for using the minibar. But minibars are totally EMPTY! There were no slippers, no bathrobe, and only one piece of tissue in the tissue-box in my bathroom. If guests ran out of instant coffee and cream, soap etc. on the first days of their stay, the staff would not give more automatically. So it's really advisable to pack everything you might need (tissue, soap, body milk, coffee whitener, sugar etc.) in your baggage. We attended a conference, and the lunch was served in the hotel. I like hot meals, but the Asian soup was so hot and spicy, that none of us could eat more than a spoonful of it. The \"main\" dish was some potatoes with cauliflowers, not really tasty. Only the dessert was edible. The breakfast costs approximately 20 euros, the food is average: eggs, bacon, cheese, muesli, cornflakes etc. The only \"speciality\" is that guests can't serve coffee and tea for themselves, they have to wait for the staff. Actually five or six waiters are standing around, watching, and walking all the time, but they do not want to serve anything. Once I had to ask the waiter five times to bring some coffee, before he finally served me. It is also very uncomfortable, that the elevator works only with the roomcards. It takes a while to learn how to use the cards. If you put them in the slot too early, or too late, the elevator won't work.

When you come out of the station take the exit Nord with a picture of a boat and look right you can not miss it is the very big building with Movenpick in red letters which are lighted up at night. It is very reassuring when you arrive at a strange city to be able to get to your hotel so easily. It is only a 10 minute walk and not 20 as some have suggested. The walk will do you good and it is not far. A small tip as you approach the hotel there is a bridge go over it do not attempt to stay by the river bank as you will have to walk up a flight of stairs at the end. The entrance is very clear as you come over the bridge there are three giant flag poles with massive banners with Movenpick on them how people said they could not see it is beyond me..

Another way to walk is to stay on ground level and go under the bridge you get to a parking lot, and go straight, where there are small offices, very picturesque.

This hotel has lots of issues. We stayed from the 27th January for three nights. The hotel is about a 5 min drive from the train station (take a train from Schiphol not a taxi as it is only 4 euros each and the trains leave from the airport every 15 mins). The hotel is 20 mins from the centre, the walk is fine and that was not a problem. It was the access that was the problem. There are no clear walkways and you have to walk under dark, un-lit bridges at night to get back to the hotel. It is really frustrating as you can see the main entrance from the bridge but you then have to walk for another 5-7 mins to the end of the bridge and the walk back in the opposite direction (there is no walkway or staircase available). Taxis are way over priced and best to avoid or agree a price before you set off. Hotel staff are not really friendly (bar staff are very nice though) and we only encountered one smiling face on check in and that was the guest standing next to us!! The concierge are non existent. We had to drag luggage to our room only to find we were not given the right type of room, then to come back down again with luggage in hand. Rooms are clean and adequate BUT be aware if you book a king bedroom, you get a kingsize bed with two small single duvets. They do not provide one king duvet. This meant cold feet all night and this \"style\" is totally couple unfriendly. You might as well book a twin bed and sleep separately. I asked for a king duvet and the guest relations just said \"well this is our style\". I said well we are both cold and with a king bed you would expect an adequate sized duvet and all she said was well \"you can turn the room temperature up\". Apparently this is a normal procedure for a Dutch hotel. I can't honestly believe it and I think the world has gone mad if they really think that a couple can sleep adequately together in a king bed with a single duvet per person. I think the hotel is totally over-rated and would only be suitable for business travelers traveling alone who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need to leave the hotel during their stay. We will highly recommend using the trams and buy an \"I amsterdam\" discount card from tourist information as it gives you free entry to loads of attractions, free bus and tram travel and also discounts on other attractions and restaurants.

Location: To start with, it is NOT AT ALL in the center. It takes 20 minutes to walk to the center or a pricey $40 cab ride both ways. It isnot a convenient location at all and the walk from the hotel is pretty sketchy. The most bothersome of the whole experience was probably the location. I truly felt that it was false advertisement. It was so far from the center that we feel that we didn't do things we would have otherwise done if the hotel was REALLY in the center. I fell that it truly tarnished our vacation. We REALLY wanted to be in the middle of the action and were far from it. The staff was inefficient, unfriendly and SO slow. My first impression was already bad. We arrived at the front desk, there was 3 persons working with one costumer so there was no line. It took 15 minutes for us to be addressed! At no point were we welcomed, told about how long it would take, or to take a seat for a while we wait.The type of things you expect in a 4 star establishment. We were not even acknowledged. When we check-out at the front desk, my husband rested his foot to tie his shoe on the little shelves meant to rest your computer bag on and a manager got off his cell phone to reprimand him on this act. Again, this is not very 4 star attitude. My husband was dressed in a suit with spotless shoes and this reprimand was quite unnecessary. Cleanliness: the room had not been not really cleaned after our first day there -although the beds were made- and the second day, no one came to clean. It'sclearly unacceptable in a 4 star establishment. Elevators: Only 4 elevators for a 20 story, 408 rooms! They are supposed to hold 13 person but even with 10 thin looking individual it was uncomfortably tight, so imagine what it's like with bigger people and suitcase. Everybody was complaining about how slow they are and often time, when they stopped they were full. Also, for some reason the elevators would not stop by our floor. We would press the button and we would see the elevators passing us up and down without stopping. One time we waited 15 minutes for one. Another time, the elevators were not working after we arrived from long day of walking around the city. We were exhausted but since tons of people were waiting in the hallway we decided to climb the stairs to the 10th floor only to find out that you couldn't! Some staff members told/showed us that at each staircase you need a special key to get to the next fly of stairs.I am not sure how that will work if there is a fire or during a blackout. Concierge: very unhelpful, every time we had a question it felt like we were bothering them and our questions were left unanswered. City tax: at the end of our stay the hotel charged us with a city tax of about $20 which I don't feel we should be accountable for. I have never heard of that before and usually when I use the reservation system I use, everything is included and if I don't use hotel services, I shouldn't have anything more to pay, I have never had until then. Amsterdam and I would NOT recommend it to other costumers. I await more from a 4 star hotel and to me this hotel is not up to the standards I have been accustomed to.

Upon opening the windows, the sound of the trains is constant because of the proximity to Central Station. On our third night at the hotel, a band was playing outside so loudly that we were not able to sleep until after 1 AM. After calling the front desk in the afternoon to have my room cleaned, the room was never cleaned. The staff did bring clean linens after I complained to the front desk. It is about a 20 minute walk to Central Station. Central Station has some restaurants and a grocery store.

However, thus far (1 night into my 3 night stay) I am really rather impressed. Leaving Central Station, you have the choice of trams 25 (inconveniently located stop at CS) or 26 or a walk along a somewhat industrial waterside road to get to the hotel's stop, beside a large music building. Ongoing construction in the road outside the hotel makes direct access inconvenient: crossing the footbridge to the music building then walking down the steps and along is the most direct route, although some might find the many steps up to the bridge for the return trip somewhat arduous. This hurdle overcome, I was pleasantly surprised upon entering the lobby. Calm, clean and light sums up the area, which was well staffed by (admittedly young) well turned out staff. I was checked in by a girl who was being trained by colleague: she did a fine job and I was directed to the elevator after being given a summary of the property. Having requested a high, quiet, room I was directed to the 11th floor; my room enjoys sideways views of both the water and the city. Looking across to a deserted evening building in the evening, I was able to leave my curtains open to enjoy the night lights across the area. The room is well designed with enough space (though it's not roomy by US standards, certainly) to move about. I understand the sofa can convert into a single bed: it'd have to be a very small person who slept on it comfortably, though! A glass desk fairly well lit by a lamp (with a worryingly flimsy plastic switch) gives ample space for your laptop and is connected to a unit with kettle, tea/coffe-making items. The A/C worked well and was unobtrusive and each bedside table has a power outlet in case you have lot of phones, etc. to charge. The room has been designed to maximize floor space - it is very uncluttered, which provides plenty of room for those travelling with large amounts of luggage. The bathroom has a very spacious shower (no bath/tub) and a good-sized basin with a small selection of nice-smelling toiletries. The glass door is opaque for privacy and the sound from the TV is piped through so you don't have to miss a second if nature calls in the middle of a show. Adequate storage space contained self-setting PIN-operated safe and a small refrigerator containing a complimentary bottle of mineral water - a nice touch, I felt. A small glitch with WiFi was explained by the helpful reception clerk: apparently, the hotel's system currently allows only 50 rooms access to the WiFi network at any one time - clearly inadequate, and frustrating if you happen to be the 51st person trying to access his/her email. I was informed that the system is due to be upgraded this week to one which will be capable of allowing all rooms simultaneous access if they so desire. To sum up, I am enjoying my stay here - while certainly it lacks the convenience of the downtown hotels, you do have a wonderful feeling of space and a short, efficient tram ride takes you to/from the action of the city centre in 5 minutes.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cVery nice place, certain drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "je135", "ReviewID": "UR6002498", "Content": "Two college students studying abroad stayed here for a weekend 10/19-23.

Free Wireless internet was nice but it kept working, then not working, then working again, then not working again, which got a little frustrating. Almost every time, we walked to Centraal Station and then up towards the rest of the city because Movenpick does not have a prime location to the city centre.

I felt compelled to post a reivew this time. I'll start with the positive points: The room and bathroom were lovely. We had a great view over the city and harbour. Pillows etc were really comfy. Interior was great and it was very clean. Now the rest: Most of the staff, with the exception of a few, that we encountered were rude, could not understand simple questions or requests and simply had no idea what was going on. Both my friend and I agreed that there was bit of an attitude problem going on. This was surprising to me because at any other hotel I've stayed at in Amsterdam over the last 9 years, from the 1* to the 5* I've never had those issues. For example.. We found that most (not all) the day time reception staff pleasant however the night time staff were a different story. They were unhelpful, not bothered and rude. An example: Simple questions like 'Do you have internet here?' or 'Do you know of / can find me a mechanic?' proved too difficult or too much of an effort to understand and answer. One member of staff thought our questions were beyond the service the hotel provides. We had only asked him about where we could find a mechanic and NOT asked him to fix the car. When asking if they had internet, she replied 'NO'. I asked 'do you have a business centre'? she replied 'NO'. I said well do you know any internet cafe's near by she said 'NO'. I assume the reason for her unhelpful abrupt answers because I may have interupted her having a happy chat with the colleague even though I had waited for her to finish. We had 3 people staying in our room. 2 people for 2 nights and 3 people for 3 nights. On the last night with the 3rd person We were given 2 towels and no extra bed linen for the sofa bed. Fair enough but then when we called reception to ask them on late saturday night to bring extra bed linen and a towel up - they didn't! I ordered a taxi - The concierge told me to come down as it was there. It was not there. I asked and was told 5 mins. I waited for 20 mins, asked again but then no one knew, until thinking it'd be quicker to walk or take the tram rather than wait for the hotel to do anything for me. On check out I asked the receptionist to put a certain amount on my credit card and the difference on my friend's card. I explained this to her three times. She then charged my card for the full amount. When I mentioned her mistake, she said, rather annoyed, that 'I had told her to do that'. I looked at my friends rather puzzled as we had explained three times. She corrected it. I think it would be a better hotel once fully done and certain staff members get lessons in communication and interpersonal skills. I wouldn't stay here again. I prefer a hotel thats more centrally located so I can walk to most places in 5 - 10 mins as opposed to 20 - 35 mins but on that note it is our fault for choosing this hotel and interpreting 'walking distance' as meaning 5 - 10 mins.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ayrshire", "Title": "\u201cNewly opened, a lot to improve\u201d", "Author": "prisoner1", "ReviewID": "UR5949028", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel on business.
