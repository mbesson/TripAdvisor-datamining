Each time it has been fantastic! I was originally booked elsewhere and when that turned out to be less than expected I immediately switched to Hostal Persal. The location is in the center of everything, 2 minute walk south from Puerta del Sol, 5 minute walk from Plaza Mayor, San Miguel Mercado, and Cava Baja (great tapas street), and 10-15 minute walk from Retiro Park. The room was great! All bathroom necessities were provided. Bed was more than adequate and most important the room has AIR CONDITIONING, which was very necessary this summer as it was 105 degrees when I was there. Wifi works in the rooms for free and everything was very clean. We requested a balcony room and got it with no extra charge. The view of Plaza Angel was beautiful. Felix at the front desk is very helpful and nice. Breakfast is included and simple, just toast, cereal, and yogurt. But just the free coffee and tea was great as I would have gone and paid a couple euro elsewhere for it in the mornings.

Check-in was quick and easy and we were shown up to our room. The room was clean and functional, with everything we needed for our stay, including a good hairdryer. Our room was on the third floor at the front and we had a small balcony, just big enough for the two of us to stand on - I would definitely recommend a room at the front. The room was not noisy, even though there were pavement cafes below as, if you wanted to, you could close the shutters and the outer and inner doors. The room was air conditioned so was always cool. Breakfast was included and taken in a very pleasant room with large communal or small tables. It was simple, but filling, with a selection of cereals, ham, cheese, pastries etc. The breakfast waiter was always friendly and chatty and kept the buffet well filled. As has been said previously, the timings of 7.30am to 11am fit well with the Madrid late nights! Our flight was not until the evening of the final day of our stay, and we were able to store our luggage in a secure room to collect later in the day.

I found it originally from a recommendation in Frommers Madrid book. I was a little aprehensive after reading the reviews here, but decided based on the price and location to stay in HP. I was going to stay at the Marriott AC Carlson until the last minute, I canceled that reservation and kept the one for Hostal Persal. Best decision I ever made! Hostal Persal is so close to so many interesting things. We walked every where. There are a \"thousand\" restaurants - mostly small with little bars and a lot of character -- in the surrounding alley like streets. Plus Plaza de Santa Ana is about 50 yards away and it has more restaurants. Plaza del Sol is a 5 minute walk. We took the Metro from the Airport to Plaza del Sol and dragged our luggage to the hotel and it was no problem. As for the hotel...Lobby is nice. Staff is very friendly as is almost everyone we met in the service industry in Madrid. Rooms: small but clean. Bathroooms: Small but not too small and perfectly clean and they look on the newer side. Soft towels and super hard water pressure in the shower. We never had any problem sleeping due to noise, but we live close to the freeway in Metro DC so it might be quieter in this hotel than home. We had a room that faced the Plaza and it was great to be able to open the balcony doors and look out onto the Plaza and see people walking around and the view is nice at night. We felt very safe there and were out a few times til 2am. Not much closet or drawer space but enough if you wont be there forever. plenty of room under the beds to store whatever. Wi-Fi was good, not great, but we definitely stayed connected with a laptop, an iPad, and an iPhone online at the same time. Made some audio onlySkype calls that dropped eventually. iPhone Facetime was not smooth, but audio part was fine. There is a little grocery/fruit stand next door that we went to constantly for water, Coke, fruit, and snacks...all priced reasonably. Got bananas and strawberries that were better than any strawberries I have seen in a US supermarket. And for trips out of Madrid, if you want to go to Toledo, the Atocha Train station is about a 15 minute walk away. While it doesnt have the ammenties of a cruise ship, if you can stay in a cruise ship room, you will be more than fine in a room in this hostal. We had a double bed and a single bed for the three of us. The only drawback for me was that the double bed was not real comfortable and was a little bit tight for the two of us on it. But the price was the best for a room accomodating three people I could find in Old Madrid. In the past two years I have stayed in hotels that were alot more expensive in Paris, Venice, and Barcelona, and this was better or equal to any of those. Even though we spent a night in the Westin Palace (5 star) and another night by the Airport in Hotel Axor Barajas (4 star), we were very happy with our stay in Hostal Persal. I will say we only spent time in our room to sleep and shower. If you are in to the whole \"hotel experience\" you might not like this. But if you need a great base of operation for being out and about in Madrid...this is an excellent choice. Even when we went to Westin Palace we still just slept there. We checked in and immediately spent the rest of the day and evening out in Madrid...so that was a lot to pay for a bed and shower.

Noisey when the bars let out with drunks kicking cans down the streets and drug deals going down right out the front door. The rooms were clean, comfortable and quite adequate. The front desk and breakfast staff were pleasant and eager to help. Our room was kept very tidy and well stocked. There were 4 of us in the room and the 4 twin beds fit us fine. We had to keep our luggage on the floor and the only place to sit was the bed. We did have one cafe table but no chairs. Still, 4 twins was important to us and they were supplied perfectly. The room did not smell of smoke (this can be rare in Spain) Sometimes it will come floating through from other places but not in the room. We were in the front of the hotel and it was noisey for about one hour around 3:00am when the bars close and the trash truck collects the garbage placed right in front of the hotel from all the business in the vacinity. The local streets generally have little car traffic. The hotel was convenient to Plaza del Sol and Plaza Mayor as well as an easy walk to local attractions (though not super-close) But, remember, this is a walking city, so \"close-by\" has a different meaning depending where you come from and how you live. Despite the \"deals going down outside..it still felt safe to walk around. There are pick pockets around, so keep your valuables safely stored. There are lots of peop;e walking around the streets and the safety we felt was from the numbers of people out and about and the vibrancy of this neighborhood. The hotel is next door to a cute little late-night grocery and many other retail spots. NOW the BEST PART...for a continental breakfast...the food was delicious, the coffe perfect and the nicest \"morning\" staff. Lots of yummy sweets and breads, cheeses, cereals, yogurt and fruits.

Mostly, you live out of your suitcase. So, if you want a luxious room in Madrid, pass this by. We spent $800 and change for the week which included a nice continental breakfast in the near absolute center of the city, walking everywhere so it suited us perfectly. Some of the reviewers mentioned noise. The Persal is located on the Plaza del Angel. Madrid is a nocturnal city, even more than we expected. We fronted on the Plaza, Room 118. Admittedly there was noise from those going home at 2 or 3 in the morning. One night there was a special event in the Persal and we were serenaded by the departing guests. (That night even the noise in the lobby was loud.) We are active \"young\" seniors. If the noise bothers you, you can buy a set of earplugs at the pharmacy up the street. Or, you can stay in one of the rooms off the front of the hotel. If you want the pulse and feeling of a great city I suggest you tough it out. There is dining outside in the Plaza and one night it was filled with various music acts. In sum, did we use the earplugs? Sometimes, yes. But most of the time we just reveled in the sounds of living. If you don't feel like walking then you can catch a cab at the end of the block. There is very limited vehicle access in the Plaza. It is a short walk from the Persal to a number of Metro stations. We took the shuttle bus in from Barajas airport to Atocha Station, a great bargain, and hopped the subway and were pointed in the right direction when we reached our stop on the Metro. In the evening we shopped at a local grocery for some excellent and inexpensive wine and the staff at Persal graciously provided nice wine glasses for our purchases. Our happy hour was cheap, flavorful and a delight. If anyone reading this has ever stayed at Sully St. Germain in Paris, the Persal is very similar. As I said then and say now, we don't go traveling for luxourious accommodations. We want value, cleanliness and convenince and Persal provided them all for us. I would stay there again.

We had stopped in Madrid on our way south in a 4+ star hotel which was a great disappointment. We were determined not to stay there on our way back, but had some misgivings after we had booked Hostal Persal (although we had seen it on our way south). Persal is exactly what it claims to be, viz a budget hotel that tries to maintain standards. Luxurious it is not, but the rooms although basic are very adequately furnished and the bathroom was spotlessly clean with good quality towels (we found the latter were an exception rather than the rule in Spain including in 5 star hotels). The breakfast was very adequate and the staff replenished the buffet table and cleared the tables very promptly. The staff were very pleasant with one exception.

The staff is very knowledgable about what goes on in the area and speak English. The rooms are somewhat small and dark though but as you are surely not spending too much time here it should not be too much of an issue. Said rooms are equipped with direct dial telephones and a TV's with a selection of channels in European and English. A laundry facility is available but not same-day over weekends. An internet desk is available. Breakfast is ALWAYS the same every day - orange or pineapple juice with a selection of coffees, some danish pastries, sliced cheese and ham and small hard rolls. While not the typical breakfasts used to when coming from my neck of the woods, I surely never went hungry. The location is in fact perfect and close enough to the main attractions, but you don't need to even walk that far to find a cafe or pub. Just to the left of the hostel is a pub in which there are regular live performers making music and the cafe's spill out onto the square right in front of the hostel. Just down the road and turn left into the main road and another big square (in front of Sol underground) and you're near the Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol. Other fantastic sights include the Sabatini Gardens and Retiro Park which are a little further away. A one-way taxi ride to the airport set me back around EUR35.00.

This \"hostal \" is a gem. Situated close to Sol on a fairly quiet pedestrian street. (Took earplugs but did not need them) due to the excellent double glazing. We had room 413, a twin bedded room with balcony, great for people watching. The beds were firm and the bed linen fresh and super clean. In fact what struck me most was the cleanliness of the whole place. Although the sleeping area was compact the total floor space with hall and bathroom was quite large. A room safe was provided free of charge and TV news channel in English. Breakfast was included in the price approx 235 euros for 3 nights. Cereal, fruit salad, bread, cheese, ham and pastries. Again super clean, the cutlery positively gleamed. Some reviewers mention the lift. Yes, it is small, but in my opinion quite charming. Enough room for two people with a small amount of luggage. If you are on the 4th flr there are some stairs as well, so perhaps not suited to the less mobile. The hotel has a restaurant to the side and a small bar. Neither of which we frequented, but the restaurant seemed quite busy and the prices reasonable. Directly outside are cafes and to the right of them the Plaza St. Ana, with more cafes. Don't miss the covered market San Miguel off the Plaza Mayor. Take some tapas and wine, perch on the stools and breath in the atmosphere. Make time to visit Toledo, 30 mins by train from Atocha railway station. There are tour buses waiting to meet you. A 2hr tour with guide and entrance to the Cathederal cost 20 euros pp. The Cathederal is beautiful.

After reading the reviews here, I was a bit afraid about what I shall find. But I was very satisfied with the hotel. After I had booked online and got confirmation, I emailed the hotel to ask for a room on the 4th floor with balcony. I didn't want to spend a whole week looking inside a courtyard. They provided me exactly with the type of room I wished. This is a two star hotel and therefore I was not expecting anything fancy. It was clean (bed and bathroom), although I admit that the floor in the room could have been swept a couple of more times during my stay. I had booked a double room (I was on my own) so space was not an issue for me. The room had a newish wooden floor, and the walls were in good shape, maybe they had been refreshed not too long ago. No (old) cigarette smell which is important for me. The beds were fine for me (I am not especially tall neither oversized). The walls might be a bit thin, but this considered, I found the hotel quiet (no slamming doors at odd hours, no loud people coming and going, etc). The balcony door had a double glass, so I was not either annoyed by the noise from Plaza del Angel, but of course it could get a bit animated. The breakfast did the trick for me, and it was always something to eat although I went 15 minutes before it was over. Free internet in the lobby. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and all the younger people were speaking good English. Only one older man had troubles in English, but they were always two people at the desk, so I didn't have any problems to have my questions answered. The location of Hostal Persal is perfect. You have Cafe Central, Populart, Casa Patas around the corner. And the one cinema with the newest movie in original version is 3 blocks away. 10-15 minutes walk from Prado and Retiro. And many more sights and wonderful art museums within walking distance. I didn't use any metro or taxi during all my stay. The hotel has a very nice restaurant just besides it (Ginger), and I ended up having my dinners there, since they had a very nice choice of dishes (meat, fish, pasta, salads), good and fast service, and really decent prices. All in all I would recommend Hostel Persal for people who are easy going and who want something practical, nicely located and not a budget killer.

The en-suite bathroom was tiny but clean, there didn't seem to be a lack of hot water at any time, and a few basic toiletries were supplied (which I hadn't expected). The entrance is on the ground floor and reception is staffed 24/7. Many budget hotels/ hostals in the area are located on the upper floors of buildings, so you can't see the reception area before you enter and you have to ring a bell to be let in. The staff were friendly and very helpful - I don't know how well they speak English though, because I was able to speak Spanish with them. The buffet breakfast was excellent value - there was juice, tea, coffee, a choice of cereals, white and wholemeal bread rolls, ham, cheese, toast, a selection of jams, pastries and croissants.

The room was spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom. These are the two most important factors for me. The TV worked fine, though the only English channel was CNN (to be expected). I had a single room, which had a nice full-sized bed. The only negative was that the walls seemed quite thin. I could hear the Italian couple in the room next to me fighting... and I could also hear their TV at times (though again, this could have been them talking/fighting.. difficult to say!)

In any case, if you're starved for your usual muffin and enormous latte, you can find a Starbucks within 10 min. walk, just next to the Sevilla metro stop. I'd recommend Hostal Persal if you need a clean, budget hotel for a couple of nights in Madrid, and like to be able to walk to alot of the main sights.

GREAT location. Sol is one main plaza in Madrid; Plaza Mayor is the other. This hotel is one block down from Sol where the Metro stop is, and just a few blocks from Mayor. Entire city is walkable - we only took the metro from the train station with our bags, and even then it was only 4 stops. Definitely the place to stay if you're on a budget in Madrid, but want something more live-able than your typical European hotel.

They where bigger, the bathroom clean and roomy (compared to mine) I am not into writing reviews, but I hope this review helps someone.

HOSTAL BIANCO - the building entrance was under construction and quite unappealing. The rooms were very noisy (we had asked for a quiet room) the walls were paper thin, which was surprising since we chose older buildings for the ambiance. The staff was nice and helpful and although quite thin the linens were clean. WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN EVEN THOUGH THE LOCATION WAS GREAT. We left town for a couple of days and then returned to Madrid to a different hotel, again looking for ambiance. So we chose the HOSTAL PERSAL which touted an underground lounge. The common areas (lobby/entrance, etc.) were appealing but the rooms are still in need of upgrading (the doors are very flimsy) and the bathrooms are quite worn looking. Also the floors had several areas that were soft, as though it could actually fall in. The most disappointing thing about this hotel was that the initial reviews and photos showed the downstairs bar/lounge area in use and were lead to believe that this underground room would be open for either bar drinks or breakfast, which was the reason for choosing this hotel. Regretfully, this room was closed off to the public. The location however, was ideal, although at the time of our visit the Plaza in front of the hotel was under construction, which was not the fault of the hotel.
