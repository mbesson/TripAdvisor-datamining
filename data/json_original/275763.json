Staff unfailingly courteous and helpful; breakfast buffet fine but make sure you ask them to make you fresh coffee rather than using the self-service machine, which is only one notch above what you can get in Kwik-Fit waiting for your tyre to be changed. Room was small but very clean and all that we needed for a weekend where we were going to spend most of the time out of it.

Having travelled all day to get there, we were told that we were being moved to another hotel, because they had been \"obliged\" to give 12 customers their room back when the airline cancelled their flight. Now..... Thats complete and utter B.S. and we knew it, and the idiot on the desk knew that we knew it, but what could we do?? We were reassured that we were going just 5 minutes away to another hotel within the LO.AN group and was also 4 star. Well - 45 minutes later when we arrived at \"Hotel Flemming\" (a whole other review in itself!) it was most certainly NOT 4*. 2* would be being kind. We were reassured by our Donna Laura staff that we would have a taxi back the next day as soon as we wanted to return. This was, yet another, lie. The next day we were told we would have to wait 30 minutes for a minibus to take us over to the hotel. We kindly suggested they do as promised and get us a (paid for) taxi (when I say kindly suggested - I'm being \"polite\" - as were already a little upset at the way we'd been treated) and eventually a taxi was arranged. When we got there - the little bell boy was all excited - telling us that his football team had come to stay at the hotel last night! Interesting........ 12 rooms \"given up\" to the imaginary travellers who's flight were cancelled, and conveniently - a football team comes to stay!!!! Throughout our whole stay the staff on the desk were ignorant and rude and very clearly did not want us staying there. \"It's a local hotel - for local people\" (apologies to those who have not seen league of gentlemen!). They did the bare minimum they had to do to \"help\" us with any requests (ie a taxi) but no more then they had to do and NEVER a smile! The rooms were average for a 3* hotel, small but reasonably comfortable. Once you have your bearings it's just a 15-20 min walk into Rome centre and the sights. There are plenty of reasonable restaurants in walking or short taxi distance - all of which are \"off the beaten track\" and better than the \"tourist\" places. Anyway- was pleased to leave the hell-hole and won't be returning.

We turned up at midnight to be told our room had been double booked and that we were being sent to another hotel. Having being forewarned by other Trip Advisors that this is a scam to ship you out to a worse hotel for the whole duration of the holiday we refused point blank to go. After getting no where with the receptionist we then climbed into our pyjamas and slept in reception hoping to shame them into giving us a room. We were eventually offered a glass of water and the lights were dimmed when they realised they had met with an impasse. The next day after being shown to an uncleaned room as the cleaners weren't in yet we showered unpackied and had breakfast. We then set the safe up to store our valuables. We both checked the safe was locked before we went out. When we returned in the evening my friend noticed 50 euros had been taken. Whoever took it had hoped a single note wouldn't have been noticed but my friend divides her money by the days she was stopping so realised straightaway. We went to reception who said they had never had anything like this happen before and they sent someone upstairs to check the safe. The safe now wasn't accepting our code which it was previously and the hotel staff member said we mustn't have set it incorrectly like that was a viable excuse for money to be taken. Later when we went to reception and spoke to the another receptionist about going to the police station he knew nothing about the incident. If this was the first time it had ever happened I would have thought it would have been the talk of the hotel but they appeared to be pretty nonchalant about it. There was no tea making facilities in the room but when you asked for a drink either in the bar/restroom or room service you were told there was no one available. The hotel is not central you have to walk 10 minutes to a metro station to get to anywhere. A lovely trip spoilt. Don't think it is a one off and book.

On my first evening I made the mistake of eating in the hotel (mainly because I had been awake since 3.30 in the morning to catch an early flight and then been working all day in the office and I couldn't see any signs of nearby restaurants). The menu was limited and very expensive (over \u20ac50 for a steak, 2 side dishes (veg & potatoes), a glass of fruit juice and a pudding). When the food arrived it was edible but definitely not up to the usual standards of Italian food. Bed was made up with only a sheet so, as it was a bit chilly I used the blanket from the cupboard. Unfortunately the blanket was very dirty (covered in other peoples' hair etc so obviously hadn't been washed recently) which really put me off but I did use it anyway. However, as the night went on I found I was too hot so opened the window but the traffic noise was horrendous. In fact, even the noise from other rooms (loud TVs etc) was clearly audible. Therefore, this, combined with a very hard and uncomfortable bed, meant I didn't get a lot of sleep. Breakfast was also a disappointment. Common problems were: - Having to sit at a table which had not been cleared after the previous guest had used it. - No milk to have with cereals - Limited fresh fruit (grapes only) - Burnt pastries - No fresh fruit juice (what tasted like cordial could be obtained from a machine) These are things which I suppose you could put up with if the price was lower. However, I would not stay in this hotel again. In fact, I am due to be working in Rome for the next 3 weeks and have changed to an alternative.

They informed us that some of there previous travelers had missed there flight and returned to the hotel around 1pm. He then told me that they have no choice but to accept those travelers back and he had to give our room to them. After this explaination he stated that our only option was to be moved to another hotel. We did not have a choice in this matter, as the second hotel was picked for us. The staff led us to believe that the hotel was close to the Donna Laura, that it was nice, and that we could come back to the Donna Laura the next day. After arriving at the second hotel, we soon realized that we had a problem. Not only was the hotel of a lower standard than the Donna Laura it was no where close to any places of interest.

Because we had several planned tours at very early hours we did not have the freedom to take the bus and spent hundreds of dollars in taxi fees during our stay. After our first night at the second hotel we called the Hotel Donna Laura back to arrange moving back to their hotel as they had promised. However, they told us that they still did not have our room avaliable and would not be able to move us. We explained that we had trouble getting to our tours that we had already paid for prior to our visit and asked if they could at least move us to another one of their sister hotels that is closer to the city. They told us that they would not do that. In fact one of the staff said, \"That is not our problem.\" They never ended up accomadating us and we were stuck at the second hotel for the entire trip. This really took a toll on us both financially and emotionally. Everyday we were stressed to make it on time to our tours and had a hard time relaxing. We lost a lot of sleep due to all the extra needed travel time. In summary, I read other reviews on this hotel that were very similar to this, but thought that 1. This wouldn't happen to me or 2. The person writing the review was \"crazy\". I hope that by writing this review at least one person will be turned away from this hotel and will be able to have a risk free trip to Rome.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE, TRAVELER BEWARE\u201d", "Author": "jamies33", "ReviewID": "UR65113614", "Content": "Hotel staff gave away our reservation to a previous traveler who had missed their flight then the moved to a \"sister\" hotel that was not near a metro station, which forced us to use taxis, which was an unexpected expense.

I really can not understand the difficulties people had with this hotel. I did a really stupid thing, so I thought. I picked this hotel purely on the photos I saw whilst browsing through my holiday provider. I didn't read any reviews until the night before I flew and thought that I had made the biggest mistake of my life. As this was a special occasion for myself and my partner; I didn't want a run of the mill hotel- but not being a millionaire I couldn't afford something top of the range either. The Donna Laura Palace looked nice. A bit better than nice- so after reading the reviews on this site- my heart sunk. However, after finding the hotel- which I believe is perfectly placed if you don't mind walking for more than five minutes- I couldn't have been more welcomed and looked after anywhere else. The receptionist (called Danilo) was amazing and he couldn't do enough for us- and nothing was too much trouble. The guy at the bar and the waiter who served us our evening meal (even though it was exceptionally late) were so lovely, I knew that the reviews on this site couldn't be right. Ok, I will concur that the evening meal was not wonderful and it wasn't the best that I had in Rome- but it wasn't that bad either. Perfectly edible and about the right price for a hotel. The Donna Laura Palace Hotel is situated approximately 10 mins from Lepanto Metro- as long as you know where you are going. You can walk to Piazza del Popolo in around 15 mins and it took me the grand total of 35 mins to get to the Colosseum. It's miles away from everything- isn't it?! The Vatican museums are around 20 mins away and you are surrounded by Alimentari (grocery shops), gellateria (ice-cream shops), restaurants, trattorias and on the Cola de Rienzo you have boutiques, electrical shops and general high street stuff! Amazing- if that's what you came to Rome for. I have to admit that I spent quite a lot of my time in Rome walking from one place to another- but if I had really wanted to, I could have tripped about 5-10mins down the road and bought my metro ticket and got to wherever I wanted in about 5mins as the metro seems to run every minute. I even took my luggage on the metro. It really wasn't a problem. Yes, the Donna Laura is on a main road- but it is set back and has a lovely little courtyard at the front surrounded by trees (and it has a pomegranate tree in the centre!). And no the taxi's won't pull up outside the door- but I suppose it must be a real struggle to get the luggage all 20 metres from the road to the door. But I knew all of this, I checked to see where it was on google maps before I went. I did this because I wanted to make sure that I wasn't too far out of central Rome- and this hotel is far from that. All the staff were friendly and spoke English (and even humoured me when I tried to speak very poor Italian!), the room was clean, comfortable, big and well decorated and the check in and out procedure was fast and efficient. I was so impressed with this hotel that I will return. No question. I don't think I would ever stay anywhere else in Rome, even if I was loaded. I even told them so on the way out.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby", "Title": "\u201cPoor service -\u201d", "Author": "easytrekker", "ReviewID": "UR45716675", "Content": "We finally arrived at the hotel after a long train journey from Florence.

The fact was that they were refused admission even to see the views or sit and relax. On the last day they tried to get up there again and were told that it was not open. They then asked for somewhere to sit and relax preffereably in the sun but they were told that the hotel had nowhere to do this at all.

For the price that I paid for the hotel I would stay there again.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201ctoo far out but nice all the same\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3700236", "Content": "we stayed in the hotel just recently and found it to be a charming place but with the (BIG) fault of being too far out. we wrongly took the advice from the lastminute map and thought the hotel to be in the centre but when we arrived at the hotel we found it to be (well, felt like it the next day) a million miles away from where we expected. however we found the hotel rooms to be extremely comfortable and superbly clean. the staff were very welcoming, especially the man with huge blue eyes, and although the breakfast wasn't a magnificant feast, it was enough to get us happily through the day (well until lunchtime at least). i would recommend this hotel to people wanting to have a quieter stay in rome but those who want to be part of the romantic atmosphere that places like piazza navona provides, well into the early hours of the morning, its probably one to skip.

Never have I encountered such lack of even basic manners toward their guests. They seem totally unconcerned about your comfort or difficulties. Our room had no telephone directory, stationery, pens, brochures listing services or any information about the neighborhood. Three light bulbs were burned out. The coat hangers were made of cheap plastic and would not hold a pair of men's jeans without falling apart. We had to ask for toilet paper since it was not replaced automatically. When we asked for glasses rather than plastic cups we were told to go to the dining room and get them, they were not delivered. And the traffic noise was just indescribly loud even with the windows and curtains closed. We slept with earplugs and it wasn't enough. I would liken the noise to the Indianapolis 500. The dining room was basic and did not open at 7 p.m. for dinner as posted. No atmosphere or service. It was a very disappointing representation of the city of Rome. The hotels we stayed in Milan and Florence were wonderful and their staffs were exceptional and gracious. This hotel looks very nice from the outside but there is nothing to recommend it once you enter. Skip this Donna Laura Palace.

It is located on a busy main road which runs along with the river. The noise of the road therefore means keeping the windows closed is essential for a goodnights sleep. The walk to the main attractions takes roughly 10-15mins but you do take your life into your own hands dodging the italian drivers. A late night taxi back to the hotel from most of the local piazza's costs about 10 euros. The hotel is kept very clean and tidy. Unfortunately small details such as the main bar never being open in the 5 days we were there and also the beautiful roof terrace, which would be ideal for dinner or an evening drink with views of Rome, was closed without explaination for 2 nights. The service in the main dining room was a bit poor and the staff seemed unused to catering for any number of guests.

As for extra towels right away- you'll need them. Unfotrunately. the Italians haven't discovered terry cloth yet... The roof top restaurant has a lackluster menu, but the desserts and wine by the glass saves it. The breakfast is lame, even by Italian standards.

Our room felt spacious and had a large double bed (v.comfy) and a sofabed for our daughter which was also good. We had a balcony, working A/C and because we had an end room, our bathroom also had a big window. The bathroom was small but elegant and functional (but why no proper hand and face towels instead of what looked like napkins?). The Hotel's staff were on the whole courteous, welcoming & polite. The fact that we had a child with us was not an off-putting factor. Downside? The hotel is a good 10-minute walk from the nearest metro (Lepanto) and the walk can get tedious. Buses stop nearby, but each time we decided to wait for one, nothing ever came - until we started walking of course! You could get a taxi - it cost us 10 Euros for a cab ride back to the Hotel from the Ancient City. Just as an aside, we never felt uncomfortable walking around the area at night (there are some friendly shops and cafes nearby), and never saw any unsavoury characters during our stay. Food in the hotel was its worst point. We were given a complimentary dessert voucher so we tried the restaurant on the first night. The food was very lacklustre, the bread stale and the fish wasn't salmon (as requested) but swordfish!! And the complimentary dessert? Ice cream or fruit (pineapple). The continental breakfast also lacked excitement. Every day, it seemed like the same old tiny bread rolls, muesli/cornflakes,puffed rice and sweet croissants were being laid out! Bread for toasting and a bigger variety of cereals would have been a nice addition to the cakes, cheese and meat slices. Also, by around 9am, the coffee turns very thick and stewed! But to moan about the food and the lack of niceties such as in-room tea-making facilities or the unavailability of an iron would be churlish. The bottom line is that the DLP is a pleasant hotel and, if you can forgive its foibles, is definitely worth checking out (or checking in, to be more accurate).", "Date": "August 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cDonna Laura Palace\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1419999", "Content": "We found the Donna Laura by accident, coming in at night from the North.
