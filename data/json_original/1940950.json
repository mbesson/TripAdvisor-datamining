As it was the first time that my wife and I had travelled without our two boys in a while I had some strict criteria on making this memorable. Well I can say that Ohla did not disappoint !!! From the moment we arrived through the grand entrance we knew this was a special place. As you enter you are enveloped in a dark black chic hallway with the concierge desk to your right. There we were greeted by Fausto (according to my wife, a lush Italian). He was so helpful in settling us and led us to the small annex on the first floor where we checked in. The check in almost like a cool living room. Ultra smart white furnishings and homely book cases all around. My wife and I spoke in hushed tones as we really did feel like we were in someones home - very nice. I managed to get an early spring (March) deal on a junior suite. What an absolute treat ! Took the advice of others on TA and had a 5 floor suite overlooking the main street. The room was quite excellent with the same chic design and modern feel. The bathroom was a little confusing at first as it is actually in your room. Think of an open plan kitchen with dinning, instead you have an open plan bathroom with a bedroom. This makes the room very intimate for couples, but if you are planning on sharing with someone you don't know very well - perhaps this open plan design isn't a great idea - no bathroom door as such in other words !! There is of course a discrete loo so it's not all open plan. The bed was firm and comfortable and you can actually pick the scent of the pillows - very classy touch. We were greeted with a bottle of bubbly cava for our anniversary and our arrival was complete - fantastic start. We chose to eat in the adjoining Sauc Michelin starred restaurant. The restaurant is very small and off an annex by the reception room. You cross a little bridge over the main lobby and bar area - smart. My wife and I chose the 5 course tasting menu, as my wife doesn't eat meat the restaurant amended the tasting menu to be more seafood based. Cannot fault the service or the food, simply lush. I would say that you'll need to have an adventurous palette to enjoy the experience - not a burgers and chips place - and not ideal for children. Breakfast was in the brasserie area with a nice open selection. Plenty of cold and warm options. I chose a small cooked Sausages and Eggs breakfast - but I've never seen such a classy serving of the dish - again the word I'd use is Chic !!! The hotel is located right in the centre of old Barcelona - we were a 5 min walk from La Ramblas, 5 minute walk from Barcelona Cathedral and a 45 second walk from the tube station that is opposite! Because it was so close to the sights and transport, we were able to taste the best of everything in Barcelona without feeling rushed, no hassle of delays from cabs or traffic. We chose to use the underground as it was cheap and very convenient. I bought my wife and I a pair of traveller tickets for 2 days, about \u20ac29 - fantastic value. Overall I could not have wished for a better experience. Fabulous hotel that made the whole Barcelona experience unforgettable. Well done Ohla and the team - truly fantastic !!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGood but not great Central Hotel Experience\u201d", "Author": "templeDublin", "ReviewID": "UR128276144", "Content": "This hotel is a class act - but it could do better.

They arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport and on arrival we were quickly shown to seats and given a glass of cava to enjoy whilst we were efficiently checked in. We'd chosen a junior suite and the fall in love package for our first night and wow - to find red rose petals in a heart on the bed, a rose petal arrow leading to the bath, which had candlelight and rose petals in the hot, bubbly bath water. A chilled bottle of cava on the side with chocolate truffles... welcome to Ohla - we were in heaven! We ate breakfast in our room every morning and although the room service charges were steep we found the breakfast filling and everything was well presented and cooked. The receptionist/concierge were also incredibly helpful booking restaurants for us (recommending great restaurants too!) and arranging taxis. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always delighted to be able to help. Each evening when we were in, a lady came to our room to check the service/cleanliness of our room was satisfactory and to provide chocolates for our pillows - I truly think it's these little touches which made our stay extra special. The final thing I should mention is the bar staff in the hotel - they are superb and I'd recommend popping in just for one of their amazing cocktails! Not only are they incredibly knowledgable about the drink industry but nothing is too much trouble and they take the time to talk to all guests and will make any drink you ask, even if you just say I'd like something involving whisky. Would absolutely recommend this hotel, and the area feels safe and is perfect walking distance to many great places including shopping and is a stones throw away from the metro for easy travel around Barcelona.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cStay was ok - but not worth the money\u201d", "Author": "Brandie_in_Boston", "ReviewID": "UR127743619", "Content": "My husband and I were excited to stay at the Ohla Hotel but in the end we were not impressed. The location is excellent but in our opinion that is the only five star aspect of this hotel. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, the woman checking in the guest before us was snapping at her because the guest was asking for her beds to be arranged in a different way (the way she had requested). When it was our time to check-in we were barely greeted. We had reserved a junior suite for four nights. They only had us down for two nights and when I mentioned this the check-in woman demanded to see our reservation. We were given a room on the 3rd floor - which turned out - allowed for a significant amount of street noise at night when we were trying to sleep. The room was fine, but quite small for a \"suite\" even by European standards. In fact I feel that calling this room a suite is simply clever marketing tool. The room was just a room. I also noticed the same stale smell others have remarked on when we entered the room. The hotel had also sent us an email asking us what aromatherapy scent and pillow type we wanted upon check-in. Neither were present in our room. The bathroom was big but very dark. Maybe my eyesight is bad but I am not sure how you are supposed to apply make-up in a place that dark. The best light was in the closet with the toilet in it! I will say the shower was nice and free toiletries were good. Our breakfast experience was similar to others who posted reviews previously. The staff was really unhappy and they seemed quite put-off if you requested something cooked off the menu even though that was included. On our last morning for breakfast I had ordered scrambled eggs for myself with bacon and pancakes for my husband. My husband's pancakes came out and my eggs at least 10 minutes later with uncooked bacon. What a disappointment. This hotel is fine but it is not worth the money and the staff especially are not representative of someplace that claims to be five-star.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel (but not a 5*) - well placed disapointing restaurant\u201d", "Author": "hedocple69", "ReviewID": "UR127682532", "Content": "Very Nice boutique style hotel, well situated in the Middle of Barcelona near to all the shopping and Museums.

Probably not ideal for children A small moan - due to the snow the flight was delayed and Gatwick Cabs which seem to run a 100% monopoly wanted \u00a3160 for a cab to SW6. Staggering - the sooner they allow black cabs the better and in the meantime use the Gatwick Express and hopefully Gatwick will stop this daylight robbery.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay - Superb Location\u201d", "Author": "rachel1372", "ReviewID": "UR123984735", "Content": "This hotel can't be faulted for design. The whole look and feel is chic, sophisticated and well laid out. The roof terrace is stunning and there was obviously a lot of thought in how the property could be made unique. Which is brilliant because in our minds, when we travel we want something different to experience. And the Ohla Hotel definitely offers something different. Like many reviewers we stayed in a junior suite. I wasn't overly impressed with the materials used in the room as although the design was 'cool' it seemed a bit like it was decorated from IKEA. Just a personal opinion; however, it was modern, clean and open planned - meaning the bath area is not separate from the rest of the room. Having stayed in hotels with similar open plans, this was not a problem for us and just added to the charm. I was slightly disappointed that our bath did not face out the window as one of the pictures had shown. Rather, it was in the middle wall of the bath area. Lovely, but just a small disappointment on my behalf as I probably spent too much time analyzing their website photos and building different expectations. We may have hit an 'off' weekend however we weren't too impressed with the catering facilities. Upon check in we were told that we could eat as the restaurant would stay open until 01:00 (we checked in at midnight). We trekked to the room and ran down the stairs just to be told that unfortunately they closed at one midnight. No problem - room service! The menu had a good selection and only a few things would be available after 01:00 so we rushed to order - only to be told that unfortunately the menu is not correct and they stop at midnight. Mini bar it was.... good thing there was a lovely half bottle to share. Breakfast was good and varied. Included in the menu are a few made to cook items which was a nice surprise to the otherwise (high quality) continental style breakfast. Moving on the bar downstairs the next evening - we had some of the best cocktails that we have ever had and I am not kidding. Well thought out, perfectly executed and excitedly different than just your average martini. With all the good, their seemed to be a bad however...Service was horrendously slow - so much so that after waiting nearly 30 minutes for a second round we decided to leave. There were only four other customers in the bar! Tucking into the last bit of crisps on our table we noticed something hard. A chewed olive pit was in the bottle of our crisp bowl. Not pleasant at all. The staff apologized however it didn't leave a good taste in the mouth - pun intended! We decided to eat down the street (recommended by the hotel) at a place called Neyra - about a two minute walk from the hotel. As my husband is Spanish he was longing for some decent tapas. We weren't disappointed (one star to the hotel for such a great recommendation!) Next morning before our departure, we had breakfast. Eggs cooked to order took 25 minutes and had bits of shell in them. Oh dear... You can see a slight pattern here. On the positive side - the location is unbeatable. Las Ramblas is a short stroll away as is the waterside leisure centre. We did have a fantastic time. It wasn't flawless by no means and perhaps all of the glowing reviews set expectations which just couldn't be met during our stay.

The hotel is central and just far (and close) enough away from La Rambla and there is a virtually limitless number of places to eat, drink and be merry. However the highlights of the hotel were; the tapas restaurant, which is just below street level and we were entertained on our first night by the hundreds of local football fans walking by, celebrating Barcelona's league title win that night; the rooftop bar and pool, though the latter is small and a bit revealing with a glass wall (however the views are great); and the cocktail bar, where the drinks are expensive but the barman put his heart and soul into making our drinks and they have some really funky chairs!

We ate in the hotel one night as the concierge said they did the best tapas in town and we loved it. The kitchen is open in the restaurant and so you know standars are high Nd the staff were attentive and friendly. We drank in the hotel bar every night before going out and although small its a nice place to start and the bar staff are experts, telling you all about your drinks and watching them make them up is a great way to watch experts in this field at work, they are a credit to the hotel. Breakfast was lovely every morning and again staff lovely. Checking out I left diamond earrings, designer jewellery, cash and cards in the room as my partner had put them out of the safe so I assumed they had been packed. The hotel called immediately, but I had checked in at the airport so they sent everything back to me including cash I had left. I think this is lovely and amazing that cleaning staff on little wages would be so honest, but this is a reflection of the standards required by this hotel and demonstrates that their staff are employed for all the right reasons. We could not fault this hotel in any way, shape or form. It's strategically placed and is five minutes from anywhere you need to be and there is a train station around the corner, all the trip buses at Catalunya square are just five minutes away and you are in the gothic quarter, so you cannot get much better location wise.

This is a classical modern boutique hotel, located centrally in the heart of the Gothic district and a major transport route with easy walking distance to many of the major sites, and 3 blocks down from the Hop-on, Hop-off Barcelona buses, which are a great way to see the city. Like others, it is a little weird that the check-in is half a floor up, but perhaps, that expands the boutique like feel to the location. I must say that they pay great attention to all the little things, from the concierge giving you directions, to the chocolates on your bed sheets. It was too bad that the roof top bar wasn't manned, and the roof top pool wasn't warmed. I would have loved to have taken a swim with that view of the city, especially looking at the Gothic Cathedral and the sea beyond. It's an absolutely stunning view. The one major negative of the trip was dinner at the Restaurant. For a Michelin star restaurant, the service was awful. The food was excellent, but when it takes 15 minutes to order a meal, and 20 minutes to respond to a request for a cheque, that's simply not acceptable.

The rooms are really different from what you have seen. We stayed on the Junior suite room which had a great view of the road and was very sunny. The shower is exposed to the rest of the room and so is the bathtub. I believe that the room meets more the needs of a couple than a family's. Rooms were extremely clean and the cleaning staff did a really thorough job. I read some reviews saying that staff is not that good. I strongly disagree. Whatever we asked was delivered fast and the staff was very polite. Information was provided regarding restaurants in the town, bars, tickets for theaters and so on. Beds and pillows were really comfortable and felt great. Mini bar was very extensive but ridiculously overpriced. They charged 8 euros for an energy drink and 4,75 euros for 330 ml of still water. Cuisine was very good and atmosphere on the gastronomy restaurant was really fantastic. A bit overpriced again but it worths having a dinner. The terrace is unique with great panoramic view and nice lounge atmosphere at any time (day or night). Location is perfect because while you are in the center you are just a 5 minute walk from the main touristic street which is La Rambla. Also while it is on a main avenue the hotel is really quiet due to good insulation of the windows.

The location was perfect - it's on the edge of the old part of the city and only 20mins by taxi from the airport. It's a great area to walk around, particularly for the older generation as it's mostly flat. The hotel is only 10mins walk to the beach through small, winding and quaint streets which comprise lovely small boutique shops, cafes and bars. The main shopping streets are close by so if you want to shop for clothes you can go to bigger high street shops (Zara, H&M, Mango etc) although I preferred the smaller boutiques. Take care when walking around Barcelona - it's well sign posted in the guide books but there are pick pockets waiting to take advantage of the tourists - we saw it first hand in our first stroll out in the streets. Just be sensible when you're out and keeping bags close to you. The great thing about Ohla is it's bar and pool located on the 8th floor roof terrace. It's breezy, has stunning views across the city (including the port) and has lovely seating where you can relax to soft music. After a few hours walking the streets it was great to go to the pool and sunbathe with a glass of wine. It's open in the evening too, so pre dinner drinks are a must. It's also the perfect way to kill those last few hours waiting for your flight home. Breakfast was great if you don't want to try the local food. If you choose the hotel buffet then book in advance as it's a little cheaper than turning up on the day. The only down side to this hotel is that if you aren't travelling as a couple then there is very little privacy in the hotel rooms. As you would expect in a new boutique hotel, it's decoration is very stylish - and that means the lovely big shower is encased in a glass cubicle within the bedroom. If you're not travelling with your partner then you may not like the lack of privacy!
