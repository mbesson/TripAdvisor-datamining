I was amazed when I opened the door. The room was really big, with a kitchenette, a small sitting area and a big and comfy bed.

Yes, it is very close to the border however it is an easy 20 min car ride to San diego. This saved on city hotel parking fees at $14 a night. Hotel staff very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast nothing exciting but fruit and cereal available as well as greasy stuff. Coffee is horrible there is a Starbucks up the road which really helped. Housekeeping left the room really fresh every day with new soap, towels every day. Great to have a microwave and fridge, laundry was useful too as we needed to freshen clothes as only brought a few. Rooms were spacious - we had a suite which had a little seating area with a sofa bed and table, beds very comfortable and so were the pillows. There are some really good restaurants in Otay ranch to the north 14 miles away or 4miles via 125 toll rd $4.50, local fast food places too. Free internet access and a business centre with a printer so we bough discount tickets before we went to attractions an saved a load of $ doing this too. For our family this was ideal as we got breakfast and no parking fees and were going to be going in the car on trips every day. Easy to get to legoland, San diego zoo, etc, we even ended up in Yuma AZ one day!

We had stayed previously in San Diego a few years ago and wanted somewhere quiet.

This place was ideal, situated in a quiet area close to the border crossing, cheaper than most hotels in the San Diego area and was very clean. The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them. Only down side was the air conditioning unit located on the roof. We were allocated a top floor room below the a/c unit, but the noise was so bad we changed rooms to a lower floor, without any further problems.

First of all, location is too far from Zoo, LegoLand, SeaWorld, downtown, restaurants. If you want quiet and away from everything, this is for you. We stayed seven (7) days and had the free breakfast everyday and were out of the room by 9am everyday. For three days, the room was not cleaned when we got back. We always got back at 4pm or after. They never sent anyone to clean the room. They always said \"housekeeping is gone for the day.\" They did not send someone up to bring fresh towels. We had to go down to the front desk and pickup new towels ourselves. We also had to throw out the garbage ourselves. For two days, the toilet got clogged. The first day, they partially unclogged it while we were away. It was not fully unclogged when we returned and generated a \"slow flush.\" The next day, it became fully clogged again and I reported it as we left for the day. They did not unclog it while we were out. When we returned, I reported it over the phone to the front desk right away and they said someone would be right up. 30 minutes later, no one showed up and I called again. Same reply, \"someone will be right up.\" 30 minutes after that, still no one, I went down to the front desk and reported it in person. Same reply, \"someone will be right there.\" 20 minutes after that, I went down to the front desk and asked for a plunger which they gave me and I unclogged the toilet myself. They also did not serve their advertised cinammon rolls for 2 days and one of their vending machines was out of order for the entire 7 days. This was all reported to management and to Holiday Inn Guest Relations. The only reply I got was from Guest Relations saying they would contact the hotel general manager. I never heard from anyone from the hotel directly. This is the worst hotel stay experience I have ever had. I have been traveling for 10 years and have over 100K miles with 4 different airlines and have stayed in many hotels. I am currently a Gold member with Holiday Inn. I have stayed at Holiday Inns from Hawaii to the East Coast. I have no problem with the chain in general. This one single hotel and its management is the problem. Holiday Inn should terminate their franchise agreement with this hotel. I will never stay at this hotel again no matter what it is called.

Clean, functional and comfortable. Very friendly and efficient staff. However, rooms are less well soundproofed than Hampton Inns and if your neighbor has the TV on loud, you'll get some noise. If it weren't for that, I'd give this a 5-star rating. This place is right close to the Mexican border - it's fun to look out your bedroom window into Tijuana as I did.
