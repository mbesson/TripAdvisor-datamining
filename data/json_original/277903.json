In fact, in my opinion (and I have been a travel professional for 15 years), this does not even qualify as a hotel. There is no housekeeping service, no food & beverage service, no internet connection available (NONE, not even an option to pay for internet), and no concierge services (other than the sponsored ticket sales booth...that is a vendor, not a concierge). If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and won't miss not having any of the typical services provided at a hotel, then this is okay. But they should not be calling this property a resort. That is not true. The location is off a semi-residential road. It takes about 6-7 minutes to get to I-4 and 15 minutes to get up to central Disney property. Coming back can take longer because of the left turn onto Atlantis. That is a heavily congested intersection. The furniture is all junk in this place. It is nice having the space of an apartment and the full kitchen, but the couch is ancient, the beds are the cheapest quality spring mattresses (the majority of the hotel industry now competes on quality of their beds...these kinds have not gotten that message). And the TV reception is really bad. I suspect it is from trying to push a modern digital cable provider through really old worn out TV's.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MIAMI", "Title": "\u201cServed its purpose for the price we paid, nothing special.\u201d", "Author": "BIGBERT305", "ReviewID": "UR127165530", "Content": "here are the negatives... 1.

I was in town for business training and desired a room with a kitchenette so that I could cook meals and save money. I was pleased with the amenities but not \"wow\"-ed. Here are (what I consider) some of the PROS: 1) Location was good for me. Off of the busy stretch but within a few miles of grocery stores, restaurants, Target, and tourist shops. 2) Kitchenette: all appliances worked well. There was a nice convection oven/microwave with removable rack, a two-burner stove, the freezer had an ice maker, small dishwasher worked well, and my favorite was the stacked laundry machines. Everything was in good shape. 3) Giant soaking tub. It was not jetted but was very deep and accommodated my larger frame just fine. 4) I had no problem with cell phone service. 5) Saw guests with pets so resort must be pet-friendly 6) Main living area and bathroom was tile. 7) Staff was very helpful and polite. 8) Complimentary internet is available in the lobby; two computers are available for guests but have a time limit of 20 minutes and will automatically log off. 9) Not one bug found in the room! Room was cleaned well too (except carpet...see \"Cons\"). 10) Nice balcony accessible from the living room and the bedroom. The Cons: 1) Paper thin walls. One night I had some rowdy young neighbors who admired foul language and loud music. When someone is talking down the hall it sounds like they are right in front of your door. Luckily they quieted down by 11 PM (the \"quiet time\" at the resort) and stayed just one night. You can hear when others flush the toilets- these are jet powered toilets, mind you. 2) Not much to do at the resort itself. There was a pool and jacuzzi that looked nice, but I was surprised there was not a fitness center or recreation room. Perhaps I just wasn't informed about them but I couldn't find one on the resort map. 3) My room had an odd inventory. I had one coffee mug, two juice glasses and two iced-tea glasses, etc. I found an inventory sheet which threatened that if I didn't turn it in within 24 hours of checking in, I'd be charged for missing items upon check out. So I did the sheet and walked it to the front desk where the lady said, \"Wow, we don't even do these anymore. I can't believe this was still in your room!\" But she did ask if I needed any items from the list- I got a toaster for the room. 4) No kitchen garbage can. I remedied this by tying the kitchen bag to the bathroom door. Not a big deal for me but some would be inconvenienced by this, I'm sure. 5) Outdated decor, TVs and furniture. This didn't bother me too much because they were all functional, just ugly. BUT the couch was the most uncomfortable thing I've ever sat on. Adding pillows from the closet helped a little bit. 6) Mattress and box spring did not match- looked like the $100 deal from the local \"last chance\" mattress store. Not very comfortable. It did have a mattress pad. I was disappointed that the pillows did not have zippered pillow covers separating them from the top pillowcase. I thought that was a bit unhygienic. Luckily I had my own pillow with me. 7) Bedroom carpet was nasty. Commercial grade that had probably never been shampooed. Two stains at foot of the bed. The carpet actually dirtied my socks. Ew! They'd have been better off doing tile throughout. 8) Construction at front entry of resort. This didn't bother me but might bother others. My room was at the back of the resort so I didn't really hear anything. 9) Some highway noise can be heard early in the morning. 10) VHS player in the bedroom, DVD in the living room. This was inconvenient for me because I wanted to watch movies in bed but could not because I brought DVDs. I suppose I could have swapped machines. Overall the resort served its purpose for me. I had somewhere to stay within close reach of my training and I was able to save money by cooking and doing laundry in my room. I got this room for less than $60 per night on an internet site, which in my opinion is a very good deal for this type of room.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jefferson", "Title": "\u201cPoor RCI Resort, never again!\u201d", "Author": "Ruth F", "ReviewID": "UR122317829", "Content": "This place is so run down.

The place was very clean and equipped with just about everything one might want: iron/ironing board, pots & pans, dishes, coffee machine, stove, dishwasher, fridge, washer and dryer. Was it a 5 star resort, no. However, if you are looking for a homey place that is good to relax while you park hop everyday then this is the place for you. The resort was minutes from all of the major attractions. Disney was the closest and Universal was the farthest with Sea World and Discovery Cove in between. The resort is located very close to many restaurants and shops where you can find anything that you may want or need. The staff was friendly and the pool area was well-maintained. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the water temperature was quite warm and therefore was not refreshing considering the Florida heat.

And the pooch loved the grounds and lakeside track, not to mention all the other pups he could visit with. If we'd had the time and the supplies we would have loved to cook out on the lakeside grills. We would have no qualms recommending the resort to others. There was a stain here or there, but it was certainly clean and comfortable. The bed was one of the best I've slept on in ages. I have dust mite and mold allergies and they did not act up while staying here--however, I took my own pillow coverings just in case. The kitchen was even equipped with a toaster, blender, teapot, electric can opener, etc. not just the necessities. We did have a problem with the washer not draining, but when we called the desk, maintenance visited and replaced the part within 10 minutes. I'm sure the appliances have a bit more than the usual wear and tear. Another unit experienced a mild kitchen smoke incident and maintenance was there to check on them and insure everyone was safe within 2 minutes flat. The pool is great--love that it is open late. However, it is getting a bit cool and the heaters don't keep it as warm as I would like it. Though the resort is fairly close to Disney, our main destination was Universal and we did not have any issues with slow-moving traffic along I-4 any day we headed north. In fact, we could be parked and in the park in less than 30 minutes. We also really enjoyed Wildside BBQ on Irlo Bronson a couple of miles away. Great calamari, bbq chicken quesadillas and soups!

Keep in mind as you read this that I am an owner of this resort but this was my first time actually staying here since I bought it over 8 years ago. I have always exchanged it at RCI and knew that I\u2019d come back once my kids were old enough to enjoy the theme parks. I think back then it was a Gold Crown designation. If you plan on owning at this resort, please beware. When I first bought it, I saw the potential. There were only a few buildings up and when I saw the model in the sales room, I figured it would be worth it when they finish the entire construction. They even showed me a nice model room during the presentation and told me how much they were going to grow and I have yet to see it grow as large as that model in the sales room. They recently showed me another room during the presentation and it is nothing near the room they actually gave me. I am very disappointed in this place. I really feel like a sucker buying this place. We own two other time shares, one in Maui and one in Cancun, and we have stayed at so many resorts in the past 10 years, vacationing once or twice a year and this one is the worse we\u2019ve ever been. First the good news\u2026 1. The staff is friendly and courteous. 2. The pool was refreshing and fun for the kids. 3. The Air Conditioner is outstanding (when it works). 4. The security upon entering the grounds is pretty good. However, upon opening the front door to unit B33, it was great at first site, but soon after looking around\u2026 1. Master Bathroom light bulb was out. \u2022 Called Front Desk and Maintenance replaced it. 2. Carpets were really filthy with stains and holes. 3. Remote Control to the living room television was missing. \u2022 Called Front Desk and Maintenance gave us a brand new one, but it didn\u2019t work, so we had to replace that one, too. 4. There were no bath towels \u2022 Called Front Desk and a bag of towels were brought up. 5. Kitchen faucet cap was broken and water was not easy to turn on. 6. Furniture was really dingy, including the Sofa, Kitchen table chairs. Some furniture had stains on them. 7. Televisions seemed more than a decade old. \u2022 Sales showed us LCD screens in the model rooms. After staying the first night, here are some more observations\u2026 1. Master Shower door would not close easily. 2. Master Bathroom lock did not work. 3. Guest Bathroom tub was stained. 4. One sheet had a blood stain on it 5. One of the towels was stained and had holes. 6. Another towel had ripped while drying my back. 7. There was dent in the refrigerator door. 8. Sofa bed had dead bugs on the mattress. 9. One of the blankets had human hair on it. 10. There were no nonstick pans so prepare to burn everything you cook or bring a lot of cooking oil. 11. The clothes dryer does not dry at all unless you have just one piece of clothing in it. 12. There is no wireless internet in the room; or wired for that matter. \u2022 Only in the lobby and pool area provides wireless service. 13. Volume for the Living room TV went out. \u2022 Called Front Desk and Maintenance came up and fixed it but blamed the lighting storm. Hmmm\u2026.. 14. Air Conditioner went out. \u2022 Called Front Desk and told me to reset the breaker for the AC. (It worked.) \u2022 The problem is that it went out sometime during the day and when we came back from a hot day at Disney it was like an oven. 15. Not all outlets seemed to work. 16. One of the two key cards stopped working. \u2022 Front desk reset it and told me to keep it away from my credit cards and cell phones. Hmmm\u2026 17. We found a large red ant crawling along the bed near my 3 year old son. 18. The TV stands in the bedroom has doors that don\u2019t retract inside the unit and thus stick out so that you can bump into them every time you walk by. \u2022 Not really safe if you have a 5 year old and 3 year old playing around the bed. 19. I found a letter on the floor outside my neighbor\u2019s door. \u2022 It mentioned a welcome package. I didn\u2019t get anything but a crappy room. \u2022 The second letter for my neighbor mentioned $100 exchange promotion and I got $50. \u2022 Obviously my neighbors were not owners and they wanted to suck them into buying into this resort. 20. I got a call for what I thought was going to be an owner\u2019s meeting but turned out to be another sale\u2019s presentation. \u2022 I even had this list of items to discuss with the staff and other owners but they tried selling me another program which was \u201cespecially available only for us owners\u201d. \u2022 They were great but I just wasn\u2019t in the mood to buy something where I was already disappointed with the resort. Also their reservation site that they were raving about didn\u2019t work. \u2022 I\u2019ve been to many of these sales presentations and this was definitely below par. All resort sales presentations I have attended had better food selection and more variety of drinks. And their website actually worked. Maybe all the people who had recently given this resort good reviews must have stayed in the model units because the unit I checked into was horrible. Perhaps they were not owners and the resort wanted to sell them ownership and purposely had given them the better unit. Whatever the case, if the other rooms were as bad as mine, this place is in dire need of help.

We are RCI owners and traded in points to go to Orlando. Here's how everything went: -Check-in: Staff was very pleasant. I was directed to another counter to get my parking pass, which was really just a ploy to have to listen to a timeshare sales pitch. I advised the woman that we were already owners, but she insisted on trying to set us up for a \"60 minute session,\" and the prize would be $60 off of tickets to some attraction. The only way I could get out of making an appointment was to tell her that I'd have to talk to my husband, who would not be in until the following day, which was Saturday. We were dozing on Sunday morning when the phone rang at about 8:15 AM. It was the same lady asking me if I'd had a chance to talk to my husband yet. I finally convinced her that we did not want to come to any of her \"sessions,\" but it really bothered me that we were given the hard sell when we only wanted to relax. And she knew we were already owners; did she think we wanted to buy a SECOND timeshare??? -Unit: Our unit was clean enough, but the walls were paper-thin. We could hear all of our neighbors' conversations. The towels were of the lowest quality possible; one of them even had a big hole in it. The washer and dryer were fine but very small-capacity, so only about three towels would fit per load. The biggest problem was that we could not regulate the temperature. It was always too hot or too cold, and it seemed like the thermostat was broken because when it was freezing it would be set on 80. -Grounds/pool: The landscaping crew was always out and about, and the grass always looked nice. However, the units themselves were rundown. Several were in need of a power-washing. Our unit had weird green paint streaks around the porch, as if someone started a painting project that they never finished. The resort boasted that it provided two grills for guests to use, but when we inspected these grills we found so much gunk that needed to be scraped off that we decided it wasn't worth it. The pool area seemed nice at first: lots of chairs, unlimited use of [cheap] towels, etc. However, there was a thin layer of bugs floating on the top of the pool every morning when it had stormed the night before. They had streamed in some pleasant 80s music, but the volume was set so loud that you couldn't even have a conversation. The first time I used the restroom, I pulled on the end of the toilet paper roll and the whole dispenser came crashing down on my shoulder. Upon closer inspection, I found that someone had repaired the dispenser with clear packing tape, and that it had been undone and re-taped many times. When I was walking out of the restroom, I almost stepped in a brown smudge that was appeared to be human waste. I went into the clubhouse lobby, grabbed the first person I could find, and walked him out to the restroom. He was very nice and apologetic, and told me he'd take care of it. Unfortunately, that meant that the entire restroom was shut down for the rest of the day. The next day, I saw that the brown smudge was gone, but that the toilet paper dispenser was still held together with the same piece of packing tape. (I saw the same employee later that day, and he asked me if I was feeling better, and he seemed genuinely polite. However, when I first took him to the restroom to show him the \"issues,\" he had asked me what my room number was. I fully expected a follow-up call from management or maybe even the offer of some sort of upgrade, but I got nothing. The only person who acknowledged my injury was that same maintenance worker.) -Convenience: This resort is very convenient to to the theme parks and attractions. -Recommendation: I cannot recommend this resort to anyone. Our \"real\" timeshare is in Cashiers, NC, and it feels like a resort.

Since it's a pet friendly place, I didn't want to even think about what had made all of the brown stains on the chair cushions. I do not have a pet, but was there because I had to change my reservation at the last minute and could only get into this place. On our first night, we discovered that we had no hot water. The guy they sent had to come up twice to fix it. The buttons on the phone in the living were ripped out, so we could only use the phone in the bedroom. On another night, we rented a movie at one of those dollar machines to watch in the DVD. It wouldn't play so we assumed that it was just because the dvd had a few scratches. So we rented the same dvd from the resort for $7. It still didn't work. The dvd player was broken so we had to call so they could replace it. One of the things that really shocked me was that on our second day we were running low on toilet paper. When I called housekeeping, they informed me that you only get a starter kit and that you have to buy your own after you run out. I've been to dozens of time-share resorts and I have never had to BUY my own toilet paper. Another crazy thing is that they wouldn't exchange our towels or do any housekeeping. You have to pay $35 for them to change the towels, make the bed up without changing the linens and load up the diswasher! All other time-share places replace your towels anytime you call and do the cleaning at least once or twice a week for free! They just don't take care of the little things that make a vacation stay comfortable. They didn't even have a gym! The worst thing was that the pool heater was broken. I had specifiically wanted a heated pool. Since it was only 67 to 75 degrees the whole week, the pool was freezing. They said it would soon be fixed. The hot tub worked, but everyone was trying to squeeze into it. The next day they said it was fixed. We threw on our suits and ran out there, only to discover that it was still freezing cold. They lied to us about it being fixed for 4 days. On the fourth day, they drained the hot tub and put caution tape all around it. An older couple told us that they had been there the year before at the same time and that the heater had been broken then too!

We stumbled across this resort that offered a week stay for around $400 without any knowledge or intentions of sitting through a briefing to become a \"member\". First of all, during the briefing the sales associate introduced us to all these great opportunities and extras if we choose to purchase timeshare with them. After all the bells and whistles, my husband and I chose to make the purchase in which the final contract was made on the day of our checkout. I tried contacting the sales associate about a month after leaving because it was explained to me that I can refer others to the resort and receive rewards. I left about 20 voicemail and email messages within a 30-day period and NO phone calls or emails returned...not even an acknowledgement. So i contacted the person of whom I originally spoke with that made my reservation, (before I arrived) Helena. She then told me to contact the Manager in which it took about 2 weeks to get a response from him. He sent me an email stating that he would take care of the issue and if I had anymore concerns to let him know. Bottomline.....THAT NEVER HAPPENED EITHER! When I call the resort after becoming a member for reservations, they always ask if i am a member. After being asked that \"EVERYTIME\" I called, i began to think members have priority. I was denied reservation everytime I called. So then, I had a friend call the day after and she was asked if she was a member, she said no, and they told her there was availability for her required dates of stay. This is what happens. Once a member, you have absolutely NO CHANCE of returning because they've already locked you in and getting your money. They want NEWBIES to come stay so that they can CON them into buying. It's been 4 years now since I've been trying with no success. However, they harass me for the annual maintenance fee for a resort i visited only once. At first I didn't mind paying the fee but got a bit discouraged after the continuous unavailability [for some folks which seem to be members]. Furthermore, not to mention the extra 50,000 points they gave me as a signing bonus and later took back because they said I should not have received them in the first year (which also says this in the contract). Their explanation, it was a mistake in the contract. My suggestion: It's a beautiful family friendly resort. If you want to continue vacation there, DO NOT LOCK IN A PURCHASE WITH THEM!

Here are the cons: 1. This resort does not have any restaurants. There are no activities on site for adults and very little for children. (This is a resort for people who do not plan to spend alot of time in their condo.) 2. The mattresses on the beds are very firm. This may be uncomfortable for some people.(Bring your airbed etc...) 3. Accomodations are not luxurous or fancy. I would rate the appearance of the rooms as what you would expect from a standard hotel. (In all fairness this may be due to the fact that the condo we stayed in was for people with pets.) 4. Clubhouse is connected to the receptionist area and needs to have more activities -maybe some exercise equipment, more table games etc..... 5. The swimming pool is small and they have one jacuzzi. Needs to be expanded. 6. Patio is very plain.

After we moved next door we could see that the full kitchen unit have a nicer kitchen, bigger living area and a nice spa type tub. After moving we just want to rest. BEWARE The pet building means Dogs. Barking dogs. I think the people next door must of used the condo for a pet kennel.

There is not a manger on duty so there was nothing they could do. I was outside at 3:00a.m begging the guy that couldn't do something to PLEASE do something. Finally at 5:00 a.m. the owners came back just to walk the dog and by the time someone got to their room they had left again. And yes the dog started barking. I went to the office at 8:00 a.m . because that was the time the manger was going to be there.Well nope the manger didn't show up till 10:00 a.m. and we were moved AGAIN to a non-pet room.

We had a wonderful time in the pool but it is SMALL no slides nothing special. Then they have FREE pizza and BINGO. We tried to sleep there Monday night but the bed was like sleeping on bricks.

No restaurants, no store(s), no gym and the \u201cclubhouse\u201d is just a reception area, with most of the building used for sales presentations. There is a trail going around a lake that is in need of much repair work.

Our one bedroom, one bath unit was clean, the smaller side of a 2 bedroom lockout. We declined the timeshare presentation and were not pressured after that. The partial kitchen had all the necessities, with a dishwasher and washer/ dryer. However, while the rugs looked new and clean, the bed and the couch were worn, sagging and backbreaking.

Everything about the unit was wonderful, except for the beds. There were three beds in this two-bedroom unit, and every one of them had incredibly uncomfortable mattresses. You could feel the springs through the padding. Furthermore, the bedding itself was the kind of cheap bedspread and blankets that you would expect at a low-rate motel. The mattress pad on our king-size bed covered only about 50% of the mattress. This really detracted from the experience for me. For some, it might not be a big deal.

If you are looking for a comfortable and peaceful place to stay,away from the hussel and bussel of Orlando this is the place for you. If you are into mayhem, keep looking. We checked in early and had no problem, we asked for a jacuzzi suite with a king bed....done! We were given an Executive Suite. It was on the ground floor of building K. The room had a view of the parking lot, thats not being negative,its going to happen. Since we weren't looking for a view, it worked for us.

The suite was spacious, clean and stocked with everything you could imagine.The masterbedroom had a Jacuzzi tub which was very relaxing, and a king bed. The bathroom was very large. The living area had a large screen televsion, and a full kitchen was provided, with a dining room table and couch. The lanai area was nice and always quiet. There were plenty of towels, and a stackable washer and dryer for laundry. This suite would definitely accommodate a family of four. We knew upon checking in that we would have to do a timeshare presentation. We were not called about it once we left the front lobby. We actually called to reschedule it from Friday to Saturday...done! We went to the presentation, the salesman was not pushy, he was obviously disappointed when we said no, but this is his means of living, I would be disappointed if the shoe was on the other foot, keep that in mind. Even after deciding not to buy we were graciously given our Seaworld Tickets. We live in Florida, so I would have to say compared to the other resorts out there in the same price range as Celebration, there is no competition. Just keep in mind, you need a vehicle to get around but nothing is more than twenty minutes away, there are no restaurants or stores on the property. Walmart, Publix and Walgreens are around the corner and the resort gives you directions to all. We didn't feel that these were reasons to give the resort a negative review. Retail and restaurants are not really needed, if you think about it you are coming to Orlando because your traveling, whats another five minutes to buy groceries or go out to eat. The pool was clean, we didn't swim but the kids there looked like they were enjoying themselves. On check out morning we called for a late check out at 11.....done!

The resort is nice and the staff was friendly and responsive. However, we had several issues during our stay. The first night we noticed the patio door lock was broken. Within minutes a maintenance person was there and fixed it (at 10PM!). However, the second involved bugs. We had many very tiny crawling insects throughout the unit. According to the management, they enter through the door. They sprayed the entry-way but it did not do much good. The second bug issue was a type of cockroach that is common in Florida. We had two cases with the roaches in the kitchen. Although I did confirm (through a bug expert at Animal Kingdom) that the roaches are not your normal cockroach associated with uncleanliness, nonetheless, it was disturbing. According to the management, bugs are less of a problem on 2nd and 3rd floors. The third issue was the overall cleanliness of the unit. The carpets were filthy. The bottoms of our feet were black from walking on them. Little cleaning attention is given to areas around the toilet, tubs, and sinks. The king mattress was also so worn on one side that you could not lay anywhere near the edge without falling off. And, as mentioned in other reviews, if you stay on a bottom floor you will hear toilets flushing above and chairs being moved. My total cost for the entire week amounted to less than $300 so I still felt I got a good deal. However, if I had paid out thousands to be a timeshare owner and ended up at Celebration World, I would have been sorely disappointed.

Large screen tv in livingroom ( smaller tvs in each bedroom ) and well equipped kitchen. The pool area was clean with plenty of chairs and towels. Overall this was a great find in the Orlando area.

Our check-in went well with no surprises or snafus to start our vacation. We had the larger of the one bedroom units and found it to be very spacious. Bedroom: King sized bed and a small tv (no VCR or DVD player) and a large jacuzzi tub in the room. Bathroom: There is a very large closet with plenty of hangers, a large stand up shower, hair dryer, and private toilet. Bring extra toilet paper. Living room: a large screen television with VCR, a pull out bed in the couch, coffee table and chair, and a round dining room table with 6 chairs. Kitchen: full-sized with a large refrigerator, dishwasher, stacked clothes washer and dryer, full stove and oven, toaster, microwave, and clothes iron and ironing board. There were a few pots and pans and enough silverware for 6 people. There is a nice screen enclosed balcony with a lounge chair and 2 sitting chairs with entry from the bedroom or living room. The staff was very friendly and the grounds are very nicely kept. There are grills peppered throughout the grounds and a mulch jogging track with exercise stations and a basketball court. The pool area was larger than an average motel pool and is perfect for small children (clean towels are provided). It has a small hot tub for no more than 5 adults but there are plenty of lounge chairs. The are a few negative comments that come to mind. The king bed was a typical motel bed and very firm. The walls are relatively thin and you can hear the neighbor's toilet flush while laying in bed. Fortunately not loud enough to wake you up. Since we stayed on the top floor I can't comment on the noise level from the upper room. Except for the pool there aren't alot of activities for kids. If you don't want to wash dishes every night I recommend you bring paper plates and plasticware. There is a grocery store about a half mile from the resort and several restaurants close by. The theme parks are a 10 minute drive from the resort if you leave early. If you leave after 8:30 am then expect a 15 to 20 minute drive. Everything considered we would definitely stay here again.

The staff were friendly and helpful and the 'help desk' people were great (even though we only found out who they were by mistake) We didn't feel welcomed or looked after as guests at the resort but more that we were being 'put up' in order for them to sell us their product.

I have stayed in many hotels and accommodations around the world, and this by far was one of the best. There was everything that one would need to make their time as comfortable as possible with so much more. The accommodation was clean and fresh, well maintained and of a very good standard. With 2 huge televisions, a video player, washing machine and dryer, huge microwave, cooker and fridge, there was nothing else that we required. On arrival, we had water, washing powder and a few other essentials to get us started which was nice. We even had a jacuzzi in the master bedroom which was relaxing after a day at the park!! I expected it to be nice, but I did not expect it to be so nice and I was plesently surprised at how nice it really was. I am however slightly confused about some of the other reviews that have complianed about the resort and actually decided to stop reading the reviews before I went away as I was starting to feel rather nervous. Need not worry. The resort was peaceful and being a teacher I went during my half term, so I expected to see and hear children. NEVER once did I hear anything, not even from the people next door and yes there were people staying next door to us. There are a few Bar B Ques around by the pond that you are free to use and generally, there was a great atmosphere there day in day out, The reception was nice and had a friendly feel to it. All staff that I encountered during my stay we kind and helpful. There was free internet service, videos to rent for the player in the room, and a few sporting activities. A car is a must and I suggest you get one of these to get you around the place even though the resprt is fairly central, especially for all the shopping that we done. I really can not wait to go back. Infact, I am currently awaiting confirmation for another booking for next summer. Had a great time and I recommend it to anyone thinking of going Have fun!!!
