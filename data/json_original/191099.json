To begin with, the location is absolutely ideal. We were able to walk to all of the sites we wanted to see. The area is full of quaint eating establishments and small grocers are nearby if you wish to collect items for a picnic (not to mention the market at Campo di Fiori an easy walk away). The staff of the hotel is most congenial and professional. They assisted us with making restaurant reservations for a 50th birthday celebration and surprised us with a complementary bottle of champagne back at the hotel. Our room was the best we've had in our extensive travels in Europe. It was comprised of a sitting area with small table and a separate bedroom. The bathroom was quite large by European standards, easily accommodating the 2 of us. But certainly the best thing about the room were the 2 windows that opened to an amazing view of the Pantheon and Piazza della Rotonda. There is a lot of activity in the piazza until the wee hours but we found closing the windows reduced the noise to quite satisfactory levels. However, we rarely closed the windows. We live in a small town on a lake and enjoy peacefulness and solitude, but \"When in Rome.......\" we enjoyed the vibrancy of the piazza and feeling more a part of the city. The breakfast served is an excellent start to the day. The staff is very efficient bringing hot drinks to the table and always keeping the food replenished so choices were never limited. The cleanliness of the hotel, from common areas to rooms, was impeccable. The front desk staff were always cheerful and efficient, greeting us each day as we returned from our touring and making us feel at home. Another feature of the hotel that we enjoyed was the roof-top terrace. This was open during our stay although the accompanying bar was not. We spent a very relaxing evening up there watching the sun go down and the lights flicker on in the piazza below while sipping wine and eating fresh bread, cheese and salami purchased at one of the nearby grocers. If I had to come up with one quibble, it would be that the wireless internet connection in our room was not satisfactory and wouldn't allow us to connect. We were, however, able to connect in the common areas of the hotel. This was of little consequence to us as we were focused on experiencing Rome and, indeed, we did not even mention it to staff. It's possible there would have been an easy solution to that. Given our experiences at the Albergo del Senato, and at a cost that we believe represents a very good value for what is received, we will definitely return on our next visit to Rome", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDelightful\u201d", "Author": "Travelpig2", "ReviewID": "UR127795630", "Content": "I took my husband here for the weekend for our anniversary in March 2012.

Most anything a visitor to Rome would want to see is either within walking distance, or if you're planning to use Rome's public transit system bus stops are very easy to get to. Secondly, the staff if superior. Any request, including pre-arrival restaurant reservations, were accommodated quickly, efficiently and with a smile. Every staff member from the front desk, to the bellmen, to the housekeepers, and bartender were friendly, even putting up with attempts of my basic Italian language skills. Although the room I had was not in the front of the hotel and had no view, the benefit to being located on the back side of the hotel was blessed quiet. I can't say if the room facing the Piazza della Rotonda are noisy, but it was nice to be able to sleep in a quiet spot.

We also loved the breakfasts, bacon and egg, fresh fruit, cereals, toast, pastries and cake, tea and coffee, what more could you want! We used the car service for airport transfers, this was a great way to start and finish our holiday as it was so convenient to be driven from the airport straight to the hotel, and we had some useful tips from the drivers.

Well this is where sites like tripadvisor provide invaluable help. Like many people I was astonished by the choice and as this trip was a surprise for my wife I wanted to make sure I got it right. After a fair amount of research I finalised on th Alberto del senato based on almost faultless tripadvisor feedback (and not just a few reviews, over a thousand) which constantly had this hotel in the top 5 in Rome. Location - unbeatable for me. Might not be for everyone as it is in one of the busiest Piazzas in Rome, but I loved that. I do not believe you can beat the location, it's within 5-10 minutes easy beautiful cobbled backstreet walks to Piazza Navona, Campo do fiord, Spanish steps, the Tiber, Roman forum etc. We always returned to the Piazza for a late nightcap watching the entertainment and crowds. Room - We had room 103 whilst not huge, it was fine for our 3 night stop. It had a fantastic view of the Pantheon and the Piazza. We loved having the windows open and hearing the hustle and bustle - even in the evening listening to the crowds and the musical entertainment (guitarists, singers etc). When the windows are shut you can hear nothing so those of you who don't like the noise will not ned to worry. Staff - friendliest and most helpfull hotel staff I have ever experienced, from front desk to breakfast room. Breakfast - great choice of cereal hams/cheeses, cakes, fresh fruit, yoghurts, bread/rolls and also egg and bacon - set us up for the day and we got by with only an ice cream for lunch (Oh my god the ice creams are fantastic) I cannot speak highly enough about this hotel, which is only a 3 star.

There was a hallway, with a large wardrobe, which led to the bathroom. The hotel staff are wonderful and will go out of their way to help you; they are a credit to the hotel. It was my mother's birthday whilst we were there and they gave us a complimentary drink in the rooftop bar. The views from the rooftop bar are fantastic which overlooks the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda, we spent our evenings having a relaxing drink there listening to the music from the square, prices at the bar are not expensive. The breakfast was great - variety of foods to suit all. There are many restaurants in the square and close vicinity to choose from so no need to venture far in an evening, though they do vary in price. I would love to return to Rome and when I do, I will definitely be returning to Albergo del Senato.

We had reserved a car service through the hotel to pick us up at Fiumincino airport. We arrived after an all-night flight to find no driver waiting for us. We waited 20 minutes. One of us had a cel phone from the U.S. & tried to call the hotel, but couldn't get through. So we got a van service to the hotel (there were four of us so we couldn't fit us & all our bags into a regular cab). When we arrived and I identified myself to the desk clerk (Mauro) he began a harangue that included snarling and sarcasm, insisting that we had not waited for the car service. It was really a disgusting, shocking, inappropriate and disrespectful display. If we hadn't been so tired, we would have looked for another hotel ... but we went upstairs, accompanied by a lovely bellman who had witnessed the incident and tried to make up for it. It is our sincere belief that if we had not been a group of all women -- two lesbian couples -- we would not have been treated that way. I spoke with the night manager later, Ann, and it turned out that there are two possible exits from the area at the airport where we picked up our luggage and the driver was waiting at the other one. All this put a sour taste in our mouths. ----- The hotel itself, however, is a dream. We had reserved superior rooms with balconies and view of the Pantheon. If you can afford it, we recommend those rooms on the 6th floor. There are also two suites on the 6th floor with adorable outside sitting areas overlooking the Pantheon. -- The rooms themselves were very comfortable, well decorated, clean. Very nice bath amenities. & the location couldn't be much better. Quite a good breakfast as well, although we had read complaints on Tripadvisor about it.

The recent room renovations are fabulous and have gotten rave reviews from our traveling companion who is an 11-time Emmy winner for Set Decoration. Every trip to Rome reiterates the sayings \"All roads lead to Rome\" and that Rome is the Eternal City. With the Pantheon just steps away from this hotel's front door, you can almost reach out and touch this ancient foundation for modern architecture from your room window if you're lucky enough to score one with a view of the Piazza. Seeing the Pantheon either very late at night or very early in the morning while the city is sleeping is like having it to yourself - an indescribable feeling. (You can get up early and take a short walk to the nearby Trevi Fountain and have a similar experience there which is in sharp contrast to seeing it typically packed dozens deep.) You can people watch visitors from all around the globe while having a refreshment outside at the hotel's front door piazza patio lounge or enjoy the breathtaking panoramic view of the city's skyline from the hotel's rooftop bar. Conveniently and centrally located, the Senato is either a short walk or cab ride away from Rome's major attractions & highlights. This also makes it accommodating for any inclement weather (hot or cold) or to take short breaks in the day to adjust for jet lag or other fatigue. After check-in, the amazing staff greets you by name and provides over-the-top personalized attention. They'll provide directions with maps, make reservations & offer recommendations. Anne, Alessandra, Mauro, Michele, Giuseppe & Adem make us feel like old friends and personify Italian hospitality at its finest.

But close the windows, shutters and curtains and all is serene inside. The rooftop bar gives good views of Rome both night and day. For us all the major sites are within walking distance, we only used a tour bus to visit the Appian Way. This meant we could see one site in the morning and easily nip back if needed to freshen up or rest before going to another or before going out to eat in the evening. For an early start trip to Pompei (pre-booked with Viator.com) we walked to the other side of the square to get a taxi to take us to the coach office near the train station. Being whisked around the empty narrow streets of Rome was another fun experience you would not get during the day. We are thinking of going back to Rome and even though we will be travelling further to see the sites we missed we will be staying here again. There is no restaurant but this is not needed because it is surrounded by them and you would rather eat outside looking at the Pantheon or some other wonderfull site and watch the people walk by. Breakfast is continental, cereals, cheeses and cold meats, the usual affair with some hot food but don't expect a full English cooked breakfast, you are in Rome after all. I would also recommend booking the airport to Hotel taxi pick up.

The staff were always attentive and helpful without being too ott; the room and public areas are well decorated, very marbly and ornate but in a stylish manor. Location wise, it is perfect - a 3 minute stroll to piazza Navona for lunch or a coffee and to absorb the 4 river statue or the bustling caricaturists in the square, walk the other way and the Trevi fountain and Spanish steps are several minutes away, all the while meandering through cobbled streets with small interesting shops and boutiques along the way. We had breakfast in Campo dei fiori which is a 5 minute walk away too.

First, there were the quick and detailed responses to my e-mail questions regarding choosing a room at the hotel and requests for additional information about the hotel.

For our stay at the hotel, we had booked a driver from the hotel to pick us up at the airport. He was waiting outside the baggage claim holding a sign with our name. The check in staff and all staff were wonderful throughout our stay. Service is definitely a high priority at this hotel.

The large window in this room also overlooks the Pantheon and the piazza. The bathroom has a fabulous shower, two sinks, a bathtub, and all the amenities that one could want. We had booked a rate that included breakfast and that was offered in the breakfast room on the main floor. The breakfast was good but the hotel could improve the experience for guests by explaining that there are items that can be ordered. For example, eggs and cappuccino must be ordered through the wait staff. However, even if you only eat from the items on display, you will not go hungry. Finally, most of the major tourist sites, with the exception of the Vatican City, are within walking distance. There are two shops within a couple of minutes where one can buy groceries (water, wine, cheese, specialty items, etc.) on the small streets leading to the square. The non-tourist grocery store across the square from the hotel had the best prices.

This was our first visit to the city and we didn't have too much time to do much planning. We were going on a holiday after a long time and being busy professionals we wanted to make best use of our holiday time. So we were very particular that we stayed in a very good place and most importantly we wanted to soak in as much Rome as we can for a week. So the location of our hotel was very important for us. We had a difficult time to narrow down our place of stay because most places that were located in a good locality did not look very impressive online. We finally chose this hotel hearing that it had a view of the Pantheon and the location was also close to most popular places in Rome. Unfortunately when we called for a booking they said they cannot guarantee us a room with the view of Pantheon. So we decided to take a risk anyway and also decided to spoil ourselves by booking the suite for the last 2 days which guaranteed a balcony and a great view. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we have had a wonderful experience. Our room did finally have a great view, the staff were very courteous, the breakfast buffet was yummy and the services and cleanliness were at its best. We loved our rooms (both the regular and the suite) so much that we chose to stay in our room on the last day without going out anywhere. Just watching people going about with their activities at the Piazza was an amazing experience.the view of the Pantheon under different lighting of the day and night was truly magical!

When we (my husband, myself and my niece Lisa Amoroso) arrived at your hotel, Luca smiled and welcomed to us to the hotel, he asked \u201chow are you\u201d we explained to him that we were not very happy. The car we hired from the airport could not find the hotel and we had been driving in circles, passing the same streets for 45 minutes. The driver became frustrated and left us off several blocks from the hotel, told us to walk straight, make a right turn and our hotel would be there. Luca listened to our story and said he was sorry we had a problem but everything would be alright now. Our room had been upgraded and we would have a good time in Rome. We then told him that my husband, who is a diabetic, left the United States without his insulin. Luca once again listened to our story and then said \u201cno problem\u201d, he immediately picked up the telephone, called the pharmacy around the corner from the hotel, explained the situation and arranged for someone from the hotel to walk us to the pharmacy. Luca once again smiled and said he would have our luggage delivered to the room while we were at the pharmacy. We then told him we did not have any luggage because our luggage did not make it to Rome and was most probably still in the Heathrow Airport. Luca smiled and replied \u201csenora, now you have a problem.\u201d We laughed, and said we knew but we would continue our trip in hope that everything would work itself out. We were only going to be in Rome for the night, we were continuing on to Egypt the next morning, if our luggage did not get there soon we did not know if it would ever catch up with us. That night we met a friend of ours who is a priest and studying in Rome, and went out for a terrific Roman dinner. Fortunately, our luggage arrived at the hotel very early the next day. Everything went well at the pharmacy and we were able to pick up the insulin around 9:00 a.m. We checked out of the hotel at 11:00 went back to the airport and flew to Egypt. Whenever I relay the story to friends and family I always say I have to write a letter of appreciation for all that Luca did to help us enjoy our stay in Rome. All this time I had very good intentions of writing. It does not seem possible that three years have gone by without me doing so. I apologize that it has taken me this long. But at least I know I have finally given thanks to someone who really deserves it for going well beyond what was expected and solving our problems. So many times people write or complain about things that go wrong, I feel it is more important to thank and congratulate the people who help to make things go right. So once again I apologize for not writing this letter sooner. I hope Luca still works for you hotel and continues to greet and help your patrons with the same grace and good humor he welcomed us to your fine establishment.

We found this hotel through Trip Advisor and the various photos posted here. We figured that the location was good as it was outside the Pantheon. We called the hotel to book a room reservation. We were calling from India. The hotel staff made it so easy. We however were extremely insistent that our room had a view. They told us there were no guarantees on a view but would do their best. With that little hope we made the booking. There are no words to describe the immense sense of joy we felt driving right to the heart of ancient rome. The taxi pulled up right outside the Pantheon and the taxi driver pointed us to the hotel. Our jaws dropped. Still not sure of the view we rode up the tiny elevator to our 4th floor room. Once inside, even the gods could not have planned our view better. We literally were looking at the Pantheon and the square below. The fountain, music, restaurants, people, life and Rome were all at our window's view. Need we say more... our holiday was perfect! But wait! it got better. On the third day, we had to move to another room due to some availability issues and were given the penthouse suit! What we thought was a perfect holiday got even better! We had a whole sit down balcony and a bottle of campaign in the room!!! Well we did pay substantially more for this room but as they say, can you put a price on beauty? The hotel staff were very courteous. One day I decided to stay in and enjoy the balcony view. When I got in the room was clean!!! the house keeping wizard lady did the most amazing and quick cleaning job i have ever seen. Morning breakfasts are quite filling.

We first booked the apartment but upon arrival shifted to a renovated room. Don't get me wrong, the apartment was fine (and HUGE with 3 big rooms) but for $400 I wanted something with more \"uumph\". Our new room faced the Piazza/Pantheon. VERY VERY HAPPY with room. It was delightful. Big, bright, beautifully appointed. One of the few hotels that provided bath robes. STAFF: The hotel staff were extremely helpful in changing room, booking cars, etc. MAINTENANCE: Hotel spotlessly clean and pristine. No chips, scuffs or marks in general areas. LOCATION: can walk to everything. Vatican is an extremely nice 20 minute walk west. HOTEL BAR: hotel has a little lobby bar inside open to 11:30 pm for hotel guests only. Nice touch. Can pop down in the evening for a coffee or drink. PIAZZA AND NEIGHBORHOOD: Facing the piazza is magical. The site of the Pantheon is DEFINITELY worth the cost. In the evening musicians come and play classical violin as people chat in the cafes. The Piazza is small (the hotel website shot the piazza with a super wide-angle lens) and charming. We learned the Senate is block so at lunch and dinner Italian diplomats, etc dine in the neighborhood. There is nice upscale feeling to the area. The area is less touristy than others. One evening we walked overt to Camp di Fiori neighborhood. SO GLAD we did NOT book a hotel there. It is 100% tourist (ok, we are tourists too, but you know what we mean). Chalk boards outside restaurants with \"happy hour\" scrawled in pink chalk.... eeeew. Not an Italian in site. Even people WORKING in restaurants were foreigners! Might as well stay home. With millions of tourists descending upon Italy every year, you can't avoid tourists, but we want to be around SOME resident Italians!! If you feel the same way then we suggest you consider the Albergo del Senato. Better neighborhood. The only thing we can nitpick about was breakfast. It was okay, fine, nothing to write home about but I would not let this be a deterrent. It really is a very small thing. It had eggs, meats, cheese, breads, pastries etc, but smaller scale and simpler in presentation than the other hotels we stayed at in italy. (ONE THING: there is a cafe/restaurant on the ground floor. I don't think its part of the hotel. Do not eat there. It was the only place we can say we had bad food. The pizza was inedible. Poured the tasteless sauce out of can with no flavorings or herbs.

I had written some notes regarding this hotel in my journal, but unfortunately, Air France lost my luggage containing the journal. The volcanic eruption in Iceland during the period of my stay that stranded tens of thousands and created havoc throughout Europe no doubt resulted in plenty of lost luggage. Back to the Albergo del Senato. I still remember it fondly. The Hotel arranged for airport transport which arrived on time. The driver was friendly and knowledgeable. Arriving at the Hotel via an air conditioned Mercedes, I was greeted by the lovely and gracious Allesandra, who seems to enchant all who meet her. My room faced the Pantheon--literally only a few yards from my window-- and waking up to that view each morning was truly an awe inspiring experience. I emailed ahead to request this view and the Hotel delivered. The room was well appointed and comfortable complete with a complimentary bottle of mineral water and just about every bath toiletry you can imagine. A large marble bathtub, you bet. Plush bathrobes and slippers, check. Yes, European mattresses tend to be firmer, but that issue was easily addressed by placing the extra duvet in the closet on top of sheet. The maid quickly caught on, and after the first night began placing the extra padding between the sheets without my saying a word. I had breakfast delivered to my room early each morning (included in the booking rate)and it was spectacular. Always several delicious baked goods, yogurt, juice, coffee (with a piture of heated skim milk for home-made lattes) and an assortment of jams and spreads, delivered with a smile. In the afternoons and evenings musicians serenade from the Piazza below. The gillatoria next door is the best in Rome. This Hotel is well located and in walking distance to many attractions as well as plenty of shops, cafes, and restaurants. The only down side is the crowds of tourists which can be a bit daunting after a few days. Ironically, one of those tourists who contributed to the over-crowding of this beautiful city, was me. The service at the Albergo del Senato is excellent and is the reason I am taking the time to write this review so belatedly. All who work there should be commended for making the guests feel so at home in Rome.

I spent many hours researching hotels in Rome because I knew I was going to be on my own with my four kids for 5 days in Rome before my husband could arrive, and I wanted a location where we could walk to most of the sites, and which was safe and beautiful. Thanks to tripadvisor I chose the Albergo, and it was truly perfect! Pros: The location can't be beat. It's in a beautiful setting, everything you imagine when you think of Rome, the Pantheon is right outside your door, and unlike other popular tourist areas (e.g. Piazza Novana, Spanish Steps, etc.) - the crowds usually never get that bad, and the area is kept clean. Architecturally, it's in a beautiful part of Rome, Berlusconi resides in his mansion just a few blocks away. We were able to walk to most of the important site, Coliseum, Forum, etc., and it's a short cab ride to the Vatican. There are so many restaurant choices right outside your door or within a short walk, Piazza Novana is just a few blocks away. When we go back to Rome, we will definitely stay at the Albergo. Service is excellent. The woman at the front desk (sorry I can't remember her name) was knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. We arrived early in the morning from our flight from the US, and she was able to get us checked into our two rooms after a short wait (we relaxed and had our caffe lattes overlooking the Pantheon). She also recommended the best restaurant for our family, it was an authentic restaurant where the Romans go, had wonderful pizzas and pastas in a quaint setting, tucked away near the Piazza Novana (never would have found it on our own). We ended going there many nights and for lunch - we tried other restaurants which were recommended on tripadvisor, but this place was better. I think the name was La Foccacia. Breakfast was also excellent with many choices, and my kids loved the hot chocolate. Rooms were large by Rome standards and nicely renovated. The hotel's interiors and ambiance were in keeping with the feel of being in Rome. The photos on the hotel's website and other guests are accurate. We did not have a view of the Pantheon, but it must be wonderful if you do. One downside though is that it will be noisier because if you keep your windows open, you will hear the noise from the many people outside. Price is reasonable by Rome standards. It's not cheap, but it's more like a four star hotel rather than the three stars it is rated. I could afford to stay at any hotel in Rome, but I chose the Albergo and it lived up to my expectations. I thought it was good value for the price. Cons: The only con is the outside noise if you stay during a time when you need to leave your windows open. If you have a room that faces the interior, it's pretty quiet, but if you face the Pantheon or side street, you will hear the noise of the many Romans who like to be out and about until midnight or later. But, this is the price to pay for being in such a perfect location. Rome is a beautiful and magical city, and staying at the Albergo makes for a perfect trip.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cideal location, wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "patwee", "ReviewID": "UR117230726", "Content": "Was there for 9 nights and am so glad I chose this place: Step out of the hotel and there's the Pantheon in all its magnificient glory.

I found myself going back to my room at various times during the day just to stand at the window and look out at and muse on the madding crowd in the piazza...what a sight. It was a cosy room too, and bathroom was big, with great water pressure. If only there was BBC on the TV..but that's not a big deal. The breakfast was not award-winning but more than adequate to get you started for the day, and the people serving were really gracious.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Magherafelt, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent small hotel, Amazing location\u201d", "Author": "Gorm0", "ReviewID": "UR117222067", "Content": "So delighted we choose this hotel.

Breakfast was quite good...with juices, fruits, cereals, breads, and two out of the 3 days scrambled eggs...the breakfast room is not huge, so you saw some people waiting....it is a very pretty room, wonderful service. \\ The roof-top bar was open when we were there.

We were given some advice on restaurants in the area by the front desk staff...and these worked out very nicely. they were booked for us no trouble at all...in fact, the one person on the desk made certain she gave us a look on the internet and read the description of the restaurant for us.

Never needed a taxi/bus and the walks were safe and enjoyable with lots to see along the way. We want to mention the excellent service Joseph at the roof top bar, gave us both nights!!! He was helpful with local knowledge and very charming. Not to mention the excellent Bellini, and sangria which were very refreshing after a long hot day of touring. The snacks were delicious too. The view/sunset to the Vatican is awesome! It is so nice to take the city in from atop after a day of touring. If you stay here you must plan on relaxing here before you head out to dinner. Luca -front desk, and was extremely helpful and friendly with directions, restaurant reservations, maps and bus routes. Alessandra was too! Our room 405 was chosen based on another Trip Advisor review. It was on the 4th floor and the window had a view to the Pantheon Square. The room and bathroom was small but very clean and recently updated. For 2 nights we did not mind the limited space, or after being on a cruise ship for 12 days. The walls had beautiful fabric wall covering, there was a coffee bar with mini-frig and a closet/cabinet. The shower/bath has pretty glass tile with great water pressure. The counter space was limited. The breakfast had delicious fresh fruit, eggs, tomatoes and cheese/meats as well as the standards - yogurt, baked goods (excellent coffee cake), cereal and fresh juices. There are plenty of good choices to fill you up in the morning. I debated where to stay for a while in Rome, and maybe that is why the cost was higher since I waited to book until 2 weeks before we were to arrive.

The room is spacious, comfortable and tastefully furnished, and the bathroom has a bath tub. The only negative (and it\u2019s hardly a deal breaker) was the wardrobe configuration. It doesn\u2019t make the best use of the available space and was a bit frustrating to use. The air conditioning is controlled via a computer at reception \u2013 we encountered this system once before in Italy. The breakfast spread is modest but ok, and the breakfast room can get a little cramped, but the service was good and I enjoyed Serena humming happily along with the classical music. We visited the roof top bar twice, once for coffee in the afternoon sun, the other time for cocktails in the early evening, when we were stalked by pigeons \u2013 we did intend to go up there after dark to enjoy the ambience but never made it. Piazza della Rotonda is lively in the evenings \u2013 there are always buskers and even a bit of street theatre. I needed ear plugs to make sure I got to sleep but had no trouble doing so. Being an old building there are also a few creaks and plumbing noises, especially in the morning. To really enjoy the Piazza and the Pantheon (opens at 8:30 AM) get up early and just walk out the front door of your hotel. The hotel is in a very central location. While it is a 10 or 15 minute (flat) walk to the nearest Metro station we utilised the small taxi rank on the other side of the Pantheon and found that it was no more than about a 7 euro fare to any point in the city. While there are many restaurants and cafes on the Piazza, these were not recommended by the hotel staff. Instead they directed us to a lovely enoteca (wine bar) just around the corner \u201cSpiriti\u201d and to a nice local restaurant \u201cCasa Copelle\u201d.

There are some other hotels in the neighborhood, but the staff and the accommodations make this place the place to stay in Rome. In terms of location, it is not just the Pantheon that is the attraction. Within a stone's throw there are St. Ignatius Church, Santa Maria supra Minerva, St. Ives, St. Andrew, and Gesu--all archetectural masterpieces and art museums with free admission. Moreover, there are excellent restaurants (e.g., da Donato), coffee houses (e.g., Tazzo d'Oro, St. Eustache), and gelato (e.g., Blue Ice--try the mango sorbet!) very close by. The cab stand is just across the piazza. This area has it all! It is the hub of the wheel of Rome attractions--Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Quirinale, Piazza Navona, the Vatican, etc. So how is it inside the hotel? We loved it before, and we loved it this time as well. The hotel has 6 stories; now the top 4 floors have been redone. Our room 604 was quite attractive; the balcony was a special treat. The one negative I must point out is that the rooms are small. But not too small. There is a rooftop bar that is open in season. It is a great place to have a drink at sunset. The breakfast is quite good. There is a large spread of fruit, meat, cheese, cereal, bread, pastry, and eggs. For the number of guests, the breakfast room is small and can get crowded, especially at the end of the time for breakfast. Uusually when I travel to a city I study all the hotel options.

The photos posted are for room 606 - we did splurge & booked this suite, but it was worth every penny!! We used the balcony overlooking the Pantheon/piazza daily & it was a perfect way to relax & enjoy the bustling of the piazza. Being right in the piazza you may be worried about noise, but you need not. We had absolutely no noise issues at any time of day. The beds were comfortable; the original pillows placed in the room were a tad hard - but a quick call to the front desk & the perfect pillow presented. (The 'tad hard' pillow is really the only negative thing I have to say; however, my husband disagrees about the original pillows & thus has nothing negative to say!) The bath was clean, nice amenities, lush towels, and plently of hot water. The breakfast buffet had lots of variety - cheeses, eggs, meats, yogurts, fruit, breads, etc. The location of the Senato could not have been more perfect - we were in the center of Rome; walked to all points of interests - from the Vatican to the Colosseum to the Borghese. The Borghese was a little bit of a walk, but break it up with a stop for dinner and it was more than doable. Rome is such an easy city to walk and the Senato puts you right in the middle of it all. We only used a taxi once to make our very early Vatican tour. (We never used any other public transportation as there really was no need.)The Senato also has chairs/tables right outside thier hotel for use of their guests only - so even if you don't book a room with a balcony, you can still enjoy the piazza comfortably without any pressures/worries. This hotel is MUCH nicer (and friendlier) than many 4/5 star hotels we have stayed in this year. The Senato definitely is a 4-star quality hotel at the very least.

After a tip on this hotel from a fellow classmate, I researched it further on the internet and of course, TripAdvisor. It was the perfect choice. Prior to arrival, the Hotel staff emailed me and helped arrange pickup and drop off from the airport via a private driver/service. That went flawless. They had a power adapter ready for me upon arrival for my medical needs. Again, this hotel and staff were true pros. Rome's a very walkable city and one cannot appreciate the architecture, the art, the culture or the \"surprise\" of this ancient urban plan if one doesn't physically walk the streets and experience the excitement from that perspective. Key to that is finding a centrally located hotel for your \"home base\" and the Pantheon-Piazza Navona-Campo di Fiori neighborhoods should be the target search zone(s). Albergo del Senato is directly on the piazza in front of the Pantheon. The energy of street life on the piazza is worth the price of a night's stay alone. We propped open our windows immediately to enjoy a backdrop of street musicians, performers, and just the pleasant din of multiple conversations occurring at the various restaurants and cafe's ringing the beautiful piazza. We particularly enjoyed the young male opera soloist who's acapella renditions in Italian were beautiful. Morning breakfasts were superb. Fresh. Varirty. Attentive and friendly staff waiting on your coffee needs. The rooftop deck was not yet open for the season. I can only imagine breakfast al fresco or a sunset glass of wine would be an added treat up within the domed skyline of this part of Rome. The front desk man was personable, helpful and always accurate with a superb restaurant recommendation. Some of the best dining I've had in Rome. The neighborhood has the famous coffee shop Tazza D'oro nearby...simply the best. Pizza by the slice about a block east of the coffe shop. Piazza Navona is a short walk as is the Campo di Fiori and it's fresh colorful produce. The del Senato is clean and the room we had was perfect for our travel needs.

It was our final night in Italy after a week in the countryside. We had wanted to stay in this hotel since we first saw it on a trip to Rome five years ago. We made the reservation for this one-night stay several weeks before our arrival, through Expedia, and we paid for the room in advance -- more than $400 for the one night. This was a splurge for us -- we had saved money on the hotels we had used during our week in the countryside so as to help pay for this one night at this well-reputed hotel. We were expecting a great experience. When we arrived at the hotel, we were taken to a room on the third floor. That floor was being renovated. About half of the floor -- everything to one side of the elevator -- was a construction zone. The workers had hung plastic sheeting at the entrance of the work zone, but the entire floor reeked strongly of paint solvent. The smell of the solvent was evident in our room when we entered it. We were afraid that we would get sick if we breathed in the solvent fumes overnight while trying to sleep. This was not at all what we had waited five years -- and paid more than $400 -- for. Given the presence of the solvent fumes, we were, frankly, astonished that the hotel management would consider any room on that floor suitable for renting out. We immediately asked for another room. The staff's initial response was an offer to upgrade us to a larger suite on the same floor, which we rejected, since the smell of the solvent was likely everywhere on that floor. They then took us, a bit reluctantly, to a room on the first floor. It was in the back of the hotel, and getting there required going up a few steps in the hallway with our luggage, and then back down a few steps. The room was overheated: it was 27C (about 80F) when we entered, according to the room's digital thermostat -- on a day when the high temperature in Rome was about 16-20C (about 60-68F). We attempted to cool down the room by opening the window, since the room's AC didn't seem up to the task. Opening the window helped a bit -- the temperature came down slowly through the night -- but having the window open exposed us to the noise of a man having a loud cellphone conversation in the middle of the night in the alley behind the hotel, and to another person who was having a coughing fit. It was not a good night's sleep. The bathtub in the room was unusually narrow and had a continuously curved bottom, which made it almost impossible to stand up while taking a shower. The staff was apologetic for initially showing us the room on the torn-up third floor. They gave us a good recommendation for a local restaurant for dinner, and they were helpful in getting us a cab for the ride to the airport the next morning. The breakfast service was nice. The location of the hotel is perfect for a quick shopping trip in the area around the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, which is what we wanted to do during our one afternoon in Rome. Based on the condition of the third floor and a remark made by the staff to another guest, I got the impression that the renovation work might last another one or two months. If you are considering staying at this hotel during that period, you may wish to call ahead to check on the status of the renovation work, and obtain a written guarantee in advance from the hotel that your room will not be on a floor that is undergoing renovation work. My answer of \"yes\" to the question of whether I would recommend this hotel to a friend is based on this proviso. I also hope the hotel management reconsiders its apparent policy of attempting to rent out rooms on floors that are torn-up due to renovation work -- it is completely inconsistent with a hotel of this standard.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cIs it Possible to exceed our expectations?

Having traveled extensively in Europe, we know the value of being in the historical center of a city & most of the hotels that have that distinction are even higher priced & mostly complacent with guests because they think their location alone will keep people coming back.

The night desk clerk insisted on helping my husband carry out our many overstuffed bags to the taxi, and then just as I was getting into the car, he ran back in & got the English daily newspaper for me. Michael in the bar was very attentive & friendly to talk to. Since we were celebrating an anniversary, we slept late the first morning & casually got ready for the day, so we didn\u2019t get downstairs till 10:45. Breakfast is served till 10:30, but we just wanted a cup of coffee. There were a few lingering couples & food was still out, so we asked the server if it was okay to come in. He enthusiastically told us \u201cOf course\u201d and wanted us to have some breakfast as well. Although we declined, we were made to feel welcome & were never rushed to finish. Before booking, I consulted Trip Advisor to be sure things hadn\u2019t changed since our last visit and saw only one posting that wasn\u2019t complimentary among all the glowing reviews, but I knew right away the reviewer was obviously not well-informed about European hotels. Double rooms will not accommodate a family of 4, like a Holiday Inn. If that\u2019s what you need, this is not the place for you. Is the elevator slow \u2013 yes, but there are 2 elevators. Although not speedy either, the small one is faster. That might bother some people, but it is a small inconvenience so overshadowed by the total experience that it would never occur to me to mention it. This hotel is our very favorite anywhere in the world & we can\u2019t wait to return next year.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNot for the noise-senstive\u201d", "Author": "MontePozzi", "ReviewID": "UR102567103", "Content": "I recently (March 2011) spent 4 nights at the Albergo del Senato. The location is fabulous, right on the Piazza della Rotonda and within walking distance of all the sights in the \"centro storico\" of Rome. The location is, at once, an attraction and a liability. The Piazza della Rotonda is a lively place that generates a lot of noise. I had a room facing the piazza, and closing the windows only muffled the noise from the square. I welcomed the rain when it came during my stay as it did more than the windows to diminish the noise from outside. I was prepared for the external noise and made appropriate allowances for it. I was not prepared, and felt I couldn't make allowances for, the internal noise, such as the bickering children in the room on one side and the television in the room on the other. I felt that the hotel has inadequate soundproofing for both the external and internal noise. The \"superior\" room itself was cozy, bordering on cramped. If I sat at the desk, the back of the chair was pushing against the foot of the bed. Sitting in the armchair, though, allowed a lovely view out over the roof tops of Rome. A better view could be had from stepping out onto the balcony. The bed was very comfortable, indeed. There were nice amenities in the bathroom, with good water pressure and plenty of hot water in the shower. I noticed some slight water damage around the tub, but this may get resolved in the renovations currently being made in the hotel. (The third floor apparently was being completely re-done at the time. I presume they're working they way upwards.) Housekeeping was a bit hit-and-miss. The room was generally very clean, but there was a layer of dust on the floor behind the door when I closed it. I guess the chambermaids must leave the room doors open when they're cleaning, so they don't see that they're missing this area. The website advertises air conditioning, but in March I had no control over the room temperature. It was altogether too hot for me, registering 28C (83F) on my thermometer. I had to ask twice before the heat got completely turned off. After that the room was sufficiently comfortable. Breakfast is adequate, if unremarkable -- cereals, pastries, rolls, fruit -- the usual items. I avoided the odd -looking scrambled eggs in the chafing dish. The Wi-Fi reception was poor in my top-floor room, but very good on the ground floor. Every member of the staff with whom I came in contact was pleasant, helpful and friendly. The people at the hotel are, without exception, delightful. I've visited Rome each year for over ten years. In the past I've always stayed at hotels in the Prati, near the Vatican. I don't regret staying here, but I don't plan on returning to this establishment.

The communication that I had with Laura Luca was excellent and she was kind to offer us a double room overlooking the Pantheon at 195 euros per night including \"breakfast\". The same went for the pick up service, fast, polite and efficient. Since we had a very early flight from Athens we tried to get some sleep during noon. The moment we closed our eyes a fire drill with its excruciating noise woke us up. It was around 14.00 pm. We decided to get up and go for a walk thinking that we would compensate for our lost sleep at night. I did not complain for the unfortunate happening at the reception as I thought it was a one time event. The same fire drill woke us up however, with its terrifying noise at 06.30 am, twice in the same day without any prior warning!!! Having slept only for three hours due to some drunks down at the piazza that were having an open air party, I was infuriated at the situation. Residents of the hotel from nearby rooms were anxious of the situation, they were slamming doors, running at the corridor, asking in loud voices what was going on, toilets were flashing through paper thin walls and a scene of acoustic chaos prevented me from sleeping again. One single night in Rome with only 3 hours of sleep. The same had happened to me at a resort in Florida and they gave everybody a 50% discount, without waiting for them to ask for it of course. To the \"breakfast\" now.... We went at 10.00 and the service ends at 10.30 am. At 10.00 am there was no omelett left, just an empty tray, next to which there was another empty tray. Both were never replenished. There was no toast bread and when I asked the non english speaking waitress what was inside another empty basket she started rambling in italian. Zero communication during breakfast as the only thing she understood was coffee and tea. After 20 minutes 5!!! pieces of croissants arrived to accomodate the hunger of a breakfast room still full with people. Three men grabbed four instantly and like a beggard for 195 euros per night I run for the last one. There was no yoghurt left and when the cheese was replenished after i ferociously pointed at the empty tray, I realized that I had to get 4 slices to make up for the size of a normal one. Actually there was nothing to eat except for the usual corn flakes and little vases of jam which you had nowhere to put them on as there were no croissants and just some stale bread cut hours ago... I was furious to say the least. I asked the reception for a compensation and they reluctanty reduced the price to 165 euros. Do they care? I do not know...

In addition to the massive bedroom there were two sitting areas, the room would easily hold 4 people if necessary. The air conditioner was powerful and it worked well.

Even though the mattress was hard I still managed to sleep well. (the couches in the room were more comfortable than the bed!)

Am only surprised it is not number one. First of all, location: right alongside the amazing Pantheon (great to be able to go in at 9.30 in the morning and have it all to yourself!). From the hotel it takes about ten to fifteen minutes to walk to the Spanish Steps (fun place where everyone meets and very posh shops) and the Coliseum and Forum (amazing place, needs time to really absorb the history). I don't walk fast, so times are realistic. To get to the Borghese art gallery (etc) and the Vatican would take about half an hour to forty minutes' walking; we got taxis and it took about ten minutes and cost about 10 euros.Around the small streets near the hotel are some excellent trattorias and pizza places, the Piazza della Rotonda itself has plenty of (rather expensive) places to eat and there is usually some entertainment going on in the piazza. So I cannot fault the location. Wherever you stay in Rome, you have to walk to each of the other highspots; it is not like Florence where all the places are within five minutes of each other. The hotel: it is lovely. Immaculately clean, very professional and friendly service. The reception areas are very attractive, the breakfast room is very smart and the breakfast is absolutely wonderful. More like a buffet in a 4 star hotel. Really, really good. And they very happily will pack a small bag for you with fruit or croissants if you want to take something out as well. I was visiting Rome with my adult daughter and we shared a twin room. The first one we were given was a bit small although beautiful, so we asked if they had a bigger room. They gave us an upgrade (no charge) to a lovely room, much bigger and with a fabulous view of the Pantheon. We were delighted. The room service was superb. Clean linen/towels every day, bed prepared for sleeping each evening, fluffy towelling robes and towelling slippers and, on request, the housekeeper even provided us with tea-making facilities in our room (we are English!). However, what really makes this hotel an exceptional place to stay is the staff. We stayed for just under a week and we asked the reception staff for help every day about something! They are not only reception staff, they are tour advisers, restaurant advisers, shopping advisers (even what presents to buy for male relatives!); nothing seems to phase them at all. They are just lovely, all of them, not only on reception (although they are the people we most interacted with), but also the housekeeping staff and the breakfast room staff too; all warm, friendly, courteous and yet so very professional.

The breakfast buffet is fresh and has a good variety of meats, cheeses, bread and pastries, fruits, cereals, and scrambled eggs from which to choose. One can walk virtually to all major attractions from this site, and a taxi stand is across the piazza. The Pantheon is directly next to the hotel on Piazza del Roma. We had a room on the first floor that opened to the Piazza and an incredible view of the Pantheon. The windows are sound proof, and we never heard the noise from the Piazza. The piazza crowds disperse after 10 o'clock. Air conditioning is turned off in Oct., but the fresh air from the large windows kep our room comfortable. When we return to Rome, we will only consider this hotel. The rooms may be a little on the pricey side (we paid $310 per night), but worth the price for the location, beauty of the hotel, and helpfulness of the staff--the best quality 3 star we have ever experienced in Europe!", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver colorado", "Title": "\u201cBEST in Rome\u201d", "Author": "sjohn1210", "ReviewID": "UR84010465", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel the end of September through the first part of October, 2010.

Our only critisism would be that there is an indoor bar and a rooftop bar, and only one of these is open at any one time. On the first night, we went to the roof bar but I was a little too cold there and would have preferred to sit inside. This really is only a teeny tiny gripe - on other evenings I wrapped up more and we saw the fantastic skyline as the sun set.

There are so many restaurants to choose from here but we followed the excellent recommendations from Luca and Alessandra and would advise future guests to do the same. The only one we found for ourselves was the Cybo which is just off the Piazza Navona, you have to cross the square and go down the side street next to the Tre Scalini restaurant which is situated on the square itself. The food was fantastic, though not cheap but then nowhere is in Rome, but you know this before you go......! Piazza Navona is a great place to spend time in the evening, it's just so lively and buzzy with artists, street acts, living statutes etc. Some fantastic ice-cream bars, these are just everywhere in Rome and all excellent. Go on a diet BEFORE you go to Rome, the food is amazing and you will want to try everything. The hotel is so conveniently located within reasonable walking distance of the all the main attractions, although initially the open top tour bus is quite a good way to get your bearings. By the end of the weekend we had finally got to know exactly where we were going! Rome is an amazing city and a place where you just have to re-visit as apart from all the obvious sites to see there are so many other places to visit and it really is impossible to do all this in just one visit. I would also recommend buying tickets on-line to see the Vatican and Colesseum as the queues are SO long, As far as the Vatican is concerned make sure you buy a ticket for the basilica as well as the museum, I didn't realise that the tickets I had bought were only for the museum (Sistine Chapel) and the queue for St. Peter's was just so long and that I will save that for my next visit. I threw three coins into the Trevi Fountain so I will HAVE to come back! Next time though I will visit in early spring or early autumn as Rome is so crowded in summer and early September that it spoils viewing of all the major sites and it was also very hot, about 80 deg. F every day! If you're a cat person do visit the Cat Sanctuary at Argentina Square. It's run by a voluntary organisation who take in all stray and abandoned cats in an effort to reduce the amount of feral cats who are at risk of being killed or injured on the streets.

I also chose this hotel because it was advertised as having free wireless internet and safety boxes in each room. The photo on the hotel's website at the time of my booking showed a superior double with a full door to a walkout balcony/terrace. During my stay from July 31 to August 3, 2010 I stayed in Rooms 302 (for one night) & 605 (for 2 nights). Here is what we received in Room 605 for the same money that we DID NOT RECEIVE in Room 302: Room 605 had: *a balcony you could walk out on for a better view of the Pantheon & piazza *a comfortable double bed with nicer coverings (obviously newly renovated) *a safety box BOLTED DOWN to a secure cupboard *internet connection on the wall and wireless internet worked in this room *a coffee maker and supplies *a clock radio *a safety mat for the tub *his and her amenity kits in the bathroom We were very happy with Room 605 and this is what we expected for our full 3 nights at this hotel. A lot of our time was wasted on trying to get the internet to work & hooking up the unplugged tv in room 302. Also, when we went to lock our valuables in the safety box we noticed you could pick up the whole safety box and walk out the door with it. It was not bolted down. As, you can see we spent a lot of our long travel day dealing with these issues in Room 302, with no help from the front desk staff. I even asked if we could change rooms and was told \"no\" there was nothing in our category and would have to wait at least a couple of days to get the safety box bolted down, so we put our passports in the small safety box at reception and carried our laptop and other valuables around Rome with us. Our second morning we went back to the reception desk to make sure our concerns regarding the safety box and no internet in the room would be dealt with. The male desk clerk suggested we change rooms and he would call up to our room in 1/2 hour. He called and said nothing would be available in our category and I told him I was disappointed that I was not getting what the hotel advertised. He then called back in 15 minutes and offered us a move to room 605. I believe the hotel staff would have known that room 605 would become vacant by noon that day and could have assured us of a move when I talked to them earlier. We had a few other issues as well: In room 605- - the key card to the room did not work (another trip to front desk) - the internet code had expired after one day(another call down to get new code) - the plug was stuck in the tub almost causing a flood (maintenance man came 3 times during our 3rd day to fix the plug) As you can see, one Superior Double in this hotel is not equal to another. The management has some work to do. Having traveled extensively and having stayed in all types of hotels and categories we did not let this spoil our time in Rome; it was just aggravating and time consuming dealing with these issues that shouldn't have existed in such a highly rated hotel. The location was excellent & the included breakfast was good. The car service that picked us up at FCO for 55 euro arranged by the hotel was excellent.

We made our reservations in March of this year, but when we arrived on Friday of this week, found out that we were being placed on one of the only two floors that hadn't been renovated as yet. When shown to our room, we found rust on the sides of the bathtub, dirty wallpaper, blackened, dirty ceilings and gouged out, old furnishings. When I tried to use the bathtub, I had to call the front desk, as the knob to convert from shower to bath was stuck from age. We found holes in our sheets! We were disappointed to say the least. When we went to the management to complain, as we were paying premium rates for this room, we were told maybe something could be done tomorrow. In their defense, they did show us to a larger room, but in the same condition. It seems the renovated rooms were not to be available to us till perhaps the next day, and we could not face moving again. If you choose to stay in this hotel, be sure to ask for the renovated rooms.To compound the issues, the air conditioner was not working for almost two hours on a very humid, almost 90 degree day. Unfortunately, the air conditioner never worked correctly in the days we were there. As previous posts noted, the area is centrally located to everything, and very lively at night with large groups of teenagers gathering in the Pantheon square. As we were in the back of the hotel, we did not hear the noise, but if you take a front room, it will be noisy.

We had two rooms, which were basically identical except for differing, bad views. This was fair as we did not pay for \"view\" rooms. The pros: Fabulous location. The sleek, modern decor was a nice change from the over the top baroque-ness of previous hotels. The location was fabulous, right next to the pantheon and overlooking a busy square. Appreciated the free wi fi, access to Sky TV and the included breakfasts. The best thing of all, though, was the rooftop bar and Michele (sp?) who worked there. The views were phenomenal, we watched the sun set every night. Michele was more than friendly and patiently listened as we practiced (mangled) our rudimentary Italian. The cons: The lights and air condiditoning only work when you put your key into a slot when you open the room. This makes the room like a furnace when you return from a hot day of touring. We left one key in the slot one day to keep the room cool, the maids removed it and took the key! Also, the air conditioning only goes down so far, we had it set on the lowest and our room still was uncomfortably warm at night. Our bathroom sink had a steady leak, which was substantial enough to get the towels wet that were hanging in front of it, and wet the floor. We alerted the front desk the first day, but it was never fixed. One afternoon after a hot day of touring, I jumped into the shower and didn't notice until I was finished that they forgot to leave bath towels. So I went to use the hand towels in front of the sink... see above problem. Also, the modern doorways are elegant, but they must be literally slammed to close. The hallways are all wood, with no carpeting, and you hear every slam and footstep outside your door. but the worst was they were doing work on the hotel, started early in the a.m. and their equipment was kept right outside our window in a tiny courtyard. BANG BANG CLUMP... one morning I woke up to the smell of cigarette smoke as they were smoking outside the window and it drifted in (through the closed window, mind you.) And where were they working? The ladder was literally right in front of my sons' door. As teens, they usually sleep like the dead, but this was a little too much. Yes, we got a fab rate, and we did not pay for a room with a view. But unless the hotel was 100% full, I don't think these rooms should be occupied during such heavy maintenance. Also, although we were there five nights, I don't think the staff recognized us. One afternoon I came in and felt like the front desk guy was following me, making sure I wasn't a tourist going to use their bathrooms (Why are Italians so possessive about their bathrooms?) Again, I balance this against the fabulous rate and wonderful location, so I can't be too upset.

I think it was a big part of why we enjoyed Rome so much. I had sent the hotel an email when I booked the room asking if they could give us a room with a view of the Pantheon because it was our wedding anniversary and I wanted to surprise my husband since neither of us had been to Rome before. At the time, they said they could not accommodate us but when we arrived - guess what? They not only had a room with a view waiting for us (and we checked in quite early - 11 am or so) but also a bottle of champagne on ice! The whole stay really was quite magical. The hotel is right next to the Pantheon, see attached photos for a view of it and the square below from our room\u2013(taken from room #406). We could open the window, lean out and see everything going on in the square (including a movie being made, a Gaza protest with hundreds of protesters, etc). It was in a superb location so everything we wanted to see during our 3 days was within a half hour walk. The staff was very friendly, spoke excellent English, was extremely accommodating \u2013 even brought us a scale to weigh our luggage. The room was impeccably clean, and to top it all off they have a very quaint terrace bar on the rooftop. (It would have been nice if they had a bar/tables outside the hotel on the sidewalk as others do). They also served a very nice breakfast with freshly baked yummy pastries, sliced fruit, cereals, eggs, yogurt, cheeses, breads, meats, but get there early because they don't replenish the food once it's gone (at least they didn't appear to). They are a 3 star but are working on getting their 4 star certification. I\u2019m sure their prices will go higher when they get the 4 star rating but I thought it was reasonable in comparison to other hotels I reviewed \u2013 roughly $300 a night. I did have a problem charging my computer - the problem was likely my converter. It charged our cell phone just fine but not my netbook so I had to use the computer in their lobby (they have free internet if you have your own computer, otherwise you pay 3 Euros (roughly $4) for 30 minutes. A tip regarding restaurants in Rome - before you sit down ask the waiter if they charge a bread fee (not every restaurant charges a bread fee) and a service fee. If they say \"yes\" to the service fee, ask \"how much\" and whether or not that goes to the waiter or the owner. I thought I had asked all the right questions at one restaurant after being duped at others (one restaurant charged us 6 Euros ($8) for a couple pieces of bread that I didn't even eat) and although the restaurant said there was no bread charge but they did have a 10% service charge, I thought that would be fine since I would have left a 10% tip anyway but when we paid, the same guy then told us the service charge goes to the owner and they (the waiters) get nothing expecting me to then leave more money for him, which I did but I was not happy that it felt deceitful. Italians generally don't tip but I think they expect Americans to tip - I've read that 5-10% is appropriate. Great city. It was not \"just a big, dirty city\" as several people had told me before we left - I didn't get that feeling at all. I think it had everything to do with the location of Albergo del Senato.

I had picked this hotel due to the location, travel advisor ratings and that I fell in love with the Senario suite, which had a delightful 4 poster bed and original frescos on the ceiling. When we check in, we go to the top floor and it isn\u2019t the room that I had booked, instead we are in a Penthouse, with the best position in the hotel, right next to the Pantheon. When I finally enquire to why I don\u2019t have my requested room on the third floor, I am told that they are doing renovations. The room is the same price as the one I had originally booked, so I hadn\u2019t achieved a financial upgrade and as it\u2019s not the room I fell in love with on the internet, I am almost tempted to downgrade and go to a standard room but we don\u2019t and stick with this room due to the prime position it is in. The hotel is very lovely and located in a great piazza, which is easy walking distance to most of the sites in Rome. Breakfast at the hotel was very adequate. The lifts are tiny and really only fit 2 or 3 people and make sure you are patient, as they are not the fastest lifts on the planet. The roof top bar is a spectacular place to sit and chill, whilst looking over the rooftops of nearby Rome. The hotel is surrounded by cafes and restaurants. One night we walked to the opposite side of the Pantheon and found a caf\u00e9 which was full of locals all watching football. It had a great atmosphere and the food was even better than expected. Probably one of our least expensive meals in Italy but really enjoyed. We couldn\u2019t believe it would be so close to a main attraction without the high prices. Two small problems with our room. One, was that we had two TV\u2019s and neither worked at picking up the sky channels, which were really needed when we were watching the volcanic ash problems. The other was the spa bath. After a long day touring the Vatican, my feet were aching and I really longed for a spa. I hopped in and turned on the spa, only to get my thigh sucked hard against the spa. I screamed and quickly pulled away and rolled on my side but if I was to roll back down to be able to turn off the spa, I would have been sucked back onto the inlet. My husband quickly came in and worked out what was going on. When we drained the spa, we discovered that there wasn\u2019t a cover over the spa suction inlet, which resulted in me being quickly attached to the side of the pump. It might sound funny now but I ended up with a huge bruise the size of an orange on my thigh, not to mention the scare it gave me. If I had long hair it would have been sucked straight into the inlet, which can result in scalping or drowning. We called the manager and when he came to the room, he really couldn\u2019t work out what all the fuss was about. He was more interested in why our TV\u2019s weren\u2019t working rather than the dangerous spa. In the long run it was all handled adequately, resulting in our last nights stay being no charge, which when you consider that was about $400 Euro it was more than fair.

Everything we asked them for including local information was great. The room was really plush, cleaned every day and had a turn down service on an evening with slippers a little goodnight note and chocolates on the bed. All the facilities you would require in a room were provided. A very reasonable mini bar, bath robes, slippers, hairdryer a television and a great alarm clock. Overall a great hotel that I cannot fault at all. The balcony was full of floral plumes which were exceptionally kept. The breakfast was also extremely nice for a european city. Pastries, yougurts and lovely coffee to set you off on a morning. The taxi service was used from the hotel for our arrival and departure and this was as smooth as possible and at a reasonable rate. The hotel is in a perfect location with all the facilities you require. Its perfect walking distance to everything Rome has to offer.

Right outside the hotel's door, the Piazza del Rotonda is full of famous sights (see http://www.romeartlover.it/Vasi25.htm for a description) and all the legendary sights of Rome are an easy walk away ... The Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and of course the Ancient Roman Forum. Even The Vatican is walkable if you're fit. The hotel is also close to The Corso and all its shops. We had no trouble booking a front room via the internet. It was comfortable; had a bath and a safe; and looked right onto the Pantheon and the Piazza del Rotonda. It's big windows opened onto an excellent view (see photos) but thick curtains helped make it quiet at night. We loved it. The Albergo also welcomed us with an excellent breakfast room downstairs in the morning. It has an ancient fluted marble column in its centre, and a large selection of delicious food at one end. The Albergo staff are courteous and endlessly helpful (thank you Alex). Their advice was wise and their restaurant suggestions were invariably good. In short, we had a wonderful stay and heartily recommend the Albergo del Senato to all. It's in an old palace, with a tiny slow lift; but you'd have to be a real grump if you didn't enjoy these old touches in a city as old as Rome.

I had debated between the Albergo del Senato and the Britannia (where I stayed last time I was in Rome, and where I thought the room and the front desk staff were wonderful and where the rates were considerably lower for this visit). What made me decide to go with the Albergo Del Senato, was the location\u2026 more central and an easier base from which to explore the Centro Storico on foot. Most especially, the many restaurants and gelato shops in close proximity had virtually everything to do with the selection. I like being able to walk to dinner and then take a leisurely stroll back (with a stop for gelato, of course!) Positives: As everyone notes, this hotel has a fabulous location. You can (and we did) walk virtually everywhere you want to go in Central Rome (including the Vatican, where we walked on a gorgeous autumn day.) Our room had a view of the Pantheon, which I loved seeing from our window along with the Piazza della Rotunda. Being next to the Pantheon also made it easy to find our way back home each day. On the first two nights, we were serenaded by a band concert, held in front of the Pantheon -- quite delightful! The other big plus is the front desk staff, who are simply wonderful. They are smart, pleasant, helpful, have a sense of humor, and can handle a multitude of questions with ease. Mauro and Alessandra were the people with whom we interacted the most, but the guy on at night and Luca, who we met on the way out, were also excellent. Bravo to all of them! The hotel has free wifi and I was able to use the computer in our room. You need to get a code from the front desk first. There is a computer downstairs for guests, but it was often in use, and when my husband tried to use it one night, it didn\u2019t work at all. When he checked with the front desk, they tried to fix it, but to no avail. They let him use one of their computers to check his Email. The bathroom was well equipped and the shower worked well. We slept comfortably and were not bothered by noise from the Piazza della Rotunda or neighbors. The room and bathroom were kept clean. There are several newspapers available free to guests and among them was the International Herald Tribute. As noted, there are many excellent eating places in close proximity and several wonderful gelato shops are a quick stroll from the hotel. Two banks with ATM's were just across the Piazza and very convenient as well. Negatives: Our room was dingy and disappointing. Yes, we had a great view, and I liked being right at the top of the stairs on the story above the lobby so we could walk up and down without having to wait for the elevators, but the furniture was old and unattractive, the room was small even for a Roman hotel, and there was wood chipped around the door in the bathroom, which was also cramped. For the price and from other reviews, I expected a much nicer room with more luxury. Perhaps all of the other reviewers stayed in renovated rooms, but we didn't. The room was too hot. As is common, the heat was turned on, but there was no way for us to adjust it although there was a thermostat on the wall\u2026 it just didn\u2019t work. I asked for an extra bath towel and another pillow. ( I never can understand why some hotels supply only two pillows on the bed and one extra in the closet\u2026 so we can fight over it?) I did mention to the room attendant, who when bringing the extra pillow, also brought an extra blanket that it was hot and she said she would speak to the people downstairs, but the room stayed hot all weekend. The television had Fox News, which isn\u2019t news at all and no CNN, but they did have the BBC so we could check on what was happening in the world. When traveling, I like to watch CNN at least once a day if possible. The breakfast wasn\u2019t as good as other hotel breakfasts I have had in Rome. In particular, the orange juice was horrible and should have been fresh squeezed rather than from a can. The quality varied from day to day and could definitely be improved although there was good variety on the buffet.The buffet included cereals, ham and cheese, scrambled eggs, melon and grapes on the first day, but the fruit selection the rest of the weekend was not nearly as good), juices, toast, pastries, some sort of quiche, yogurt and oranges. We ordered cappuccinos from the waitress and ate enough to last until lunchtime. My husband loved the apricot tart served on Friday morning, and he wished he\u2019d left more room to eat several slices (on the other days there was a pastry, but it was never as good as this apricot tart.) Only on vacation do we eat dessert with breakfast!

None of us had been to Rome before but this hotel had been recommended by one of my friends whose mum and sister had stayed there previously so she booked it for us. I had no idea before our arrival where we were staying so got a lovely surprise when the taxi pulled up outside and I instantly spotted the stunning Pantheon in the Piazza Della Rotonda immediately opposite the hotel entrance. The beautiful piazza glowed with lights from the busy restaurants (with outdoor seating even in December!) and Christmas decorations - it was just magical. We were greeted at reception by Mauro who treated us like old friends and made us feel so welcome throughout our stay. Our room was perfect and overlooked the side street and the side of the Pantheon. It was clean, quiet and had everything we needed. Raffaello the hotel night porter kept us entertained after our evenings on the town and all of the staff we came into contact with were helpful and friendly. The hotel is perfectly situated for enjoying all of Rome's sights and things to do. We only took one taxi (to the Vatican as we were short on time and wanted to beat the queues - but we walked back afterwards!) and walked everywhere else. The Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and Piazza Navona are all within walking distance of the hotel and Rome is a very easy place to navigate your way around. When choosing restaurants, we found the lesser known places down the side streets served the best and most authentic food. Just a short walk behind the hotel is the beautiful church of San Ignazio (on exiting the hotel go left and then immediately left again up a side street until you come to the next piazza. The church is on the right hand side) One of Rome's hidden gems with a ceiling that to me seemed of equal merit to the one in the Sistine Chapel - a definite must see! If you are visiting the Vatican get there early. We arrived to find a HUGE queue outside the Vatican museum entrance and were fortunately approached by a rep who offered us a group guided tour that beat the queues and was well worth the \u20ac40 we paid. The normal museum entrance fee is \u20ac14 but I would still recommend seeing the Vatican this way. Our tour guide Stan was excellent - pleasant, funny, interesting to listen to and very passionate about art history and the Vatican. The tour was 2.5 hours long and included the Vatican museum, the Sistine Chapel and the Basillica de San Pietro. I think the company was called Tour In Rome.

I did write one and post when we first arrived back home the first week of July, 2008. For some reason, it did not post........so I am now going to try to recreate my review. Better late than never. We were a group of friends arriving in Rome on 2 different days. We arranged for transfers to our hotel with Rome Cabs. Both days the arrangements were flawless/perfect. From the minute they picked us up to the time they took us to our ship, it was a pleasure to deal with such a professional company........more later, below. We stayed at this wonderful small hotel in Piazza della Rotonda. Our lovely, large room, well appointed room overlooked the magnificent Pantheon. To us, this came to be known as \"OUR Piazza\"! This hotel provides a fabulous central location for a perfect stay in Rome. As is often said, \"When in Rome......\" We didn't want a modern, chain hotel. We wanted to experience the FEEL of living in Rome. This is exactly what we got. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. They serve a wonderful full breakfast each morning (included). We would choose Albergo del Senato again anytime! The next day all 6 of us shared a delightful FULL day with Stefano himself. Three of us had been to Rome before, the other 3 were Rome 'virgins'. Stefano packed in more important attractions than us 'vets' could ever have dreamed possible......then added in a few hidden gems of his own personal choice. We were amazed and very appreciative of his efforts. He even managed to get us to the top of Capitoline Hill that was closed to traffic.......saving us the climb. We were very grateful for that, as it gave us the magnificent view of the Forum.....a wonderful overlook. Mid-day, we had a scrumptious lunch at La Capricciosa, as prearranged by Stefano.......it could not have been more perfect. He even joined us for a cappuccino.....and our first limoncello.....the best of our entire trip, I might add. The afternoon was just as full of venues and surprises as the morning had been. Again, we were amazed at how MUCH we were seeing. Stefano really knows his magnificent city and how best to show it off to visitors........with a VERY personal touch. We felt as if we had known him forever. He shares what he loves about the city and what visitors expect to see........there is nothing 'canned' about his presentation. It's as if you were his long lost cousin from across the big pond and he just wanted you to see EVERYTHING! The next day he had arranged a guide for the Vatican Museum. In hindsight, though the guide was great for getting us passed the long lines, we all felt we would have seen the things that were most important to us if we had just done this on our own. That is no reflection on Rome Cabs ..... that's just the way it is when you have a guide. Now that we KNOW how it works, in the future we will just plan accordingly. We had also arranged for Rome Cabs to transport us to Civitavecchia to board our cruise on the following day. Much to our surprise and great delight, it was Stefano himself who showed up promptly at our hotel the following morning at the prearranged time. So we had another 1 1/2 hrs. of great conversation as we drove through the countryside to the port......and a little added surprise as a parting gift.....VINO! Now I can't say or guarantee whether that is done on a regular basis or if we were just VERY SPECIAL! ;) I am positive that Stefano's staff also provides a great experience......so no matter who is behind the wheel you are going to have a GREAT time and cannot go wrong with Rome Cabs. In October, 2009 other friends used their services, Marco was their driver. They had nothing but wonderful things to say about their day with him.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, AZ", "Title": "\u201cCan't imagine a better experience!\u201d", "Author": "billsinaz", "ReviewID": "UR51254320", "Content": "We planned a 4 night stay and wanted to see a ton of sites.

The front desk service was also very professional and attentive. Our main issue was the noise between the rooms, which isn't the fault of the hotel necessarily but still worth mentioning as an experience we had. There is noise from the piazza which is muted somewhat by the double glazed windows but you can still hear the activity outside - we live in NYC so we're used to street noise. Rooms that don't face the piazza will be far more quiet. What was more bothersome was the lack of sound-proofing between the rooms. We didn't really see many comments about this from the reviews which perhaps means others were less concerned with this aspect. We originally started off on the 3rd floor and then we were able to move to a suite in the top floor thanks to the terrific front desk staff so that definitely helped and we were very much appreciative of their assistance and understanding. Perhaps we had bad luck with the guests next to us, but we could hear a lot through the walls (this was also the case when we were in the 3rd floor room). I don't expect whisper quiet but I also don't expect to clearly hear other people moving around their rooms, opening drawers, etc. The hotel's location is great and we appreciated the help from the front desk staff during our stay to upgrade our room.

It's within walking distance of literally everywhere. On arrival the desk staff were absolutely polite and professional in every way. All front rooms look directly at the Pantheon. We stayed in one of the superior rooms on the top floor (number 604). It's expensive in comparison to other cities but after exhaustive research I realised it was actually middle of the road for Rome hotels. The room was very small (most in Rome are) but it was very well equipped and absolutely spotless with a very comfortable bed. Small bathroom too but as with the bedroom it was immaculate. I had one problem while there when the key card for the room didn't work, I went down and told them at the desk and they literally tripped over each other to get the problem fixed which was done in about 20 minutes. The breakfast (included in the price) is simple and adequate, don't expect a big lavish affair, they provide cereals, toast, pastries, sliced meats, cheese, yoghurt etc etc, nothing cooked at all. The coffee is surprisingly bad for Rome so wait till after your breakfast to get one in the many cafe's beside it. The bar downstairs is tiny and again adequate to sit and have a beer and read. The piazza outside is brilliant at night for food (expensive but good quality) and watching Italian life go by, every night there were different singers and buskers who were excellent but not in your face trying to get money off you.

The breakfast room downstairs was great, but bringing up a tray of coffee and pastries to have on the balcony each morning quickly became a habit I dearly miss. The view of the Pantheon from the balcony was insane. Watching the piazza della rotunda fill up with people every morning and clear out late at night was great. The fountain was always our first stop before heading out on our daily sight seeing adventure. Since it was August, having a full water bottle was a necessity. Make sure you go up to the roof top for cocktails. Watching the sun set from that view is amazing. The food from the restaurants on the piazza is fine and well worth the view and people watching.

There is a mini bar in the room which was a nice touch but to be honest we walked to the bearby 'de spar' and bought the odd bottle of beer which was really cheap as nastro azzurro (peroni to you and me) was expensive in the bars and restaurants. Rome can be enjoyed on a budget even in this current economic climate! Look out for Goilitti's which is a meeting place a couple of streets away from the hotel which serves the best ice cream and ice cream type desserts ive ever tasted.

The location is excellent - next to the Pantheon, in the middle of Rome's historic center. You step out of the hotel and you are in the middle of the action.

If you get bored with this Piazza, Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain and other touristy places are just few blocks away. We only took a cab to the Vatican, otherwise we walked everywhere. Each time we stayed at Albergo del Senato, we asked for a room with a view of Pantheon and were fortunate to receive it. Despite of all the crowds at the Piazza, the rooms are quiet when you close the windows. The rooms are cozy, not very large, but spacious enough. Nicely furnished, clean, with flat screen TV (I think with satellite \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, I don\u2019t watch TV when I go to Italy).

The bathrooms are on the small side (although quite standard for hotels I guess), but very pretty and clean, marble I believe (or something that looks very much like marble); they even have towel warmers. And the water pressure is FANTASTIC! I wish we had that water pressure at home. The breakfast room is beautiful with the usual for Italian hotels breakfast \u2013 bread rolls, cold cuts, cheese, frittata, quiche, tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, cereals, pastries (fresh, still warm and yummy), etc. The people working in this hotel are wonderful.

At the price point of this hotel, which was the most expensive of our whole trip, I expect a spectacular experience not one in which I needed to change rooms once, and would have a second time had I had the energy to pack up again. Let me say that the people in this hotel are unfailingly lovely and the atmosphere is luxurious and pleasant, but our rooms? Not so much. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a junior suite with a fabulous view over the Pantheon. However, the beds were lumpy and tiny and in making room for a small anteroom, the designer stole space from both the bathroom, which was miniscule and the bedroom, which was also small. The final problem though was the sub-standard air-conditioning, which in Rome's August heat, just didn't cut it. Since our second room also had the air-conditioning problem, I finally figured out what the issue was -- both the vents and the thermostat are in the hallway, which is pleasantly cool, but that cool air doesn't make its way into the room itself. The lovely hotel manager got us a fan, for our second room, which helped alleviate the problem somewhat. Though our second room was quite large, as was the bathroom, the tiles on the wall of the shower had pulled away, and what was left was a poor attempt to repair the area as well as what looked to be a good crop of mildew. It was a real turn off. The wall facing the shower in the bedroom also had signs of water damage. The manager assured us that these rooms were going to be renovated this year, but that didn't help us or make our stay any more pleasant. Also, the beds in this room were very boingy, and desperately in need of replacement, as they had been in the first room. I understand that the top floors have been renovated, so I would assume that this is where you want to be if you stay at this hotel. Also, though the hotel had free internet, the signal was frequently non-existent and really only worked well from the lobby since our room was in the back of the hotel.

We couldn't even get a chair to fit for the desk , since it left no room to walk past it on the way to the bathroom.

My husband is tall and thin - he is 6'8. Due to reviews, this was my number one pick based on location alone and it was better than expected!! Our room was on the third floor and overlooked Piazza del Rotunda and the Pantheon!! The noise from the square didn't travel too far and never prevented us from getting sleep. The bed was bigger than an American queen but smaller than an American king - my husband had no problem fitting! Space was limited, but it all the major necessities (a/c, private bathroom with shower and bath, safe in closet, minifridge) - what more could one ask for? The week we were there, our tour guide said Rome was in an unusual heat wave (our room stayed very cool - so no problem with the a/c). Being from Texas, we thought they were crazy! Yes, it was hot as you were walking around in the sun, but it was very bearable and crossing the street and walking in the shade solved that problem! For us, the weather was perfect! We had a bottle of champagne waiting when we returned to our room on our first day. I can't say enough about their complimentary breakfast. Cheeses, meats, fruit, cereals, oatmeal/grains, eggs, breads. It was quite enjoyable - even for an American! I didn't have their coffee because the Italians are known for their cappucinos - and they were great! The staff was beyond exceptional. We started and ended each night on the roof top terrace. Words cannot say how beautiful the view was!! Our last night there we wanted to splurge on a nice restaurant. The front desk called a couple of restaurants, asked about wait time and made a reservation for us at the location that had the shortest wait! By the time we arrived (5 minutes) our table was ready! We did take advantage of the market (small grocery store) around the corner. We bought two large bottles of water there our first day and then continued to refill them at all of the aqua-ducts that are scattered across the city.

We also booked private tours of the main sites we wanted to see (Vatican and Ancient Rome) and after seeing what it COULD have been like without it, are so glad we spent the extra money - it made Rome so much more personal! Whether you need information regarding a cab, tour, cheap or expensive local cuisine, exchange booths, wine, etc the staff was the first place we went and got all of our answers! Cleaniness, service, location, amenities truly were fantastic. We are already planning a return to Rome next year with family and have already told everyone we know that we will be staying here!! We did take two cab rides while there and each time we spent less than 9 euros, including tip - so I think we lucked out with not being \"taken\" by either one of our cab drivers.

The room itself was not large, but not tiny as many European hotel rooms are. We had a good 5 feet between the bed and the closet on one side and about four feet between the bed and the window on the other. That side had a nice love seat and a chair. There were two nice size night stands and a dresser that had one side occupied by the mini bar and the other opening to a compartment with a single shelf. There were some shelves in the closet, but no drawers. The safe in the closet was a good size and easy to use. The bathroom was a bit tight - but not bad. Toilet, bidet, single sink. The tub was a tad narrow but typical of others i've had in Italy. Shower was in the tub- great water pressure and temperature. The terrace on the roof is accessed via stairs from the 6th floor and was very pleasant - still a tad cold at the beginning of May but very nice while the sun was still out. The absolutely best feature of this hotel is the location - right on the Piazza de la Rotunda with the Pantheon. It was the perfect location for walking to all the places we enjoy such as Piazza Navonna, Campo di Fiori, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps. The first morning we walked to the Vatican - it really wasn't that far and we took our time. A totally pleasant walk through the streets of Rome as everything was starting to open for the day. The front desk staff at the Hotel were wonderful and very helpful. The Bartender was very accomodating.

The main shopping road is about 10 minutes walk away. Its quite a good idea to invest in an A to Z road map of the area if you are doing a lot of walking as there are so many little side streets they are not always marked on the normal maps. The best restaurants we found were across the river in Trestavere, with some quite memorable meals taken at half the price of the restaurants on the Piazza. If you want to go a bit further afield the trams and buses are quite an easy option, and of course the main line station at Termini.

All major sites are in easy walking distance in all directions. (Be warned. Wear flat shoes as streets are cobble stones and not easy for heels).The Pantheon really is in the centre of tourist Rome and you could not get a hotel any nearer to this beautiful building. The hotel faces the square and is ideal for people watching and soaking up the atmosphere. The area is also safe for late night strolling or window shopping etc ( not all areas of Rome have felt this safe in the late evening). The buzz of activities in the square does not affect your stay as the noise is not a problem in the hotel. -------Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a problem with a leak in our bathroom one night and we were given a free upgrade to a suite with a balcony and an even better view of the Pantheon! We also received a free bottle of champagne and nibbles. (It's a shame we didn't have the leak earlier in our stay!) Our previous room was 307 and was also a good room. The rooms are adequate. They are on the small side but not too small. Shower and bath and constant hot water. Rooms were kept spotless and the beds were turned down and chocolates left every night. The rooms were always warm as some nights were extremely cold during this visit. ----- Eating out is no problem with so much choice. Eating on the square is the most expensive but each side street has lots of cheap restaurants. There is a coffee shop called Tazzo d'oro just around the corner which has an international reputation for good coffee. And it was good!!! You can also buy cheap Pizza and eat as you walk if you don't want a sit down meal. This only costs a few Euros. The hotel breakfast is good although the coffee was not the best that we have had in Rome. -------Travel to and from the airport is also not a problem. You can use the buses as mentione by other tripadvisor members, but we prefer to use a taxi. The travel time from the airport is about an hour and the traffic can often be awful. The price is about 55 Euros(one way) but if there are a few of you travelling it is not too expensive and the convenience is worth the cost. The hotel can also provide the taxis at about the same price. We find it better to pay out for the taxis as once you are at the hotel, eating out can be cheap and travel is zero Euros! -----Viator tours are good. By far the best ones we have taken are the angels and demons tour and the underground Rome tours ( both taken last year) ----- Tourist attractions. All are obviously good depending on your preferences. We were not impressed to find that you now have to pay to go into the forun. The entrance has also been moved and the free guides are a thing of the past. (12 Euros) One surprise for us this year was the \"birthday cake\" or Victor Emmanuelle monumnent. We ahve walked around this a number of times and never thought to climb the steps but it really is worth a visit. You can get a lift to the top (7 Euros) for paoramic views of Rome. There is a cafe on the sun terrace , also with good views and access to yet another church ( a very interesting one) and also access to the square on the capitaline hill ( with small statue of Romulus and Remus) ---- Lastly!!!

My tips:Central location so you can walk everywhere Good shoes because you walk everywhere See the Pope sunday at 12 to 12.30 in St Marks square Check vatican museum opening times so you dont miss it Take the lift in Basillica you may save 2 euros but there's anoher 320 steps after ( You must go to the top) Check out bus numbers before you go to Rome or get a map asap No need to book the Terravion bus the normal shuttle bus is 4 euro cheaper Throwing coins in Trevoli fountain is great fun day and night Spanish steps not worth a diversion for Shops open after 5pm sunday! Corso ( main street) very busy then Someone said you are either a quick pedestrian or a dead one in Rome ...the mopeds seem to have right of way Colosseum much better than rest of ancient city but ticket gets you both. Watch for orange trees in the ancient city if you have strength to walk around it. We didn't think much of Campo de Fiori square and market (also its closed as a market on sunday). Don't appear too keen to go into a street restaurant..we were given a free bottle of wine one day and a free course the next. Spare a few coins for the street musicians (or those on the Metro) the atmosphere added by them is awesome Bus transfer coaches stop at each side of Termini not in the bus station at the end Cheapest way from Ciampini if you only have hand luggage is to catch bus from Airport to Ciamponi Station for 1.2 Euro then the local train to Termini 2 euro. Only snag was trying to work out the train platform (be brave and ask) as the train board gives you the times of every station stop of the next train not a list of coming trains as it is in uk We also went to watch soccer at the Olympisc stadium and saw Lazio lose 3 to nil to David Beckhams AC Milan. if you go walk to Flamimi ( about 25 mins) then tram 2 to Mancini where you can see the stadium 10 mins walk over the river) .

Fortunately Expedia had the hotel on their system and whilst we normally book 4star, I was so pleased we booked this 3star wonder. Our flights were cancelled going out on Saturday due to the fog, but we managed to get out on Sunday instead, our first thought was we couldn't believe how central the hotel was, you never quite believe descriptions that say they are near a certain attraction, but this really is as close to the Pantheon as you can get. It's my partners favourite building so made the trip even more of a success. When we arrived, the staff were so welcoming and sympathetic about our cancelled flight, we were taken straight to our room. I couldn't believe our luck when we got a room overlooking the pantheon - room 103. It was a small, but stunning room, clean, well furnished and just the best view in Rome. I was quite hot in the room as the air conditioning is turned off during the winter but despite the cold air outside, it was still very hot, so we left the windows open over night and luckily we didn't get too disturbed by the morning rush. One fellow writer on here talks about the beds and I would have to say that I agree, the beds are hard and can be a little uncomfortable, but having said that, the room was really great.

The bathroom was also unusually large. 2. Breakfast- A large breakfast buffet was included in the room rate and offered the usual assortment of pastries, bread, yogurt, cheese, eggs, cereal, fruit and coffee/tea. The breakfast room itself was an ornate baroque style room that was picturesque. 3. Location- One of the huge draws of the hotel is its location directly facing the Pantheon piazza which, of course, is in the center of town. There are plenty of cafes surrounding the Pantheon so the area had a lively atmosphere but as our room faced a back courtyard, it was not noisy. 4.

It was never too full that we could not get a table at sunset and there was a good selection of cocktails and wine on offer. 5. Staff- The staff were multi-lingual, patient and very helpful. Yes, the elevator was small and yes there was a charge to use the internet (5 euros for 30 minutes) but I think this is very typical for Europe and so neither thing bothered me. I was very pleased with the hotel and would definitely like to stay there again the next time I am in Rome!", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cThe staff made us feel at home\u201d", "Author": "HodyPeel", "ReviewID": "UR20738947", "Content": "My wife and I and the couple we were traveling with loved this hotel.

In fact, our window faced the piazza which gave us a breathtaking view of the Pantheon, which was absolutely amazing. The best thing about this hotel is the location. In the heart of Rome, you are a short walk away from every major attraction in Rome, including the Coliseum, the Roman Forum, the Vatican, the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, etc. When staying here, you are also very close to many restaurants and shops, as well as near Piazza Navona and Campo de Fiori. The next best thing about the Albergo del Senato is the staff. We found them to be both friendly and extremely helpful, and they also do a good job of keeping non-guests out of the hotel, which was nice to see given the amount of people that hang out in the piazza. The room itself was also quite nice. We stayed in a suite, and although it was not as nice, or a big, as I expected based on the photos on the website, it was still a nice size room and a good value for the price. They had Sky TV, which enabled us to have 3 English speaking stations (Fox, Sky World, and CNN), which was 3 more than we had during the rest of our stay in Italy. The bed was a little stiff, but comfortable nonetheless. The main complaint I would have about this hotel was the lack of Internet connectivity in the room. Unless I overlooked it, I didn\u2019t see any way of accessing the Internet, except for a computer in the main lobby, which was 5 Euros for about an hour of time. I also didn\u2019t notice any wireless networks available in the room. However, these complaints were insignificant when you consider the location, quality of hotel and room, and friendliness of staff. In addition, there is almost nothing better than to open you window to the sights and sounds of Piazza della Rotunda and enjoy all of this from your hotel room. I highly recommend you book early and request a room facing the piazza. Also, they offer personal transportation from the airport for just slightly higher than the normal cab fare. I also recommend you take advantage of this feature, as it is a good way to kick start a vacation in one of the best cities in the world.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cJust okay\u201d", "Author": "Napalover1", "ReviewID": "UR20376452", "Content": "Not sure what all the fuss is about.

The front desk staff was very kind, as we very much appreciated their maps for us. Their dinner (and gelato) recommendations were right on. The hotel's terrace provides remarkable views. And the location cannot be beat. It was an easy walk to: The Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Piazza del Polpolo, Piazza Navona, The Vatican, etc. The hotel was even kind enough to direct me to the closest hardware store when my curling iron over circuited and quit working. The A/C was awesome (and believe me in August it was very hot outside), although in the evenings we enjoyed falling asleep with our balcony doors opened listening to the musicians down below performing. Does it get any better than that? To see the Pantheon Square full of people in the evening and then to see it deserted in the early morning was a wonderful comparison. I would not hesitate to stay at Albergo del Senato again. My only complaint; they were not quick to respond to my emails before hand.

Taxis? Never used them beyond getting to and from the airport, this location is so central. Noise from the piazza? Delight to Puccini sung in the Piazza in the evening. Who can complain? Service? Just fine - unobtrusive, professional, and helpful when needed. Breakfast? Also, just fine while nothing special. If you don't like the coffee, just go around the corner to get what might be some of the best coffee in Rome. You can say the same for the excellent Gelateria just up the street. The rooms are compact but serviceable. The triples are towards the back so you don't get views of the Pantheon from your window, but you can get that out the front door or from the roof top terrace in the evening.

The only reason it's not #1 on Tripadvisor is that the Albergo del Senato has many more reviews than some of the smaller lodgings ranked higher but not as good. Fellow Tripdvisor users should know the following: 1. The Albergo del Senato is located on a wonderful cobblestoned square full of life - you can relax watching it all from your room or the rooftop bar while the charismatic barman Michele serves you drinks. 2. As a previous review stated, you are ideally located in the centre of Rome's wonderful sights - the longest walk is the Vatican 20 minutes away. 3. Our room was bigger and more modern than the mostly-disappointing rooms in Europe - and unlike most, it has great air con! 4. The front office staff including Salvatore are expert in where to go and what to do - all with a smile and good English. 5. A better-than-continental breakfast is included in a beautiful breakfast area that includes a typical Roman pillar. 6. Any visit to Rome should include a visit to one of the wonders of the world - the Sistine Chapel with Michelangelo's mind-blowing tribute to God. Whether you're religious or not, this is truly inspiring. Photos inside aren't allowed, so go see it.

There was a heat wave in Rome last week, and the air conditioning was virtually inoperative despite several efforts by the staff to fix it. Our daughters had problems with their air conditioning also. Their unit leaked constantly and a maintenance man finally came and drained a bucket of sludge out of it. The staff were generally proficient and gracious--expecially in the breakfast room and housekeeping. Our room was cleaned beautifully each day by a pleasant and diligent housekeeper. The roof top bar offers great views and great drinks.

I strongly recommend paying for a guided tour of The Vatican and St Peter's as you miss so much without one, and Eugene, our guide, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. A word of warning though, we paid to go to the Coliseum on one day and The Vatican the next, without realising that if you do the Vatican first with one of the many tours offered, you get admission to the Coliseum and Forum included and many guides will offer a free tour too! We paid far more than we needed to on attraction tickets as a result. We did find the food and drink a little expensive (not helped by a poor exchange rate) approx 5 euro for a beer or coffee!

Chocolates with next day's weather (cloudy or sunny without temperature indication) left on bed with turn down service. The breakfast was mediocre.

Two types of meat (salami and ham) and one type of sliced cheese, rolls, cereal, yogurt, scrambled eggs and some pastries. I know that the Italians don't have huge breakfasts but considering it is a hotel and the cost of the rooms, they could increase their effort in this area. I've had much better breakfasts at hotels that are much cheaper than the Senato. The staff is friendly but nothing extraordinary. One of the restaurants they recommended ripped us off - l'Angoletto - so, if the hotel doesn't book a table for you directly, beware (though the food was good). They booked us a limo to the airport on our last day and said that they take credit card, but once we reached the airport, the driver said that it was impossible to pay with card, so my husband had to run inside the airport to find an ATM.

As for the hotel itself, the reception and lobby are fantastic and the rooms are beautifully furnished and during our entire 3 night stay, immaculately clean. The facilities are as you would expect in a good hotel with minibar and a small bar downstairs. Unfortunately, the rooftop terrace was not open during our stay but given the location, i'm sure its brilliant. The staff were super friendly, helpful and completely genuine and most of them had better English than me! I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and although i've been to most of the big European cities including London and Paris, this is the best hotel i've came across so far.

The breakfast was good compared to many that I have had in Europe. One of the complaints on Trip Advisor about the hotel is the lack of a restaurant in the hotel hay this is no problem because with a 2 block radius of the hotel are dozens of excellent restaurants with beautiful sidewalk dining. The hotel was within fairly easy walking distance of the major tourist attraction including the Coliseum and the Vatican. We simply walked everyplace we wanted to go. Once you get your bearings and with the help of a small map we no problem finding our way around historical Rome, after all getting lost once in a while is all part of the fun. Across the Plazza from the hotel on a corner is a grocery store where we were easily able to buy all of the wine and cheese we wanted and any other things such as diet coke we needed.

The hotel was loaded with American families, but nice ones (!) so our interactions with other hotel guests were also surprisingy pleasant. I can not say enough nice things about this hotel and I hope I never have to stay any place else when I return to Rome! Note: My husband used a travel agent and she was fine, but for our trip I booked one hotel directly and one through Orbitz or something and both of those were fine - so my advice is to skip the travel agent if you can.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cFabulous location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "LAtravellers_7", "ReviewID": "UR10989585", "Content": "The Del Senato is located about 50 feet from the Pantheon!

First, after reading Trip Advisor, I decided to splurge on this centrally located hotel in Rome. I contacted the hotel by their email address and recieved a reply email within 24 hours. If you can't find the email address, google the hotel name and it will come right up. Since we were traveling in November, I asked what their best discount rate would be. They booked my wife and I for four nights in a double room overlooking the Pantheon for 195 Euro per night. Now, don't get me wrong, 300 bucks a night (euro = $1.50!!) is not normally within my budget, but this place was worth it. We arrived at 10 PM. The hotel is on the same square as the Pantheon, a massive structure built in 27 BC. The hotel is beautiful from the outside and faces the square. We checked in to room 206, a double room with a queen sized bed. Upon opening our window we had a truly remarkable view of the Pantheon some 40 feet away. Really, unbelievable. For those of you wanting a room with a view of the square and the Pantheon, I spent some time with the front desk figuring out what rooms were which. Essentially, rooms 202 through 207 are rooms on the floor I stayed on with a view of the square and the Pantheon. The front desk advised that each of the five floors had rooms of the same type stacked upon one another. (ie room 206 and 306 and 406 and 506 are all double rooms) As such rooms 302-307, 402-407, etc will be rooms that look out on the square and the Pantheon. Room 204 had a balcony right on the square!! I was a bit envious. Room 207 and 202 were junior suites that had two rooms each. The hotel is a 3 star hotel. I don't understand why though. I would rate it at a 4, closer to a five that to a three. The room was not large but not small. It had a queen bed with a nightstand on either side. It had a TV that got CNN and 25 other Italian channels. It had a closet that contained a safe. It had a very nice bathroom with a tub/shower, a toilet and a bidet. The entire building was bright and clean and nicely upscale. Breakfast was included in our rate (as were taxes, etc.). Breakfast consisted of breads, meats, cheeses, coffee, cappicino to order (no fee), eggs, cereal, fruit juices, and other items. Newspapers were available for free oustide of the breakfast area. Breakfast was good and clean. We started each day off with a big breakfast that lasted well into the afternoon. The staff at the hotel could not have been friendlier. They provided us with all sorts of advice that made our trip nicer. The front desk has maps of Rome and many suggestions for good food, a grocery store location, etc. Luca even made sure we had a cab to pick us up as we left for the airport at 3 AM!. The hotel is centrally located. Across the street from the Pantheon. 20 minute walk to the Colliseum and the forum. Ten minute walk to the Trevy Fountains. Fifteen minute walk to the Spanish Steps and shopping on the exclusive boulevard in front of it. 10 Euro cab ride (less than 10 minutes) to the Vatican. Truly a great location. Any review would not be complete without a discussion of any negatives. So, here goes. The bed was hard and I couldn't figure out how to adjust the heat. (It was warm in our room and no I didn't ask) That's it! No more negatives. If I ever am lucky enough to visit Rome again, I will stay at the Hotel Del Senato. It is worth the splurge. Oh, you can also check out live pictures of the square (Piazza) on their web cam located on the roof of the hotel. It is on their website. I hope this review helps others plan and have a great trip to Rome. Rolf T.

The staff were exceptional in helping us plan and spoke exceptional Englsih and always gave time. Breakfast was good as it goes in Continental Europe, we enjoyed it anyway, there is no restaurant but across the square in a side street is a brilliant restaurant which I booked a table and was glad as it heaved with locals as well as tourists.

We booked for 5 nights and had only booked the week before so weren't expecting the best room naturally and so we weren't disappointed. It was at the back overlooking an inner well and with a generator outside which was ok if you didn't open the window. They were nice enough to give us a bowl of fruit in our room, however, as it was our anniversary and I felt the staff were trying very hard. The hotel does have it's pluses: a roof terrace bar with wonderful views, helpful staff, a central position and bright ,elegant decor (even if the marble is imitiation, and on closer inspection, you feel it's been done on the cheap). Another plus, this hotel is not far from Giolitti's the fantastic ice-cream parlour..I highly recommend this, especially the Pompelmo Rosa (Pink grapefruit) which is not easy to find elsewhere! However, the rock hard beds made our lives a misery and I didn't get one full nights sleep, tossing and turning, then awaking every morning with aching hips even though I folded a spare blanket into 4 lengthways and put it between myself and the mattress. I had noted that someone else on here had complained about the beds but felt it was worth the risk as it might have been a one -off. I was wrong! I felt permanently tired throughout our stay as a result. The breakfast looked good, but the rolls (poor quality for Italy) and croissants felt tired as if they were yesterdays left overs on three mornings. The coffee was the worst I've ever had anywhere, it was like dark brown water. We asked for stronger coffee and it was marginally stronger so I opted for tea after that. The fruit salad on offer was all tinned (except for one morning when it was finely chopped fruit) and the fruit juices were all with added sugar, so I had to give them a miss as I'm marginally diabetic and on the last morning, when I tried it again I'll swear it was an orange 'drink' rather than juice. There was scrambled egg avaliable, but was positioned almost behind the counter as if you weren't encouraged to have it and it was rather unappetising to look at ,though fine to taste. The staff were very efficient at clearing away, almost too much so, and in view of the other 'economies' it made me wonder if they had enough crockery to go round! We should have eaten breakfast out on reflection, especially as the 'best coffee in the world' at Tassa D'Oro is just round the corner. The nearby cafes are not cheap, being opposite a top tourist attraction. Strangely we didn't find many places to buy a snack or sandwiches around the Pantheon, you really had to search, though there were plenty of restaurants, so this didn't immediately spring to mind as it might have done in, say, Venice. There is a supermarket nearby off the other side of the piazza, which is handy for picnic food, though it's sandwiches were rather boring. On this trip we felt on the whole that there was an air of economy, not just at the hotel, but at the restaurants we chose, good food certainly, but not very much of it unlike other holidays we'd had in this city when the Romans seemed generous. We'd heard from a cab driver that Romans were feeling the pinch and were rueing the loss of the Lira in favour of the Euro, so perhaps that explains it. All this hotel needs is better beds and a better breakfast to make it work.

We booked a Junior Suite and were given Room 215 (on the third floor in the US) which is on the right corner of the hotel closest to the Pantheon. Being on the corner meant we had three windows in the suite. Since the weather was so nice, we opened all three during the day and it was wonderful. The room was beautiful with fabric walls, wood floors, high decorative ceilings and comfortable furniture. The room and the hotel are meticulously clean and very well maintained The layout of the suite had one room which was a nice entry/dressing room area with a small couch, a great marble bath and the beds in the main room. The views of the piazza and the Pantheon were outstanding. The roof bar (manned by Michele) was open and we had pre-dinner cocktails up there several times. The breakfast was very good, especially the scrambled eggs. All of the staff were fantastic, especially Mauro at the desk. The only minor problem we encountered was with the AC/Heat controls. Apparently, there is a cut-off if the windows are opened (a very good idea), but when the windows are closed, it appears that the thermostat in the room does not work and the system is either on or off as directed by the front desk. There is a card in the room which says the temperature can be controlled by the thermostat, but ours just flashed weirdly during our stay. The engineer who initially came to the room told us the system was controlled from the front desk. It did get a little chilly on one night, but we were too exhausted from running all over Rome to involve the desk. Not a big problem, but maybe those cards should be pulled from the rooms and a better explanation of the system given to the guests. Aside from all the great qualities of the Senato mentioned in other reviews (all true, too), we found the best thing to be the perfect location. A few blocks to the west is the Piazza Navone. To the south, the Forum, Largo Argentina and the Piazza Campo Fiore. The Corso and the Fontana di Trevi are a few blocks to the east. Finally, to the north, is the Altar of Peace, Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps. And there are great places to eat everywhere. We walked all over the place. I have got to go back to Rome, and when I do, I will definately stay at the Albergo del Senato! A wonderful hotel in a wonderful location! BTW, every restaurant at which we ate was very good, except for an unfortunate experience at Fortunato right up the street. (sorry, Rick Steves!)

From the moment we arrived with all of our many bags of luggage to the arranging of the two taxis to take us to our next destination, it was absolutely wonderful. The front desk staff was extremely helpful with all our myriad of questions. (Although they will not cash any travelers checks -even in Euros). We booked a triple room and as that room was not available yet in the early morning when we arrived, arranged two rooms for us so that we could crash immediately at no extra charge. It was always so easy to tell the taxi drivers where to take us- we'd just say take us to the Pantheon. Almost everything is within walking distance but, it was HOT. The Pantheon--what can I say - so amazing to see it (almost touch it) from our open window at all times of the day and night with the lovely Piazza below. It was never too noisy to sleep with the shutters and windows closed and the wonderful air conditioning (it was extremely hot in August). The breakfats were just right for us to begin our heavy days of sightseeing and the drinks on the roof a welcome respite at the end of our days. We never tired of the views up there. The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms very roomy by European standards. They arranged a pick up at the airport for us and that was perfect too. The driver gave us a wonderful tour of the city on the way to the hotel. You will not be disappointed staying here. Tips: there is a wonderful restaurant behind the hotel called Miscellanea recommended by Rick Steves- be sure to ask for the \"sexy wine\". Get your tickets for Palantine hill in the Roman forum area they are good for the Colliseum as well and then you skip the ticket line there ( very long). Be sure to get a copy, or just look through one, of the Rome then and Now- very interesting. Try to climb the dome of St. Peters- absolutely stunning views of the city from up there.

Our stay was all right, nothing more. I booked in early February, explaining that I wanted three beds in two rooms for myself, my wife and 11-year-old daughter. I settled for a junior suite at 340 Euros (about $510) a night. Closer to the time I contacted the hotel to book a car to take us in from the airport for 55 Euros because I did not want to be tackling the Fiumicino taxi ranks after crossing the Atlantic overnight. This worked out fine. The main advantage of this hotel is its excellent location. The Pantheon is in the very centre of the city and you can walk to pretty much everywhere you'd possibly want to inside 30 minutes. Only when I read the guidebooks did I realise that the Pantheon is also known for its night life. In fact, the noise from the square wasn't a problem with the windows closed. Shame the same couldn't be said for the room. We were put into Room 102 at the front of the hotel. It had a very noisy air conditioning fan and we asked how we could turn it off. \"You can't. It has to be done from the reception,\" was the answer. The first night the system in both rooms worked the way it was supposed to, coming on intermittently. But on the second night the fan in the smaller room (with one bed) ran the whole night. We complained, they sent up a technician, who told us the fan ran the whole time. This was patently not true. The fan ran throughout the night the second night too. In some ways this was a blessing, because it helped drown out the noise from the bar below. That's right -- despite booking SIX months in advance, despite telling the hotel we had a young child, they chose to put us in the one room that was right above the bar. The thump thump of the music went on till midnight. When I complained about the air conditioning the receptionist knocked a token 20 Euros off the nightly rate. The staff were generally helpful, the breakfasts were OK, the laundry was delivered on time, the rooftop bar was absurdly overpriced.

I thought it would be too close to the constant tourist traffic. As it turned out, I thought it was the perfect location. Noise was never a problem and It put us within walking distance of everything. 5 minutes to Piazza Novona, Spanish Steps 15 minutes, Vatican 20 minutes, Trastavere 15 minutes, Colloseum 15 to 20 minutes. We have done a fair amount of traveling (Paris, New York, Munich) and I like a certain comfort level. I fully recommend Albergo del Senato.

At night the roof-top lounge has breathtaking views and excellent service. The hotel's excellent location is within walking distance from most sites. The staff at Albergo are exceptional! They booked a car to and from the airport (55eu each way) and after a 9 hour plane ride allowed us early check-in. Mauro was especially helpful, he recommended and reserved great places for dining. We loved \"Armando\" al Patheon near the hotel. A quaint family run trattoria with an excellent server, Fabiana, who found humur in my husbands poor attempts to speak Italian. Mauro also facilitated the purchase of a Leonardo D'Aniello ring I saw in the hotel curio.

There was a variety of baked goods, fresh fruits, cereals, etc. And again, the staff was very pleasant and efficient. We walked everywhere, even to the Galleria Borghese.

Tip: if you want to eat on the hotel square the restaurant directly opposite next to the 'salami' shop is good for a lunchtime snack, and salami shop is also good). WHAT ABOUT THE LOCATION: Over the next few days we walked to most of the main attractions from the hotel without the need of taxis - stopping on route for drinks and coffees, the Vatican is about a thirty minute walk and the Colloseum-Forum the same (both of which are the furthest you will ever need to walk), Trevi fountain, Pantheon etc are no more than a lazy 15-20 minute strole. Tip: if you want to see Rome from a birds eye view, go to the Vatican early and take the lift to the the top of St.Peters dome - amazing!!!! When you visit the crypt below St.Peters you can not help but feel the change in atmoshere and the increadible vibe - gets v.busy so get up early; you've been advised. The Vatican Museums are also amazing - if you love your art, put plenty time aside and go very early - time was short so we cherry picked the best rooms. One of our party loves Guinness, and if needs must there is a good bar only 10 mins away that can help you out - odly enough no ex-pats only locals / my choice was the great old wine bars serving what the Italians do best / Cul De Sac had some fantastic wines and snacks - some of the best I've ever had.

There are two bars, one on the roof and one on the ground floor (small, but ideal while waiting for everyone to get ready, being a male it took me 1-2 minutes to put a shirt and jacket together and head for the bar, where I met my other male travellers and then we waited and hour or so for our partners, who being female took ages, perfect) - the barman gave well above avarage service, making all sorts of cocktail nibbles while we drank during our stay. The hotel is for every one, couples, singles, families and small groups... in the way of food there is only breakfast in a smallish but smart dining room, but this is good and again the staff made the difference, plenty of coffee, tea, fruit, meats, cakes, breads, cheese, cereals, juices and scrambled eggs / no cooked breakfasts. We did not find this a problem - when you have so many places to eat to choose from on your doorstep - the idea is to go out and explore the local area - felt very safe at night when walking back to the hotel which is a great plus. CONCLUSION: When I go back, and I've thrown my coin over my should into the Trevi Fountain, I will have no problem in re-booking or recommending this great hotel to my friends and family... in fact I'm already making plans now it was that good a trip, more so than any other I've been on. Many thanks to the Hotel Staff and manager... who told us our wives had run off with some local Italian men for the night and wouldn't be back to late - we were amused - nice John Cleese sort of guy in the best possible way!", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cFabalous Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RebelChic", "ReviewID": "UR7161146", "Content": "This was a gorgous hotel with very friendly staff.

We were greeted by Mauro who is the best Manager I have ever enountered; unfailingly polite without fawning, knowledgable, honest and good looking!

Our junior suite was on the 2nd floor which was high enough to gain an impressive view of the square and I was only sorry the rooftop bar was closed as it was winter. Any gripes? Well, hardly. The breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel so be prepared to queue or go early or late, and what you have read about the orange juice is true - just don't drink it. That's about it.

St Peters blew my socks off and I can't possibly do it justice here - seeing the Pope was extremely special. When we booked flights they were 1p plus tax on Ryanair.

We booked the hotel after much research as representing the best choice in the 3 categories important to us: 1) location, 2) old-style elegance, and 3) friendly (not stuffy) service. In our opinion, this hotel excelled in all 3. We requested a superior double with a view of the Pantheon and were thrilled to discover on arrival that our room had not only a view but a lovely terrace overlooking the Pantheon (and indirectly the piazza). The high ceilings, wood floors, heavy drapes, and overall elegance won us over immediately. The room and bath were relatively large by European standards; the bath was appointed nicely in marble with very new fixtures and a jetted tub. Nice fluffy robes, slippers, and floormats gave us an extra sense of coziness. The beds were comfortable and we experienced no problems with noise either from the outside or from other rooms. The TV was a bit confusing to use, but we didn't really spend much time in the room watching it. The location was perfect for exploring the historical center of Rome. We walked to Trevi, the Spanish steps, Piazza Navona, and the Forum/Colosseum. In addition, there is plenty of shopping in the immediate area for everything from designer clothing and jewelry to Italian handcrafted paper and wooden toys. There is a supermarket nearby (on the street leading to Piazza Navona) with salami, cheese, and wine for a picnic or snack. There was no shortage of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but steer clear of places that are right on the Piazza and head up one of the side streets for a better price and a better meal. Breakfast was included in our package, and we enjoyed the selection of breads and rolls, cereals, juice, cold meats and cheeses, as well as scrambled eggs each morning in the breakfast room. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and spoke excellent English. The hotel has a rooftop terrace and bar that was closed in November, although we had nice weather during our stay. That's fine, because we enjoyed wine and cheese on our own terrace. There is also a small bar off the lobby, but it appeared to be unused during our stay -- and who wouldn't rather step out the front door and have a drink on the Piazza della Rotunda or walk a few blocks to Piazza Navona instead? In short, we enjoyed our stay tremendously and I will definitely plan to return to del Senato on my next trip to Rome. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel that has a European elegance and feeling.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield.

The extra touches from the maid who visited our room twice a day once in the morning to clean and at night to put goodnight mats at the side of our beds on the laminated floors and she left us little sweets with a little goodnight note. Just the extra little touches really made us feel special. We were left a bottle of champagne in our room but I think this was because I mentioned it was our honeymoon. If you can select your room you must select a room on the 6th floor as this is the only floor where the rooms have a small balcony which looks out on pantheon square. The breakfast was buffet style continental breakfast but it had a good selection of cereal, fruit, delightful pastries with butter and Jam and for those who wanted it - bread cheese and ham. You could go back as many times as you wanted, there was waiter service for fresh coffee & tea. The location of this hotel could not be better. next door to the Panthoen itself, Trevi Fountain just up the road. Half way between the coliseum and the vatacan all within walking distance. I would not hesitate to stay here again. One thought for eating out.- Eating in Pantheon square proved rather expensive. Try the little restaurants running off the square these proved more value for money and alot more friendlier. November was an excellent time to visit Rome as we did not have to queue for any of the sites.

All of the fantastic reviews are true! We had a quad and I think it was probably one of the least decorated rooms in the place. When we got in I couldn't believe how gorgeous it was! The ceilings were so high with painted frescos. The bathroom was fantastic. The decorations were gorgeous. And the place was wonderfully clean. We peaked in other rooms and they were also fabulously decorated. One had a huge poster bed with a crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling! (after seeing that room I got a bit jealous) The location is fabulous. It truly is magical being across from the pantheon! It also is great for eating choices as well as evening activity. You can also walk to many sites or hop a cab from here. My husband has a bad leg, so we walked to Piazza Navona and Trevi fountain from here. The other locations were also walkable but not really for him so we cabbed it. We loved hanging out at the Piazza Navona & Pantheon at night. The staff was fabulous. Extremely helpful even when we screwed up and didn't understand some things. The only complaint was one of the single beds (they are really chairs that convert to single beds) was broken. It didn't stay flat unless you were laying down in it. We didn't complain though. If we did I'm sure they would have dealt with it. They also had the best breakfast of the 3 hotels. Besides bread, ham/turkey, cheese, salami, fruits, yogurt and cereal. They had real orange juice and grapefruit and also had scrambled eggs. I believe that anyone with any standards (i.e. very high or not) would be extremely happy with this selection.) Just as an FYI we stayed at the La Residenza in Florence and the Hotel Commercio & Pellegrino in Venice.

The hotel itself is a detached building, in contrast to all the other buildings fronting the square, and situated immediately to the left of the Pantheon. Apparently a room facing the square requires a superior double rate; of these 20 or so rooms, 5 (on the top floor) have small (2 people standing) balconies, and one (on the 3rd floor?) has a large stone balcony, dead-centre over the entrance. All the others still have large floor-to-ceiling shuttered windows, so you still get the atmosphere from the piazza. The hotel itself is immaculately presented; it's classified as a 3-star, which signifies that it doesn't have space for a gym, rather than representing any compromise in quality. The TV was a flat-screen LCD with free Sky box; the keys were smart-cards; the toiletries were plentiful and of excellent quality. The 3 stars also allows for a friendlier service, which suited us: we ended up chatting and joking with the receptionist for 10 minutes at check-in. Combined with their limo service from the airport, in a leather-trim VW Toureg (\u20ac55, vs min \u20ac40 for a taxi), it couldn't have been a better arrival. The room was very comfortable - \"huge\" isn't going to happen in such a location unless you're a rock star - and watching a free concert take place in the square below that evening, from the balcony, was fantastic. It was suggested that we'd get views of the city from the 6th floor, but the surrounding buildings are of equal height; you won't see more than rooftops a couple of streets away.

Never, have we stayed in such a beautiful room as the one we were then given on the third floor. Not only was it extremely spacious but the four poster bed and spectacular ceiling murals took our breath away. We felt as if we were in seventh heaven. Even the bathroom had a jacuzzi. And as if this wasn't enough, stepping out of the hotel's doors we were straight into the Piazza della Rotunda, a warm and lively square, which is home to the most amazing Pantheon - we had the golden opportunity of being able to go into this amazing circular temple before any other tourists arrived - a site not to be missed! And it is right on the hotel's door step. The breakfast room is quite small, so if you wake up late you may end up having to queue. I can recommend the cake that was always available for breakfast though the orange juice was questionable. The roof terrace was enjoyable and the Bellinis made from fresh peach juice and local sparking wine were an absolute treat. Not to be missed. The staff were always helpful and kind and our room maid was a delightful lady who kept everything spotlessly clean. Please be sure, however, NOT to use the money changer in the square for any foreign currency and traveller's cheques. They charge a wopping twelve and a half percent as against any bank's maximum one percent charge. There are two banks in the square and many, many others close by - though the process may take longer than anticipated.

Normally when visting a city we have to rely on busses and metro's however from this hotel we could easily walk to the Colesseum, The Vatican, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain etc. The staff at the hotel really would do anything they could to help you and the two guys on the front desk (1 in the mornings and 1 in the evenings) were always friendly and happy to help. I would also recommend popping up to the roof terrace and having a drink before dinner with Michelle the barman, who is happy to offer you tips on good restaurants and have a good chat whilst overlooking the piazza. The day before we arrived I emailed the hotel to arrange a car to pick us up from the airport they were happy to help and responded straight away and it was well worth the money I think it was 55 euros when we arrived and then arranged for a car to take us back to the airport at 45 euros. For the sake of 100 euros I can highly recommend this as transport to the city from Ciampino airport isn't great and being in the back of an airconditioned merc beats sitting on a bus.

The view is wonderful--the Pantheon, the square, even the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the distance.), the bathroom was modern and the location is perfect for exploring the entire city.

Be sure to have him arrange for transportation to the hotel from the airport. Do not even think about driving--the streets we took to the hotel were more like alleyways and I could not have found my way there if my life depended on it, Also, if you plan to visit the Vatican, have them arrange a private tour guide. You can easily navigate Vatican City on your own but there is a special entrance for guides that is open from 8-8:45 a.m. We waited in line for 30 minutes in the shade while those in the general admission line waited for about 3 hours in full sun, As for restaurants, the concierge happily made my reservations--I can highly recommend Dal Bolognese and Da Fortunato which is less than 1 minute from the hotel on foot.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Hotel and Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5459782", "Content": "Beautiful Hotel with an excellent staff.

The suite consisted of an ante room with small couch and two small chairs, very passage like and not really a room as such.

The shutters and double glazing kept out the noise. However we had no hot water the whole time we were there. It was barely luke warm. We complained everyday but nothing was done, other guests we spoke to also had trouble with the hot water. I got the feeling this was not an unusual occurence and they really weren't interested in fixing it. They did however offer financial compensation at the end of the stay.

Now, I must write about something that really upset me at the Del Senato. We took friends with us who had never been to Italy before. I made all the arrangements, including flights, tours and renting our beautiful cottage in Tusany. I worked very hard to make this trip special for all of us, even though we have been to Rome numerous times. I did allow our friends to make their own room reservations at the two hotels we stayed in while in Rome. I wanted to allow them to pick out a price range they were comfortable with. About a month before our departure date, I asked them to make sure and reconfirm everything. I confirmed my reservation with the Del and heard back from them immediately. Our friends said they couldn't get the hotel to respond to them at all and also realized they had asked for the wrong date. After three attempts, I told them I would e-mail and see what I could find out. I know our friends are very inexperienced with travel matters, so figured they had done something wrong. The Del wrote back to me right away and said they had never heard from our traveling companions, but did have an opening on the correct night. In the meantime, I had our friends contact another hotel just in case. Of course, they thought they had made a reservation there as well, but suddenly remembered they had not written back with their credit card information. Anyway, we arrive at the Del Senato and are taken to our rooms. I knew they had initially asked for a standard room. We met downstairs later and they asked how our room was, knowing we had a more expensive room than theirs. We said it was lovely, but small. They said, \"Well, you should see what a standard room looks like.\" Well, I couldn't imagine what he meant, so we went to their room and I couldn't believe my eyes when we walked in. They had the most expensive suite in the entire hotel and only paid \u20ac 250 for it. The hotel had found them a room for the night all right. So, I'm the one who bailed them out of a real mess and we got a tiny room for quite a bit more money and they get the suite? I guess the hotel staff didn't even think about it when I wrote to them and explained how our friends had made a terrible mistake. I was so happy that they were able to get a room, because if I hadn't checked, they would have arrived at the hotel with no reservation anywhere. Geez!!! At least, I got to see what that beautiful room really looked like. I believe the rate for it is \u20ac 615 a night. Hmmm, I guess it just added to our friends special trip. Anyway, the Del Senato is a wonderful hotel and I would stay there aga", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cDel Senato lives up to it's reputation\u201d", "Author": "Gungadin", "ReviewID": "UR3895866", "Content": "Just back from the Albergo del Senato.

You will not be dissapointed, unless the lovely ammenities such as fine room service, fabulous in hotel restaurants (Hassler Hotel) are what you really want. We recommend this #1 for it's location, at the foot of the Pantheon, but also far closer to walk to the many wonderful sites, (our favorite Piazza Navona is close, the wonderful antique shops are close, the Vatican is not much further, Piazza Venezia, the Forum and the Coloseum are relatively closer) #2 for it's reasonable price (relatively to the grand hotels mentioned above) (around 300+ dollars) #3 it's cleanliness and sophistication. You can eat well many places in Rome, so the lack of a fine dining room does not bother us. This is a relatively good bargain for Rome standards. I highly recommend taking a horse and buggy ride which you can rent at the front of the Pantheon, and which will take you around to these sites on the roads which are now closed to cars, and will save your feet for the many hours you wish to spend in many of these locations. The ride seems expensive 150 euros or so, but is a GREAT way to get aquainted with the city, and for those of us repeat travellers, a wonderful way to get reaquainted with a city we love, occasionally work in, and visit often.

So count your money into their hand. He didn't even drop us off in front of the hotel, so we had to lug our suitcases around the cobblestoned alleys to find the Pantheon (several conflicting directions from Italians in the area), and FINALLY arrived at del Senato, dying in the heat and needing rest badly. We mostly (hastily) chose it for its location, but I was misled by the rave reviews for this hotel... There was a dead cockroach by the couch in the lobby. No bellman at the door to help us with our luggage. The front desk guy Salvatore barely welcomed us and called for a porter but by then we had gotten our bags ourselves to the elevator. My exhausted heart fell when the elevator opened - it was TINY!! about the size of a phonebooth! The two of us couldn't even fit with our luggage (and we are petite girls), so we had to make 2 trips. We got off the elevator and dragged our luggage some more up a series of 2-3 steps before we finally got to our small room. BEWARE OF ROOM 112, the view of the balcony is horrible - after looking once we locked it, kept the curtains drawn and never opened them again. you step right out into a dark back alley in which anyone could just climb right up into your room. The walls are PAPER THIN! The door of the next room is literally 2 inches from your door and everytime someone opened and closed (slammed) their door it was loud as if they were trying to come into your room. We could hear EVERYTHING, including every word of our neighbor SINGING while we tried to rest and everyone passing in the hall. But the worst was over, the twin beds were firm and comfy. The bath was clean, although hot water came and went, the water pressure was good. Breakfast was great actually, and another front desk man was very courteous and helped us get a taxi cab when we left - we were so worried about the thin walls keeping us up for our week long stay, that we changed hotels the next day. Also, the rooftop terrace is overrated. I would say it has the feel of a B&B.

Air-conditioning worked great. The breakfast buffet was excellent -- meats, eggs, fresh fruit, breads, pastries...everything you could want.

Our \u201croom\u201d (number 501) was actually a suite consisting of a large kitchen, a sitting room, private balcony bedroom and bath. It was extremely spacious and, I suspect, is not typical of the normal rooms in the hotel. We had wanted a room in the front of the hotel facing the Pantheon but our room faced the rear overlooking a Hodgepodge of roman apartment buildings. Also, based on the hotel\u2019s web site and brochures, we had expected a room painted and decorated in Roman style. But this suite was furnished very modern. The really good news about this room is that it was extremely quiet. In the evening, we could hear the clamor of the large square in front of the hotel. There are many restaurants, street performers and crowds that create quite a racket. But facing the rear, the noise did not bother us at all. The breakfast is included and while not spectacular it was quite acceptable. We found no reason to search beyond the hotel in the morning. The roof top bar is a wonderful feature. House wines were reasonable (around 15 euros a bottle) and quite good. After walking the streets of Rome, it was a pleasant treat to sit on the roof and watch the sunset over the city. Internet access is available from one computer in the lobby bar and while there was some conflicts from multiple guests wanting to use it at the same time, it did work well. The best feature of this hotel is probably its location. It seems that it was in short walking distance to all the major attractions. We only found the need to take taxis to and from the train station and we never even had to brave the underground. The only criticism at all of this hotel was that the front desk staff was a bit stuffy and lacked warmth. By no means were they rude or inefficient - just a little on the stuffy side. On balance, we\u2019d seriously consider staying there at again although I would also shop around for a better-priced hotel (we paid 250 euros a night).
