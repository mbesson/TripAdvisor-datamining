Kame Hall is 4 individual serviced apartments and a communal area on the first floor and Kame Hall is styled in a modern fashion which was very much to my taste. Room was large and very clean by Rome standards and bathroom was massive (great shower). Apartment situated just off a beautiful Square with a Turtle Fountain. There was a small fridge in the room with yogurts and pastries, there was also and excellent espresso machine in the lounge area. TV in the room, Italian sky, but you wont be watching much TV in Roma. You just use a key code to get and and out of Kame Hall and then use an individual key card for your room inside. Location of Kame Hall is really excellent, 5 minutes from Pantheon, 10 from Piazza Navona, 15 Minutes to Trevi Fountain & Spanish Steps, 20 minutes to Coliseum and Palatine Hill and 25 minutes to the Vatican - all walking distances, especially on a lovely spring day! Owner Simone was extremely helpful and booked taxis for me and my partner to and from the airport and also gave us a map of Roma and advised us on where to go. He gave us his contact number and told us to call him any time we needed assistance. Overall I would highly recommend this B&B for the no fuss traveller, in my opinion you get a lot more for your money than staying in a traditional \"hotel\" in Rome.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crawley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cModern, spacious and clean rooms in the middle of Rome\u201d", "Author": "aroundtheworld57", "ReviewID": "UR125398501", "Content": "Is a clean place that has good sized rooms and bathrooms with easy access to the city of Rome.

Contrary to other reviews, its very easy to find as its just off Piazza Mattei which all the taxi drivers knew. Kame Hall comprises 4 rooms with a communal self service breakfast and coffee area (open all day). Our room was very big, as was the bathroom with a great shower. The room could have been in Brooklyn NY as it the decor was very modern so if you're after baroque style Rome antiquities this isnt for you. The 4 rooms are also at the top of a flight of stairs which was no problem for us. It was spotless, really lovely and really big rooms. Fridge and tv in room also. Comfort and style-wise, its on a par with a 3* hotel room so all you miss is hotel reception / concierge / lobby areas. Vittoria the owner was very helpful. We had his phone number at all times and his shop is only 2 minutes around the corner. He recommended a great restaurant to eat in - Solo Margherita - just around the corner (no name above the door, and no menus, just daily specials). The location was great and we only used a taxi to get to and from Campiano aiport. Otherwise we walked everywhere and took in all the main sites. Kame Hall is located close to the Jewish quarter so Sola Margherita was one of the best dining experiences we ever had. On our last day, we ate in Nonna Betta, also in the Jewish quarter and very highly rated by Tripadvisor (!) and it was the worst meal we had. We crossed the bridge to the bohemian left bank and enjoyed a fantastic value meal full of italians there on a Sat night. Another night, we ate in Pain et Vin, literally on the corner across from Kame Hall. The only downside was the breakfast as it was all packaged, supermarket food. We didnt bother with it on the second day. However for price, value, size of room etc, I would definitely recommend Kame Hall.

Very clean, comfortable, loved the Jewish Ghetto area. This area is not primarily Jewish but it's characater is still built around the Great Synogogue and only Jewish school in Rome and small pedestrian cobblestone road with Jewish stores and kosher restaurants/bakeries. The bakery/deli is outstanding for takeout sandwiches, pizzas. It's now an artsy district very close to the beautiful Pantheon area and in walking distance to many sites and near the bus. I agree to take a cab from airport. Staying near the bus terminal is not nearly as nice and not in walking distance to main sights. Towels, be sure to keep them separate because they do not change them every day and they may fold them and put them all together. Nice owners, do their best to be helpful. Don't expect travel literature in B & B's or hotels in Italy, come prepared, HAVE A CELL PHONE. Must make reservations at many of the good restaurants all over Italy or you'll be stuck eating mediocre food for tourists. Also, many cities you have to call for a cab, flagging them down is not acceptable.. DO YOUR RESEARCH on restaurants or ask people when you get there. Bring a book of Italian phrases. MANY people DO NOT speak English. Have a cheat-sheet. It's fun to try and connect with people. After leaving Rome, do not consider renting a car UNLESS you order and get confirmation in advance that you will have a GPS. GPS is usually pretty great there.

One month before our departure, we called the staff at Kame Hall to confirm our reservation and were led to believe that everything was in order. Upon arrival in Rome (after a very long flight from Sydney) we were told that there was a 'problem' with our room. What the problem was exactly was never made clear as we were not able to see the room or get a true understanding of the situation. The female staff member informed us that we would need to stay elsewhere for one night and that she had made reservations at a nearby hotel. She walked us approx two blocks to a hostel that could only be described as a slummy dive (I would estimate around 50 - 80 euro a night) and told us that we could probably move back tomorrow. By this time my boyfriend and I were annnoyed and suspicious. We had read previous reviews on Tripadvisor of other people that this had happened to at Kame Hall (I believe that these have now been archived) though given our precautions, thought it would be fine. It is usually common practise in such situations for the hotel to arrange accomodation at a much better hotel when they have double booked (they never indicated that they had but it was obvious that that was the case) or have a large unspecified 'problem' with the room. Kame Hall had instead put us into a slum in the hope that we would swallow it and they would make a few extra $$ on the side. By the time this was apparent, it was 5pm on a Saturday night in the middle of summer when the G8 was on. My partner and I ended up walking out, with nowhere to stay, and finding another hotel a few blocks away that was more than we had budgeted but at least was honest. The entire situation had been both awful and a clear manipulation. Since returning home we have lodged a complaint with Rome's new tourist police in the hope that other people will not have to suffer the same fate.

Down the street from Largo Argentina in the middle of the Ghetto, a few blocks Teatro Marcello, Forum, nightlife Campo di Fiori -you can virtually walk everywhere although with all the motorinos and cars Rome is not my favorite walking city.
