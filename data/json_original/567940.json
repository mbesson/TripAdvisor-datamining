Okay it was only 8 euros but still, he didn't have to do this and he's running a business at the end of the day.

During our four week vacation, we've been to many places and stayed at ten different hotels. This is by far the worst hotel I've stayed at, perhaps the worst in my life. The hotel owner or manager, a middle-age gentleman who runs the hotel with his wife and son, is extremely rude and has no idea what customer service means. Upon arrival we discovered that there were no towels in our room. When I asked, I was told that because I've booked the hotel using a particular website, I'll have to pay extra for our towels. Even if that was true, a good hotel would give its customers break who have just arrived from a long flight. We're talking about towels only, not free breakfast. This is only one example, I can write ten pages describing our bad experience at this hotel. One morning when I asked the owner about going to Florence (which train station would be better) he said I'm a smart American and I should be able to figure this out!

A lot of local Italians used this so felt it must be good! As you will have read in other reveiws, the bus service into Venice is excellent and very easy. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here! The staff were fantastic and always wanted to help.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWhat a find the Hotel Altieri was!\u201d", "Author": "lovetotravel2010UK", "ReviewID": "UR56966303", "Content": "Yes, it's in the suburb of Favaro Veneto, but we had 5 nights bed and breakfast during the Carnevale Maschere for less than what it would have cost for one night in Venice centre. A delightful family run hotel and without exception, every staff member was friendly and helpful. The room was quiet, spotless, spacious and airy with heating/air-conditioning, and the bathroom provided a hairdryer and a shower with great pressure and plenty of hot water. Continental breakfast is served in a bright sunny room and consists of the usual choices accompanied by excellent coffee - not your weak filter, although a 'tall' coffee is available. The area is safe and residential, with a few shops and bars. Eating places are few (there is the option of eating in Venice centre before returning to the hotel), although I can highly recommend 'Jungle Pizza' which is about 30m from the hotel - huge choice of inexpensive, delicious pizzas and friendly staff. Next door is the excellent 'America Bar Onde Rock', obviously the place to drop in after work and have a drink with friends before heading home. Everybody seemed to know somebody else, but we were made to feel very welcome. Drinks are accompanied by a bowl of snacks and are inexpensive - try the local Prosecco, a Bellini or the drink of choice, a Spritzer. Practicalities. The taxi from the airport cost EUR30, but only EUR1.10 each on Bus 15 (public bus so nowhere specifically for luggage) going back. We arrived at night and didn't know where we were going, so the taxi was easier at that point, but next day we found our bearings and public transport was the way to go. Bus tickets are EUR1.10 each (or a carnet of 10 tickets for EUR10) and can be bought from the Tabacchi (you can't buy them on the bus) opposite the Hotel Ducale about 80m away (turn right upon leaving the Hotel Altieri and head to the end of the road). Upon entering the bus, you need to swipe the ticket over the scanner. Bus 19 (on the same side as Hotel Altieri about 15m before the Hotel Ducale) runs every 30mins and takes about 20mins into Piazzale Roma. Around the corner, is the Pastrello stop and from here you catch Bus 4 or 4/ which runs every 7mins and takes about 30mins. Time your journey outside of rush-hour and you should get a seat, although many seem perfectly happy to stand. On the canals, the Vaporettos are EUR6.50 each way, but if you plan on using a few, consider the Travel Card (incl bus and vaporetto), starting from EUR16 for 12hrs. Fair enough if you want to pay a fortune for a central hotel (and still drag your suitcase through the narrow streets), but I'd prefer to spend the savings on daily expenses. So if you are looking for a friendly hotel which offers the best value, and is located on good bus routes, then look no further than Hotel Altieri. I'll be staying nowhere else.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portugal", "Title": "\u201cA good option for a car holidays\u201d", "Author": "enona", "ReviewID": "UR56449643", "Content": "This was part of a car travelling holidays in Italy.

Although not located in the historic centre, it was easily accessible by bus (there are various bus stops down the road from the hotel which take you into Piazza Roma in Venice) The room was lovely and clean but what made this hotel stand out was the superb service we received. Staff at the front desk were incredibly helpful in finding out the best/quickest ways to get to Treviso airport so early in the morning for our flight and also helped us plan an itinerary for our day in Venice. Everyone was so friendly which made our trip so much better.

However the hotel gave us everything you could need for a short break away. The room was clean and comfortable with a nice on suite bathroom. There was a good choice of breakfast every morning. The staff were always very helpful. To get into Venice it self from the hotel again was very easy, with a choice of buses less than a 100 metres from the hotel, the number 19 being the quickest but only running every 30 minutes. The other choice of bus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being either number 4 or 4/ both taking slightly longer but more frequent, and running later in the evening so enabling you to stay in Venice till late. The Venice travel cards offer very good value for money and give you unlimited travel for the duration of the ticket that you buy, and if you buy more than 2 weeks I advance offer even better value for money. On the whole would really recommend this hotel for a short break to Venice.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Altieri", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d567940-Reviews-Hotel_Altieri-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$69 - $121*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Altinia 51</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30030</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "567940", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5a/40/5a4084a7f5b9b738fae580488b6639ab1large.jpg"}}
