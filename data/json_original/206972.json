We ended up in Madrid to avoid the volcanic ash cloud for the return trip home from Europe. We booked this hotel based on recommendation from a friend. When we arrived from our flight in the evening and asked to borrow an iron and an ironing board to go out to dinner with ironed clothes, they refused, saying that they do not lend irons for \"security\" reasons. They offered to have our clothes ironed for 7.50 Euros per item, but it would take a few hours. Rather than being apologetic about this ridiculous policy, they acted as though this was the only reasonable policy to have! Their \"free\" wi-fi in the lobby is actually for 30 minutes a day, you have to get a new code from them daily. The internet is incredibly slow.

My husband and I arrived at the hotel separately, him having come earlier in the day to attend a business meeting and evening reception. I flew in on a later flight into Spain and arrived at the hotel later in the evening. Knowing my husband would still be out, he had earlier in the day arranged with the front desk staff for me to pick up a key when I arrived. However, when I arrived, there was no record of this and I ended up in a situation where I was receiving abuse from the front desk clerk calling me a liar. The point was not so much that there was no record and so they could not give me the key, but rather that he immediately resorted to brushing me off and refusing to look further into it (despite my being on crutches at the time and also holding the confirmation numbers for the reservation). It was only when I parked myself in the lobby, clearly refusing to leave, that he finally did as I had originally asked and called the desk clerk who had been working earlier in the day at the time my husband had arranged the key to be given to me. When the day clerk confirmed my/our story, the night clerk did eventually give me the key but did it in such a disgruntled way and when I asked for an apology, he outright refused.
