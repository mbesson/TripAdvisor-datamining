The first room I was given was 115. It smelled terrible, the bed had a dirty bedspread and no pillow. There were no towels, no hangers, no phone and the floor was disgusting. I brought the receptionist to my room who apologized profusely, and I was moved to another room 328. It didn't smell as bad and had towels but was still awful. The floor and rug were so horrible I kept my shoes on to walk on it. The wind whistled eerily through the door all night. I couldn't bring myself to shower there. I've stayed at other Suburban Extended Stay hotels and the rooms were cheap and clean and for the most part in good repair. I think this hotel needs to be condemned, Based on other reviews it sounds like they might have some ok rooms but I would never recommend this hotel based on my experience.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Lake Tahoe, California", "Title": "\u201cConvenient\u201d", "Author": "DavidMagyar", "ReviewID": "UR125793504", "Content": "I was in town for a week for work training and wanted something close by and cheap with a kitchen.

Of course, being an obsessive dog-mom to a sweet, spoiled pit mix girl, I had to not only find someplace that was dog friendly but also \"breed friendly\". I called Suburban Extended Stay and had a great customer service rep who booked my room and assured me the dog would be no problem. He even offered me a discount. I got to the place after a 2 day drive and it was just OK -- kind of what you would expect for an extended stay -- but after a few nights my thoughts on the place plummeted: - It smells like weed in the hallways nightly but no one from management says anything about it. There are beer cans everywhere. - That being said, the clientele is trash, which I'm sure factors into my bullets not only above but also below. - The men who stay here are widely blue-collar, which is completely fine, but for some reason they are creepy and will blatantly stare and say things to you with no regard (I was happy my pup is part pit, to say the least). Maybe because there are at least 10 \"gentlemen's clubs\" within a 1-block radius? - The management is horrendous. Some loud, horrible, low-rent woman who does not care about the customer at all. - It is, in fact, not dog friendly at all. The maintenance came in my room without warning while I was at work, and because the dog was barking in her crate the neighbors complained. And because the neighbors complained the manager (mentioned above, horrible) called and yelled at me, and then continued to complain to me every time she saw me in person. Not only is this horrible customer service, but complete BS in any given social setting, how dumb can you be?! I didn't think my sweet little girl was safe being in her crate by herself the rest of the time and had to pay for dog daycare. Absolutely unacceptable. - IT IS NOT SAFE. what people say about the doors always being open is true. And, as alluded to, it's on a horrible side of town. - IT IS NOT CLEAN. Enough said. - THE HOTEL IS NOT HONEST. I never got the discount I was promised. When checking out, the front desk worker played dumb even though I gave him my confirmation number and the name of the customer service rep who helped me. Ridiculous! - The washers and dryers eat your money then don't work. And the manager (like I've said, horrible) blames the company that owns them and takes no responsibility. - IT IS NOT NICE. Run away. Don't stay here. If you have a dog, might as well board them for the price of daycare and stay someplace where you're not scared of being robbed, mugged, raped or contracting a disease from the disgusting surroundings.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf you are a person who values life you...\u201d", "Author": "dat935rat", "ReviewID": "UR66483457", "Content": "If you are a person who values life you will pay a few extra dollars for a different hotel.

This hotel offers both. For the memorial weekend, I was looking a inexpensive, but decent hotel to stay and when stumbled across the Extended Stay hotel, I thought to myself this can't be soo bad since people stay for long periods of time and the pictures look GREAT! Boy, was I wrong. My boyfriend called me when he first arrived to the hotel to discuss the quality/looks of the hotel and stated that we might want to look at someplace else. I brushed it off thinking he was being too picky. When I arrived, I felt like I came to a drug-infested motel! There were several windows open and people walking around like they had no sense. Going into the lobby, it looked decent but once I walked into the hallway, it was damp, smelly, and filthy. The rooms were spacious, but dirty, smelly, filthy, and poorly organized. My boyfriend told me that he laid in the bed for a minute and was bitten by something. After hearing that, I quickly booked another hotel and called the front desk 3 times to cancel my reservations. The phone rang and rang. I decided to go to the lobby and found the ONLY hotel agent sitting on the couch talking and laughing with a random stranger. I was totally appalled and upset and she explained that she never heard the phone ringing. I made up some lie to the hotel agent about deciding to stay with friends. She was very rude and unsympathetic and told me I would be charged for one night. I checked my account a few days later and found I had been charged 6 different times!! What a nightmare!

Go Pflugville Panthers win state! Anyway, I needed a nice motel fairly close to Texas stadium that was big enough and cheap enough for three guys. The motel was great for our purpose, but it a no-frills type of place. Advantages- large room, kitchen (full refridge, stove, microwave) , wireless internet, interior corridor, several entrances so your car is always near, VCR player in room, . Negatives- no continental breakfast, little to no bathroom amenities, shower was difficult to get the proper water temperature, needs more insulation around pipes/bathroom. There were several youngsters in the hotel as well and many of them were hanging around the halls at night when we came in from our night out. We were ok with this because we were all in our 30s. I can imagine that others would be annoyed by this occurrence. I'm normally not that light of a sleeper, but the noise coming from the pipes -irrespective of whether or not it's from your room- was practically unbearable in the morning hours.
