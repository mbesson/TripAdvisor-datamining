Breakfast was fine, always homemade baked goods even though cappuccino was provided by a instant coffee dispenser, lacking the true Italian barista touch and requiring silly laminated passes to be handed in every morning.

My husband and I were traveling with our two teenagers (16 and 14) for my 50th birthday and were hoping to save some money by all staying in one room. Daring and unromantic, I know, but it was just for 2 nights and VERY few hotels in Rome can accommodate a family of 4 in one room (at a reasonable price). We had driven from Tuscany that morning and arrived in our rental car. Had no problem parking the car in the garage the hotel recommended (about 2 blocks away). Front desk was great--very helpful, spoke very good English, cheerful, all around nice to deal with. Were thrilled to get to our room on the 6th floor and find that the AC worked really well! That was my first test. Even though the room was small and the bathroom tiny, it did have a nice-sized recently renovated shower (passed my second test), and a delightful little balcony with a small table. Perfect for having a morning cup of coffee and spying on the nuns in the nearby church. I loved the little alley the hotel was on. It was quiet and a short walk to the cab stand at Piazza Barberini. The kids loved the Internet access in the lobby (which was great because it kept them out of the room!), and I loved the little courtyard where they served breakfast. Once you de-Americanize yourself and get used to the smaller scale of things in Europe (thinner mattresses, smaller portions, smaller rooms, smaller cars), you really start to appreciate the history, the culture and just the general \"joy of life\" attitude the Italians possess.

We got the Metro some days (e.g. over to St Peters/The Vatican) but you could actually walk to most places. We walked to the Vittoriano, the Colosseum, and over the river to Trastavere one evening for dinner. Walking about was a nice way to see more of Rome, but the Metro is also really convenient. There are also some nice places to eat around the hotel. We used the lounge area a bit, and there was free Wifi, which was a bonus. There isn't a bar as such, but if you asked the reception staff they would get you a drink and bring it to the lounge \u2013 a little bizarre but it seemed to work! The breakfast room was nice and the breakfast was good quality. The other downside was the amount of noise. This is not the hotel's fault, as there were some really loud guests (surprisingly, older guests) staying at the same time as us who liked to shout up and down the stairs to each other and make phone calls outside other people's rooms. Also, you couldn't close a door without slamming it, which added to the noise. In trying to give a fair review, I would say the staff try quite hard to create a friendly, family run hotel, and they have no control over the other guests' lack of manners, but it is quite basic for what I imagine is not a cheap rate. The location is excellent, and I suspect that's what you pay for, and the public areas of the hotel are good, but I felt the rooms (or ours, anyway) let it down. Also, to be fair, we don't know exactly what it cost as it was all included as part of the overall tour of Italy, so it may have been a real bargain.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sanford, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and we will return!\u201d", "Author": "joepalace", "ReviewID": "UR113990787", "Content": "Great location near Metro.

This half glass cost 4 euros! It wasn't the money that bothered me - it was the mean spiritedness of the act! Having developed the habit of enjoying a glass of prosecco over the previous 7 weeks in Italy, I know that a glass of prosecco usually means that the glass is reasonably full. (in fact, in my hotel in Taormina the first glass of prosecco was complimentary.) Not here, it seems. The same attitude continued at breakfast. By 9am, fresh fruit was limited only to apples and even though breakfast ran til 10am there was no chance of replenishment when requested from staff. Only cereals available were Kellogg's Cornflakes. Also very disappointing was the hotel's recommended restaurant, Osteria Barberini. Not only was the food fairly mediocre - aimed at tourists who don't know better - but the owner was a bit free with his hands (three times) as he passed my table. True, the staff at the hotel were, generally, helpful and accommodating and the ability to use the spacious lounge was a bonus.

You have to slam the doors of the rooms to lock them, and as you can imagine, that made for rude awakenings at night . - The walls are paper thin.

Sweet croissants, cheese and some sliced up sausage. No fruit. The \"cold\" milk for the cereal was left out on the counter the whole time and turned out to be room temperature by the time you got around to using it. - The strong smell of cleaning products.

I will do my best to describe this \"apartment\". The apartment is accessed through the courtyard. You enter it through a door that opens onto the courtyard. Once you open this door, you see two more doors, each of which locks. Each door leads to a room, and each room has beds and toilet/shower. You cannot really leave the doors to the rooms open at night, as there is a light illuminating the area between the exterior door and the inner doors that cannot be turned off (at least I could never figure out how to turn it off). So, if you are travelling with younger children and want to be able to leave the doors between the two rooms open, this apartment may not be the best choice for you. I noticed that the bathroom in room 104 ventilates into the courtyard, which means that persons who may be enjoying a drink or breakfast in the courtyard can hear what takes place in that room (and vice versa). The rooms are very basic, but clean and quiet. The location is excellent, a short walk to the Villa Borghese, and the Trevi Fountain. You do, however, get what you pay for. While I found the staff quite pleasant, housekeeping neglected to provide sufficient toilet paper in the rooms on our last day. I also thought the staff unhelpful in providing accurate information about transportation to the airport. They were happy to arrange an expensive car service (70 euros for 4 people), but provided misleading information about the cost of a taxi to the airport. One of the staff told me, incorrectly, that there was no fixed tariff to the airport from inside the Aurelian wall, where the hotel is located, and stated that the fixed tariff only applied outside the wall. This was completely wrong, as I learned the next day when I booked a taxi to the airport and was advised by the driver that the rate from inside the wall was a flat 40 euros. I suspect that the staff member was simply mistaken when she provided the erroneous information, and doubt that she was trying to tout the more expensive car service. However, you would think that such basic information would be well-known by anyone working in a hotel. Breakfast was okay, although my kids kept commenting about a funky odour they noticed in the breakfast room (I never noticed it myself). So, if you want a clean, basic place in an excellent location at a reasonable price, you might want to stay here.

So, it's not in the middle of all the sights, but it's within easy striking distance by Metro, bus, walking, or taxi. We often took the Metro out to sights and then casually walked back at night (safe area). Transit strike one day meant that we had to do a lot more walking than usual because of the location, but that's pretty common in Italy. AC worked great, the room had a safe, and our room was exceptionally quiet, even though it was a street view room. Great for siestas, unless you have a loud American family next to you. Cons: Price could have been a bit more competitive, but it was Rome in the summer, after all. Standup shower was pretty tight, so if you're a larger person or pregnant with twins, you may want to ask about that ahead of time. Also, they didn't let me bring pizza back to our room.

However, when you carry a box of pizza from the Tiber through the hot streets of Rome, on a 92 degree day after lunch, all the while navigating through the sea of people trying to sell you roses, helicopter toys, and stupid green lasers, you naturally get peeved when they tell you that no outside food is allowed in the hotel.

Modigliani provided us with an appartement (room 601) including a small kitchen, which was a very positive added value, and plenty of space for a very reasonable price. The staff is very friendly and the roomservice is good. Although dishwashing is not included, the maid did it two or three times.

Although the hotel was in a great location, it was in a quiet area. The hotel staff were very helpful and quick to respond to issues (the only one we had was a blown light bulb which was fixed in 3 minutes). The room was small and clean. I paid about 430 Euros for 3 nights in early April - rather expensive but that's Rome. Negatives: the walls between the rooms were quite thin and you could hear conversations. The pillows were very hard and the beds very firm and bouncy. If your partner rolls over in the night expect to be bounced out of the bed (and my partner is only 8 stone). Our room didn't have a bath only a shower. The breakfast was simple with no frills. A few tips on the rest of Rome: The main shopping area is on the Via Del Corso which was about 10 mins walk from the hotel. If you like Prada, Versace etc, you'll find a whole street of these brands on Via Condotti (near the Spanish Steps) - again only a few mins walk from the hotel. Many of the locations around Rome are easy to walk to but be aware that most streets are cobbled to you will need some very comfortable shoes. My wife advises the ladies to not wear high heels or stilettos. The Metro is very cheap about 1 Euro to get to most places. There are also lots of buses and trams to hop on and off. If you want to go on tours then I'd recommend Eden Walks - they did a great job for us. Food is expensive - about London Prices. Drinks are very expensive - expect to pay 4 to 5 Euros for a 33cl bottle of beer/coke/water. Coffee is also similarly expensive and you get a very small cup. We tried a whole variety of different restaurants and the food was quite plain and not of a very high quality. The food in a good Italian restaurant in England is far better. Rome offers some fantastic architecture and history - around nearly every corner you'll find a building that would stand out in most other cities. I recommend the Vatican Tour and St Peter's (San Pietro) Basilica if you can only do two things. If you have more time then head off to the Colosseum and Roman Forum which can take a full day.

Obviously their are numerous room layouts as other reviewers had some negative reviews of the bathroom, however I thought the accommodations were very comfortable. Its obvious from the staff that this hotel caters to mostly americans, which was just a safe bet, as you never know especially in a city like rome what you could end up with. I happen to visit on an italian holiday where many of the museums and other points of interest were closed for several days. The staff thoroughly researched this and upon originally providing some ill advice on the sistine chapel, caught me just before leaving for the day to inform me that they were in fact open, which showed me that they were willing to go the extra mile for the guests.

The staff there were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help us. We'd booked via laterooms.com and they'd booked us a queen bed, instead of 2 doubles. The receptionist immediately sorted this out for us, giving us a tripple room at no extra cost. All the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive. We hadn't told them it was my sisters birthday, but they had checked our passports when we checked in and, when we returned from a days sightseeing ,we found a lovely bottle of prosecco with 2 champagne flutes and a happy birthday note from the owners. It was a really lovely touch and helped make my sisters birthday special. The beds were comfy, the minibar was well stocked and very reasonable and the bathroom was spacious with a really good shower. 2 main tour buses stop at the bottom of the road and there are loads of good bars and restaurants around Piazza Barberini which is right on the hotels doorstep. Some extra tips - definitely book your tickets to get into the Colosseum online before you go as the queues can be huge. We also booked a Sunset walking tour of ancient rome through viator which lasted 3 hours and was worth every penny. We also booked the open bus tour through viator as the bus stopped at the Piazza Barberini which was really handy. One other tip - the dress code for entering St Peters Cathedral is really really strict. Please make sure you wear something thats below the knee and have your shoulders covered.

We stayed at the Hotel Modigliani for 3 nights and had a very nice quad room in one of their garden apartments. The hotel was in a great location and quickly became one of our favorite hotels during our visit. That is until the last morning.... The hotel arranged a shuttle service to the airport for an early flight. Our group packed all of our belongings and had a few minutes until our shuttle was to arrive so we went to the dining room for a quick coffee and to see if our shuttle had arrived. Unfortunately we left our carry on luggage in our room unattended. After 10 minutes we returned to our room and found a man who was dressed in the hotel uniform coming out of our locked room. We thought he was there to tell us the car had arrived, but he quickly walked away. Once in the shuttle on the way to the airport, we noticed all of our wallets had been emptied. We specifically took out money for the shuttle the night before and we all clearly remembered packing it with our documentation the morning before our flight. We emailed the hotel to make them aware of the situation in hopes that others would not fall victim to theft and maybe an apology. We did get an apology that basically said they didn't believe us and that we brought it on ourselves. Here is a quote to enjoy: \"But the guest has always reason, at the end, the proverb tells. We reply: the guest could be reason.\" We were all shocked to be insulted after being robbed.

So, after looking for a nice place to stay in Rome, without spending a monthly salary, we decided to book a double room at Modigliani. As usual, my plus and minus (and some so-so). Please, note that sometimes I'm forced to find some \"minus\", especially when I enjoyed my stay (like in this occasion). PLUS 1) Location - Placed in a small street near Tritone Square (Via Veneto bottom), is located in a safe area just 300 m from the nearest Subway station (leading to S.Peter in 5 stops) and 5 minutes walking from Piazza di Spagna and Trinita' dei Monti. 2) Atmosphere - Friendly, family atmosphere, helpfully with suggestions and helps (maps, reservations, etc) 3) Suggestions themselves - we are Italian.. we were looking for a typical Roman restaurant, not a tourist-trap-fake-trattoria.. the simple, genuine restaurant we have been sent shows how serious they are (ask for Sora L.) 4) Room - clean, warm (maybe too much!!), good bed, good quality bath free items.. so-so bathroom (small shower, I agree). 5) Peaceful place, you don't even think to be in Rome during the night: you can keep the windows opened, without being disturbed by noises. SO-SO 1) Breakfast - probably it is perfect for Italian.. but foreign people maybe would prefer more \"salt\" items (just some cheese, ham and salami - no eggs, bacon, etc)... but.. ok, you are in Italy, you are expected to eat and drink like an Italian.. so, cornetti (brioches) with chocolate, marmalade, cream; espresso, cappuccino (made by a barman, not an automatic machine), cakes.. if this is ok for you, this is your perfect breakfast.. 2) Light in the room had very low power.. to have a good light we had to keep all 3 bulbs switched on at the same time (who cares?) MINUS 1) Thin walls - the TV in the nearest room when switched on is like in your room.. but you cannot change the program!! Acoustic insulation is not working very well.. 2) Temperature - well, this is not really a minus.. we have been give a 5th floor room. When entered, we found about 25 C (too much for us).. we had to keep the heater off for all the three days for having about 21 C in our room. But, I repeat, this is not an objective minus (just subjective).. 3) TV!! Wow.. I did not ever think that an old 15'' cathode ray tube TV can be still present in an Italian 3 stars Hotel.. Bad video quality, remote control not working from distance.. If they will change them with some LCD (maybe fixing the LCD on the wall), the result will be fantastic... Ok, now, the final question: would I suggest this hotel to my best friend? Definitely YES! I loved the stay, for a reasonable price, in a good location, a clean and friendly hotel.

If it was in Germany, I would rate this hotel a 2 or 3, however relative to other Italian hotels it's above average, despite the noise.

Best cappuccino I had in the 3 cities visited on this trip! I have 2 complaints with this hotel - the noise in the mornings and the mattress/pillows. The elevator chimes upon arrival on each floor and all the room doors open onto the elevator vestibule. No hallways. There is no way to close the room doors quietly. They must be pulled forcefully to close and engage the lock. Any conversation by others in the vestibule will be heard as well as the necessary morning cleaning sounds. Our mattress was depressed on one side and therefore slanted and the pillows are extremely flat and stiff. These discomforts, added to the morning noise made for too few hours of sound sleep. I liked the staff very much. They were extremely helpful in guiding us to a simple local restaurant, La Scala, on our first night and in sending us to a great travel agent, Sunderland, for the easiest train ticket purchases i've ever made in Italy.

This was our first trip to Rome and in researching hotels we came across the Hotel Modigliani and from the Trip Advisor reviews we decided it was where we wanted to stay. The hotel was nicely located in a quiet residential area but still close to restaurants, metro and was walking distance to everything - Spanish Steps - 2 min, Trevi Fountain - 5 min, Galleria Borghese - 15 min, Coliseum - 30 min (metro was onstrike that day), Vatican - 45 min (day after we arrived from Canada, so walked back to stretch our legs). The service was amazing and the out door breakfast courtyard made for a great start to the morning. The only problem we had with the service was - they were to arrange for a car to pick us up at the airport but due to a taxi strike the car couldn't make it but the front desk provided us all of the instructions we needed to get there via train/metro. We had room 603, so top floor with a little rooftop balcony that faced east, so after a full day of walking around Rome it was a nice place to sit & relax with a glass of wine and talk about the day-plans for dinner-plan for tomorrow. The room was a good size for the 3 of us (good double bed & our daughter had the 'sofa/day bed'). And while some people have commented on the size of the showers, I'm well over 200lbs and had no problems - in fact after a day walking around Rome it was nicer to be able to lean against the wall while showering.

The only positive was that they gave us a newsletter which offered some valuable recommendations for stores and restaurants in Rome. The nadir of the visit came at 4:00am, when we all woke up drenched in sweat due to the faulty air conditioning system. I went to speak to the front desk about it, and was assured that it was working properly, and that if it wasn't, it was because I was moron and couldn't figure out how to work the thermostat. (which was not the case!) The front desk clerk claimed that they didn't lower the A/C at night, however, he did flip some switch behind the counter and our room eventually cooled down again. At this point, the Modigliani was the fourth hotel we stayed in during our visit to Italy, and it was by far the worst experience. In particular, the A/C incident - although a hot room was annoying, our annoyance could have been assuaged by some deft customer service, like an apology, which was never forthcoming. For me, this is the prime test of customer service - how a business handles things when things go awry and a customer isn't satisfied.

The staff were so helpful, and we found the hotel newsletter to be a great source of information, particularly for restaurants. We ate at three of the restaurants they suggested and had wonderful meals, not expensive, all within a few hundred yards of the hotel. The hotel breakfast was adequate, plenty to choose from. We usually ate early, but if we had been getting up later, we could have eaten in the lovely little internal courtyard - it was gorgeous. Our room was at the front of the hotel, a double on the fifth floor, plenty of room (we had thought from previous reviews that it might be tiny, but not at all) with an excellent bathroom, all spotless and in cool calm colours, much appreciated after the heat and the hustle and bustle of the streets of Rome. The marble floor in particular was heavenly on bare feet after a day of sight-seeing.

Overall, this hotel did not meet my expectations. But I cannot begrudge it the good value. Originally, I booked 1 double and 1 triple. A week before the trip, I noticed that they were running last minute specials so I called to get the new rates. They weren't able to give it to me; however, they did give me two rooms in lieu of 1 triple room for the same price. This was above and beyond what I expected so I was really looking forward to getting there. Two things happened which changed my overall view of this place. One is that the hotel is tiny - the rooms are pretty small as well. My room (201 - avoid all 01 rooms) was so small that I felt really claustrophobic in it. The bathroom was minute - there was a small shower that had doors that you pulled shut around you. The toilet is about less than 1.5 feet from the sink and 2 feet from the shower. I couldn't wait to get out of my room each time. The other thing is that the 2 days we were there, the receptionist was not very helpful. His name was Guiliano - avoid him at all costs. We asked him to order a taxi to make our Vatican tour. After 15 minutes, it hadn't arrived so we asked again. Turns out he hadn't ordered the taxi at all and couldn't find a taxi that was available - almost made us late. We ended up heading to the Piazza Barbarini to get our own taxi. Asking him anything felt like we were imposing on his time. Having said that, there were two redeeming qualities about this hotel. It was exceptionally clean - I would have been disgusted if the small space was not clean on top of things so luckily, it was very clean. The location is fairly convenient, near the Spanish Steps and Piazza Barbarini. The breakfast was a small spread but the cappacinos and cafe lattes were really good. Overall, I would not stay here again. I'll go back to the Intercontinental around the corner on Via Sistina - it's really more my style and although not posh, it was comfortable and roomier.

Furnishings were simple and tasteful - not luxurious or grand, but still quite nice. The bathroom had a towel warmer (nice to have in February), large towels and your typical European wall-installed hair dryer (not too powerful but functional). The view from our room was mostly just rooftops but we didn't get any street noise. If you want a view it seemed to me that the other room on the sixth floor (when I glanced in as it was being cleaned) would be preferable.

We're not big breakfast eaters, but there certainly was enough to fill us up until lunch. Rachel will make you a great cappicino, or latte, and the selection of food is good. The hotel is centrally located on a small street, near Piazzo Barbarinni, which means you can easily get on the subway or bus to anywhere you need to get to in the city. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see, except for the vatican - we took the subway. We would spend hours walking around and if we got too tired, we would take a cab back to the hotel, which never cost more than maybe 8 Euros, no matter how far afield we had wandered. One of the most pleasant restaurants is right down the street, on Villa Della Purificazione (the same street the hotel is on). It's called Restaurant Barbabrinni.

Continental breakfast was more then adequate, but I wish European hotels would put tea/coffee making facilities in their rooms! Location is good, we walked everywhere. About 35 minutes to St Peter's, Spanish steps just around the corner, Trevi fountain 10 minutes away and Colliseum 25 minutes. Of course, there are lots of other places (churches!!) to keep you occupied. The church of Santa Maria Maggiore, near the station, is also worth a visit. There are some good eating places near the hotel recommended by the owners, La Scala, 2 minutes just around the corner and Ristorante Tullio on via San Nicola da Tolentino, about 5/6 minutes.
