First you must know what you are looking for. The Hotel Suisse is in a perfect location, just a short walk up the street to the Spanish Steps. The hotel is located on a very narrow side street in an old (hello, it's ancient Rome) building. The hotel is located on the third floor and has an elevator for easy access. I would compare the Hotel more to a bed and reakfast than a hotel. Our room was small, we had a double bed as requested, it was comfortable for my husband but I like a softer mattress, still I slept OK due to lots of walking all day long. The bathroom was also small but very functional with soaps, shampoo, and a hairdryer. The bedding was good and the towels were nice. Everything was spotlessly clean, the staff was friendly and helpful and spoke great English. The TV also had two English channels, BBC, & CNN (yuk, but better than nothing). A light Continental Breakfast was was delivered to our room in five minutes after a quick phone call requesting it when ready every morning. Overall the Hotel Suisse is Charming, for us it was a great value, and we would definately stay there again. I do however recommend that you have the hotel arrange for a private driver (round trip), he will meet you at the airport outside baggage claim and drop you right in front of the hotel. The cost is Euro 50.00 each way but worth every penny, it is a 45 minute ride from the airport, traffic is bizzar to put it mildly. We have lived in Europe for 5 years and I would not recommend driving inside the city of Rome.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for a good location\u201d", "Author": "MS M", "ReviewID": "UR123239209", "Content": "Hotel Suisse was a very difficult hotel to find (I suggest that you book the hotel driver) - but once there the location of the hotel was very good.

I felt safe in the hotel and they kept everything securely locked. The room was nice sized with 2 shuttered windows overlooking a garden area that was surrounded by other buildings, possibly apartments. We could hear these incredible sounding birds each morning and it was really kind of neat. The room itself was nice size, clean, hard bed with a 13 inch small old tv. I wasn't in Italy to watch tv so really could care less. The bathroom had a little shuttered balcony overlooking the same garden area. The shower is extremely small and I'm an average sized woman. I dropped my bar of soap and literally had to step out to pick it up. My hint of the day was to make sure the balcony doors are shut. The staff were very nice and breakfast your typical very small cappuccino, oj and croissant. There was this small jazz club next door that was really pretty cool. The night we went they had a small group of musicians that sounded and looked like they'd just stepped out of the 50's and were incredible. I thought the Spanish step area at night had a very carnival atmosphere and there were several nigerians trying to sell glow sticks, bouncing lite up balls and it was a little too much. The walking distance was not too far to get to the Presidents palace, Pantheon and Tevi Fountain. Basically you get what you pay for and when I go back to Rome I would pay the extra and stay in the Pantheon area. Full of musicians, outdoor restaurants, etc. It was really the neatest spot in my opinion for Rome tourists.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cSafe, Secure and great location\u201d", "Author": "Ourdream2", "ReviewID": "UR118128205", "Content": "It is a nice hotel in great and wonderful location to the Spanish steps.

Our room (#38) was just big enough for 2 people, but not if you come with your luggage, as most people do. The shower was tiny. If you are more than 200 lb., stay away from this room - you won't fit in the shower. Among the staff Julie was kind and helpful, but the owner herself was rude and aggressive. Her main point in our 5 minute conversation was that she didn't really need us as customers, because she had plenty of permanent ones, and, if we don't like the shower, we \"can go to a public bath.\" I imagine a Motel 6 employee would be fired for such a comment.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cHUGE Room!\u201d", "Author": "Kealoha12", "ReviewID": "UR7616143", "Content": "Hotel Suisse has several things going for it: location, cleanliness, and price.

The hotel was SUPER clean especially the bathrooms which I am very particular. The bathroom was modern but the hotel is in an older building which we found very charming. A few things though that may bother some travelers but were ok with us were: you had to tell someone if you were going to be out after 2:00 am so you can be buzzed in. As we were traveling with a toddler it was lights out for us by 9:00. And we felt safe that guests had to be buzzed in. The breakfast had to be taken to your room--I actually liked this because my boys (husband and son) slept in so I can call for breakfast, and its in our room by the time they wake up. We don't have to worry about missing breakfast. You had to climb a few steps before reaching a small elevator. So if you have luggage--be prepared.

You have no key to the entrance of the hotel so everytime you leave and come in they have to buzz you in (which is a bit of a pain, believe me). Personally, I prefer places where I can come in and out whenever I want regardless of the time. After all, I'm on vacation!!! The price is not bad for the location and the place is definitely CLEAN.
