It's a cliche, but it describes this classic, luxury hotel. Close to the train station, shopping, restaurants, bars, parks, and gardens -- you can't beat it! This is a beautifully appointed hotel with a somewhat formal atmosphere, both in decor and service. The rooms are a nice size with appropriately deluxe bathrooms. Attention to detail is evident in the spotless rooms and bath. In general, the room was attractive and comfortable. In terms of decor, the lunch area near the bar is not to be missed. Covered by an amazing dome of stained glass, with a central area of flowers and plants, and beautifully furnished, it was a constant object of photographs. The bar itself is cozy, beautifully appointed; it is a bit formal in terms of service, and was on the expensive side. Nevertheless, it was a very comfortable place to relax at the end of the evening. My only disappointment was the staff. While efficient and helpful when engaged, there was a lack of warmth and friendliness that I enjoy in a fine hotel. Interaction with staff can be the extra touch that can make a hotel stay memorable for me. I missed that at the Westin Palace. In summary, this is a beautiful, classically decorated and run hotel with a superb location in Madrid. You can not go wrong staying here, especially if you enjoy a subdued, formal atmosphere.

If you've been a little exhausted by all the museum walking, take a quick nap back at the hotel. The hotel itself oozes of royalty. From grand rooms, to having wonderful buffet breakfasts inside a copola that must have had a few grand balls many years ago. Afternoon tea brings out world travelers and Madrid's elite in a bit of wonderful star gazing. We saw a number of movie stars having a drink while we were there. The wine store inside the hotel is absolutely incredible, and a place for wine lovers to delight in. They have the full gamut of Spanish exclusive wines at cheap prices. The only single disappointment was that the roof top bar was closed while we were there, probably because it was a little cold (for the Spanish, not us Canadians), and there really wasn't a spa per se that was functioning.

The most attractive quality of the hotel is definitely its location in front of Plaza Canovas del Castillo or better known as the \"Neptuno fountain\" plaza. As you step out of the hotel you find Museo Thyssen Bornemiza to your left across the street and the Museo El Prado to your right two blocks away. Very close to the hotel is a Starbucks and a convenient store \"VIP\" where you can eat -breakfast, lunch or dinner - shop for fast snacks, buy a book or grab some toilletries if you left anything behind before you left home. The kiosk that faces this two establishments sells the best street map you\u00b4ll ever find to tour Madrid on your own. The rooms we reserved were one with a king size bed and one with two twin beds. Both rooms were very comfortable, beds are awesome, save box, mini bar, complimentary bottled water every day,flat screen tv with channels in spanish, english, french, german, arabic. Bathrooms are also comfortable. The staff is very nice, helpful and hard working, rooms and bathrooms were spotless. The only complaint would be that there is no free wi-fi in the rooms; connection is charged by the hour or by day (16,50 euros per day; 1,50 euros per one hour). They do have an open connection in the lobby. The restaurant is beautiful, the service is superb and the food is ok (around 42 euros per person).

The hotel is in a very good location in downtown Madrid near the Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (among others). You can also easily walk up to Sol and many of the main tourist attractions in Madrid. We arrived around 10:30 am and were able to check in to our room right away. Our room was quite large and a big bathroom with a double sink and separate tub and shower. The room was also very clean and quiet It was admittedly a little run down - and that was surprising to me given the class of the hotel - but nothing that really bothered us. Our room type came with free wi-fi and free bottled water everyday which was great. Another plus is that our room faced the street where the Good Friday procession took place. We were able to hang out in our room (or rather squeeze out a seven inch opening onto a french balcony) to take photos of the procession. It was so crowded down below that we never would have been able to see what was going on if we hadn't been willing to wait a few hours in the cold for the procession to begin. Lastly, on our last day we in Madrid we took the Renfe train to Barcelona and it is an easy 10-15 minute walk to Atocha station.

After some price comparison, we booked plane tickets and hotel in one go using travellink.com and we had to pay 16.000 NOK (2700 USD) for the flights and 6 nights at the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at about midnight \u2013 the hotel is located between the Prado museum and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum so very well positioned. The taxi ride in from the airport only takes no more than 20 minutes and costs about 23\u20ac - additional costs for airport, day of the week and time apply. The Westin is an elegant historic hotel built in 1912 and the sign still says Palace hotel outside. Check in was fast and we got room 630 on the top floor (6th floor). The problem with old hotels is that they are not necessarily equipped to handle modern expectations \u2013 like there are stairs leading up to the reception, steps leading up to the lifts \u2013 not that practical when you are dragging along a big suitcase. Although there are staff on hand to help carry luggage to your room. The room was pretty inviting when walking in. There are light tiles on the floor and a huge mirror on the entrance wall. From the small entrance the room opened up and here there is beige/light carpet and light yellow/cream colored walls. The view was not that great as we had windows facing into the courtyard \u2013 looking down on the large glass dome on top of the dining room. If you stay here during Easter, try and get a street view room so you can catch the Holy Week procession on Good Friday. The room was equipped with dark furniture \u2013 a desk and chair, a cabinet for the 32\u201d flat screen TV and mini bar (where a coke cost something like 7\u20ac), a small table and a bigger chair and a bed. The queen sized bed was firm but quite comfortable. Along one of the walls there were three doors which revealed the wardrobe with enough hanging and drawer space, an iron and ironing board and a mini safe (which included space for a laptop and a plug to charge it while storing it). The TV had quite a variety of channels but the menu system seemed to make it a lot slower to start, change channels etc. We had some problems with the air-con when we were there. April in Madrid was quite cold in the evenings. When we had the air-con on it got too cold in the room (there is no display for choosing the temperature) and when turning it off the room got a bit stuffy. The rooms are not very well sound insulated either \u2013 we could easily hear people talking when walking past our door. The bathroom was impressive\u2013 quite large with a combination of wall paper and tiles and with two sinks in marble finish. There was a bathtub with a shower option which worked out pretty good. I normally don\u2019t like shower curtains but this had a curved pole which prevented the shower curtain from sticking to me when taking a shower. There were also two shower heads with good water pressure and hot water. There were standard amenities like shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouth wash but no shower cap (which baffled my wife). There was a small separate room (separated from the rest of the bathroom with a frosted glass door) with a toilet and bide \u2013 separate toilets are quite a good solution in my opinion. We had some issues with the telephone and it took 4 different calls to reception to finally get a technician to fix it \u2013 he ended up replacing the phone. As I mentioned earlier, the location of the hotel is very good. It is located right next door from both the Museo Nacional del Prado and El Museo de arte Thyssen-Bornemisza and it was only a bit more than 500 meters to walk to Puerta del Sol and just over 1 km to Plaza Mayor. Let us talk about some of the stuff that I was not that happy with. When I booked the hotel I was hoping to get some perks with my SPG gold card but that was not the case. When checking in I knew that breakfast was not included so the receptionist said that they had a promotion for breakfast for 22\u20ac and I said that I would think about it. My wife and I talked about this and next morning we decided to use this \u201cpromotion\u201d but it turned out that it was 22\u20ac per person and we could not only do it for one day \u2013 we had to do it for the entire stay. Charging 22\u20ac for a breakfast is totally over the top, in my opinion \u2013 I normally just have some cereal and fruit in the morning and I think it is annoying that you still have to pay for the entire buffet. That said \u2013 the breakfast is great here. You have an excellent selection of cereal, fruit mixes, good quality juice, eggs made the way you like, healthy options \u2013 and even some local specialties like churros. My recommendation is: go around the corner to buy your breakfast at VIPS or Starbucks. The breakfast area is also mentioned in guidebooks and we saw a number of tourists stopping by to admire the dome. There was no coffee/tea option in the room but there was a note saying that you could get this by calling room service \u2013 and they would only charge 4.50\u20ac as a delivery charge! In other words: it is cheaper to walk around the corner and get your coffee from Starbucks. Another thing that annoyed me about the hotel was the internet situation. Having access to the internet is getting more and more important as it is a great tool for planning a stay in a new city, booking restaurants, looking at maps etc. More and more hotels are offering this for free (e.g. Traders and Shangri-La chain that I also stay at) but this is not the case for Westin. They wanted 16\u20ac per day for access to the net which is totally insane in my opinion. I think it is one of the perks you can choose when you have a SPG gold card but I think the rules states that as I booked it through a third party, they didn\u2019t offer this to us. SPG also argues that they have free wifi in the hotel lobby but this is a 256K internet connections and who wants to sit around the lobby whenever you want to check something online? I have stayed at Westin hotels in Asia too and it has been the same there \u2013 even when staying on business levels the internet is not included. I usually end up buying a local SIM card to get online (you will need your passport to get one in Madrid). I hope that SPG hotels soon realize to move with the times and introduce free internet. I don\u2019t want to seem petty and complain a lot \u2013 but the internet and breakfast issues actually annoyed me quite a bit. I guess they figure if you can afford the hotel you can also afford to pay a lot for these services? Conclusion It might sound like I\u2019m very negative to the hotel based on what I have written above but all in all the Westin hotel is a great traditional hotel with reverend fa\u00e7ade, ballroom etc. The location of the hotel is great as you can walk to the most important museums in minutes and you can also easily walk to the most important squares of Madrid. The room was pretty well laid out and it is a nice mix between the traditional and the modern hotel. I have given feedback to Starwood about my annoyances \u2013 it is great of them to respond to Tweets. If you are going to Madrid and need a 5 star hotel with a good location you should look into staying at the Westin.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great stay\u201d", "Author": "jogrine", "ReviewID": "UR127558633", "Content": "Good location close to central Madrid sights.

We found the Hotel easy to find and as we drove up to the front, the concierge arranged for the car to be parked for us. Check in was easy, but the room that we were originally given was not prepared for us - in fact I think someone was still using it! However, they could not have been more apologetic and upgraded us to the most beautiful suite. What a fabulous room - massive bed, beautiful fixtures, dressing room, large bathroom with toiletries and luxurious towels etc etc etc. The bar and lounge area are just beautiful ! Jolly expensive and so I would recomend that you only have a drink here as a taste of luxury or if you really cannot muster the energy to walk out to the city !! Breakfast was probably the best we have ever experienced - you could not ask for more! Massive choice and range of food. We bought the hop on hop off city tour bus - this is definitely the best way to get your bearings and see the city - we then used it as our transport around the City and saw most within 2 days. We were surprised at the value for money of Madrid. An evening meal of Tapa's and wine and beer and coffee came to \u00a330 - brilliant! The city does not really come alive until gone 10pm and then it is buzzing. The bars and restaurants are all of good quality and most of the people very accomodating to our lack of the Spanish Language. The Hotel is very central to everything but do get a good City map to help you find the best places to eat / drink. The concierge was brilliant and gave us good advice as to where to eat and shop. We loved the food and drink market, but did not enjoy the Sunday market which was full of cheap rubbish - probably made in China / Taiwan! There are some not so nice areas in Madrid but do see them during the day as it is quite enlightening !! I would recomend a weekend visit to the City - it is exceptionally good value for money. The Palace Hotel is reasonable - we booked with Easy Jet for the flight and Hotel - 2 nights including a car, for 2 under \u00a3400.

On the less positive side: a few of the handles were missing from bed cabinet drawers, the door of the armoire did not shut properly (so the inside light would remain on) and the flushing mechanism of the toilet worked only so often. A proper maintenance of the room must not be a priority. Slippers are not provided (only on request) and the bathroom amenities are well below average for this kind of establishments. The acoustic insulation is not great, therefore you will easily hear your travel companions returning to their rooms after their festive night out.

I will echo two points, though - the first is that the hotel lobby is (surprisingly) small for such a grand hotel, and the elevators do not reach it (they come down only as far as the 2nd floor - the 1st floor to non-Europeans). Therefore, if the bell staff is not assisting you with your bags, they need to be carried up about 15 steps to the room elevators. This can be a challenge after a long flight and/or with heavy bags. Also, while the rooms that overlook the Fountain have a great view, it gets VERY noisy late into the night and also very early in the morning, due to the traffic and the fact that the local Starbucks is here.

The location is unbeatable for anyone who wants to be at the heart of old Madrid and within walking distance of major sights. Mere minutes away, literally across the street from the hotel, are the Prado Museum (a 650m walk); the Navy Museum (450m); and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (250m). The Palace of Communications (550m); Reina Sof\u00eda Art Centre (1km); and Royal Palace of Madrid (1.7km) are slightly more distant, but easy and interesting walks. Our room was basic and unremarkable by our experience and expectations of Westin and of five star hotels generally. It was well sound-proofed from Madrid traffic, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom adequate. We were surprised that no tea or coffee-making facility was there when we arrived, but this was swiftly provided when we inquired. The gymnasium was adequate. Staff throughout the hotel were courteous and efficient. The standard of cleanliness was high. Promotional room rates were acceptable value for money. The one outstanding and most memorable feature of the Westin Palace, apart from its location, is its Rotonda restaurant. This is not only a beautiful restaurant venue, centred on an elegant colonnaded stained glass dome, but it also has the best buffet breakfasts and lunches we experienced anywhere in Spain. Sunday brunch was phenomenal. The quality and presentation of tapas alone in the Rotonda's buffets puts many specialist tapas bars to shame. The Rotonda's waiters are consummate professionals who with genial courtesy maintain the highest standard of unobtrusive service. We like the Rotonda so much that on our return to Madrid in February, when we chose to stay in an apartment, we walked back there every morning for breakfast.

From the moment we arrived I felt like I was part of a special experience. The check-in procedure was flawless, cordial and informative, and the hotel was gracious enough to let us have our room even though we arrived at 10 am. The Heavenly beds were indeed heavenly....so, so comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful with nice toiletries, plenty of hot water and comfy robes. Our room was on the third floor and beautifully quiet: no outside or inside noise at all. A prior reviewer mentioned the room being far away from the elevator but that's exactly what I always request: always! The farther away from the elevator, the smaller the number of people passing your door which gives me the extra peace and quiet I want. The fitness center was well-equipped and I wish I had been able to experience the Asian restaurant at the rear of the hotel. I heard the food was delicious but they don't begin serving until 8:30, which is later than I like to eat. The location of the hotel is absolutely unbeatable: in sight of the Neptune fountain, walking distance to Plaza de Cibeles, across the street from the Thyssen-Bornemisza (great Impressionist/post-impressionart art) and the Prado, and a very, very short walk to the Reina-Sofia museums featuring art by Picasso, Dali, etc. The Thyssen was my favorite of the three and you can grab a bite to eat there too if you are totally enthralled with the art as I was. The Edward Hopper masterpieces alone are worth the price. We purchased Madrid tourist passes online prior to the trip that saved a lot of money but primarily lots of time since you get to skip the lines. This included numerous attractions but one we particularly enjoyed was the Palacio Real Madrid with its fabulous collection of stringed instruments for my musician husband to ooh and aah over. (Madrid Card holders enter in a separate entrance).The palace was close enough to the hotel to walk and enjoy the sights and sounds of Madrid along the way, including Plaza Mayor. Since we stopped so frequently, I'm not sure how long it would take to walk to but probably around 30 minutes or slightly more. Plaza Mayor was fun and believe it or not, Elvis Presley is alive and well in Madrid! We also enjoyed the Parque de Retiro, a very short walk from the hotel as well. The park itself is beautiful and if you love to watch people, this is a great opportunity to see a little bit of family life in Madrid, particularly around the water. If you're interested in flamenco, tap as fast as you can to Corral de la Moreria. (We took transportation since the show starts late at night). I did a huge amount of research on which flamenco show to attend and came up with this one, bought tickets online before the trip and was so glad I did. The talent at this show is unbelievable and not to be missed. When I mentioned to the concierge that we were going to see flamenco, he immediately stated that the best in Madrid was Corral de la Moreria but unfortunately they were sold out and would be unable to get us tickets, so I was ecstatic that I already had purchased the tickets. The place was indeed packed but what a fun experience that we will never forget! The area close to the hotel seemed very safe and we felt very comfortable walking around. There are numerous restaurants close by. If tapas are your pleasure, you will be in heaven....and that's just the way we felt at the Westin too....a perfect stay in a fabulous location!", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLuxury and Location!\u201d", "Author": "Nam S", "ReviewID": "UR123982533", "Content": "Westin Palace is a luxury hotel located walking distance from every major attraction in Madrid.

While pricey (thus my title) it is well worth it. The staff is European courteous and speaks a multitude of languages, including Chinese dialects and that is not just the front desk, but throughout the hotel. The rooms are spacious under European standards including two wardrobes and double sinks. Views are a little iffy. Many of the rooms have no view, so if you are going for the first time you may want to pay for a view facing the Prado, which brings me to my next point; the location. Whether for business or pleasure nothing is further than 15-20 minutes away and there is much to do within walking distance or a 5 minutes cab ride. There are numerous museums in the area as well as some fantastic food. Surprisingly, some of the best Chinese food my companions and I have eaten anywhere was inside the hotel itself. I recommend the Peking Duck. But, if you are willing to walk 5-10 minutes then leave the hotel entrance and start walking straight and slightly to your left up Calle del Prado. It will take into a sea of restaurants, including some great traditional Spanish food eateries. we loved Taberna La Delores which is in Plaza Jesus. Frankly, we didn't have a bad meal anywhere nearby. we also felt very safe. As we walked around past midnight and the place was hopping. Take note, if you like to run you will love this location. Across the street from the hotel is Parque de Retiro which has some very wide paths. I mapped a run at mapmyrun.com if you want to see a roughly 4 mile run in the park. Lots of security and broad boulevards, or, you can do trail runs through the park. Getting back to the hotel, if you ask, there is a plan that includes a breakfast buffet each day with made to order omelets. Prices are high, but even higher if you eat a la carte. there is also a data plan which I again recommend unless you have your own internet service as the prices for this are also high. The plan includes some additional tv/movie options. The beds are very comfortable and at night there is a turn down service. Complaints: Some rooms are very far from the elevator, so request one that is closer to the elevator. Also, the television system is far more complicated and finicky than it needs to be. If you are looking for a clock, its in the tv. My room did not have a clock radio to set an alarm.

Well, it clearly isn't. Where in the world would you get ripped-off with fake fish roe served as Caviar? We ordered a bottle of champagne and (real) Caviar pretty much at our arrival and before going out for a walk and dinner. To our surprise, we found that it wasn't Caviar at all but some kind of local produce that by all means tasted like MUD. I honestly had to spit it out in the toilet before it got down my throat. I didn't even let my partner try the horrible stuff. I have been lucky enough to have had real Caviar (yes, the stuff that comes from the Caspian Sea, be it Russian or Iranian) pretty much since I can remember, so I had to find some proper produce so redeem myself with my partner (thanks Westin Palace Madrid for making me look like a pr\u00a1ck!). Anyway, it wasn't long before we found ourselves at ElCorteIngles and surprise! We found the real deal and gave ourselves a proper treat well away from the Palace. Not only that but I told of my nightmare with the fake fish roe and we were told by the man at the store that real Caviar is readily available in Spain and especially in Madrid. So it is truly shocking to see that this supposedly high-class hotel serves fake caviar in a country with such a vast 'cuisine culture' like Spain. Appalling! When we asked the staff, they couldn't really bother and were quite arrogant and impertinent and kept insisting that it is the real deal but \"produced in Granada\" which just added to our frustration - it tastes like Mud so I don't really care where it is produced, it's simply fake, not Legit. What a shameful experience really, being ripped-off and having to explain to them that what they are selling is not Caviar at all while they stare at you with a 'insulting expression' on their faces.

There are a few restaurants around so it\u2019s probably better to go out to eat unless you have a generous budget. There is an Asian restaurant in the hotel too and the degustation menu there was much better value and terrific food too. Having a coffee in the rotunda was expensive at EUR7 and a milkshake at EUR12! The rotunda is worth a visit though, especially in mid morning when the sun lights it up beautifully. Breakfast was around EUR30 pp for a pretty good assortment of hot and cold foods. Kids under 12 are half price. Car parking was expensive at EUR35 per day and you don't really need a car to get around.

The staff with one exception is very courteous and helpful, especially if your Spanish is not perfect.

Its famous \"Rotonda\" dome lounge has been a staple of Madrid life for over a century. I had been there before for business meetings and dining at the superb Asia Gallery inside the hotel, but never as a guest. So this time I stayed several days and I was lucky enough to get an upgrade as a SPG Platinum member to a suite. WOW! It was larger that my first apartment, and nicer too! My suite was right in the center of the building and had direct views to the Spanish Congress building. A separate living room with dining area, a guest half-bathroom, a large bedroom with en-suite bathroom and a huge walking closet with vanity space. I wanted to move in! The decor is traditional (check my pics) and I understand that they are renovating floor by floor and I was in a non-renovated floor but still looked pretty good, although some of the wall paper was a bit worse for wear. The service was excellent throughout and the only but was that check-in took a long time as many people were waiting and only 2 front desk people in attendance. I saw the same thing happening other days, but I gather that they were very busy. This is a large hotel with over 450 rooms, but it looks and feels smaller. The Rotonda lounge is perfect for having breakfast in luxury surroundings, meeting people, and generally people-watching. Concierge service is not what I am used to in other hotels of this caliber and rather more transactional than informative. But I use Tripadvisor for my recommendations anyway. Room service was very reasonable for this type of hotel and the quality was good and well presented. Location is perfect, you are in the center of Madrid, by the Thyssen museum and the unique and magnificent Prado. You are also in \"el Barrio de las Letras\", so you have all the amenities you may want nearby like Calle Huertas and Plaza Santa Ana for tapas and restaurants galore. Theatre, parks, shopping and all the bustling of Puerta del Sol right in the centre of Madrid. Best location in Madrid (Hotel Ritz is opposite) Everyone smiles and are there to help you.

Finally, they provide a coffee service in the mornings direct to your room (as there are no coffee / tea facility in the room itself) - however you still must pay the 5EUR room service charge ... annoying. As a business traveller, I work in my rooms at awkward hours and a fresh coffee is also appreciated ... but really ... service charge for a coffee service you advertise in the room?! How about a 50% reduction on the service charge? Obviously not really an issue for the leisure traveller who is probably sound asleep at 5am when i am looking for a hot brew!

They have thought very hard about how to take the most money from the client, whilst giving them the minimum in return, The building is well situated in the centre of Madrid, with public transport and local taxi's right on the doorstep, and the building itself is fantastic. Once you enter, the inside matches its exterior, with the cupola in the lounge area being worth a trip to the hotel on its own. Our check in was fairly slow, took well over 20 minutes from arriving in the door to being given our room key. We went up to the room and were initially impressed, a good size, with a fantastic bed and the standard toiletries available, as well as a decent bathroom with good shower. However a closer inspection showed that there was nothing else, not even a complimentary bottle of water. When I am paying the sort of money I paid for the room, in a hotel that prides itself on its service, to not even have a bottle of water in the room is unacceptable. Yes, there was water in the fridge, but over \u20ac6 for a tiny bottle of still water is excessive in the extreme. I recently stayed in an SPG hotel in Budapest, and there was quite simply no comparison. Having paid roughly the same amount of money for a room, and to have found slippers, water, coffee and tea facilities in Budapest, I was extremely disappointed to find nothing in Madrid. On reading the hotel blurb (carefully hidden away) I found I could ask for slippers as well as a large list of other things, but even in these austere times such basic items should be provided as standard. The things that cost nothing were well represented at the hotel. Although the check in was slow, the young lady that dealt with us was incredibly friendly and helpful, allowing us to check in a couple of hours early as the room was ready. All members of staff were attentive and ready to help with any questions. We came back to the room on the first full day after having spent all day out in the city, and someone had placed a Do Not Disturb sign on our door. This obviously meant that when we entered, our room hadn't been cleaned. A brief chat with reception and the room was sorted very quickly. In a city where I can buy a 2 litre bottle of Coke for less than \u20ac1.80, it quite simply cannot be justified that a small glass of the same in the hotel bar costs over \u20ac7. Everybody knows that to eat and drink in a hotel is expensive, no matter what hotel at whatever budget, but a mark up of over 700% is surely ridiculous. I came to Madrid for a short break with my girlfriend, to meet up with a couple of old friends, to watch Real Madrid play football and to view the city.

The lobby is impressive. The check-in process was somewhat slow but the staff seemed to be genuine in their desire to be helpful; English is spoken. Since we\u2019re Starwood members we were \u201cupgraded\u201d to the Starwood floor on check-in. I also have to say that we were able to check in before Noon without a hassle, which is nice. Our room, 608, was very pleasant. The room is not big but it is comfortable. There\u2019s a queen sized bed, a good sized writing desk with lamp, TV in a cabinet, reading chair and lamp, end tables with lamps by the bed. There is a plentiful amount of closet space which is great. An in-room safe is included in our price. The bathroom is decent size and the toilet is in a small room off the bathroom. While our two windows were on the small size and somewhat high up (and will only open four inches by design) the view is pleasant. With the windows closed there is no street noise except for the occasional siren. There is only moderate noise from the hallway and from the adjoining rooms. The bed was comfortable. It was hot while we were there but the air conditioner worked great. The hotel is very well located to the city sites that we wanted to see and not too far from the train station. Now to the issues: first, there\u2019s no free wi-fi. Wi-fi is something like 19E per day, which is ridiculous. However, there is a business center where you can use the computers for free (there are six or eight of them). If you time it right there\u2019s no problem getting a computer, however one day I went down there twice and they were all occupied both times. Not surprising for a big hotel. It would also be nice if the hotel would put an extra chair or two in there; a couple of times when I went down to use the computers there were computers available but no chairs as couples had pulled chairs over so that they could both sit down and read the computer monitor. Maid service: it\u2019s a little thing but I am surprised that we didn\u2019t have turn-down service, especially on an \u201cupgraded\u201d floor (we were there four nights and it didn\u2019t happen any night). Not that I can\u2019t turn down my own sheets but I would have appreciated getting fresh towels. While we were in Madrid it was HOT and we went through our towels. One day we didn\u2019t get fresh hand towels and our soiled face clothes were taken away and not replaced. If towels aren\u2019t going to be replaced during the day then it would be nice if the maid service would leave an extra towel or two in the bathroom (we each got one towel a day, which seemed stingy for an upscale hotel). As to the room itself, there are two issues that I\u2019ll mention: first, the pillows. It has to be hard for the hotels to deal with the pillow issue: too hard, too soft, too small, etc. And pillows must regularly get worn out. We had two pillows on each side of the bed: a good sized one that went completely flat when touched, and a decently firm one that was about the size of a sofa pillow (small). The other issue is that our carpet could have used some help. Not dirty but tired; it\u2019s obvious where it has been stained and cleaned over the years. Neither of these were a big deal for us. The other thing is that the cost of breakfast at the hotel, if not included in your package, is ridiculous. So, unless you\u2019re comfortable with spending what you\u2019d normally pay for dinner on breakfast, you\u2019ll be going out every day. There\u2019s a Starbuck\u2019s around the corner. There\u2019s no coffee maker in the room, however there is a notice that they\u2019re happy to bring you up a cup of coffee in the mornings, just let them know; there a 4.50E delivery charge! In reading some of the other reviews I was surprised by the comments about the staff, as we always found them to be helpful and engaging with one exception (see below). Do find time to at least have a drink under the rotunda, which is stunning. I did find the staff in the rotunda to be unfriendly verging on rude but I have to say that it\u2019s worth enduring them to have a drink there. The rotunda is stunning.

When I highlighted the problem to the person at check-out, he just shrugged his shoulders. For an issue that caused me to waste a lot of time, I expected more than a shug of shoulders. He didnt even note the problem, which leads me to believe that it wont be corrected the next time I visit Madrid. 2. forgetful egg-maker - I asked for some eggs at breakfast and came back a few mins later to discover that my order had been ignored. So I reminded the man and came back again - still no eggs! I was in a hurry and in no mood to beg for eggs so left slightly hungry. To forget once is human - to forget twice is simply negligent! Other small points were that there seemed to be only one towel set and only one bottle of shower gel in the bathroom - irritating if you shower at night and in the morning. I could have called and asked for more but my focus is to maximize sleep time rather than wait around for house keeping to deliver towels! To be fair, its not all bad - the hotel is well located, the rooms are new-ish and the bed very comfortable. But thats simply not good enough for me.

For cash and points, this was an amazing deal. The hotel was in a great location, right near Plaza Santa Ana (great square with outdoor restaurants, bars, etc), and walking distance to Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace, Retiro Park, & the Prado (basically almost all of the main city sights as long as you like to walk). I preferred being here over closer to Puerta del Sol which seems to be a magnet for demonstrators which I didn't really like. Madrid is a great taxi town, too, though. The 2 times we took one it was cheap. Our hotel room was nice and comfortable, but it did seem like the hotel was in the middle of doing some renovations/updating in the rooms (could hear it during the day and see some evidence of it). The public spaces were very nice, as well. We found the breakfast to be too pricey, so I can't say how that is. The one negative comment I would have would be check-in. First, it took forever (not waiting in line, I mean once we got to the counter). The woman in charge at the desk seemed flustered, confused, and I saw at least 2 different guests come up irate during our time waiting for her to take care of checking us in. One seemed extremely angry that he had requested a towel 3x now, and they apparently weren't sending it up to his room (if I was paying the regular rate for this hotel I could see that angering me, as well). Even after he said he would stand there and wait for it, she told him he would have to go back to his room and wait for housekeeping and seemed to blow him off. Then, someone came and asked about if something had been taking care of (not sure what), and when she said not yet, they stormed off (seemed like this had happened more than once already). Also, she kept disappearing to do other things and not checking us in while we were standing there 1/2 checked in! That was not a good vibe to begin with at the hotel, but we didn't have any issues ourselves other than this. We asked the concierge for advice on some things and he was very helpful, and check-out was very quick (not with the same person). Some Madrid Advice in General: Plaza Santa Ana is very nice at night and has some nice bars and tapas places. The Royal Palace is worth touring, we really enjoyed it because it had furnishings (unlike a lot of European palaces). Retiro Park is a good place to visit on a nice day. We rented a row boat on the lake which was fun. Also, seek out fresh churros con chocolate while in Madrid (churros with a cup of a warm chocolate pudding for dipping). We had pretty good paella at a restaurant called El Caldero (also on tripadvisor) and great 2.50 Euro calamari sandwiches and papas bravas (potatos with a spicy sauce) at a little place on Plaza Mayor called Casa Rua. The Prado museum is free after 6pm, after 5pm on Sunday (open until 8pm, closed Monday). We got into a long line at about 5:45 to get in, and were in about 5 minutes after 6. Definitely worth saving some money--8 Euros each. Also, we covered the main things we wanted to here (the museum's map plan is very helpful with pointing out the most important works), and then headed over to the Reina Sofia for a glance at Picasso's Guernica. The Reina Sofia is free after 7pm (open until 9pm) on weekdays (closed Tues) and from 2:30pm to 9pm on Saturday, and from 10am until the 2:30pm closing time on Sunday (will save you another 6 Euros each). We took the high speed train to Toledo while here for 1/2 a day (33 mins each way) and enjoyed that a lot. If you go there, be sure to have your taxi at the train station take you out to El Mirador (the viewpoint over the city) first (make sure they wait, you will not find a taxi out here) , take a few pictures, see the view, and then have him take you into town (Plaza Zocodover is probably a good drop-off point). I think there is a bus that also goes out this way, but we didn't look into it as we had a limited amount of time in Toledo and wanted to be able to be on our own schedule. The Cathedral in Toledo is the main must-see sight, but the town has several other sights, as well (the entire place has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Sight).", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sylvia H", "ReviewID": "UR116627032", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here and everything was fantastic.

The room was immaculate and ready early. The beds were very comfortable. There is an in-room safe. There is an iron and ironing-board in the room. It is a very well-positioned hotel, the Thyssen museum is basically across the road, and the Reiner Sofia and the Prado are only 5-10 minute walks away, which in Madrid's hot weather, you will very much appreciate the short walking distance. It is also a 10 min walk to the Retiro park, which I highly recommend walking later in the evening, when many locals go out for a run, for exercise, roller-blading, skate-boarding or just to stroll around. The park is beautiful - a lake with hire boats, the Crystal Palace, and a free art exhibition connected to the Reiner Sofia was being held when we were there, which was wonderful - we saw Leon Golub, but the exhibition space listed about 6 artists to be exhibited over the year. There is a convenience store around the corner where you can buy beers, fruit juices, wine and snacks, as well as books, magazines etc. Gift stores are around the corner as well. It is a 10-15 min walk into the central part of Madrid where the main department store is and many other retail outlets. For non-EU residents, if you are shopping at El Cortes Ingles (main Spanish dept store), make sure you go to the 2nd floor to get your 10% discount voucher to be used for the day - 7 days of vouchers can be used over the year. (You need to show a passport or ID with country of residence on it). Depending on the purchase price, you are also eligible for the VAT component to be credited back to you when you leave the last EU destination, so purchases from here can be well-priced. The only negatives for the hotel (which cause me to give it 4 stars instead of 5) relate to the stairs guests are required to climb in order to get to the lifts to go to their rooms - (approx 6). This presented only minor problems for us as we had heavy bags, and there was no-one to help us when we checked out at 5.15am. I had to rap on the desk to wake someone up in order that we could check out. I imagine the stairs could also be an issue for disabled guests. Similarly, there were about 5 stairs to climb down into the business centre, where there were 6 computers available for 1 hr complimentary use (per day, per room - not per guest). We booked this room on hotels.com and were happy with the result. There was no pool, which was disappointing. The wonderful cupola rood complete with stained glass in the foyer area was beautiful, but drinks were not cheap. A swimming pool in a 5 star hotel is almost a must. Other than these small issues, we were happy with the hotel and happy with our choice.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExceptional...too bad they don't have\u201d", "Author": "MariaVillaevic", "ReviewID": "UR115304329", "Content": "Madrid was our last stop in our two week trip.

The staff was friendly and very helpful, we never got to use room service, but ate at the hotel restaurant and the food was amazing. I recommend trying the Minestrone soup. The only cons is that internet was not complementary and there was some construction or remodeling going on so we heard odd noises in the morning, but not loud enough to wake us up. One bonus tip, if you do not want to use the laundry service in the hotel (which is outrageously high in all hotels in Europe) we found a laundromat 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

I find that the combination of location, beauty of the hotel itself and quite good service is hard to beat for a city that has its share of middling hotels. The Westin is definitely head and shoulders above most of them. The first thing that strikes you is how gorgeous and well preserved the common spaces are (the hotel is 100 years old next year, and has been maintained and refurbished to preserve it's splendor). The glass domed central tea room is gorgeous (it's also the location of an outrageously expensive Sunday brunch service - almost 80 Euros per person), and so are the lobby, american bar, and the Asia Gallery restaurant in back (which is, by the way, very reasonably priced and serves great food) The rooms themselves (and I've stayed in my share of them) are very spacious and nicely appointed. I've stayed both in the SPG floor (6th) and some other floors, and the rooms are fairly comparable (except that rooms on the 6th floors seem to all have bidets and the one I had on the 4th floor didn't, nothing major). I rather like the courtyard view rooms which actually have more light on the 6th floor (as the outside view rooms tend to have smaller windows, being the last floor) and are a lot quieter (traffic noise can be an issue on the surrounding streets, plus there's been extensive construction of an underground garage in the nearby plaza and lately demonstrations against the government a block away...) As far as other amenities, there's quite a nice gym with fairly new machines including sauna upstairs, although the solarium area is not currently open due to renovations. Service is par for the course for a 5-star hotel. The Service Express people are very attentive and come to your aid quickly. The front desk staff is very courteous and professional, and so are the baggage handlers and front door staff. Whenever I've had issues (such as an ongoing internet / tv issue one time) they've gone out of their way to fix it or compensate me for any inconvenience. Room service comes within the estimated time, and the food is good. That's not to say it's flawless, as there are some minor service glitches that keep it from becoming absolutely top notch, specifically around the housekeeping staff. It's probably a factor of how big this hotel is (it takes an entire city block), but some days some of the minor amenities seem to pass you by without explanation: some nights the maids show up for turndown service, and some nights they don't; sometimes they forget to bring the complimentary water bottles (2 a day), some days they forget to replenish the washcloths or the bath gel in the bathroom (on the other hand, it's one of the few hotels in Spain to even provide washcloths, so...). Maybe they should have some sort of checklist process, not sure... Also, the Wi-Fi access is incredibly spotty even on the same floor, which considering that it also comes at a steep cost is pretty annoying. There is a cable connection in each room, so that minimizes some of the pain, but if you are using an iPad for example, it can become quite vexing.

When I compliment hotel staff, it's not just because they comped me a nice room or gave me some freebies (although it usually doesn't hurt, I admit), but because I feel that they deserve the recognition in comparison to my many interactions with hotel staff at many other properties. My husband and I stayed at this property during our honeymoon. Two days before our stay, I emailed the hotel (to the generic hotel email address provided in the pre-stay welcome email) to ask if they would consider our special occasion and comp us a room upgrade. Within 24 hours, we got a personal email from the General Manager of the hotel congratulating us on our honeymoon and informing us that an upgrade may be difficult as the hotel was sold out during our stay. I was impressed with the the GM's personal attention to my email, regardless of the potential lack of availability of a room upgrade. Upon check-in, a very courteous and friendly front desk associate congratulated us on our honeymoon (evidence that someone made a note on our reservation based on our email), and told us that we got a room with a beautiful view of the fountain. It wasn't a suite, but we appreciated that the hotel/GM did their best given their sold-out situation. As we arrived early around 12:30PM, our room was not yet ready. They asked us to wait an hour, so we went to lunch and came back, but the room still wasn't ready. The front desk apologized for the delay and comped us two drink coupons for the hotel bar while we waited. I thought that was a nice gesture and we got to enjoy a drink at their well appointed bar while we waited. Once our room was ready and we were checked in, the GM sent up complimentary goodies (champagne, snacks, and beautiful chocolate tray) with a personal note, again congratulating us on our honeymoon. Needless to say, we were thoroughly impressed with the GM's personalized attention to detail. During the rest of our stay at the hotel, we continued to be impressed by the friendly professionalism of all hotel staff we interacted with, including the maids. I think that is a great reflection of the GM's leadership, and based on my limited interaction, I would say he definitely leads by example. As far as the rest of the hotel, it is very conveniently located for most tourists' interests, and we were able to walk to most of the Madrid's sights and restaurants that we wanted to visit. Oh, one thing I remember is that when we asked the Concierge for lunch recommendations near the hotel, they sent us down Calle del Prado to Plaza Santa Ana. Although it was a nice plaza with many restaurants with terrace tables, we felt that area was a bit too touristy and later discovered more excellent bar/restaurants for tapas that were full of locals on Calle Medinaceli/Jesus and C. de las Huertas. And if you don't mind walking 20+ minutes or taking a taxi from the hotel, there are even more amazing restaurants on Calle Cava Baja.

Having nothing but extraordinarily wonderful things to say about Westin Palace Madrid (WPM) makes writing this review very uncomfortable for me. I\u2019d never previously experienced the level of service, luxury and opulence as I had on my recent five-day stay at WPM. I booked a junior suite and I was upgraded to an executive suite (I suspect it is because I am a Platinum SPG member). The fancy hotel suite that the wealthy billionaire had in the movie \u201cPretty Woman\u201d (played by Richard Gere) is the closest that I can think of for comparison. A large foyer opens to an extremely large bedroom and a large living/dining area with a chandelier and exotic living flowers. There was also an extra bathroom off of the foyer. The bathroom off of the bedroom had separate shower and tub and a separate toilet room that included a bidet. The shower had the best adjustable water pressure AND VOLUME that I\u2019ve ever experienced. I also booked a junior suite for my kids and the junior suite itself was the largest of this type of suite that I had ever seen. Both suites had large bowls of fruit (9 different varieties) in the living areas. There were large bottles of complimentary water provided on each of the days of our stay. The views from the rooms were spectacular \u2013 the enormous Neptune Fountain was directly out our large spacious windows. The hotel has both housecleaning and afternoon turn-down service, of course. Certainly the most inspiring thing about the trip was our interaction with the General Manager. Upon our arrival late on the first night, our driver had dumped us off on the street with our luggage (not a very smart person), and I had felt that the hotel porter/doorman could have done more to help secure our safety. I emailed the General Manager about my concerns that night and the first thing in the morning I had an emailed response as well as a greeting card under the door from the GM, asking to meet with us about the experience. I did not call to make an appointment but rather wandered downstairs late (we slept-in) and within two minutes of asking for him at the front desk, he had concluded a meeting that he was in and introduced himself. He spent a good half-hour or more discussing the events from the night before, and he described how he had already reviewed the video of the entrance from that night. He got to know each of my family members individually and has done so much for us during our stay, it is almost unbelievable \u2013 so I won\u2019t even bother to go into details. Suffice it to say, he is a genuinely personable gentleman who clearly puts his guests\u2019 interest at the highest level of importance. Once again, the movie \u201cPretty Woman\u201d comes to mind, where the billionaire has the highest level of service that you could ever imagine. I have read the few negative reviews from other reviewers on this site (there aren\u2019t many of them) and I find their complaints extremely trivial. For example, having to pay for reliable internet is a wonderful thing. Any time that I\u2019ve stayed at a hotel that had free internet, I could never get any work done because every youngster in the place was hogging bandwidth with their youtube.com downloads and social media and whatever else they use it for. It is very important for me to have reliable bandwidth; having a cost-threshold to keep the bandwidth reliable is great, because the time wasted waiting for unreliable internet is much more valuable than the cost of the internet. (BTW, ALL Starwood hotels clearly advertise that internet is an additional cost.) The complaint about the cost of meals at the restaurant is also nonsense. The hotel is clearly a high-rent building and the food and waiters are excellent, so you should expect to pay for it. If you want tapas for less cost, there are dozens of places to choose from within a block or two of the hotel.

Not what one would expect of a five star hotel. On top of this, bear in mind that this is not really a high-end hotel at all (despite the impressive shell), but more like an expensive lay-over joint for traveling businessmen. The reception area is almost continuously overwhelmed by hordes of people milling about, and there are constant large and noisy events throughout. As a result, the service is more akin to that in a road-side cafe or busy small-town bar, than that of a grand continental hotel. The rooms seem fairly comfortable (although tastelessly decorated), and become reasonably quiet on the upper floors.

I was also happy to see that housekeeping respected the Do Not Disturb sign whenever we had it on the door, and didn't enter the room during these times (one of my pet peeves when staying in a hotel is when housekeeping disregards your request for privacy). The hotel location is also fantastic -- only about 10 minutes walking from the very heart of Madrid, Puerta del Sol, but enough aways so the hotel vicinity is still quiet.

Main issue, but quite important imo, is the Palace rooms lack light and air. You are in the middle of a mediterranean country, but end up in dark rooms with small windows and large frames ?!? which open only 10cms for security reasons. After asking to change rooms, I got an upgrade to an executive suite with fountain view connecting executive room also with a view for 200euros, which was comparatively a great deal ! Must thank the hotel staff for that move, but than the security wouldn't unlock the balcony doors... balconies are low and I suppose there have been some accident before, but the regular windows are at a standard high. Paying 800euros per night I'd expect not to be made so childish that someone else should tell me wether I can or cannot open the windows. Besides the hotel only offers inside bars and restaurants... the large terrace by the hotel on the Cortes square is instead occupied by a Starbucks... Across the street The Ritz has a great garden with bar and restaurants, where I ended up for drinks or meals everyday - it's Spain though, not a great gourmet destination, so even in The Ritz you will get food with too much oil and not enough veg - The central domed room in The palace looks great and it was a good time to have breakfast there with family and friends evey morning. The Suite was very nice and the service overall decent. It is an old building though and can become quite noisy. The area is great, I would definetely look for a place in the same district when going back to Madrid.

Moreover, this was on a pure Starpoints stay = FREE, since the almighty Dollar is truly in the crapper right now. First, I would like to thank the management of the The Palace, as well as its exemplary service personnel who catered to every one of our whims and needs with a smile and without any delay. Second, to all of you above, who have posted your experiences while at this property, your insights were greatly appreciated! I will add that I believe that I was fortunate in that my wife and I had arrived on a Monday and we had left on a Saturday and this permitted us to obtain quite a nice suite upgrade as a result of my Starwood Platinum status for this reward stay. I believe we were also helped by the fact that there were no conferences at the hotel on the day of our check-in, otherwise, the suite that I had received, likely would have been unavailable to us, as it most certainly would have been reserved by a paying customer. In fact, the GM informed me that the hotel regularly has a 75% occupancy rate, and this is not solely due to its fantastic location for the tourists that regularly flock to Spain's capital. One might notice that the hotel is just down the street from the building that houses Spain's national legislature (Chamber of Deputies)and various governmental ministries -- so it is not hard to believe that politicians, their aides, lobbyists and all sorts of business persons also stay at this property due to its proximity to these power centers. In addition, two major insurance companies are across the street from the property, and it is the one that is directly across the side street from the hotel - Groupama -- that has this really nice animated clock/carillon with moving figures. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkJuIZOcb6I The above video really does not display the whimsical nature of the show, which I believe runs every day at 12 Noon, 3 PM, 6 PM and 8 PM -- the bellmen certainly will know the correct answer should you ask -- so try to see it as it is right on your doorstep! We took the Aerobus into town from the airport (fare = 2 Euros p/p) and we alighted at the Plaza Cibelles which was about a 10 - 15 min straight shot to the hotel. The only problem that I initially had encountered was that I could not find the entrance to the hotel when arriving from this direction! I thought that it would have been somewhere on the street corner fronting the Neptune Fountain Plaza - somewhere near the Starbucks and the VIP restaurant, but instead, it was that side streets that passes the Chamber of Deputies. First of all, those of you who are seeking enormous hotel rooms, or humongous suites, this may not prove to be a suitable property for your tastes, as this is Europe, after all, and rooms are often smaller than those found in North America. Secondly, this property is located in probably one of the most exquisite positions in downtown Madrid and space certainly is at a premium here. Finally, the hotel will also be celebrating its centenary next year, and back then, a premium was just not put on large hotel rooms, and this property reflects that tradition. However, you should know that I found the rooms to be more than adequate as they were quite well furnished even if they are a bit compact, and they utilized their space limitations in an intelligent and efficient manner. Furthermore, although I personally am a fan of minimalist modern design, or modernist and comfortable decor found at most US Westin properties, the traditional furnishings of this hotel are quite appropriate and in keeping with the esthetic of the property. We were given Room # 636 -- The Palace Suite -- it even has a plaque outside its door -- that had a small entranceway leading directly to a living room, whereas the sleeping quarters were through a door off to one's left. There was a door to the right, but it appeared to be a connecting entranceway to the room next door and it appeared to be locked. Whether it was a powder room or something else, I do not know as we had no need of it. The living room was quite nice and was well furnished with period furniture and within each of the eaves (as it was sited in one of the magnificent cupolas atop the building) there was an inlaid glass panel with the hotel's logo etched in script. In addition to the full size sofa, there was an easy chair, a dining room table for 4, a work desk against one of the walls of the room, as well as the obligatory Flat Panel TV on what I guess was the mini bar. If one were expecting a huge room within which to throw a wild party, I guess one might have been dissatisfied, but if one had hoped to conduct a quiet business meeting or perhaps a romantic soiree, then this room would be perfect for your needs. The elegant surroundings for this vacationing party of 2 more than exceeded our expectations! The bedroom with separate door off the hallway opened into a well decorated compact bedroom with a lounging chair. However, the signature hallmark of this room was not what was within its walls, but rather, what was without, for there was a door that opened onto its own private terrace overlooking the Neptune Fountain and the Ritz Hotel! We often had drinks late at night savoring the view, but you should be aware that they turn off the Neptune fountain's lights at midnight. Further, The Palace has the better view of the fountain, as it faces its front, whereas the Ritz ,only has a view of his behind!! The room's en-suite bathroom again was appropriately outlayed with a separate tub, and as well a glass enclosed shower. The vanity was situated in the middle of the bathroom, the shower stall and tub to its left and the W/C to its right. The shower door, as well as the glass door leading to the W/C were each etched with the hotel's logo. Because the bathroom had both a tub and a shower stall, it actually might be a bit tighter than the bathrooms of the standard rooms at the hotel. In addition, two at a time at the vanity might prove somewhat challenging, and I think that my only other quibble would be that the shower stall ought to have door handles on both sides, so that can pull it closed to insure a tight fit when taking a shower. However, I do not recall any significant water seepage on the floor when exiting the stall, so in all probability, it is just my predilection for exactitude that notes this minor issue. Nightly turndown was provided 4/5 nights and was quite nice. Finally, as an American of now some girth (unfortunately), a well working Air-Conditioning system is a requirement for me, and the hotel came thru with flying colors, in this respect. In fact, of the 2 rooms I sampled, each of them had a powerful and efficient air conditioning system, and on the Queen bed that I had slept on, I received a direct, head-on blast from the A/C vent which was located on the wall directly opposite to my bed -- it was heaven and there are benefits to a compact room, especially in Spain's heat! Those who like to sleep a bit warmer can simply turn up the thermostat, but for those of you, who like me, appreciate a cool breeze on them when they sleep, while the wife sleeps warmer, you will not be disappointed. And, yes, I did mention a Queen bed in the suite that I had occupied. It did not matter to me, as I sleep on a Queen at home (yes, space is at a premium in my area, as well!) but it was the standard Westin issue bed which set the standard for beds in the hotel industry, so the smaller size proved to be of no issue to me and I had a restful sleep each night of my stay at the hotel. The hotel does have King bedded rooms, I believe, should you require a larger bed. The Green Marble and what appears to be dark Mahogany wood decor of the SPG floor that we were placed on, provides a striking interior design that bespeaks evident luxury without over the top flourishes, perfectly in keeping with the Old World tradition of the property. So too, does the lower lobby of the hotel with its grand upper steps leading to the upper lobby and the truly impressive and must be seen to be believed, Beaux Art/Art Nouveau domed dining room and adjacent bar. One can easily imagine well attired men and women at the very end of the Edwardian era, descending those magnificent steps, or more recently, American tourists flush with almighty Dollar, the only currency that really mattered in a post-war Europe ravaged in the aftermath of the carnage and destruction of WWII. Well, things certainly do change, but one must soldier on! For those looking for the health club, it is on the seventh floor and is reachable via a flight of steps near Room # 650. Just go thru the nearby exit door and ascend to the next landing. The fitness room is available by key card access 24 hours/day and is quite well equipped, but the view from there, alas, is not of the Neptune fountain, but of some other buildings and the nearby NH Hotel. It has dual adjustable A/C units and a cold water dispenser with free ear buds, as well. I did not dine at the hotel as a result of the rather forbidding breakfast prices, but had I been there for the Sunday Opera brunch, I might have partaken in the offering. However, I can recommend a nearby restaurant for lunch or dinner -- La Finca de Susanna, which is within a couple of blocks of the hotel. La Finca de Susanna is part of a mini-chain of differently named restaurants, all of whom apparently offer a similar type of cuisine at various locations in and around Madrid. Further, La Finca de Susanna would not look out of place on the Upper West Side of New York or in that city's SoHo or Tribeca neighborhoods, with smartly dressed waiters and crisp white linen tablecloths as I assume that the other restaurants are similarly decorated. I had been told by the wait staff that they all offer, for the value conscious, the approximately 12 Euro Menu del Dia for lunch, which was certainly the best dining bargain we had while in the capital. Alas, I also was advised that they do not offer a similar prix fixe for dinner, but given that I saw a number of regular diners ordering huge plates of mussels at lunch, and that entree was not on the Menu del Dia and its price was reasonable, as well, I can safely assume that must have a significant following at dinner, as well. Although my wife did not often require the services of the hotel concierges as my wife speaks Spanish and Madrid is easily navigable, they were invaluable to us for obtaining reservations on a moment's notice, for such restaurants as the Casa Botin, as the Palace name counts for something around Madrid! And I know that some of you may consider this restaurant too frequented by tourists -- and I was seated with many other English speakers -- in fact, one table we became quite friendly with and later roamed the Spanish Capital at night after dinner -- but the suckling pig was quite good, as well, and anyway, it is reputed to both be the oldest restaurant in the world, as well as having one Francisco Goya, as a former employee! As others have noted above, the Thyseen museum is across the street from the hotel and it is quite nice as it has a range of European art from over the centuries. What I was surprised at was that the Baroness only had started collecting in the 1980's and has yet amassed a considerable number of artworks! Additionally, a number of American artists represented, among them Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer, etc. In fact, all 3 major art museums are a credit to Spain, and they all should be visited if at all possible, and luckily, that is one of the strengths of the positioning of the hotel. As discussed, the Thyssen is across the street (you pass it on your way to the hotel if utilizing the Aerobus), and the Prado is across another street from the hotel. Finally, the Reina Sofia (the Modern Art museum that displays Picasso's Guernica) is housed in a former hospital/convent, and is no more than a 15 min walk from the hotel. Madrid's newest and the 4th major art institution -- the Caixa Forum -- one actually passes on the way to the Reina Sofia -- and this is the same route one would take if one wanted to go to the main railway station of Madrid -- the Atocha Station (also about a 15 min. walk from the hotel). By the way, I do not recommend you walk to/from the station with luggage, unless you only have a backpack, as the streets can be crowded at times. All of the museums presented their artwork in up to date, modern surroundings, with effective lighting on many of their respective masterpieces. My wife informed me that this was not always the case, and that when she last was in Madrid as a college student some time ago, the only game in town was the Prado, and that back then, the method of displaying the art was primitive, at best. The Reina Sofia and the Prado have free admission on certain evenings and some weekend days, and I believe that the Caixa is always free (I did not visit this museum), and the Thyseen, as a private museum, is never free, so pony up for that one! But, if you are staying any significant time at this hotel, you could visit a large chunk of the collections of both the Prado and the Reina Sofia without paying any admission charge as a result of the perfect location of this hotel. All in all, we had a superlative stay at the Palace which was made all the more so by the gracious hospitality of the GM and his employees. My wife and I certainly will return to this property, as we never even made it to Toledo or Segovia, instead opting to visit the royal palaces of El Escorial (by the way, I think the roundtrip bus services might be a better way to go than the train we took from the Atocha station), and the equally worthwhile Royal Palace at Aranjuez. I also mentioned above, that we had our best extended stay at any SPG property and the reason I had to caveat that statement was because we next went to Barcelona and stayed at the Le Meridien and received equally fantastic treatment from the GM and the hotel staff. Inasmuch as that stay was an all too brief 3 nights, this seemed an appropriate way to differentiate two equally excellent hotels that provide the best in terms of customer service, accommodations and location.

This hotel was one that pleasantly surprised me. Arriving 3 hours late from a delayed flight from Lisbon I was very happy to find that the reception had actually taken the time to call the airport and reschedule my car to meet me when my plane landed. Got whisked off to downtown Madrid to this hotel, arrived to find myself in front of a very charming typical Spanish Architecture designed palace. The lobby itself is amazing, not new or modern at all but excellently adapted without compromising the design. Not hard to navigate at all. The receptionist that received me (I could kick myself for forgetting his name) was I believe the best staffmember of any hotel that I have ever been to. As soon as he saw me, he told me \"oh, you've been delayed, then I won't keep you, I've upgraded your room and sent you a fruit platter, and the AC is set to your preferred temperature\". Less than a minute later, I was in the elevator on my way to a room which was facing away from the main entrance (there was some construction going on there which was sort of noisy). The rooms are MASSIVE and very comfortable, the westin bed... Words cannot describe how marvelous it is to sleep in one of those. ACs are controlled from within the rooms, it was very easy to change the temperature, internet works fine, and the bathtub - wow... I went down later on in the afternoon to thank that receptionist - he was gone and no one could tell me what his name was... There's security in the lobby that DOES actually differentiate between the guests and visitors... I took a nap in the afteroon to wake up to a second fruit plate from the hotel \"we hope the delay did not inconvenience you too much, please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay better\"... Now, that's service... Checkout the next morning was just as smooth, although with a different receptionist. What else is there to say ? A great hotel with great service and excellent staff. Well worth the stay, well worth the visit, highly recommended (especially the green apples by the exit of every floor...) An experience to remember. I am definitely going back there the next time I'm in Madrid.

From the fancy doorman in full Wizard of Oz guard garb, to the expansive lobby with marble floors and trompe l'oeil paintings, to the impressive rotunda tea room area with a huge chandelier and leaded stained glass dome, you'll feel privileged staying here, even if you're a commoner, like me. The location is both handy and prestigious. It's right across a fountain square from the Prado museum, and walking distance to several Metro stops and the train station (if you don't have loads of luggage) and there are many fun tapas bars and restaurants nearby. It's also only a 15 minute walk to the Puerta Sol and Gran Via but these are typical tourist haunts with t-shirt shops, chain stores and restaurants with pictures of their food in the window that spell certain doom all over the world. The double decker tour buses stop right across the square every 15 minutes or so. You can select an \"old world\" or \"modern\" route and you can get off and on at will. Some visitors think these are too \"toursity\" but I think they are a great way to get oriented or to use as your own semi-private transport system. One nearby place that may fool you, as it did me, is a chain called VIPS. It may look like a Spanish Denny's but they offer good, cheap food, in a nice setting, at any time. Keep in mind that many Spanish restaurants open for lunch at 1:00 pm, close for siesta and re-open at 10 pm. VIPS serves many Americanized variations (great for kids, fussy eaters or those with a jones for a burger), plus beer and wine and have a convenience store tacked on so you can take sandwiches and drinks with you as you tour the city, or pick up stuff to re-stock the inventory you took from the mini bar but are too cheap to pay for. Take a right out of the hotel door and VIPS is one block away. Of course there are many more dining options near the hotel and I would urge you to go exploring. Take your first right or left leaving the front door and follow the small streets behind the hotel (not in the direction of the fountain or the Prado) and you can't help but wander into a maze of tapas bars, jazz clubs, and pubs. Don't be shy, wander in, belly up to the bar, order a local beer or glass of wine and point to what you want to eat. Be aware that you may receive some tidbits \"on the house\" and that glasses are small, so ask for \"grande\". My assigned room was nice and it had a balcony with a view of the fountain square, but it was noisy due to traffic and a cop who blew his whistle with every exhale. There are motorized window shutters but I only discovered these after I requested a quieter room towards the back of the hotel. Both rooms were large (keep in mind, I get upgraded) with modern marble bathrooms. The rooms, halls and elevators are beautifully done with fine materials and have a solid old world feel lacking in your basic Sheraton or Hilton with their crack house security doors and Formica counters. The bed, as in nearly every Starwood room was plush with a slew of pillows. Although I ate like a pig for 3 days, I didn\u2019t' sample the fitness facilities. There's also a very large park on the other side of the Prado that would be great for running or walking. The front desk staff and the concierge were quick to please and spoke perfect English. The Wi-Fi in my room didn't work (this is a common Starwood issue in Europe) but the wired ethernet connection did. I get internet access for free (Platinum status), otherwise it will cost you $18 euros a day, which is outrageous in a hotel of this standing and price. Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes, if I'm on an expense report. I have no complaints except for the price- $290 euros a night.

El Prado museum is to your East and another great museum is across the street. You can walk easily to Plaza Mayor and to the Atocha train station. You also need to walk several blocks to get to the nearest Madrid metro station. And taxis are very plentiful and cheap in the city. The hotel is 100 years old and is just beautiful. Check out the small museum on the ground level before the restaurant and check out which heads of state & celebrities have stayed there before. Rooms: As Starwood Golds, we were upgraded to a room with Premium View on the Starwood floor. We had a nice view of the plaza. The rooms are very nice but they are definitely small compared to US standards. The beds are indeed heavenly! After walking for so long we slept like babies every night. The shower is also fantastic as expected. I tried to kindly ask for an upgrade to a junior suite from the hotel manager and was nicely shot down. I thought maybe we can get the suite as me and my wife are both Golds but it was again pointed out to us that G+G is not equal to P (Platinum) :-) Service: I think this is what separates hotels from the average hotels around. Everything we asked for was done fast. We asked for a few electrical adaptors, extra towels several times, a tea kettle...all delivered fast and with a smile. Check in & Check out was done fast and pleasantly. Concierge was used once and he was great. We even got a call from manager's assistant if we needed anything. Turndown service was done super fast and all maids we interacted always greeted us. Treatment of Gold Elites: Again, we were given a standard view on the Starwood floor with a premium view. A couple of waters each day. I do not expect much more from Starwood. And this is the reason I am still loyal to Hilton who treats Golds much better. For starters, Hilton Golds get free internet! Each 24 hr internet access will cost you 16.10 euros plus tax in the Westin. For 2 days of internet we had to pay 38 euros total! For example, we stayed at the Hilton Madrid airport the final night before our flight and, as Golds, we received free internet, room on the executive floor with lounge access including a full breakfast buffet for all 4 of us.

I booked in advance directly online on the Westin Hotel website and got an amazing deal - stay 5 nights, pay for 3 nights in advance receive 2 nights free. Wonderful! The only negative was my room was one that needed to have a little bit of rehab. It was a clean, great room but some of the furniture was a bit frayed. My friend paid full price for her stay and I noted her room was in tip top shape, still not a problem since everything else was so perfect. The service was 5 star, especially the concierge - namely Ricardo! Brit Air 1st class lost ALL MY LUGGAGE - God bless anyone who transfers at Heathrow, please hand carry all your luggage on board with you. I arrived at the Westin Palace on a Wednesday and the concierges (mostly Ricardo) stalked Brit Air daily trying to get me my luggage, which finally arrived on Saturday! Thank you Ricardo for staying on top of the problem! It helped that Ricardo warned them that I had a much needed prescription in the 1st class luggage! remember that one next time, hopefully never will have a \"next time\". Upon arrival at the Westin Palace there was quite a hullaballoo going on as MTV was hosting the EMA Awards in Madrid and most of the stars were gracing their presence upon us at the Westin. The star guests at the hotel were Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Shakira, Kes$ha, etc. The policia were patrolling the front doors where fans waited at all hours, screaming when a star appeared. It was fun with the exception that I was wearing the same outfit (had it laundered by housekeeping several times of course) every time I came and went - sort of like walking down the red carpet! I am single and blonde and many times I have been called a Shakira look alike, so much to my chagrin I had to be seen by the fans wearing the same outfit over and over. Kind of funny. Anyway, another plus service story was the GM of the hotel. I had smartly bought travel insurance and when the luggage never arrived I called the hotel operator to find out how to call the USA travel insurance collect so I could go out and buy some cosmetics etc. I thought I had followed her instructions but upon checking out on morning of Day 6, found I had international phone charges of what amounted to about $500 USD!! With no time to waste at checkout as I was hurrying to catch an international flight to Morocco, I felt best to revisit the bill upon my return at the Westin for one more night the following week before I flew back to the US. When I did return to the Westin from Morocco, I made an appt. to see the GM about my hideous phone bill. He was quite professional and sweet. He went to confirm with the hotel operator the dialing instruction she had given to me, reported back to me that I had been one digit off for correct dialing and credited the entire phone bill - helping me to have sincerely warm heart felt memories of the Westin and Madrid after all. My room was much better quality on my return for the one night as I was paying the normal rate, no deal that night. Food was great, there is a Starbucks practically next door, great street full of tapas Bars beside and behind the hotel. I made sure to check out the only competitor, the Ritz Carlton across the plaza. No contest, stay there if you are retired, grey haired and want a very unhappening quiet hotel. What else can I say, you MUST stay at the Westin Palace Hotel, I will when I return!", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germantown, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms and public spaces.

The room we got was spacious and well appointed, but we immediately noticed the sheets not fully fitted. No biggie. Then we noticed the stained and peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, the door of which was pretty battered (possibly water damaged) and in need of paint and repair, and the toilet seat which was up, which suggested a bit of a rushed cleaning job. Again, no biggie, but for US$350 per night, you expect a faultless experience. What really capped it off as an ordinary experience was the clearly stained shower robe hanging in the bathroom - it looked like something you would find in a cheap motel on a major highway - and the check-in advice that the hotel does not offer free internet, despite being sure I booked such a rate. I didn't follow it up at the time because I thought I might have made a mistake, but after checking out of the hotel I came across the original booking which clearly stated \"Tv Internet With Keyboard, Movies On Demand\" compared with the other booking options which referred to \"internet for a fee\".

First off, as a person that enjoys walking in cities, the location was superb. Across the street was a little quick-service cafe for morning coffee, pastries, bocadillos, etc.. The hotel is approximately a 5 minute walk from Banco de Espana Metro subway station and 15-20 minutes walk from Plaza del Sol (a Metro/train hub and also start of a shopping area with El Corte Ingles department store). It is also extremely close to the Prado Museum (about 2 blocks away). For those that do not like walking around too much, taxi cabs are also readily available at the hotel. The neighborhood is a government district so there is not much character, but it is extremely safe, with police patrolling regularly in the vicinity (due to the need to protect the government offices). Now for the hotel itself: The hotel is a historic building, so the rooms are not as big as what you would expect in the United States. However, the room we got was nice, with one large King sized bed, a large bathroom (toilet in a separate little room, double sinks, nice bathtub/shower with round curtain bar). The room was well maintained, clean, and comfortable. The closet had a safe and was roomy and could keep all of our clothes as well as store our suitcases out of the way. The LCD TV was nice and had a few English channels, but not HD so it could have been even nicer. The computers in the business center give you 1 free hour of internet, which is nice for quick checks of email, Facebook, or just finding a place on Google maps. A nice touch for those that need a quick internet fix but are not constantly needing access. The concierge staff and reception staff were extremely helpful. This is the shining star of our stay. The airlines lost one of our luggage on a flight from Barcelona to Madrid and the concierge staff went above and beyond to stay in touch with the airlines and nag them for updates on the bag.

We were given the card keys and let ourselves in only to find our room was equipped for disabled guests :ie no bath or shower cubicle, but a shower \"area.\" Why had I bothered to book in advance directly with them?

The room was huge, and very comfortable; the bathroom had 2 washbasins, bath, and separate walk-in shower and loo. The decor was immaculate and the room faced inwards so was perfectly quiet. A huge bowl of fruit was refreshed halfway through our stay (we would have welcomed replacement of cutlery and plates when they had been used, but this seems to be a peculiarity of 5-star hotels that offer fruit; once you've used the plate, away it goes). Breakfast under the glass dome was very lavish and the staff could not have been more attentive. Indeed there seemed to be staff everywhere at all times, alert and ready to be helpful--I cannot understand those who say they had difficulty getting refills of coffee etc as in our experience you only had to blink to be offered orange juice, coffee, whatever. The bar staff were also very good--after a few nights, one waiter even brought our usual aperitifs without being asked for them. The staff were uniformly polite, friendly and charming. Marc Lannoy runs a tight ship, in our opinion, and we much enjoyed the buzzing and efficient atmosphere of the hotel. When we arrived our bags were immediately taken care of, and the doormen were always ready to get taxis etc. Check-in was swift and friendly; since we had come overnight on the train, we arrived before our room was ready and were offered an alternative but since we were keen to get the bed-size requested we opted to relax in the rotunda and read, with a cappuccino, until the room was ready. The food in the restaurant is good, if pricey, but no higher than prices at comparable etablishments in this city. We ate in the main restaurant, in the bar, and also in the Asian Gallery, all of which were good. My only plea would be for an omelette, or even a cold Spanish tortilla, on the bar menu! The breakfast chef cooks superb omelettes, and it would be nice to get one for lunch or a light supper. The location of this hotel is superb---right opposite the Prado in one direction and the Thyssen-Bornemisza in the other, and also in easy walking distance of Puerta del Sol and Plaza de Santa Anna, where there are many places to eat. It has the feel of a real 'Grand Hotel', and the rotunda is a delight to be in at any time of day, comfortable and beautiful, with room for all sorts of different activities.

No one to help with luggage, and barely to open the doors. Our room was said to be not ready, and we were asked to wait.

The room has been very well prepared. I had requested reception to organize 4 bath towels at all times, but this was always ignored, unless I asked again to house keeping, either in the morning or for evening turndown. Breakfast is good quality, with great selection of fresh and qualitative ingredients. Great juices. We were lucky enough to be seated under the dome each morning, which made breakfast a lovely moment. I would however say that it is rather understaffed ; it is sometimes difficult to call someone's attention for an order of coffee, let alone a refill. This is a great place for either business or leisure. The promotions they are running on their website make it really good value. The location can hardly be beaten : convenient, cloqe to everything, yet quiet (double glazed windows are ugly, but very effective from a soundproofing perspective). But this is a huge hotel, with close to 500 rooms and suites. It is buzzing.

The service both times was extraordinary. The property is very clean and very classic - just what you'd expect in a building created in the image of a castle. The room rate was affordable, and my guests loved it as well. I managed a meeting there, and overall the meeting space was large, spacious and more than adequate. The service was fantastic - what a friendly, helpful group of people. And while I have only mediocre Spanish skills, they were more than happy to switch to English simply to ease my discomfort. Beautiful gym - large but mostly quiet. Workout by Westin. You can't beat the location - it's within walking distance of Plaza del Sol, Atocha train station, the Prado and other museums, Plaza Santa Ana, and Serrano. I am sure that there are many other areas that you can walk to, but that's all I had a chance to see while I was there. What I found a bit inconvenient was the lack of a quick place to run to for bottled water and snacks - there was no store in the hotel itself. There was a Starbucks nearby, in the same building but with an external entrance - so this was fine for something quick to eat. There is also a VIPS that has a convenience store of sorts. Both are outside of the hotel. And, of course, abundant shopping and restaurants a short walk away - El Corte Ingles, anyone? I agree that meals in the hotel could get a bit pricey, particularly breakfast. But all of my meals were really wonderful, so I would say worth the money.

The bedroom we had was an executive club room and was lovely but even so I had asked to upgrade cos using Starwood club points and the charge of 35 euros extra only gave you free apples in the so called coffee corner (next to the lifts) free wifi (big deal) and movies except LOL the movie channel didn't work so they refunded the extra charge which was fair cos for an upgrade you got very little extra IMO.

For people wanting to go to Madrid for tourist or historic reasons this is a great location to be in, otherwise you may choose the more tranquil and classy Salamanca neighborhood. But back to the Palace I would definately recomend it if the price is right, in other words not at any cost, because i believe there are some newer ad better hotels in Madrid that for the same price would be a better option in my opinion. The only issue with the hotel is that some rooms require major renovation, but others dont, so i believe that if you manage to get a renovated room you will very much enjoy your stay.

The downsides are that most tourists will spend most of their time in the livelier neighborhoods around Santa Ana, Sol and Plaza Mayor, and these are a 5 to 15 minute walk. Also, the hotel's grandeur seems to be fading; our room had stained wallpaper and curtains and nicked paint on the doorways, and we were allotted a single bar of soap for 3 people to share for use at the bath and sink, and only a couple bottles of hair conditioner during our week stay. The staff are very nice but we made requests of the them that were not met. The TV is old and most important, wifi is available only at a hefty daily fee. The wifi thing is especially annoying as there is free wifi throughout most of the surrounding neighborhood. You can just take your laptop up to any cafe at Plaza Santa Ana and enjoy free wifi and people watching, however, one should not have to resort to this after paying so much for a room at the Westin. Breakfast at the hotel was terribly expensive - one can get a coffee, toast and juice nearby at one-tenth the cost. I realize that premium prices are the norm in top hotels, but there is a point where one feels that they are being taken for a fool.

Very happy to travel by foot/metro and loves to explore like a local. All expenses paid by my company. The location: on a busy intersection, the Palace Hotel is about 400m from Puerto de Sol (the heart of Madrid). Being such a flashy hotel, I really felt like a tourist (which I don't like) - there's a Star Bucks in the hotel building and there are beggars/street performers vying for your spare change. I also stayed at Hosatl Luz (a budget 2 star hotel, about 250m west of Sol) which was in a far better location. Having said that, this area was very safe and within walking distance of many of Madrid's hot spots. El Banco is the closest Metro stop, about 3 blocks or 300m away - very walkable. The room: I stayed in room 378, a premium deluxe room for about 270 Euro per night, including buffet breakfast. Having travelled extensively with work, I would expect to pay no more than 180 Euro for a place like this. The internet was a massive rip-off at 18 Euro per day, or about 15 Euro per hour!!! The decor was standard - nothing out of this world. The bed was super-comfy and bathroom was well appointed and spacious. There was an electronic safe but was small, and did not fit my 15\" laptop. Bathrobe was available, but no slippers. Quality of the shampoo was poor for this kind of hotel. The room and bathroom were very clean, as you'd expect for a five star hotel. Like a previous reviewer, I'd expect an LCD TV in this day and age for a hotel of this class. The hotel: built in 1912, it is a grand old building with a beautiful facade kept in beautiful condition. This is not a hotel for those with wheelchairs/prams, as there are about 12 steps from the street to the lobby. There is a beautiful internal lead-light dome (see photos) where breakfast/meals are served - this was just lovely to sit under and gaze at. Breakfast was buffet and included in the room rate (once again, my company paid for everything), but for this kind of money I was not blown away - I have stayed in better hotels for far less. There was fruit, cereals, bakery items, salmon and eggs/sausages offered in the breakfast buffet. The coffee was average but the OJ was superb (freshly squeezed). The hsopitality: the service is what you would expect from a five star hotel. It's difficult rating a hotel when work pays for everything. Don't get me wrong, the Palace Hotel is lovely and grand and everything you'd expect from a five star hotel, except for a few shortcomings - lack of ramps from the street to the lobby (very annoying with lots of luggage -or if you're in a wheelchair), ridiculously priced internet/room rates and lack of some 'must-haves' from a 5 star hotel (e.g. LCD TV, slippers, etc). The only reason I am NOT recommending this hotel is due to the pricing - if you can find a rate under 200 Euro, then you may consider staying (forget about the internet charges!). One last thing - there were MAJOR road works about 50% completed when we were there.

Yet I was slightly disappointed due to some minor issues which when compared to other 5 star hotels made me rate it only as an average hotel. First of all I was surprised to see that in a 5 star hotel you don't get any toothpaste or shower gel in the standard room amenities. Secondly, it would be good to finally upgrade from the retro TVs and get some LCD or plasmas (same applies to the telephones). Remote control would need some repairs to allow the user performing basic operations with just a single press of the button and not in five or six attempts. Also, I still don't understand why in the year 2010, a hotel of this class would charge 20 euros per day for the internet - I think it is ridiculous. Cleaning services were a bit too loud and I don't know why when I first walked to the room, one of the paintings was laying on the floor instead of hanging on the wall - again someone should make sure that the room is really ready to meet another guest. Finally, I simply thought that this hotel needs some refurbishment as it is showing some signs of wearing down.

Also, guests seemed more diverse and the atmosphere was more relaxed. My partner pointed out that he'd never seen people coming back from jogging at the Ritz (which actually sounds like a great idea given the Parque del Retiro close proximity). Also, we found the late-night card entry very convenient. The room, in the third floor was an adequate size, the beds are VERY soft and I expressed some concern to my partner.

The Westin is perfectly located, close to El Prado, El Retiro and a 5 min taxi to Gran Via/Chueca/Sol/Opera etc. A few (small) negatives. The bathroom's wallpaper was noticeably peeling due possibly to humidity and there was an ugly stain on the bathtub. Oh, and most toiletries are available on demand but not in the room.

The carpets and decor look outdated and worn. The television in our room was a box television that was quite small, and the lining on the tub in our bathroom was chipping, so that when I got out of the bathtub I would have pieces of white chips in my hair. Apart from that there were constant fees. The fee for internet is 16 euros (20 US dollars) a day! Additionally, because of my husbands hotel status we were told that we could receive free coffee once a day. Of course I took advantage of this! However, when we checked out of the hotel, there was 15 euro worth of service charge for the coffee. They forgot to mention that it was an additional 5 euros ($6.50) for the free coffee to be brought to the room. As rated, the hotel was clean. Our rooms were well taken care of, however, if you decided to hang out in your hotel room, you better put the DO NOT DISTURB sign up, because you will be disturbed...a lot! It felt like we were constantly being bothered. Maid service, mini bar service, turn down service. At one point my husband and I were taking an afternoon nap and forgot to put the sign up and there was a knock on our door. The maid gave us a total of 2 seconds (if that) to answer the door, before we know it she's using her own key to get in, and were yelling \"No, por favor!\" Annoying! Finally, it is mine and my husbands habit to immediately check out our view when we walk into our hotel room for the first time. Our view was a complete let down.

The room doors here are very heavy, and close very noisely unless extreme care is taken, and needless to say, the bosterous kids were not taking such care. When I stuck my head out to see what was going on, two room service carts were being removed, and I asked one of the room service waiters how many kids were in the suite....and was informed that there were 10 or 11! I called down to the duty manager to enquire about alternatives if the noise continued, and was informed that the large group of kids were assigned to 5 rooms on the floor, and had been in residence for 2 weeks....and that if the loud noise continued past 10pm that I should call back. It was an unprecented situation, that generated neither an apology nor even an acknowledgement from the hotel management that screaming 3, 4, and 5 year olds running through the halls, slamming doors, and singing/shouting/playing loudly in their communal room might be disruptive to our enjoyment of our accommodation (which had an adjoining door). The location of the property is outstanding, but current management has turned a luxurious property into a run-of-the-mill Westin.

The hotel has a very classic and elegant decor (you won't mistake it for a W) with an atrium that is beautiful and excellent for people watching. The rooms are comfortable, again with a classic decor. We had an executive king bed room. The bed was fantastic and really large which I like. Given its proximity to a number of Spanish government buildings a number of politicians appear to stay there. We noticed a number of secret service types and police milling about at all times while we were there. The extra security was never an issue for us and if nothing else it is nice to stay in such a secure hotel. The hotel's location is fantastic in my opinion. You are across the street from both the Prado and the Thyssen (and the botanical garden) and a few minutes walk from the Reina Sofia. It is great central location for walking the city. Moreover, the hotel is walking distance from the Antocha rail station which is great for taking the high speed train for day trips our of Madrid. The service at the hotel was professional and efficient though hardly the warmest I have experience. The hotel concierge was helpful and made a number of dinner reservations for us. I can't comment on room price as I used SPG points for our entire stay. We did have one (very) overpriced cocktail in the hotel bar. The bar is very comfortable with greens and dark woods. As is the custom in Spain we received a number of small appetizers with our drink. While the music and atmosphere were nice we did not see the need to have more than one drink there since there is so much to experience in Madrid. We never ate at the hotel as it was way way too expensive and again, there is so much to experience food wise in Madrid. After all, we did not come to Madrid to eat in the hotel.

The hotel is located in a very central area of Madrid. It is a historic buliding that is classy and well cared for. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are gorgeous. We would have loved to have a jacuzzi tub but oh well. The breakfast was included in the price of the room which was great as the Spaniards tend not to eat the large breakfast fares that Americans do and meals in Spain tend to be expensive. Hence the spread that they put together is outstanding. It even includes free champagne to make mimosas. Regarding breakfast, one word of advice, in general we found eggs to be made very runny in Spain. This sounds trivial but when we were at the hotel we had to learn how to tell them that we wanted the eggs cooked \"hard\". Once we learned how to say it there were many other guests asking us how to say the same. (Too bad I have already forgotten the phrase). The hotel is in walking distance to the major attractions in Madrid incluing el Prado Museum, el bario de Las Letras y el Gran Via. It is also close to the train line. We took a train to the airport when leaving. Although the hotel's front desk recommended that we take a cab, we found the train system easy to navigate and of course cheap. My only complaints about this hotel is that the cost of movies is ridiculously expensive and there is no free internet. I think it cost $20 euro to rent a movie. My husband and I were desperate to hear some English langague on the television and so we rented a movie but the cost was outrageous. Lastly, plush hotels need to realize that internet use should be free. After paying a hefty fee for a room, patrons should not be charged additionally for internet access. The lower priced hotels offer this for free. As a bonus, the hotel has a very modern gym that is located at the top of the hotel and adjacent to an outdoor terrace.

Luckily there was a good deal directly on their site, including breakfast so we booked that. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and had no problem checking in immediately. The hotel doesn't look big from the outside, but once you're walking around to find your room, you realise how big it is. There was also a lot of construction around the hotel so the taxi had to drive around several times trying to find the best way to drop us off. The room was nice, enough space for a couple of nights, nice decor, a pretty view and complimentary bottled water (but that could just be the SPG floor). The bathroom was spacious and there were 2 sinks which i always prefer. The bed was typical Westin and super comfortable. Had a few issues with the turndown service, especially since you eat dinner so late in Madrid, they would continue to knock/walk in and we would still be there. I think they need to do turndown later in this city. The breakfast was excellent and in such a beautiful room with a big stainglassed atrium. The selection was nice, cooked-to-order eggs, regular eggs, meats, cheeses, breads, even churros one morning. Sometimes the service was a bit spotty to get coffee though, but overall, great breakfast. The location is the best part. You're right acoss from the Prado, as well as the smaller museum (although still big!) that I'm now forgetting the name. It was perfect to just walk outside and just exploring. Madrid is very walkable in general and this was a great base. I also liked that the nightlife was 5-minute away, but not so close that you would hear anything noisy at night. There aren't restaurants right outside the door, but again, literally 5 minutes away there are streets of tapas bars and restaurants. Check out was easy as well and we got a cab right away. I would highly recommend this hotel for a city break.

The two properties are basically right across the Paseo del Prado from one another, and I personally find them quite comparable, so much so that I let price alone be the determining factor in my choice of stay. As has been mentioned in some reviews of the Ritz, my room there was slightly tired, but not enough so to be objectionable. I prefer the drive-up appeal of the Ritz, but prefer the common areas of the Palace. I am an SPG Gold and was staying on an amazingly reasonable promotional rate. The first room I was given was not a renovated room, so I asked the desk to move me up to an SPG floor where the rooms were renovated, and they gladly and quickly did so. The rooms are elegantly done up, and the baths are large and luxurious. The courtyard rooms have only a view of the interior common area cupola and other rooms, but I prefer that in central Madrid because traffic buzzes until almost dawn on weekends and the courtyard provides an excellent noise barrier for a good night's sleep. I've found the staff to be a bit more relaxed and casual than at the Ritz, but the care is excellent, with people making an effort to remember my name, which is impressive in a hotel of its size. Obviously there have been many reviewer comments about the Prado, Thyssen, and Reina Sophia, and all of them stand tall among the world's great museums. There are many things I love about Madrid, but I always recommend a late afternoon stroll through the Retiro Park on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to enjoy the masses of elegant and happy citizens enjoying that tremendous city asset. For a luxury remembrance of Madrid, try the Loewe boutique in the Salamanca district. Loewe is essentially to Spain what Hermes is to France, but an item there can be more special because Loewe isn't widely distributed internationally and the quality speaks for itself.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel but $25 hot dog?!\u201d", "Author": "BirdCatcher", "ReviewID": "UR42480232", "Content": "Yes, the $25 hot dog pretty much sums up this hotel: it's magnificent, but you may not respect yourself in the morning.

On check-in I was upgraded to a newly refurbished Executive Room which was surprisingly small. I wonder how much space would be available in the lesser Deluxe and Standard rooms. Anyway, the room was modern, comfortable and quiet. But the breakfasts were a great disappointment. Fortunately my tariff included breakfast, but anyone paying the exorbitant price for it separately would be doubly disappointed. Flavourless coffee, incompetently cooked eggs, fermenting stewed fruits, slow replenishment of buffet, and indifferent service attendants undermined my otherwise pleasant 4 night stay at this hotel. On the other hand, the fitness centre is surprisingly good \u2013 large and well equipped for a hotel \u2013 and was usually empty of other hotel guests.

The interior of the hotel is beautiful, particularly the main lounge which features a massive ornate glass dome reminiscent of the one in Galeries Lafayette in Paris.

It felt like a business-traveler's hotel, which is probably their main clientele. It was pretty, but soul-less. I booked using Starwood points, so I had two free nights. Kudos to the Starwood Preferred Guest program for making this so easy. Had I not used points, I think the room would have been about $300/night. That seems a little high to me. The location was good (very near the Prado Museum), but in a touristy area. The hotel was also under construction near the entrance, so that you had to wade through a mess to get to and from the hotel. The room was fairly large and had all of the special Westin touches - the Heavenly Bed and Showerhead. But I think our room must have been recently renovated, because it seemed sparse, as if it was missing some decorative furniture. We did have a window that opened onto the street next door, but it also looked out over a construction zone, which is not the hotel's fault, but it was noisy. One legitimate complaint is that this is a very large hotel, and as we exited the elevator, the signs indicating the direction to the guest rooms did not have our room listed, so we wandered around for about 15 minutes and then generally got lost each time we tried to return. We also had to wait 30 minutes for the doorman to bring up our bags, although he didn't appear busy. Check-in was easy, though, and the public spaces were beautiful. Stay away from the hotel restaurants, bar, and room service, though. It was ridiculously overpriced. No one should pay $15 for a glass of standard wine in a bar in Spain. And for the in-room breakfast, we would have needed to pay about $50 for eggs and toast. This makes me think that they're catering to customers on expense accounts.

Our room was a deluxe twin facing outside on the back of the hotel, making it a very quiet option. The room was of an adequate size, though the beds were not nearly as comfortable as they looked. My mattress sagged to one side, only making my back condition unhappier. Clearly the mattress needed updating. And the airconditioning unit was a welcome addition to a hot Madrid day, but we were disappointed that in the 2 nights we spent there, it seemed to get warmer and warmer in the room and was not able to keep a consistant cool temperature. These little things one does not expect to find in a 5-star hotel. That said, the marble bathroom was well-appointed and with wonderful water pressure too.

There are 3 intial steps from the street, followed by a foyer area with another few steps. Reception and concierge are on this level.

This hotel has been reviewed extensively on this site so I won't repeat all the well-known details, but will simply provide some brief pros and cons. Overall, however, we liked the hotel and thought the location was great, but we felt that it needs a substantial \"gutting\" in order for it to truly be one of the fine hotels in Spain. As it stands now, it's simply a nice place to stay, but don't expect opulent luxury. PROS: (1) Location is wonderful. It's quite central and you can walk to pretty much every tourist attraction in Madrid. Most are within a 5-15 minute walk, and other further sites are about a 25 minute walk, but you can certainly walk everywhere if you like. We had an 18-month old child with us and even we were able to walk to everything. (2) Breakfast is included and was surprisingly nice. Large buffet with eggs made to order. Impressive for an \"included \" breakfast. CONS: (1) As mentioned above, our biggest criticism is that the hotel really needs a major modernization. I am an SPG Gold Member so was upgraded to a large suite. While I wouldn't categorize our room as \"grotty\", I don't think it has been renovated since maybe the early 80s. The washroom in the suite was very large but looked to be about 15 years old. Not a huge issue but certainly needs modernizing if this hotel would like to remain a leading hotel in Spain in the years to come. As an aside, we also stayed at the Westin Valencia while in Spain and that Westin was absolutely beautiful. Night and day with the Palace. (2) Bad Doorman Service. I would normally never knit-pick doorman service in a review, but I have to do so here. There are tons of steps to negotiate when entering the hotel from the street (about 15-20 steps). We had a stroller with us and the doormen only assisted us about 25% of the time. They were often spotted around the side of the hotel smoking. I only saw the doormen at their post about 30% of the time. Often, the front desk people would see my wife or I carrying a stroller and run out to help us (often looking back as if to ask \"where is our doorman?!\"). Westin - please have a chat with your doormen. Their service level was attrocious for a higher-end hotel. OVERALL: Nice hotel but just be aware of what you're getting here.

Everything I expected.\u201d", "Author": "GuercinoBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR32875878", "Content": "I just returned from a 2-night stay at the Westin Palace Madrid. This was my first trip to Madrid, and I booked my room over the Starwood website for a pre-paid visit (which included breakfast and a double-basin marble bathroom). This is exactly what I received. I took the metro from Madrid-Barajas airport in the early afternoon (EUR 2.00 one-way) to get to the Westin Palace Madrid. After 2 connections, you'll arrive at Banco de Espana metro and can walk down Paseo del Prado (on foot, 5-7 minutes depending) to reach the hotel. Very busy street. The airport-downtown connection is a smooth one. If you are in Madrid mainly for the museums, then the Westin Palace is definitely the hotel for you. And it's a leisurely stroll down Paseo del Prado to the Reina Sofia and/or Atocha train station. Upon arrival, there were 2 people ahead of me in line. After standing in line for about 5 minutes and wondering what he was doing looking at his computer anyway when there were people waiting to check in, I was suddenly cheerfully greeted by Alberto at the front desk who apologized several times I had to wait a few minutes before he could help me as he was finishing up checking in a large group of guests for a wedding celebration and that the group of wedding guests was inordinately a large one. I could understand. It was, after all, a Friday afternoon. I was given a premium room on a higher floor, and while my room did not have a view outside, I did not find the view of the inner courtyard and the domed ceiling of the restaurant displeasing. I had, after all, paid a less expensive rate for reserving early and didn't need to look out the window anyway. And the room largely made up for anything. Large comfortable \"heavenly\" bed; meticulously clean bathroom; no peeling off of wallpaper in my room or in the bathroom, separate WC with bidet; water pressure was excellent; shower head and separate hand-held shower head. The room was very quiet, and I appreciated the turndown service each night when I got back to my room. Chrome and steel were polished throughout. The only thing I habitually notice in Europe is if you are a single traveller, hotels tend to hand out one (1) towel only. I never said anything, but into my second day, the maids started leaving me two (2) extra towels, so that was good. Plush hotel carpeting throughout the establishment. I never saw something dirty on the floor in the public areas. Beautiful lobby and hallways. Old world European charm. Splurge and have an aperitif in the bar/restaurant area under the dome. Check out the small hotel museum. My rate included breakfast (7am-11am each morning). (remember: Spaniards don't breakfast like the Americans or British do). Excellent service; choice of both hot and cold foods was varied. Bacon, Spanish sausages, small pancakes, eggs, all sorts of fruit, cakes, donuts, breads, cereals, granolas, yogurts of differing varieties, fresh salmon (overseen by a sous-chef), coffee/tea and fresh orange juice brought to your seat and attentive service. Pilar was a very helpful, smiling server, and she gave me some good sightseeing tips for which I am grateful (and told her so), warning me to stay away from Puerta del Sol in a taxicab because so many streets were blocked off for road renovations in the square itself. The gym is located on the 7th floor. Very quiet when I was there on a Saturday afternoon. Unisex (small) sauna; impeccably clean men's locker room and shower areas with an abundance of clean towels, washclothes, floor towels, hairdryers. Nice upbeat club music. I appreciate more old-world hotels rather than more modern places. It's not my taste to be in a hotel where the doorman wears a black t-shirt with a white \"W\" on it. I never have found the service to be any better in those types of hotels. Prime location to the Prado (literally across the street) and the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum (literally across the other street as well). There is a Starbucks on the side of the hotel facing the Plaza de la Cortes which gets crowded. Also a ZIPS store (a kind of Spanish soda fountain with counter service and you can purchase sundries, magazines etc. there as well). The hotel building is over 100 years old, and while I have read many postings of this hotel on this website where people complain so much and agree the elevators were a bit slow, that still didn't bother me (you use your roomkey to operate the elevator). Who really cares? As long as it worked (which it did). On my floor as well as on the floors above and beneath me, in the common area leading down the center staircase, two large platters held red and green apples (and those apples were huge). Not too inconveniently located from Puerta del Sol or Plaza Mayor. The hotel website says the hotel is 3 miles to the Royal Palace. I found it to be about 1.5 miles at the most -- I could walk it in 25 minutes at a leisurely pace; Puerta del Sol in 10 minutes past a myriad of buzzing bars and tapas places or taverns serving fresh Spanish jamon and wine; full of people. Concierge service: very pleasant and helpful. A younger concierge, Bart, was extremely helpful. The concierge has a good hotel map of the surrounding area; I purchased stamps there as well. I found the hotel to meet all my expectations. I did not partake of the minibar because I knew minibar prices are very high (to be expected, especially in Europe and even more so in a large, old-world hotel as the Westin Palace Madrid) anyway (and I had no intention of using the minibar even before my trip). Individual Siemens thermostats in the rooms. The thermostat was obviously quite new and worked very well and quickly (about 4 different comfort settings); no loud noises when the A/C was going. Double-glazed windows and heavy curtains. A/C cooled quickly and thoroughly. I have a little test for a hotel. I take the hotel stationery out of the desk and leave an envelope and several sheets of hotel stationery on the desk in plain view to see if the maid will notice to refill. While the maid failed my test by not replenishing the stationery, for the rest, I was very pleased with maid service. I even received a call late in the morning asking me if I needed anything since I had placed the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door the night before. Therefore, the staff does know when not to bother you, but just contacts you right in time in case you may need something (towards 12pm if your Do Not Disturb sign is still on the door). I requested toothpaste the night before, and it was brought up immediately to my room. If you don't pick up your phone, the maids will place a card on the floor in front of your room notifying you they noticed the Do Not Disturb sign and were just checking on you. Much appreciated. In sum, prime location, extremely clean, restful room, \"higher end\" prices surely, but I was not disappointed with anything. I am always pleased to stay in a Starwood property. For my first trip to Madrid (to visit the museums), I am happy to have stayed at the Westin Palace Madrid and would certainly stay here again just because I liked the hotel immensely. After having walked around the city center and seen other hotel establishments boasting 4 or 5-stars, I was not impressed (barring the Ritz across the Plaza de la Cortes) with what I could see those hotels may have offered for what I was getting. Knowing I had a nice room waiting for me after sightseeing was key to enjoying all that Madrid has to offer. You can walk to Plaza Santa Ana in about 10 minutes, Puerta del Sol in 10 minutes, Palacio Real in about 20 minutes; side streets do not have that many things at night, so you'll have to go elsewhere to eat, but I never once felt unsafe outside at any time of day or night. I recommend the Westin Palace Madrid and shall stay here again. And the personnel with whom I had come into contact were all friendly, efficient and approachable. Thank you Westin Palace Madrid. I enjoyed staying with you and shall be back.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bozeman, Montana", "Title": "\u201cGrand Property in a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "qaz123", "ReviewID": "UR32533327", "Content": "Except for the fact that this hotel is not that close to a metro station, this hotel is ideally located for tourists visiting Madrid.

This is a large hotel, so service is impersonal and there is a lot going on in the lobby etc. That said, the hotel has managed to keep itself pretty well maintained. We had a room on the 6th floor, which is an SPG Guest floor and has recently been renovated. The rooms and hallways were in very good condition. The bed in our room, though outfitted with the standard comfortable Westin sheeting, had a mattress that sagged heavily in the middle and was actually fairly uncomfortable (the mattress should have been replaced long ago). In addition, a hotel of this calibre should have flat screen TVs, not the 25 inch CRT televisions it has today. This makes the room feel a bit dated, even though it was recently redone. The bathroom offered two sinks and ample vanity space. There was tub/shower combination with a shower curtain--I personally dislike shower curtains and strongly prefer glass enclosures. Again, this is an upgrade the hotel should have made when renovating the rooms. The rooftop gym is spacious and very well equipped, particularly for a European hotel. We did not make use of any of the hotel's dining facilities. The business center was well equipped and the first 30 minutes of internet is free, as is printing. I thought this was nice touch that many folks probably don't know about. We stayed on cash and points, so it was a particularly good value.

The Westin Palace Madrid ( rated 5 stars Luxe / Lujo ) is a classical Palace in every sense beside the Ritz Hotel which is located opposite the Westin. The Entrance is a corner entrance crowned with a chandellier and doorman in classical attire and once in we had been greeted by a massive romantic mural on each side above the reception and the concierge desk plus in the middle are flower displays and an empire-style chandellier which looks like a hanging palm. To find the way to the famous La Rotonda just storm with bravado straight ahead the fine ways here along a Loewe Signature Store and finest carpeting - the same Salvador Dali has done with a very nice pet alligator on a liege! So we thought we had the right people in history to mingle with! Once there at the La Rotonda you will see at first sight the most beautiful glass painted cuppola you can imagine in fairytale surroundings with lots of superb seating and service people running around serving the guests! Quiet a sight to behold, Folks! After having found a nice hot spot to seat we ordered with the very nice waiter named Antonio the following items for our sweet lunch afternoon incl. warm applepie with cream, Pancakes with cream and strawberry plus chocolate sauce, Jamaican Coffee, Peach Juice, Vichy Catalan Water - sparkling and natural 500 ml - which all came in after 45 min. of leisure at 52 Euro and 19 cents incl. VAT and SERVICE CHARGE! All in all we had 1h and 15 min. at this masterpiece of a hotel! This hotel can only be highly recommended from us and we would also stay in future here when the time is right! By the way rooms starting from 271 Euros a night! Afterwards we had experienced the nearby Ritz Hotel Madrid ( rated 5 stars Gran Luxe / Gran Lujo - a member of the Leading Hotels of the World - owned 50% by Orient Express Hotels, Trains and Cruises ) which we thought at first would be even better, but our own experience told us somewhat else. We visited the Ritz Hall/Lounge/Bar which is the heart of the hotel and we enjoyed one Cafe Ritz signature coffee and one non-alcoholic fruit cocktail at cost of 36. 00 Euros incl. VAT and SERVICE CHARGE. Judging from our own views at the Ritz the public spaces, the value and the service - warmer at the Westin - the Westin Palace Madrid is the more superior choice. By the way the best price at the Ritz for a room was 295 Euro for one night Classic room. Had we the choice we would recommend the Eurostars Madrid Tower for the sheer modernity of it all and the Westin Palace Madrid for the sheer class of it all. The Ritz in our view is busy, not as romantic and does not particulary stand out between the other two. But in the end it is a personal choice! Our second visit to the La Rotonda at the Westin Palace Madrid occured more recently on the 31st of May 2009, our third time in Madrid, our fifth time in Spain, during our stay at the Hesperia Madrid ( rated 5 stars, One of the Leading Hotels of the World, Santceloni Relais and Chateaux Restaurant, Virtuoso - best Hotel and Resort Experience in the World Award Winner ), which can only be highly recommended from us , flawless Hesperia.

On our second visit to the Westin Palace Madrid we had chosen once again the La Rotonda in the heart of the hotel and were pleasantly surprised by classical LIVE Opera Singers ( one soprano and one tenor ) and piano player - this on a hot 33C+ Madrid afternoon - superb! This time around beside the music we had incl. again the favoured Peach juice, Vichy Catalan 500ml bottle, 1 cappuccino and biscuits plus the always loved pancakes with cream and strawberry sauce to go with the fine music and a perfect setting in Madrid served by Javier this time around! The bill this time around came in at 33 Euros and 77 cents incl. VAT and SERVICE CHARGE. Once again superb Madrid, superb hotels, superb flights with BMI from Dublin and Iberia from London to Madrid. Please do not forget to read our other hotel reviews here at Tripadvisor just look at our Contribution Profile incl. stays at the Eurostars Madrid Tower, Intercontinental Madrid, Hesperia Madrid, Hilton Madrid Airport and our very fist view ( visit only ) of the famous Villa Magna Madrid Hotel which has recently re-opened to great acclaim and is now also a member of the Leading Hotels of the World.

We were given a room on the sixth floor, where all the rooms were labelled \"Starwood Preferred Guest\". If you haven't joined SPG already, it is worthwhile to do so to ensure a room on this (the highest) floor. The room looked exactly like all the pictures of rooms in previous reviews. The room faced the interior dome, so no views - but no noise either. A great tradeoff in our opinion. I suppose the furniture is a bit dated...but a nice change from the ultramodern design in many hotels in Spain. It was a Heavenly Bed and we loved the two-headed Heavenly Shower too. There is morning coffee in the foyer on the sixth floor, and a great workout room adjoining a sunny rooftop terrace with nice views of the city. We had a great rate through hotels.com which included breakfast. It's an excellent buffet served under that fabulous dome...a terrific way to start the day. On Sunday, there was an Opera Brunch in the dining room. At 65 euros, we passed on the brunch, but did have a drink and listened for awhile...a fun change of pace. It is a fabulous location; just a short walk to all the art museums, the Botanical Garden and Retiro park, and the Atocha train station. For dining and nightlife, the Plaza Santa Ana is a short stroll in the evening. And the Hop On/Off bus stops at the corner, which is a convenient way to tour the city and get to sights on the other side of old Madrid, like the Palacio Real. And what a safe location! The Spanish president was addressing the Congress while we were there - right across the street from the hotel. There were a half dozen police on every corner for blocks. There was a metal detector set up in the lobby, though curiously guests didn't have to go through it. It's one of the only times I used an ATM on the street (and never felt uneasy with a couple dozen police with 25 meters). My only complaint was the boring and clubby-stuffy bar, and the rude attendants in the bar area. One woman in particular - Christine - was extraordinarily rude to us on 3 different occasions. Fortunately, we found the Plaza Santa Ana about that time and never went near the bar again. Hopefully the Westin will do something to correct this problem, as the rest of the staff was very kind and helpful.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cDissapointed\u201d", "Author": "asialoverR", "ReviewID": "UR31175219", "Content": "I stayed in the westin in madrid for 5 nights, location is just perfect and close to everything, but here are few things that I didn't expect, and I'm comparing westin here with other westin in asia, the room location aws looking at the dome of the resturant so no view, receptionists not really friendly, rooms furniture are a bit old, the room had no bathrobe u have to ask for it, the slippers are not there u have to ask, shower gelwas not in the room u have to ask for it, one piece of soap and 1 bottle of shampoo, water not provided complimentry but u have also to ask for it daily, I asked for apersonal scale, i gota broken one, shame on Westin in Europe really,other than u have to ask for every thing in the room, I enjoyed the stay ,the food and the city, no way to compare this hotel to the high level of service you always get in asia, and I had similar experience in Paris westin as well , so I figured out that that is the European standard", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Place to Stay in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "KauaiLover", "ReviewID": "UR30970739", "Content": "You can't beat the combination of the hotel's location and the actual hotel product.

Room: The beds were covered with wonderful, high quality linens and were super comfortable.

The furniture was mahogany antique reprodutions.Yes, there were a few little imperfections as in dents in the woodwork, or a scratch on the paint (this is a 100 yr old hotel) but nothing that took away from the pretty room. It was also very quiet. Hotel: The style of the hotel was very traditional so if you're looking for modern/contemporary this is not the place for you. The lobby was bright, colorful, pretty and smelled wonderful especially in the evenings when they put scented candles all around.There is a small room off the lobby with displays of memorabilia from the hotels' past.....old registers, keys, photos, famous guests, etc. Breakfast is served in a gorgeous room with a stained glass domed ceiling with a huge crystal chandelier. There are many, many food choices from pastries, meats, cheeses, eggs made to order, etc. The cost for the buffet is high but it was included in the great rate we got on Expedia. Breakfast is served from 7-11 AM. The hotel also has an Opera Lunch on Sundays including live Opera and costumes if you are into that. There is a computer room (four computers... at least one was always available when we went in there) with printers available free to each guest for 30 minutes per day and then for a fee beyond that time limit. Location: Great location across from the Prado. Also across from the Congress building so lots and lots of security around the hotel. Everything is within a 15-20 minute walk including the Royal Palace. There is a Starbucks just to the right as you come out of the hotel and a VIPS. This is a bookstore/convenience store/diner serving hot meals, salads, and sandwiches; it also has some grocery items, toiletries, etc. Outside Activity: If you're looking for somthing different, you can take a 3 hour Segway tour through www.madsegs.com. Very professional guide and so much fun!! The conceirge didn't tell us about it since we asked about a bike tour but this was a great way to see parts of the city we might have missed.

In our opinion, there is nothing quite like stepping outside the lobby door of a centrally located hotel like The Westin Palace in an exciting city like Madrid and having everything within reach: museums, restaurants, transportation, parks, shopping, bars..... This is a big hotel, too, with lots of people and groups and meetings going on, so there is a bit of a 'buzz' in the lobby. The rooms are nice, large and quiet; bathrooms are done up in marble and are fairly spacious; linens and towels are soft; the combo shower/bath is large and full of hot, pressurized water. There are some deferred maintenance issues here and there, dust in some nooks, chipped spots in the paint and the wood molding, and not all of the furnishings are up to snuff, but not enough to be a bother for us.. Housecleaning and turn-down service is good, if not a bit erratic. We found as the week progressed that some toiletries were replaced, some were not, some we never knew about until they magically appeared. We had to laugh, too, when one day the a.m. maid who cleaned the room also did the nightly turn-down service at the same time. We loved the breakfast buffet and the stunning rotunda lobby. Otherwise, drinks and food in the rotunda lobby and the bar are very, very expensive. Service is good overall. Staff are uniformly helpful (though personally we did not find the concierges' recommendations in some regards to be helpful or accurate). The hotel provides currency exchange, but charges a whopping 5% commission. No one at the hotel is able to recommend a competitive currency exchange place and we never managed to find one on our own. There is a gym upstairs on the sixth floor which is decent with locker facilities for men and women and a shared dry sauna; a scenic terrace adjoins the gym and provides a wonderful view over the rooftops of the city.

They were so incredible rude that when I asked them about tickets to a theatre, they said you can go over them and get them yourself, instead of helping me get them.

The hotel has a terrific reputation and from what we experienced this was deservingly so. It was fabulous and the staff and each and every employee could not do too much to make the stay terrific. I\u2019ll touch on several high points as I put my review together. However, if you prefer the Cliff Notes version stop reading here. It\u2019s impossible to go wrong staying at The Palace while in Madrid. Luxury Every element of The Palace is luxury, but not in an \u201cin your face way\u201d. What makes The Palace so terrific is that it says luxury in the most understated way possible, and keeps on saying and saying from the moment check in takes place until check out and departure. It\u2019s 100% professional, first class, and fabulous. Location Can\u2019t see how a location could be any better. The best attractions in Madrid are just a walk away such as Prado Museum and others, Old Town, Park Del Retrio and others. A car for the average tourist would be a tremendous hassle, so forget about it. We love walking and exploring and The Palace is terrific for that as it\u2019s just as close to old town as to many other attractions. Could not be better. Our Room We arrived somewhat early around 930am or so after an all night flight from Chicago. They had a room, but it was not what we reserved. They did a terrific job finding us a perfect room when checkout occurred at 100pm or so. We were put into the Executive Suite on the 6th floor. This was a one bedroom suite with a tremendous view of the Prado Museum and the Ritz Carlton. It was perfect. Dining Room & Hotel Bar Our room package came with a daily breakfast buffet. Was a terrific additional feature. Like everything at The Palace, this was terrific. All sorts of options and service was impeccable. We also had dinner in the dining room one night and perhaps we should have dined there two nights. It was terrific meal and as mentioned before with tremendous service. We went to the hotel bar once or twice. It should have been more. Was a terrific place with great options and terrific appetizers during cocktail hour each and every afternoon? Terrific. Staff It\u2019s impossible to say too much about the staff. They were both knowledgeable and courteous every minute they were on duty. There was nothing either too big or to small that the staff would not do. Enough said. Amenities Did not use much of hotel amenities. Used wireless internet daily and worked terrific. Loved fitness center. Did not use business center. Used concierge almost daily and they could not have been more helpful. Summary The Palace is a five star hotel and it does everything terrific.

One of the best things about the hotel is its location. It is perfectly situated within walking distance of a number of attractions and great neighborhoods. Additionally, the free breakfast is fantastic, the hotel bar is comfortable and serves great drinks, and the concierge provides great recommendations for sightseeing. On the negative side, it's hard to believe that quality hotels like this still charge for internet, but the Westin has a package that includes internet and on demand movies -- I recommend this.

Very efficient and courteous service on both arrival and departure Breakfast was seriously good in the Rotunda and the service superb. The bar and bar service was particularly very good and as expected quite expensive. All the staff were very friendly and helpful - late check out easily arranged Fantastic common parts. Interesting little museum. A smart landmark hotel. Minor criticisms:- a) The queen bed was very comfortable but we would have preferrred a king. b) All the toiletries were kept in short supply throughout our stay ( very unusual for a hotel of this calibre). Cost cutting? BUT I must say within minutes of a call to Housekeeping everything we asked for was delivered with a smile . It was just irritating that we had to keep asking for something pretty basic items like shower gel, shampoo or slippers. c) TV was rather old fashioned and the BBC signal extremely poor d) No evening turndown or hotel chocolate or weather forecast. Didn't get a chance to check out the restaurants or the fitness room. All in all we had a fantastic long weekend in Madrid and this hotel greatly contributed to our feeling of wellbeing.

For this review I'll share only my experience at this hotel, a grand property that does not deserve the *****L rating. Knowing we wouldn't arrive in Madrid until shortly after midnight, I called the hotel in advance to warn them about our late arrival and inquired about transportation from the airport. I was told it'd be easy to get a taxi easily even for a group of four with lots of luggage, and the hotel was \"looking forward\" to our visit. The first taxi driver in the cue at the airport quoted 50 euros to the hotel, doubling the meter rate even though all of our luggage could fit comfortably in the trunk. The other drivers claimed they couldn't take us because it wasn't their turn, so I called Westin Palace for help. Apparently the 5-star service didn't exist between midnight-6am at the Westin Palace. The concierge wasn't staffed, and neither the front desk nor the bell boy (they only had one during these hours) was capable of arranging a car in such an \"emergency\". I realized later incompetence wasn't the real problem of the hotel staff here, it was laziness and indifference. For many, if they could do nothing for the guests, they would. We managed to find an honest taxi driver but got to the hotel with 5 euros short for the fare. After waiting 5 minutes for a long-face staffer to unlock the front door, the longer-face old man at the front desk told me there was no chance the hotel could make up the difference in fare and charge it to my room. His exact words: \"We don't do that here, lady.\" For anyone who's traveled around the world, stayed at the best of places, but happens to look younger than her age with very young-looking parents in tow, you would understand my frustration. Taking care of transportation costs is one of the given requirements of any true 5-star hotel. The Ritz, Four Seasons, even the Hilton does it, so why not the Westin Palace? Well, I'm not old money. I didn't come in with a fur coat and LV bag. Meanwhile my poor parents, whom I'd brought to Spain to celebrate their anniversary, were trying to keep the driver patient with broken Spanish. The bell boy (a pretty ancient one who spoke great English) just stood there without offering to help. Finally I squeezed the directions to the hotel ATM out of the front desk man and paid off the driver (who was very courteous and SMILED, unless everyone at the Palace). It was 2am. Check-in was very brief with no briefing of any kind on the services included in our room rate such as breakfast and access to the gym. When asked for a map of the city, the front desk man just pointed behind me and said: \"I don't have it. Ask the concierge.\" Then he curved his lips for the the first time....from the stiff movement it was easy to tell he didn't do it much. Our rooms on the 6th floor SPG members floor were exactly what you'd expect from Westin, spacious with a very comfortable bed. Except our room had no toiletries, no soap, no shampoo, no slippers, etc. A call to housekeeping took care of this problem. We went to bed at 3am. Breakfast was a typical buffet affair under the stunning dome. The wait staff was either very attentive and efficient or completely spaced out and wouldn't refill your coffee or replace cutlery without prompting. The only consistency was the lack of smiles, oh, and very salty fried eggs. The hotel's location was superb: neighboring the Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums, a 15-min walk to Reina Sofia museum and Atocha train station, and 20-30 mins to Plaza Mayor and the Royal Palace. The neighborhood was well-kept, felt safe at night and had some excellent bakeries and restaurants within walking distance. Opposite the Palace stood the Ritz, but the Palace had a better view of the Neptune Fountain in the Plaza Canovas. The daily complimentary water in room and the free apples/coffee/tea service in the morning on the SPG floor were pleasant surprises, though I wished the coffee/tea were provided throughout the day as at other Westin's Club Floor. The gym was on the top floor, clean and sufficient, had a tiny sauna but no pool. (I thought a hotel cannot receive a 5-star rating without a pool, or is that only the standard in France and Italy?) The hotel served my family's purpose well as a convenient base for exploring Madrid, and the Heavenly beds ensured us good sleep every night. We were entitled to one coffee or tea per person per day in room for the tray charge of 4.50 euros. A nice bonus. The housekeeping team was pretty stingy with the bathroom toiletries and would only replace them when the last drop was gone. However they were always quick to restock when requested. Once I started to ignore the hotel staff I was able to enjoy my stay in Madrid and see the hotel for what it could be. It was unfortunate that the staff continued to fail in almost every aspect. I knew I would not stay here again when I saw my father carrying one of our luggage to the front door when we checked out. Apparently the front desk thought 7 pieces of luggage only warranted an elderly bell boy with a 3-wheel trolley which he couldn't even balance.

We therefore had to pay an additional 50.00 Euros per night in order to get a room that had two beds. Our total price paid was 175.00 Euros per night and we were booked into an Executive Room. Our large room looked out over the traffic circle and fountain at Plaza Canovas del Castillo. It was very clean and in very good condition. The beds were extremely comfortable and had very nice sheets and down comforters. The bath room had a very nice shower with three shower heads to choose from, but there was no bath tub. During our entire vacation, this was the only hotel room that was nicer than our bedroom at home. That was important to us. The public spaces within the hotel are gorgeous.

He allowed us to parking our car in the main drive way for over 10 minutes while we checked in. The hotel is in a perfect location. We did not have to take a taxi the entire time we were in Madrid because this hotel is within walking distance of everything that one would want to visit. Our only complaints were the following: The price of the food in the hotel restaurant as well as room service was the highest we have ever seen in our entire life. $25 for an ala carte hot dog is just simply outrageous. $43 for a continental breakfast is not justified. (Just around the corner and within the same building is the VIP Caf\u00e9 that serves an entire meal for two with a bottle of wine for less than $50.)

I checked this site before booking, but knew that unless the reviews were awful we would stay because it was free. The reviews we read criticized the hotel for two main reasons: cost of everything in the hotel, which we anticipated, and criticisms that the staff was not helpful or nice. We found the former to be true but not the latter. Everything at the hotel was, indeed, exorbitantly priced, especially considering the weakness of the dollar v. the euro. But we had planned for that (we brought instant oatmeal and hot pot to have breakfast in our room. We discovered that we didn't even need the hot pot because there was a hot water urn set up near the elevator on our floor with instant coffee, tea, milk etc available in the morning). Service in the hotel, on the other hand, couldn't be better. The staff was gracious and helpful. When I asked at check-in how much to tip the bellman, as I usually do in a new city, the desk clerk told me it was included. The doorman asked us where we were going each time we wanted a cab and then would give the cab driver directions to the location, and he did this even tho we did not tip him. The concierge made reservations for us for dinner at a kosher restaurant that he suggested and then suggested another one. And the next night he asked us how we had liked the one he suggested. (in a city like Madrid, for the concierge to be aware of kosher facilities is quite unusual). Everyone we encountered in the hotel was nice and helpful. The room was clean and beautifully appointed.

You can fall out of bed and get to the Thyssen museum, the Prado and the Reina Sofia are a short walk away. The business center was open at whatever hour we needed it.

Well, after my previous stay I wrote a review in TripAdvisor. I stated some problems we had, but that weren't bad enough to complain to the Hotel Management directly.

We chose the Palace because although we prefer larger hotels with impressive lobby's and good sized public areas, they have to have a presence and not be featureless/uninspiring. This hotel certainly didn't disappoint. When I arrive at an hotel the first impression is very important and sets the tone for the stay. If I look around without feeling the \"wow\" factor then its unlikely I'll relax and enjoy my stay. Well, the Palace has the factor and then some. It is situated in a busy area, close to several museums, a lovely park, plenty of shops, and importantly only a few minutes from the array of tapas bars in Plaza Santa Ana. The hotel has a buzz, there are people coming and going which is great if you enjoy people watching. As you enter the lobby you look up towards the extremely impressive Rotunda which has a wonderful domed glass ceiling. This is where you can enjoy a drink - it's very relaxing - and also have breakfast and an evening meal. Beyond the Rotunda are several function rooms and a chinese restaurant. I wasn't impressed with the food but my wife thought it was excellent. A case of depends what you choose ? Beside the Rotunda is a decent size bar which looks a little too much like a gentlemans club. All wood panels and green leather chairs. The service from the bar was the only disappointing aspect of our stay. We were overcharged for wine on 2 evenings, waited an age to be served and I almost collapsed when I saw our bill - a coke cost 7 euros (wine was cheaper.) Breakfast is something we always look forward to in european hotels: salami .parma ham,salmon, cheeses etc and although these were offered the breakfast experience just seemed to lack something although the service was attentive and efficient. I had originally booked a premium deluxe room but on checking the day before we left I saw the room was only around 35 sq mtr which is a little small. I called and reserved a junior suite and when we entered the room and saw the expression on my wifes face I was pleased that I had. The room overlooked the street and fountain and had a fantastic bathrooom. If funds allow consider enjoying one of these rooms. The only downside to the room was the noise at the weekend from emergency vehicles. As for the staff, everyone was polite and we were acknowledged and greeted by all. The concierge were very helpful but check-in was a surly affair. Although we don't plan to return to Madrid as we had time to see all we wanted to, if the Palace was transported to another city we would book without hesitation.

The Westin Madrid Palace Hotel is an elegant building with detailed architecture, very conveniently located near the museums (across the street or just a few blocks away) or a 10 to 15 minute walk to the main plaza areas like Puerta Del Sol, Calle Mayor, etc. This is probably one of the most elegant hotels we've stayed in. The Westin self parking underground garage was difficult to locate as the entrance was on a one way street. We had to drive down some small streets to locate and enter that street. Actually, the bigger pain was the underground parking garage itself. The garage is very small (maybe 50 cars max?) and the spaces even smaller! Even maneuvering (can't call it driving in there because it's that tight-you can't go fast unless you want to take out the bumpers or mirrors!) our mid size rental car through just trying to pass through the columns required driving at a crawl,inching back and forth to avoid scraping the car!. I even got out of the car to help negotiate the hairpin turn in the lot. We found the best spot we could-one where we could drive out of without inching back and forth to avoid hitting the columns or walls. Then we left the car parked there until we checked out. How tight could the parking spaces really be? I saw one of those mechanic floor jacks and my husband said the valets probably needed it to move the cars into the tight spaces or to get them out! Yes, there is valet parking available for slightly more than self parking. To do valet, Westin doesn't have a real driveway. You pull up right onto the sidewalk area in front of the hotel steps and you'll see the valet and doorman. Self parking was about $30 USD a night and valet may have been closer to $50 USD/night. So if you don't want to hassle with self park or don't want to test your driving/parking skills, valets extra cost may be worth it. Also, driving during the evening rush hour in downtown Madrid is challenging with the scooters cutting in and out, pedestrians crossing on red lights and the taxi lanes. The parking was the only real negative about the hotel, but the hotel is an old building so you can't really fault it as it wasn't designed with modern parking in mind. Check in was professional, efficient. We were upgraded to a large corner Junior Suite, as he's an SPG platinum member and they had availability. Very nice, elegant suite with a separate master bedroom with tv in a armoire and a large walk in closet with a safe. A sitting room with sofa, arm chair coffee table, tv and mini bar refrigerator in the armoire, work desk. One full bathroom with separate tub, shower and toilet room with a frosted glass door. Two white Westin robes and slippers to use. Amenities included Molten Brown soaps, shampoos and lotions, toothbrush, mouthwash, razor. Second bathroom with toilet and sink only. The suite had very nice elegant details like crown molding, chandeliers, etc. Nightly turn down service included the chocolates on the beds and some small rug they put down on both sides of the master bed. Maids were friendly. Concierge gave us a map of the local area when we asked. There is no SPG club room at this hotel. The 6th floor is supposed to be the Club Room floors, but the only Club level amenities offered is a self serve espresso machine and apples. I think we were on the 3rd floor and according to the elevator symbols smoking is allowed (and we smelled it) on one of the floors of the hotel. We didn't eat any meals in the hotel but went out and found small local restaurants nearby. There is also a Starbucks right around the corner. The hotel has a workout room on the top floor and we took a quick look at it and the equipment looked in pretty good shape, but no one was using it. No swimming pool here. Just a note that if you do take one of the streets from the Plaza Del Sol area towards Gran Via, be careful if you've got little kids and don't want them to see, as the area is a bit seedy with porn shops and prostitutes leaning against the buildings and trees waiting for business. This was mentioned in the Rick Steves' travel guide book and even for our short two day trip, found the info and maps from this book to be pretty helpful. Also watch out for the pickpockets and scammers. So the Westin Palace is a beautiful hotel, elegant rooms, great location for visiting museums and close to the plazas.

The hotel is largly non- smoking with all but one floor being non-smoking, a definite plus in a country that still is very much a smoking place. Most restaurants allow smoking. Some have a non-smoking section, but really is meaningless when there is no physical barrier. They have a really nice roof top gym with a good assortment of fitness equipment. There is a hair salon and a Loews shop on site as well as an art store -- also there is a Starbucks that is ALWAYS packed! Hilarious! We had a couple of opportunities to eat in the hotel -- breakfast was included in the room and was held in the domed glass lobby lounge buffet style. Very, very good. The biggest surprise was how exceptional the Asian restaurant on site is. .. it is beautiful and the food is sensational as is the service. If you don't smoke.. get there early. The bar lounge is very active, but comfortable with service staff who are whizzing by. We also had New Year's Day brunch at the hotel -- it was really great. There were hundreds of tiny single dish apps that must have taken an army of chefs hours upon hours to create. Just magnificent. A great selection of local foods were also presented. The draw back of this hotel -- the concierge service is awful, unfortunately. They want to send you to the touristy spots only -- I tested this theory a couple of times and sadly, they really did not seem to care one iota about guest needs. They seemed not to have ANY clout in getting tickets or reservations --even when the request was made a month in advance of the visit. They were not knowlegeable about what was open when or take the time to check -- the answer was always \"it is possible\" -- oh well, yeah thanks!!!

On more than one occasion 2 door men stood around talking while my wife and I had to open the door for ourselves. We called guest services 4 times during our stay, each time the service was poor. I was told that an electrical transformer and a scale were not available (even though the hotel literature said it was) because the person answering did not know what they were - she asked me repeatedly what a scale does / what purpose does it serve. When I got frustrated enough to go down to the lobby and ask the concierge for assistance she was visibly annoyed at having to assist me. When we were checking out I had to call guest services 3 times to have someone come and help me with my luggage (it took 45 minutes to get someone to bring my luggage from the 3rd floor to the 1st floor). If the elevators were not so tiny I would have done this myself as there is no reason this. Also, my wife and were on our honeymoon and my american express travel agent made it a point to indicate this in all of our reservations (it said it on all of our travel vouchers) and the Westin is the only hotel we stayed at that did not acknowledge it in some way. So while the hotel / lobby was beautiful and the location was great I will never stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "December 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA top-notch hotel and not overly expensive\u201d", "Author": "Mantelstone", "ReviewID": "UR11608756", "Content": "Having received an excellent rate through Hotwire, it was definitely a pleasant and very enjoyable stay at Westin Palace in Madrid.

I am also a seasoned traveler and have experienced many, many, Starwood hotels in my life. I am a Starwood Gold member. From this view point I have to say that the Westin Palace in Madrid does not reach the Standard that Starwood has for all their hotels. I will start with the positive: Nice Lobby, great hallways,great location...feels like a Grand Hotel when you enter. Now my experience: My reservation made many months in advance was not found (reservation with starwood points) even though I had the confirmation in my hand and the points were deducted from my account. After more than 45 minutes waiting and several phone calls, my reservation was found. I was given a smoking room (reserved non smoking). Then I was moved to a non smoking room after complaining. The room was very standard. No heavenly bed or linens and just a small Queen Bed (felt more like a large full). After asking at the front desk I was told that this hotel does not have King beds (????), that they were remodeling the hotel because many americans request them, and only the executive floor has them. The mattress was outdated, pillows were terrible, and I was promised a change of room the next day. After no one called me with the answer, I talked to the chief of front desk after my second night. He wrote down the issues I mentioned and promised a change of room for the third night. I am still waiting for his phone call. That night we needed a Taxi. Every hotel of this category that I have been to, has Taxis waiting outside or they can be easily called. I was told by the doorman to not even try to wait for a Taxi there, that it was better to walk to the near neptuno square and get one there. (great service, no?). So in general, the hotel is nice outside, average once you open the door of your room and not up to the Starwood standards, and mediocre in regarding to customer service.

The hotel has an excellent location. The Thyssen and Prado museums are within five minute walks, Retiro (park) is another five minutes UP the hill behind the Prado, and Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor are about 10-15 minutes away UP another hill. So, all in all a great location, but be prepared to climb a bit. The only location drawback is that you are about a 7-10 minute walk from the nearest metro stations - Banco de Espana, Atocha, Sevilla or Sol. The hotel itself has excellent facilities. The rotunda lobby is ornate and beautiful. The hallways on the guest floors are wide and well lit. The breakfast area is well laid out with a wide selection. The rooms themselves are very nice. The bathrooms are probably the best part with twin sinks, and a separate room for the toilet and bidet. Towels are plush and unlike many European hotels, there are facial wash cloths. The room itself was spacious, but there was only one arm chair in the room. We would have preferred two chairs. Our room was room #649 which was south facing onto an alley with no particularly redeeming view. There were two problems we encountered. One was the mattress was badly in need of replacement. We could never get this scheduled, although the hotel did try. The other was air conditioning. Our air conditioner would come on, throw out cold air, get to the desired temperature, convert to fan only operation and never go back to throwing out cold air, no matter how warm it got in the room. We tried twice to get it fixed, but as we don't speak Spanish, we could not adequately communicate the problem. So, while we could hardly say we loved our experience in the room, we'll assume we were outliers (heard no complaints from others in our group). I am rating the hotel as excellent as the facilities themselves were superb and assuming that the problems we encountered were atypical. We did walk across Paseo del Prado to the Ritz and our view is that the public areas in the Palace exceed the Ritz. If you want to save a few euros on dining, if you exit the hotel, and go downhill to the Paseo del Prado, in the basement of the hotel building but only accessible from the street, there is a VIPS and a Starbucks. VIPS is a family oriented cafe / convenience store, but we found the food very satisfactory on our several occasions dining there. If you ask, they do have english language menus, but the Spanish language menus are well illustrated enough that with even the most rudimentary of Spanish, you should do OK. The only drawback is that you cannot order off the lunch menu until as I recall 1:00 pm (if not 1:30 pm). As for Starbucks, you know the drill.

I asked to move to the junior suite I had booked, and was told it was unavailable, which annoyed me. They finally moved me to another executive suite, which was much better, with a very nice bedroom and bathroom, but still some issue with the living room set-up. It was still not set as good as the smaller junior suite, in my opinion (see below). The hotel overall is great, with a good small gym (but no pool), a really nice breakfast buffet which is served in a beautiful room with a glass domed atrium. The building itself is a classic old place . The staff was really helpful (except for one bad steer by the concierge for tapas - La Truja was pretty lame!) and overall it was an extremely enjoyable experience. Hotel location is great - across the street from the Prado and other great museums, 10 minute walk up to the Puerta Del Sol, with a host of bars and restaurants and old shops on the streets between. Great town, Madrid. By the way, on the way out of Spain 2 week later, I stayed at the Palace again for 1 night, got a junior suite, and it was absolutely great.

The Palace Hotel is a perfect hotel for Americans travelling to Madrid (all staff members speak english) for either pleasure or business. (note the Starbucks right next to the building) The place *could* be converted to a St. Regis if they upped the service levels a notch. This hotel seemed to attract alot of Americans and Brits but still remains a grand Spanish hotel. Pros: Rooms - The RENOVATED rooms are excellent. The decor is absolutely beautiful with fabric covered walls and a terrfic marble bath. The included buffet breakfast was well done and we looked forward to it each morning. Neutral - Service - the staff was friendly and we had no serious problems but it wasn't what you would expect in a true 5-star hotel like a Four Seasons or St.Regis hotel. This is a large hotel and the staff seems a bit overworked - also it is difficult to give that personal type of service you would experience at a traditional 5 star property. Think 5 star property with 4 star service. Cons - Rooms - the UNRENOVATED rooms are actually pretty bad and are more like a 3 star experience. We had 2 rooms one was renovated and was absolutely beautiful - the older one was a completely different room from the older very beat-up unrenovated rooms. Standing in the older room made me feel like I was in a completely different hotel. Bottom line - a well known swanky and beaufiful large hotel in a good location in old Madrid.

We'd been delayed at the airport, our luggage had been interfered with between the plane and the carousel (it took 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive), and the taxi driver couldn't drop us at the hotel because of a demonstration in the city centre, so we were a bit disgruntled by the time we eventually arrived, but as soon as we stepped into the lobby, we started to relax. What a beautiful first impression you get - the lobby has an air of grandeur that you can't fail to be impressed with. The front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. Unlike other reviewers, we had no issues with waiting for service either at the reception desk or at the concierge desk, but I guess it depends on the time of day or time of year. We had booked a premium deluxe room, but when we arrived to our assigned room, we discovered that we'd been given a lovely junior suite (no idea why, but I wasn't about to complain). We had a lovely sitting area with comfortable sofa and its own TV. The minibar was also in this room, although we didn't make use of it, because it was so expensive - the price list is hidden at the back of the room-service menu. Mahogany double doors led into the bedroom, which had a second TV, and a comfy queen-sized bed (although I'd agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the pillows are a bit too soft). There was also a walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was beautifully done in marble and had a separate bath and shower, and double sinks. One nice thing I noticed was that rather than the usual 2 big towels and 2 tiny hand towels, our bathroom had 4 huge towels and 2 fairly large hand towels, as well as the bathrobes - much better!! The public areas downstairs are gorgeous! The bar has a real old-world atmosphere, and the rotunda is just spectacular. We ate in Asia Gallery on the third night of our stay, and I can highly recommend it, even if you're not staying in the hotel. Amazingly, it wasn't all that expensive (considering the fact that a glass of 7-Up in the bar cost \u20ac7). We chose one of the set meals for two, which consists of soup, mixed starter, half a lobster each, scallops, quail, duck and dessert, and it was only \u20ac50 each. The staff there were wonderfully attentive, and the decor in the restaurant is just so lovely. Breakfast was included in our stay, and it was a fairly impressive spread, with pretty much everything you'd want at a breakfast buffet (oh, apart from the fact that there was no milk on the table for tea/coffee, but I think that's just the continental way of doing things). There were plenty of staff members milling about, ready to refill coffee cups and fetch anything you wanted. Make sure you don't do that thing of going down for breakfast 5 minutes before service ends, though - as soon as the assigned time is reached, everything is cleared away in about 5 minutes, so you could find yourself facing empty shelves.

I am a platinum Starwood member and try to use points at the nicer properties because they are so expensive and especially in the European locations. What I liked best about this property was the location which is excellent. The Prado was next door as was the modern museum of art on the other side of the square. There is a Starbucks located in the same block for decent coffee and a pastry. There is a Spanish version of Dennys called VIPS which you can get food cheaper than most restaurants but it is not very interesting just filling. What I did not like about the hotel is that they gouge you for everything. A small bottle of water was almost $7. The rollaway was $50 euros a night and a cup of coffee in the hotel was almost $5. Stay away from the overpriced and not very interesting breakfast buffet which is 22 euros. The concierge made lousy restaurant recommendations where the Tapas food was not only terrible in quality but high in price. We made a point of returning to let him know that it was a poor recommendation and he thanked us but the next day I returned for another reason and overheard him giving out the same recommendation to another customer. Typically this means they are getting some sort of kickback to steer you to certain places to eat. Avoid the concierge for anything but directions. The rooms walls were thin and we heard everyone\u2019s door open and close as well as the room above us. We were in a superior room which was spacious but a bit worn. Rather so-so. The rate for this room was over 500 euros a night and I would have fled after the first night but we were using points to stay there so I did not mind. It is a decent hotel to stay in if you can use points and absurdly overpriced for the prices they charge for the accommodations you get. Our queen size bed had seen a better day since the springs tended to squeak when we got out of the bed.

Regal in appearance, the architecture is classic and elegant. The stained glass domed rotunda restaurant serves as the hub of the hotel and is beautiful and inviting. Having said that, it is ridiculously overpriced. A small diet coke runs 7\u00bd Euros ( appr. $ 9.00 US) . The breakfast buffet, while complete, is also well overpriced. Room service- welcome to the home of the $25 (mediocre) hamburger. While I do not mind paying for an elegant, well appointed hotel, the surrounding atmosphere should justify it. While the hotel is indeed the epitomy of old world charm, the physical space lends itself to creating a lobby area that is busy and very active at all times, and not a place to relax on the provided couches. The concierge station is well trained and pleasant, but never seem to go out of their way. The front desk staff again are pleasant and ammenable, but not overly welcoming given the status, reputation, and accompanying price of the Palace. One chooses a 5 star hotel not only for its location and amenities, but also for that extra pampering that is expected when paying a premium price. The hotel, while certainly a comfortable place to return after a day of sightseeing, seems to be missing that \"je ne sais quoi\", that undescribable quality or attribute that seperates a 4 star from an amazing 5 star hotel experience. The hallways are certaily nice, and appear to have double the standard hotel hallway width, with mounted wall sconces outside every room, and upscale carpeting, somehow evoking what one might imagine the Titanic hallways to have looked like. Each guest room has a bell in place of having to knock on the door, as well a hallway visible light that notifies staff of a \"do not disturb\" status in place of a paper doorknob hanger. The rooms are decidedly masculine in feel. A wall sized dark wood armoire is large enough to store all of your luggage items, including a double width hanging closet. The bathroom is large and comfortable with double sinks, a large counter area for all of your toiletries, and a toilet and bidet in a seperate- carved glass door enclosed room. The tub-shower combo shows some wear and tear. The bed IS very comfortable as advertised, and the surrounding furniture is fine. The location cannot be beat, and right outside the front door is a Starbucks and a VIP restaurant/store, as well as having the most famous museums across the street,and the Grav Via area a short walk away. The lobby bar is a quiet oasis away from the hectic lobby, decorated in dark wood paneling conjuring up a gentleman's club feel. An enjoyable place to enjoy a ( very overpriced) cocktail as a break from your sightseeing journey. In conclusion, if you are able to get your room here for a decent price, certainly go ahead and you will not be dissapointed. If you are paying $300 a night ( as I did) , you will probably find yourself wanting more from the experience and from this hotel where its reputation precedes it. For the price, I strongly recommend the Park Hyatt Villa Magna as a more sedate, luxurious choice. Located in the upscale Salamanca district, it is also conveniently located to most tourist sights in a much quieter, park like setting.

I booked through the Starwood website. The hotel is well and conveniently situated in central Madrid near to the Retiro park and the museum quarter. It is a grand old building, with fine appointments, although it is starting to show its years of use just a little. The entrance hall is very grand, and the concierge very efficient. Our check in was very efficient, with a friendly and helpful counter agent who upgraded our room when she heard we were on our anniversary visit. Our room was small ( even upgraded) but beautifully appointed. We were a little disappointed that the much vaunted \" heavenly bed\" was only a double, not a queen or king size, but it was opulently covered and quite comfortable. The bathroom and shower room was exemplary - it is a pity that one has to pay for a five star hotel in order to get such lovely and enjoyable facilities. The view from the small window was of the Plaza de Las Cortes - a bustling traffic roundabout and the retiro park beyond. After a reminder from me, the staff bought up the sparkling wine and flowers I had pre-booked for my wife. The delay did not spoil our visit. A quick look at the minibar and room service menus caused us to laugh - a small jar of jelly candies at \u20ac7.50, and a Mars Bar \u20ac8 for example !! I popped out to the VIPS store on the Plaza to stock up on such items for a tenth of the price instead ! The restaurant is very grand - airy and charismatic under a glass dome,but sadly also cripplingly bad value. Fortunately Madrid is well provided with fantastic eateries and we found several lovely venues over our stay, where we experienced wonderful local cuisine and ambience for realistic prices. The gym on the top floor is very well stocked with equipment, which seems to never be used. We were surprised that this lovely hotel did not have a pool however. Breakfast was fine, with a chef adding freshly cooked Tortillas Espanol to the broad and tasty buffet repast. All in all we had a fine stay, but less adventurous vistiors might have paid much more than they needed to for somewhat overpriced hotel services. To be honest our weekend was so lovely and romantic , we could hardly remember the hotel as anything less than wonderful, but the Westin Palace CERTAINLY played its part in the romance of our celebration weekend.

The hotel is impressive with its architecture. Inside the hotel, you first notice the grand chandeliers, mural on the wall, and then you see the posh furniture in lobby sitting area. After the wow-factors, you see the long lines of people check in/out and at the concierge desk. When we got to the front of the check-in desk, the process took no less than 30 minutes and I have already presented the check-in clerk with the email confirmation print out, credit card, and passport. I really have no idea what took so long, she didn't ask any questions but just typed away on her computer. The long line in the lobby seems to be a common sight during out stay. Every time we walked through the lobby, there was ALWAYS a line. We hardly ever asked the concierge for help because we just didn't want to wait in line. We were put in a standard room on the 6th floor, the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. The room was definitely a great size, has been remodeled, window overlooking the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum, air-conditioning that's working, and lots of closet space. However, the queen size bed was definitely NOT your average Starwood bed. The mattress was old and lumpy, the pillow was more like someone stuffed some dirty towels into the pillow case, and the linen was nothing to write home about. However, the bathroom was very spacious, with double sinks, and the Westin double shower head. We didn't see an ironing board or hair dryer, so we called housekeeping to request the items. After three phone calls and no delivery, we gave up and never used those items during our stay. Housekeeping was somewhat decent in cleaning room, changing towels. But they never changed our robes during our stay. One good thing about the service is that they set up fresh coffee and tea every morning in the 6th floor lobby. Through out the day, there's fresh apple in the 6th floor lobby as well. We didn\u2019t check if that was the case for all the floors in the hotel. Overall, the hotel is in a great location.

We used points to stay 10 nights at the Westin Palace in April, 2006.

We were given a smallish room on a Club level floor with views overlooking the plaza below (directly across from the Prado Museum and next door to the Thyssen Museum). The windows are placed high, but we were able to see an Easter week procession from the room.) I was happy with the room (exactly what I expected from a Westin) and loved the location of the hotel (convenient to lots of the tourist stuff and in a very nice neighborhood.) Negatives: both check-in and check-out were unbelievably long (people in line at check-in were red in the face and complaining), breakfast is like $45 per person per day (for a buffett that does not justify the price) and we often had to wait 10-15 minutes for a taxi when heading out for dinner. I recommend buying bottled water/drinks for the room at the VIPS and breakfasting at the Starbucks on the plaza. The add-on charges here are really steep so watch out!

It was spacious, quiet, and very comfortable.

The arrival in the handsome foyer is somewhat let down by having to queue for some ten minutes to check-in, since the hotel can get very busy and there are only two over-worked receptionists. Some members of staff come to you whilst you queue, to offer you some complimentary refreshments, which is a nice touch, but it seems to me that they would be better employed behind a reception desk. Then, the non-smoking junior-suite we were given was very tired looking, and smelt like the inside of a smokers train-carriage, and the king sized bed we had requested, (and was confirmed to us) was no more than 1M60 in width. We complained to reception,(by phone to avoid having to queue again), and were given a very handsome junior suite on the fourth floor, which gave on the much quieter back of the hotel. This junior-suite consisted of a long beige marble-floored corridor which led to a very nice oval shape sitting room, a large bathroom with a window , a separate toilet cabinet, and a comfortable bedroom with a proper king-sized bed. The equipement was good, with two TVs, a CD player, fax etc...and nicely furnished too. But it was perhaps a little tired looking with small tears on the wallpapers, many cracks on the ceiling, and the large double picture-lamp had come off the wall, and was hanging by its electric wires over the head of the bed like some sword of Damocles. We mentioned it to house-keeping and a man came, took away the lamp, saying that he would returne to fix it and never did, leaving a hole in the wall with two live-wires sticking out during our whole stay. The bed was very comfortable, soft but supportive, but I disliked the pillows which felt like they had been half filled with cotton balls; your head just sank in them so you had to tuck them all the time. Another irritation was that when the room was cleaned the next day, we found a little card on the bed explaining that the sheets had not been changed, and if we wanted them changed tomorrow we should leave out that little card, and all because the Westin Palace had strong feelings about conservation issues.Right... This reminds me of the very expensive London Hilton which tells you, also on a card, that in order to maintain your privacy they have surppressed the evening turn-down service unless you specifically arranged it with them. Regrettably I notice more and more often that large hotel groups are making up lame excuses, to cut down on their expenses. The hotel was very well located if, like us, your aim is to visit all the main art museums, and the restaurants are not very far, a five euros-taxi ride will take you to the nicest ones. In the end I had to conclude that the hotel was, on the whole, good, especially since our stay was very good value. We used one of their many packages on offer where two nights would give you a extra third night free; at 450 euros a night, with the free night it worked out an average of 300 euros a night, for a large junior suite, with breakfast, right in the heart of a major Europeen city. Similar accommodation in central Paris, London or Rome would cost over double that amount. So my advice is, do choose this traditional palace hotel for a stay in Madrid, if you can get a good value package, and don't expect 'Four Seasons' type of service level since the doormen won't open the door for you and the staff in the public areas stay chatting together in small groupes and on the whole are neither very pleasent nor helpfull; (with one or two rare exceptions). Oh, and buy your own water since the mini-bar (with no price list) will charge 5 euros for a tiny 30cl bottle!", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cthe best in Madrid.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4517233", "Content": "great service, immediate check in , check out. attention from everyone. clean rooms. bathroom was beautiful. perfect location. i was there feb 8-14th for the ARCO exhibition. only one complaint. i asked for a suggestion from the concierge about where to get a good paella, and he directed me to a restaurant that was shut down for construction... $5 euro cab ride down the drain. but thats okay, everyone makes mistakes. this hotel was definately the best in madrid. better than the ritz!", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Fine 5 Star\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4466917", "Content": "We stayed there for Valentines Day in Room 181.

We walked everywhere from the hotel, but there is a metro station practically right outside the door. The Madrid Vision tour buses have a stop right across the Plaza, so we literally saw the city and only had to walk across the street to do it. Our room didn't have a great view, but we loved the room nonetheless. The bed was SO comfortable, since it's a Heavenly Bed. There was a lot of closet space as well as an in-room safe. However, I was surprised to see that the shower was not separate from the bathtub and that the shower curtain was pretty flimsy and blew in on me when I took a shower. The toilet and bidee were in a separate \"room\" off the bathroom, but only behind a frosted glass door, so not very private if someone is getting ready at the bathroom counter. Also, the temperature was very hard to regulate. It was VERY warm in our room and didn't really cool to a comfortable temperature at night to sleep because it was so warm outside. The corridors were also VERY hot to walk down, with seemingly no ventilation. There is no ironing board and iron in the room and you have to call Service Express to have them bring you one. When we called, all of them were in use, so we had to steam our clothes in the shower to try to get out the wrinkles before going out for the evening.

As a Starwood Platinum member I'm likely spoiled by the amazing hotels and great service, but even the Westin Palace surprised me. As other reviewers mentioned, everything is top notch, and dont overlook the great gym, sauna and little sundeck on the top floor. The sundeck was a great place for my daily siesta! But on top of the hotel itself, the amazing part is the location. It's so close to the museums, shopping, busses, just about everything for a first time visitor to Madrid. (Just walk really quickly by the Planet Hollywood and Starbucks underneath the hotel.)", "Date": "September 24, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Westin Palace Madrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d190569-Reviews-The_Westin_Palace_Madrid-Madrid.html", "Price": "$282 - $418*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Plaza de las Cortes 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28014</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "190569", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/f0/1e/exterior-facade-neptuno.jpg"}}
