You have to put aside expectations about 'hotel'. Domus Ester has a small office/reception on a higher floor of an ancient building in the old centre of Rome. Rooms are small, price is very small, comfort is very good for the money, style of the rooms very very good, consistent with the local environment, exposed beams maybe 4-500 years old. And you get to experience what is conventional with Italian apartments, a bathroom in which a cat would have difficulty turning around. This is Rome, if you want Dallas, go to Dallas. Step outside with a map (very helpful, cheerful reception staff, but be conscious they are also running to service rooms, not hanging about waiting for you) and the centre of the western world is at your feet, and reachable on foot easily. DON'T pay for the tourist bus, go to a newstand on the street and buy a daily or weekly or monthly metro pass. Weekly costs ?Euros16, monthly Euros 30. Fantastic way to live the life of the city, buses and underground. Shop or eat near the major city tourist attractions and expect the major city tourist quality and price. Take the tram (ask at desk, walk 200 metres) to Trastevere, especially for restaurants or Saturday mornings for the Porta Portese market (where you can buy a new suitcase for the market loot also! :-) Find a stop for the magic 116 bus (see last entry at my http://duemesi.blogspot.com ) and be taken on a wonder journey through the city to the Villa Borghese. You must book ahead for the Borghese Gallery (giving you crowd control for a couple of hours access to what we think is the best gallery in Rome, in an historic park where locals relax at weekend). But be conscious that every corner where you walk, near Domus Ester, is history. It sits on the Field of Mars, where generals returned from war camped with their armies awaiting Senate approval to enter the city for their 'triumph'. 'No Littering' signs on the corner from the 1700s. Walk west towards the Capital (Campidoglio) and the Forum and Coliseum and, especially in the historical Jewish quarter, marvel at how builders have included bits of older buildings, up to 2000 years old, in subsequent multiple rebuilds. Don't just run between designated tourist sites. Look at every building, every cobblestone... around here every historical figure of Roman history has walked and breathed Every church nearby has its distinct visceral character (and free amazing art exhibitions). Incomparable value unless you want overdressed and supercilious creepy attendants to bow at you with their hands out.

The bathroom was biggish with a bath and well stocked with freebies and the rooms were immaculately clean - you can't fault them for that.

Our room had once upon a time opened directly onto the main stairwell, and though that door is now completely sealed, the smell of rubbish from the communal garbage cans at the bottom, along with people's conversations, did carry up into the room from time to time. As this July was very hot (temps in the mid-30s up) this meant choosing between fresh (but hot) air from the open window, or keeping it cool with the aircon with the risk of occasional smells. That really was the only negative, however. Otherwise, it was great to be in such a handy location, right in the middle of Rome, and the lack of pretension was a nice change from more up-market hotels. The room was spacious, with attractive rafters on the ceiling, and the minibar fridge can be reorganised to accommodate your own water bottles etc. Breakfast is basic, but delivered to your room, which is nice, and the place felt generally pretty secure.

Esthetically our room looked fine, and the bathroom was very spacious indeed. It appeared to be newly renovated, clean and included a shower and a large bathtub, but there was a peculiar odor of sewage. We assumed the smell must have been coming from the open window. We didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to whatever the smell was or where it was coming from because we had tickets to the Vatican Museums, and about 10 minutes to drop off our luggage and head out to the Vatican. When we returned to our room later that evening the smell of sewage made relaxing impossible. Where was this horrific smell coming from? I asked if it would be possible to be moved to another room (believe me, it was THAT bad). The gentleman at the desk told us that nothing else was available because he actually overbooked, and would have to make arrangements for another guest to stay at a nearby hotel. He then realized that he could make that arrangement for us instead and simply give our room to the new guest that would be arriving the next morning. That poor new guest had no idea what he or she would be in for. The gentleman was able to arrange for us to stay at a neighboring hotel, and the Domus Ester paid the difference of 20 Euros. He walked us over to the neighboring hotel, which was a mere block away, and said that we could see the room the next morning and decide if we wanted to stay there instead. I had closed the windows on our room while we were out all of 10 minutes while we were seeing where the other hotel was located. When we returned to our room we literally started gagging because the stench of sewage was so overwhelming and even worse than before because the window was closed for all of 10 minutes. The smell was not coming from the window, but coming from the spacious and newly renovated bathroom, which we can only assume might be due to incorrectly installed plumbing. We opened the window again and held our breath while we slept. Next morning we didn\u2019t even want to shower or go anywhere near the bathroom. We just wanted to leave, and didn\u2019t care what the new hotel would be like because anything would have been better than the Domus Sewer. The woman at the desk was surprised to see us leaving and offered us a new room because someone had cancelled at the last minute that morning. The new room she offered us at the Domus Ester did not smell, but it was directly across from the reception desk (not exactly private) and we just wanted to leave. If it wasn't for the Domus Ester smelly mishap we would not have known about the quiet, clean, contemporary Bed and Breakfast which was like a trendy apartment in the heart of Rome called the \u201cInandOutB&B.\u201d www.inandout-rome.com The In and Out Bed and Breakfast had the best espressos, lattes and croissants we had in any breakfast-included hotel in Italy. We really appreciate that the Domus Ester made a new arrangement, but it is inhumane to expect anyone to endure a smell of sewage strong enough to make them want to leave no sooner than they arrive, let alone expect anyone to pay for it in the first place. We are grateful that they were reasonable and understanding enough to make a new arrangement. I should also make it clear that not all the rooms at the Domus Ester have this problem and maybe they will get the sewage smell corrected in the room we had. If not for the smell, it is a fairly good hotel in an ideal location for experiencing the historic sights and trendy restaurants in Rome.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location (if you can find it...)\u201d", "Author": "Dynamene", "ReviewID": "UR37077024", "Content": "When we arrived at Domus Ester we were quite apprehensive after seeing the outside, a graffiti lined alley, but were pleasantly surprised when we made it up to the hotel (on 2nd/3rd floors of building, no lift but luckily the staff were insistent on carrying our bags for us).
