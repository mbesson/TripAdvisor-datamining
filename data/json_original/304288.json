{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean, quiet, decent value if ou can get a special rate This is a business hotel (SMALL rooms) run by the same group as the imperial hotel (so I was told). It is very close to Hanzomon station and so really easy to go to omotesando, shibuya and it is also right near the imperial palace, very nice during cherry blossom season. Very few foreigners stay there but they seem to be able to cope (I speak Japanese but I think they usually had someone who could function in english). If yo want hustle and bustle I would not stay here.It is a good value and safe", "Date": "Apr 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR966883802", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SFintrepid"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066443-d304288-r7350752-Grand_Arc_Hanzomon-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "304288", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
