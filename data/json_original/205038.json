We knew 4 star abroad is not quite the same as 4 star Britain but this hotel should rate barely a 3 star. The young reception staff are great, the older ones are just miserable. We were shown to a room that was not much larger than a corridor, L shaped with twin beds that were actually around the L shape so the foot of both beds were together! we went to reception to ask for another room, they had none until next day but could put us in the attic, this was a much bigger room (incredibly noisy) and you had to walk around like the Hunchback of Notre Dame as it was only possible to stand up in the middle, the bed was pushed up against the wall on one side so you had to crawl across person next to you or go on hands and knees to avoid banging your head on the ceiling. I know people say you only use the room to sleep in but it is nice to come back to a reasonably comfortable room after a long day sightseeing in a very busy Rome, the rooms in this hotel were not comfortable and were very small, also the walls were made of paper, you could hear people unzipping their suitcases and hanging their clothes in the wardrobe. This hotel was on the outskirts which was not really a problem as the Metro was close by and it is so easy to get around, the hotel restaurant was expensive and the menu didn't particularly make you want to dine in of an evening. There are no restaurants nearby but there was a supermarket and also one of two takeaways serving lovely food, mostly pizza and paninis and cakes. The breakfast was as you would expect: croissants, cheese, ham, salad, jams, fruit juice, yoghurts etc, scrambled eggs (actually omelettes cut up) were only served on a week day and not at weekends. It is the first hotel I have ever been in where your fruit juice was served in plastic cups and also plastic tea spoons, all drinks were out of machines, and the waiters and waitresses were there just to clear tables, there was no welcome or eye contact, they were very slow to fill up any things that had run out, I got the impression this hotel was run on a shoe string. I have to say the good things about the place were: it was spotlessly clean, the shower was boiling hot with lots of water pressure and the towels were large. I would not recommend anyone to stay here, it also is in need of a refurb.

Not sure when the photos were taken on their website, but there was lots of lipstick on that pig. Very shabby property. Front desk staff clearly are not in love with their jobs, even though we were pleasant to them. Internet would have been 6 euros/day, had it worked - their wireless was down throughout the hotel. For a large hotel, they had very small elevators & teeny tiny rooms, with a bathroom to match! If you are a large person, I'm not sure you will be able to enter the shower, as the fold out door of ours bumped up against the pedestal sink & left an opening of about 18 inches. Our room was big enough for a double sized mattress, with about a foot of space between the foot of the bed and the desk unit that also housed a small fridge and 13\" B & W tube TV, with poor reception (not that you'd want to spend any time in the room). On the plus side, there was a small safe, and blackout curtains. The mattress was thin, with pillows to match! The only redeeming qualities were that it was pretty close to the Metro (walk straight out to the main road, hang a left, cross the street & walk about two blocks) and they really did have quite a buffet spread for breakfast.

I had 1 reservation through a hotel booking site and the 2nd direct with the hotel. The 1st booking was a special rate for a double or twin room. When I arrived at the reception I was greeted by the staff. They were not very welcoming, There had been an error in my booking that said there would be 2 people. I arrived with my friend who had picked me up from the Airport. They immediately started wanting his ID to check him in. I explained that it was just me. They seemed very suspicious and insisted that he left his ID at the front desk whilst he escorted me to the room. They had put me in a single room. I went to the reception and state that i had booked an offer that stated I would get a double or twin. They then put me in twin. There was no room information in the room. There was what I later learned to be a mini bar in the room but no price list etc, JUST AS WELL I DIDN'T USE IT!! The breakfast was good! though staff not very welcoming and you kinda had to work it out for yourself. The 2nd night was a booking through the hotel website on a \"Gay Friendly\" offer. With a free cocktail. There was no mention at all through my stay about the cocktail. They put me in a double room. The rooms are basic and look tired. There was no tea and coffee facilities in the room. I asked and the rude staff stated I could purchase this in the bar. Bit strange for a 4 star hotel. The staff member was also smoking behind the reception desk!! The air conditioning unit was loud and rattled and didn't make it very cold. The bathroom was basic and old fashioned and therefore appeared dirty. The metro was across the road so very near to the hotel and ideal for getting into Rome. On checking out they tried to charge me again despite already paying the night before. This was a bit embarrassing. I was generally disappointed, As it was not \"cheap\" and it was 4 class hotel so i had high expectations, The only saving grace was that the breakfast was plentiful.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara CA", "Title": "\u201cRude Staff\u201d", "Author": "Mariuchi", "ReviewID": "UR119261405", "Content": "The hotel is very basic and small.

The interior in the communal parts of the hotel seemed that of a 4 star hotel, rather grand, rather well kept. We thought we had chosen a good hotel which was nice after a long afternoon drive from Florence. We weren't taken to our room, our bags were not taken for us, and were left to our own devices to find the room. This is something that is expected to at least be asked in any accommodation above 2 stars, nonetheless we found the right door. As we entered the room, we literally couldnt believe our eyes. The room was a about the size of the double bed, had to have our bags piled up on top of one another in order to get to the bed. The walls had various splash marks of various beverages, black marks, cobwebs on the ceiling. The paint had faded, the carpet had filthy stains on, the curtains looked like they had never been cleaned, there was dust everywhere, the lights flickered - far below par. The bathroom was filthy, with mould growing everywhere, the tiles laid in the bathroom were faded in parts, the shower door did not close, water leaked everywhere. The fan made a horrible noise, and the air conditioning which barely worked only had 3 options which were all very noisy. After seeing the state of the room, we went down to complain to the management. Although they remained vaguely correct and polite they seemed to think that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the room and stated that if we had paid \u20ac150 or more for the night then we would have had a completely different room. I am afraid that being a hotel pretending to be 4 stars ALL rooms need to adhere to certain standard. None of the standards one could expect even in a 1 star hotel were met. I believe that even a youth hostel would have been cleaner and better kept. We reluctantly remained in our room as the management seemed to turn a blind eye to the problems they have in their hotel room. We found a minibar which could barely be opened with greatly overly priced beverages, an old fashion, small (12\") TV stashed above the minibar - something you might find in a movie from the 80s in a cheap motel room. About the size of the minibar below. Despite the double glazing we could hear the beeping and cars running from the dual carriage way below. The mattress was firm in places and soft in others - luckily the sheets seemed a little cleaner than the rest of the room. Very disappointing. The nightmare however didn't stop there. We had breakfast - thinking that just like any other four star hotel, breakfast would be rather good. However to our great disappointment - there was no orange juice, just super sugary concentrated liquid which appeared orange which came out of a machine from the 60s. The coffee came out of an automated machine from the 80s which clearly hadn't been cleaned in months, if not years, the coffee tasted disgusting. Absolutely vile. The croissants were not fresh - tasted stale - even with the jam / cream inside. Despite us being right between the middle of the serving hours for breakfast they had run out of butter and jam as well as croissants just before we returned to our room. Something not correct there. The people working on the floor for breakfast seemed obnoxious and expected us to move out of the way when they wanted to pass without any polite words, a simple \"Thank You\" would have done. We were very glad that we only spent one night in that hotel - and would NEVER return to it - even if we were paid to do so. Extremely disappointed, felt robbed and made our night in Rome quite simply rubbish. The check-out was somewhat less polite, more rushed, and seemed they just wanted us out of the hotel. All in all a terrible experience, just hope that people would avoid this hotel - I am absolutely positive that even a youth hostel would be better - as well as better priced. This was not worth spending any money on. All in all... AVOID AT ALL COST!

This hotel is run as a business so it is not warm and fuzzy as some of the reviews of other hotels indicate. However, I would not hesitate to stay at The American Palace again. It was across the street from the Laurentina Metro stop (last stop on the blue line) and the bus station and had a taxi stand next door so transportation to central Rome is easy. My daughter and I used the Metro every day to travel into historical Rome, usually to our favorites stop, the Colosseo. The trip cost 1 Euro and took less than 15 minutes. I read many negative comments on this site about the included breakfast. While the same food is offered everyday, there is enough variety that no one person could eat all of the items at one breakfast. I stayed 8 nights and ate different foods each morning. While the food is not gourmet, the free breakfast saves the expense of one meal out - leaving more money for delicious late night dinners and gelato. As we were 3 peole for part of the trip we had a suite with a bedroom and my daughter slept on the couch. When she left the hotel did not make us move to downsize but did reduce our nightly rate which I thought was very nice. The staff were polite, again not warm and fuzzy, but we did not have any issues with bad attitudes -something that was mentioned several times in other reviews.

Quick note on the metro- make sure that they're not doing any unexpected construction at night. We had to walk a bit on our way back from the center until we reached a metro that wasn't under construction. The rooms are very bland and small. We've traveled through Europe plenty to know that European rooms are smaller but this was smaller than expected. Plus the room decor was very bland and the air conditioning was faulty. The restaurant was very good, albeit overpriced. I'm sure that it is overpriced because they expect Americans to stay there due to the name. I recommend the swordfish, it was delicious! The restaurant was also very nice. The continental breakfast provided was pretty standard and if you choose to, there are plenty of markets to stock up on food to save some money.

Location of hotel could not be better as Metro is just across the road and only 15/20 mins to city centre. Upon arrival (11.30 a.m) we were told that we could not check in until 2 p.m.. Basil lookalike and his sidekick Manuel could not of been less helpful in directing us to the supermarket and Metro but as we had a few hours to kill we braved it ourselves. The supermarket is just up the road and we used this regularly to purchase water, wine and nibbles. As a rule you will pay anything from 1.50 - 2.50 euros for a cold bottle of small water from stands and a full 1.5 litre bottle from supermarket was 0.35 euros. Just pray your fridge works in the hotel room. Ours didnt and tried the leaving the door open trick but that had no impact. Couldnt be bothered to complain having read other reviews and the lack of urgency to problems from Manuel & Basil. On the first night we didnt feel like going into the city centre as been up since 2 in the morning. We decided to eat in the resturant. DONT do it !!! we waited a good hour to finally get our meal which was very nice. However, we had a main course each, 2 side dishes and water and it came to 49 euros !!! The wine is ever so overpriced, 16 euros for half bottle!!! you can get a half decent bottle of Frascati from the Supermarket for 3.50 euros.. You do the maths.. The other thing is that they give preference to local Italians over guests and this is blatantly obvious to all!!! Breakfast is only cold meats, bread, cereal, fruit, yoghurt and very continetal.. We had no problem with this as if u want a full english, go to Spain. Unlimited amounts so you can get a good fill before you then go out and treak the city. The hotel was very clean but it seems as though the resturant and bar were run as a seperate business. We insisted upon a double room at the back of the hotel having read reviews of how noisy it is at the front.

Location - this is good in that it is the end of Metro B tube line - Laurentina station. Means you always get a seat and its around 25 mins to Termini or Colosseum. The hotel is 3 mins walk to the tube. Location - Bad. Its on a 3 lane main road and the road noise is terrible unless you get to the back of the hotel. Room - just big enough to swing a cat in. I didnt know they still did 12 inch portable TV's either and the channel choice was poor and not aligned to the hotel guide. Bathroom adequate. All in all, good location for me as i was working 5 mins walk away but high road noise throughout the night and lack of aircon will be horrendous in summer months.", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cFine if you don't mind sleeping next to a motorway!!\u201d", "Author": "Lou033", "ReviewID": "UR12259193", "Content": "The noise from the traffic outside could be heard over a resonably loud TV.

After pulling them up on this we got a larger room 3 days later. The standard of the decor and service does not befit a 4 star hotel, closer to 3. The desk staff were also quite stroppy and unhelfpul. We were told all the shops were closed on Sundays, only to find everything open in town mid sales! Breakfast was mediocre with stale croissants and coffee from a vending machine type dispenser. It is very close to Laurentina line B station, but this line has no air con and all the trains are covered in graffitti.

The breakfast selection is large, but not spectacular, get there early or it will be gone. Rooms are clean, and staff is for the most part cordial. i actually got more helpful information from the lady around the corner at the Tabbacci stand. Example, i asked the hotel staff some questions about the area and they tried to sell me a map for 9 Euros and All i asked for was directions to the Banco Roma The rooms are small. I know alot of americans say this when it comes to European hotels, but i have stayed in many, and by comparison, very very small. We had a hard time putting two average size suitcases in the room. You can lay across the room longways and touch each wall toe to fingertip (5'9\"). Room had a nice little balcony, but we were on the street side, and it was very load all times of day and night. A/C I think was for show only. The best attribute about the hotel is not the hotel itself, but its location. It is set on a business block that is compariable to a small outside neiborhood mall here in the states. The street next to the hotel has a variety of small cafes, a gelato shop, pharmacy, clothing, tabacci (stamps, magazines, cigarettes, ect..) And about 5 banks that are perfect for currency exchange. (do not use the hotel, their rates were outrageous!) Also the hotel is located about a 5 minute walk from the subway station. Very nice, but it is about a 25 mintue ride into the heart of Rome.

The breakfast was fine as long as you arrived before the coach loads and if you sat long enough the continental fare was replenished.

No fault of the hotel, but it should be advertised at a lower star rating.

Let me count the whys: The rooms are TINY. The hotel advertises 'air conditioning', but in our room, 401, it was so ineffectual, we could not sleep the first night. When we complained about it we got a shrug and were told that the hotel was full so the aircon didn't work so well. The hotel lobby was well air conditioned 'though, so I thought this was illogical. They made no suggestions to address this problem and I had to ask for a fan, which was the only thing that made the room temperature bareable. It made a lot of noise and meant we had to walk over the bed a lot. The so called minibar consisted of a quater bottle of sparkling wine, 2 cans of soft drinks, 1 beer, 2 small bottles of water and 2 small fruit juice cans, all of which were warm. No food. We eventually realised that the casing around the fridge was hot to the touch and that opening it made the fridge work better, but I think there is a real health and safety issue here. The reception staff, apart from the blonde woman, were very good at avoiding any contact with you and were extremely brusque when they were forced to acknowldge you. The hotel could not provide me with an iron so I was forced to send some items to be ironed and the hotel lost them, forcing me to wear dirty clothes in the meantime.. Eventually they found them and, when I checked the list, they had altered the tarrifs without telling me, charging me more. I left a clear plastic bag of underwear in the bathroom and they threw it away! When I complained I was told I must have left it 'Near the bin'. Hard not to in a floor area of 3 feet square. Room 401 and 2 other rooms that we saw had dark marks and stains on the walls and were in dire need of redecoration. The hotel advertises a 'free breakfast' but, if you want eggs or bacon, you have to order it for your room at 5 euros each - when we sampled this delight, it was hideously inedible. I mean, really, don't. The breakfast downstairs included bread that was stale by 10am, 'coffee' and 'juice' machines that produce liquids almost but not entirely unlike coffee and juice. The bar area is advertised as open until 11.30pm but it was left unattended most of the time and closed by 10 on at least 2 occassions. Also, the restaurant was closed all the time that we were there. On the small plus side, there is a beautiful tiled court yard with nice tables and chairs surrounded by lime trees. The linen and bathroom were all very clean and they knocked off 15 Euros when I complained at the end of our stay.

On our first full day in Rome, having got to the airport very early in the morning, we went for breakfast at 9.30am - bad idea! All that was left was cereal and dry bread buns! No croissants, no toast - nothing! And the kitchen people were clearing everything away. The tea machine wouldn't work either. The next morning we went at 7.30am and it was very BUSY - lots of food but extremely busy so I suggest you get up early for a decent breakfast! The staff on reception were very un co-operative and far from polite, they were also very unhelpful. There was only one guy there that would say \"hi\" and \"please\" and \"thank you\". The only good thing about the hotel is that it is 2 mins away from the Metro station and there is a bus stop right outside the hotel. No restaurants are in the nearby area so you're better off going into a place called Barberini (change at Termini to Linea A) - the restaurants there are fantastic and really cheap.
