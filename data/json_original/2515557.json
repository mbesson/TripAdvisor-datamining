I went back into the lobby and asked for a first floor room or second floor at least and she gave us one. When we got in the room though we were pleasantly surprised. The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it. I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was blah but I wasn't expecting much from continental. Lo and behold, something else was broken! There are two Belgian waffle makers and one was out of order so we waited a very long time for our turn. Cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, etc. Every piece of fruit I got was a little past prime.

We grabbed a muffin and found our way to Little Italy's farmers market where we got a pretty good panini sandwich for breakfast. I think some people are having trouble with bookings mainly because of Expedia and Hotwire. If anyone takes the time to read the other reviewers, most had trouble with their reservations because they made them though a secondary company. The hotel didn't get a \"5\" mainly because the breakfast room was a bit small for the complex, and the ice machine close to our room was broken. We had to go to the 3rd floor for the ice we needed. I also think that San Diego in general is a bit expensive. The hotel was full and as good business people they charge what they can. A previous reviewer mentioned that he did not want to use his Hilton points. Folks... this is not a Hilton hotel. I'm sure the \"Del Coronado\" is a better hotel.
