There is a small parking lot next to the hotel, though it fills up fast. We got the last spot thankfully, as it was my husband and I with our toddler, and traveling with kids means extra stuff to lug to the room. The room was nice, two double beds with a table and chair. The bathroom had a nice large shower. However there is no AC so we had to open the windows. We were at the back of the building and it wasn't as noisy as I expected. The beds are a bit hard and could use some extra pillows but my husband liked it as he prefers harder mattresses. The main attraction with this hotel is that it is right on the beach. Yes, you have to walk past a homeless camp to get to it, but they didn't bother us. We were able to spend the morning by the ocean and it was a good way to end our trip.

Other than some spots or wear holes on the carpet the room was clean as was the rest of the building, the bed was comfortable although the pillows were thin (luckily I was alone and could pile both on top of each other), and the shower and bathroom were decent, with room service restocking and changing towels, etc each day. The wireless internet was quite good, and the counter staff were helpful, especially the bearded gentleman, and they try their best to give you a good room. You can also go up to the rooftop for good views, etc, but there's nothing really provided up there to make it comfortable other than a couple of broken chairs. On the negative side the Venice area is not really the most salubrious around these days. A lot of homeless people live just outside the hotel, along the beach front, and other unsavoury sorts can tend to gather around. Although I never really felt threatened, I also didn't feel entirely comfortable walking around at night. It is however just a few blocks north until you hit Santa Monica and the vibe improves quickly. A lot of peddlers and legal marijuana sales are also just out along the boardwalk - fine if that's what you're after. Also the area is quite noisy until around 11pm - midnight (this was during midweek). Another minor beef was that the coffee machine in the foyer was broken down for the three days I was there until the morning I was leaving - annoying that they didn't even provide alternative facilities, such as instant coffee to fill in. With no airconditioning, I also imagine it could get very hot in summer. Venice is also not that convenient to the main tourist areas, such as Hollywood, Downtown LA, or the theme parks. It's fine if you want a beach experience, but there's a fair bit of travelling to get anywhere else. Even Santa Monica is a decent half-hour walk away. It is possible to get the local bus to downtown, which takes about an hour and travels through some interesting areas that I was probably glad not to be walking through, but it is cheap at only $1.50. This bus goes quite close to the hotel and terminates at Union Station downtown. All up the Cadillac was a decent performer at a reasonable price for LA. In future I would probably stay elsewhere, say Santa Monica if I wanted the beach, or otherwise nearer to where the other action is, but that's probably as a much a statement about the area in general as the hotel itself.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cthin walls, very noisy\u201d", "Author": "Charles F", "ReviewID": "UR126544308", "Content": "The location of this hotel was great, however the walls are super-thin, leading to a very noisy hotel experience.

We paid a few bucks extra for an ocean view room, which looked right out over the beach. Many other hotels in LA would charge $400+/night for that kind of view, and we got it for less than $200/night. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. If you don't want to spend the money for the ocean view room, they have a rooftop patio with good views, although there weren't any chairs or furniture up there. The hotel had no breakfast either, but it is near several good cafes and breakfast/brunch places. The hotel is right on the boardwalk in Venice Beach, with all of its colorful characters. If you are from a rural area, it may seem a little intimidating. However, if you live in an urban area, you will feel right at home in this neighborhood. The only downside was that everything closed early. The boardwalk was relatively deserted after dark, and even the local bars were shooing us out by 11. (Maybe things stay open later in the summer?) Parking was an adventure. When we arrived, the man at the front desk told us that their lot was full, but we could park in the \"public lot\" a half-block away. (The hotel charges $15/night for the parking, even in this other lot.) We drove around looking for the lot, could not find it and had to go back and ask him which lot he meant. Eventually, we realized the lot he was referring to was not a public lot at all, but the valet lot for a local restaurant. This caused us some confusion and concern at first, but the valet said it was fine because they have an arrangement with the hotel. This was actually a great solution for us because it was a half-block from the hotel, and we had someone keeping an eye on our car. Bottom line: if you are looking for a four-star experience, spend the extra money to stay in Santa Monica or some other part of LA. However, if you want a decent room and view at half the price in an eclectic neighborhood, the Cadillac is a great choice.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for in CALI\u201d", "Author": "tatertot1982", "ReviewID": "UR125901483", "Content": "This place is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The unassuming building blends in seamlessly with the surrounding shops and residences, and the carnival of boardwalk characters who make Venice so famous were just bopping around every which way. However, once inside the hotel, we were impressed by how set apart the interior was from the boardwalk scene. From the lobby, through the halls, and to our room, it was clear the hotel had been recently renovated. With a minimalist approach, it was clean and stylish through and through, with no no air of hipster or This Is Art. The concierge on-duty appeared to be a one-man show for the evening. He was friendly, laid-back, and knowledgeable. For an additional $16 we were able to park just on the other side of building. We also requested wifi access for an extra $2. All tolled, we spent $140 for the night. Our queen room was a little gem, a comfy and close space. It had a simple elegance and the basic furnishing, which included a flat screen TV and ipod dock. Our window alone allowed us all the sights and sounds that, put together, make Venice Beach feel like SOMEWHERE--ocean waves rolling; people talking, singing, yelling, laughing; sand and palm trees all the way up to the lights of Santa Monica Pier.

Our room had a great view, that I am sure we hadn't booked, or was just way better then what we had anticipated which was a lovely little surprise for us on Christmas day :) All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave us some great tips on how to get the most out of our time in Venice. Some noise from cleaners and a little street noise but nothing too disturbing. Street noise in Venice is kinda part of the fun of the place. If you are not looking for that atmosphere perhaps Santa Monica is more your style. But we loved the place, great location.

On the beach front there were a lot of homeless and people probably on drugs (there were 3 medical marajuana centres) so I wouldn't advise it for those with children, but I felt perfectly safe even at night. The people weren't nearly at threatening or scary as some of the beggars in the big cities (San Fran/ San Diego). Just a couple of blocks into the town from the hotel are loads of good restaurants. As for the hotel, all staff we spoke to were very friendly. The first receptionist advised us the best place to park; an underground parking lot just a couple of blocks away which was $12 for overnight and seemed safest. He provided a map and showed us how to get there and where to go for dinner. Other guys were also friendly and chatty. The room was clean, no problems with it.

From my understanding this place used to be a hostel and it's definitely haunted by it's past. The rooms are very small and cleanliness is not the hotel's top priority (see pictures). It was so bad that I asked to be moved to another room but was told the hotel was full and I would have to try again in a few days. No such luck. Here are the highlights (or lowlights as it is more appropriately entitled): - Parking is ridiculously difficult; this is not the hotel's fault however, they charge for parking in their lot in which it is nearly impossible to get a spot. The one night I lucked out and got a spot, hotel charged me for two days of parking ($30) when I entered the lot at 11:30 p.m. and departed at 2:00 p.m. the next day. Unbelievable! The other option is to park on the street which is free but not easy. I ended up parking almost a mile away from the hotel. I know the distance because I had to use my car's GPS to find my way back to the hotel (embarrassing but true). - The rooms are not as advertised and there was no refrigerator which I really wanted and expected. - The rooms were not very clean or well kept (see pictures). - The walls are paper thin! You can hear your neighbors' thoughts! The hotel is also very loud which isn't a problem at 6:00 p.m. but it's annoying at 6:00 a.m. It's also supposed to be a non-smoking hotel which other guests continuously ignore that rule. When I contacted the front desk in reference to the smoke filled halls which was infiltrating my room. I was told that the only thing they could do was charge the guests for violating that rule! - The window was broken so it wouldn't stay open. I found this out the very hard way after it slammed down on my hand causing three injured fingers (including one with a bloodclot). - No cell phone reception in the hotel. This may just be my carrier but it was still very annoying. On the flip side, the hotel has reliable wi-fi service. - I want to speak briefly about its \"great\" location. This was my first visit to Venice Beach and though none of my friends had stayed at this hotel, the general area came highly recommended. I read the other reviews about the characters that hang out around the hotel but they were not explicit enough. Many of the people are from a half-way house located on the next street and are addicts and other unseemly types. I was warned by a local to be back inside the hotel by dark or no later than 9:00 pm and after my five-day stay I can say he was absolutely correct in giving this advice. One night the police had cordoned off the area around the hotel because a \"man with a gun\" was on the loose. There were many police cars and a helicopter. Even during the day I found the area undesirable...and I'm from New York City! If I were to return I would definitely stay further towards the Santa Monica Pier area. - The staff was the only reason I gave the hotel 2 stars.

The staff... well, they went out of theyre way to make sure we had EVERYTHING we needed, they were kind and curtious and friendly and super fun! My shout out to Nikky..

The hotel itself was quiet- I barely saw or heard another guest the entire weekend. I even had the rooftop to myself every morning for the perfect view of the sunrise. My room was very clean upon arrival, and kept that way by the housekeeping staff. The front desk staff were helpful in providing me with the information I needed, and very friendly.

Most are pretty accurate to what we found on our stay. Venice Beach itself is a place of diversity. Anything goes, and expect it. If that is not what you enjoy, find another place to visit. For us it was fun! The Cadillac Hotel is eclectic, reflecting the area perfectly. We stayed on the second floor. The room was small but clean. There is no A/C at the hotel but with the windows open it was no too bad, but a little sticky as the hotel is right next to the ocean. Just next door is a small convenience store, a restaurant/bar, and lots of shopping. All in all, for the low price of the room and if you are wanting to visit the Venice Beach area, then this is a good place to stay. There are no luxuries here, expect only the basics, but it will give you a great feel of experiencing the entire scheme of things and a very convenient ok place to sleep. We have no complaints at all about our stay except for the parking. This was the one considerable downfall, as the lot was full (it is very small) and you are basically left to find a place of your own to park. There is free parking along the street about 2 blocks up, but your car has to be moved before 8:30a.m. the following morning or it will be towed. That wasnt a big problem because you can move your car to the beach parking lot which was $6.00 for all day. It makes for a moving game though, every day. The worst part was the walk back in the evening from your car to the hotel - in the dark. There are \"interesting\" characters around, we didnt feel completely safe after dark.

Its in a very popular part of the strip with the locals being that there is a pub & a patio resturant right beside it popular with such...also the transients there frequent that area. There was previous reviews stating the noise from the locals & such from below, but we got there on a Saturday & the whole strip seem to shut down right before 12am & the street was quiet. Again, this was on a Saturday...which we found shocking for such a lively beach compared to the entire pacific coast we had travelled. We expected the eccentricness of venice...& found it as we expected & if not easier to bear & less than we thought. It was just like back home in B.C. Canada :) Ok so about the rooms!! There again we research everything already & new what to expect. We had a room that wasnt facing the busy walk way, but then it had a view of a wall & partcial parking lot & a neighbooring courtyard. There was some simple things the owners of this hotel could easly do to make the REGULAR cost worthy & possibly upgrade the star rating.....like buying new sheets for the beds & throwing out the ones that have been marked & other wise damaged/ uncleanable! Second the carpet seemed sketchy. absolutly needs to be replaced atleast in our room, which was a family suit! Just saying, small things that easly could be done like a soap rack /shower eccessories...should be able to find one, like from a dollar store even, one for every room ohwell. Plus what would be so bad about purchasing patio furniture or atleast chairs for the wicked rooftop they have. We new that this might be one of the hotels we might end up getting when looking on hotwire....& at the price range offered on it we had hoped it would be this hotel due to the location & such. It is a 2 and a half star hotel & it was worth $92 a night plus $40 extra to upgrade to a family suit. :) Much props to the guy at the front desk he was friendly & a cool guy, & hey no problem for me fixing that water dripping on metal noise in the alley way btw. I hope that helps everyone.THIS IS A GOOD BACK PACKING & COUPLE OR & PARTYING WITH DA LOCALS OR ON THE STRIP TYPE PLACE. But really you couldnt really find abetter place right on the strip anyways.

This time I returned with my 14 year young son for spring break in LA. We travelled from Vancouver, Canada. First off I am very aware that Venice Beach reflects a diverse and eclectic mix of society and in part that alone can contribute to one's experience. We felt safe and never encountered any threatening behavior from a small group of street people scattered amongst the crowd of faces from all parts of the world taking in the uniqueness of this somewhat artsy/edgy community. During our three night stay we took in a basketball game at the Staples Center, cycled the Boardwalk to Manhattan Beach and walked during the evenings to Santa Monica, and back to the hotel, it is fair to say the noise factor if any subsides by 11:30 p.m. Jeff & Shirey ( the Hotel Management ) are friendly, extremely helpful and caring.

Firstly, you can practically \"feel\" the crime rate in the area. The alleys this glorified motel sits in is littered with drunks, prostitutes and rude homeless. There is little outside apart from the glowing pink neon to indicate this is actually a hotel. The inside lobby is disgusting garage sale art deco, featuring a claustrophobic elevator, one-man sized, that made me fear for my life. I opened the door to my room, with high hopes of a respite from a day's travel from the East Coast, only to have them obliterated as the sickly halogen light illuminated the room. I have never seen a room in any hotel, short of Tokyo Coffin Motels, as small as this dismal room was. The queen size bed, which looked like something Ikea would throw out as \"cheap particle board\", occupied nearly the entirety of the room. In order to reach the far end of the room, one physically would have to contort to dodge the poorly mounted HDTV on the wall and the foot of the bed. Space between the wall and the bed was literally about 5 inches. the far side of the spartan room featured a spindley table and two rickety chairs that appeared to have been saved from the trash heap of a dwelling in the ghetto. They did not appear to be capable of bearing weight in the slightest. A small fridge hummed in the corner, and was the only place I could actually put my luggage up on. The heat and claustrophic effect of the room made me look instinctively for the thermostat. There was none. The room was not climate controlled. It had an ominous looking ceiling fan that I cranked to high while I flipped on the TV - an HDTV flat screen, ironically hooked up to cable quality rivalling that of tin-foil-covered rabbit ears antenna reception. The bathroom made me long for the comparatively wide open spaces of a lavatory on a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737. The shower was fine, so long as you stood perfectly still with your hands at your sides. See, not enough room to raise your arms in the shower. It was about 2 feet by 2 feet. The towels, of which there were three... had the texture of high grade sandpaper. Cotton thread count 30. I took my shoes off, and the carpet was actually sticky to the touch. Underneath the bedsheets was a layer of plastic. Having read other reviews of this hotel, I realize now that the plastic was not to prevent a guest from ruining the bed, but rather to mitigate the high chance of a guest catching scabies or bedbugs from the beds. After spending a single night in The Cadillac, we cancelled our five day stay and forfeited the following night's charge.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berne", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location, neat and clean\u201d", "Author": "l3my", "ReviewID": "UR26161990", "Content": "Started my 2 weeks california trip with my younger sister in this hotel.

I would stay there again depending on the reason for the trip. My son and I were doing a college tour along with another mom and son and thought that staying on Venice Beach would be fun for the teenage boys. Our days were busy so it was actually the moms who enjoyed the beachfront and the boys slept in. The Cadillac is undergoing renovation, but it didn't affect us at all except that we enjoyed an attractively low rate. The rooms were simply appointed with beds, flat screen tv, and small fridge. New paint job, carpets, and bathroom greeted us from a long trip on the red-eye. Everything was very clean. There was no chest of drawers, but the closet has built-in shelves. There was no chair or table in one of the rooms, but I think there was a chair in the other. Try to get a room with the flat screen tv between the beds, not at the end of the room. The boys said the tv at the far end of the room wasn't as bad as they thought. They also had a sink outside the bathroom which they didn't quite understand, but which I think could be handy when sharing a room. Our favorite part was the location -- right on the beach. We enjoyed walking every morning along the walkways and down on the beach. There are some nice eateries and coffee places open early. The Fig Tree has wonderful, healthy breakfasts at half price before 9 a.m. I bought some breakfasts at Henry's market right across from the Cadillac, and they were delicious. We dared not venture on the beach after dark. There is a large 'bohemian' contingent situated at the gathering place in front of the Cadillac,. This did not deter us from staying there and we felt safe walking in a group back from the parking lot. There is a lovely Italian restaurant across from the Cadillac where we caught a nice glass of wine (although pricey) at the end of a day and we felt quite safe. The staff was very nice and helpful with any questions we had. We would all stay there again if we weren't going to spend much time in a hotel. It was perfect for us. I only wish we had more time to take in the sights of Venice Beach during the day, but we were busy visiting colleges and relatives. I often travel for leisure and stay at resorts with family.

We had booked the stay in LA early since we knew that the area around Santa Monica and Venice Beach is rather expensive. You can imagine the feeling when we arrived and was told that they had given our room to someone else! I had the order confirmation but they could not care less and showed us the door. It did not help much that we got the $22 deposit back, since I knew that now it would be impossible to find a decent and affordable place to stay. I was wrong! We found Cadillac Hotel in a hotel guide, cheap compared to many other alternatives but still not fully booked. In the beginning, this left me a little suspicious, but there were only good surprises! The hotel is right on the beach walk and our room had ocean view. Also, we got a queen size bed even though we could only afford to pay for the single beds, greatly appreciated being newly engaged. The room was nice and clean and there was Internet access for a small fee. There was even parking behind the hotel for a decent fee. There was also great overall service, e.g. we were missing one towel and it was sent up while I was still in the shower in a matter of minutes. Finally, the hotel went the extra mile to solve a misunderstanding when they did not have to. Before leaving we made an agreement that the hotel would ship a package back to Sweden that had not arrived yet. I signed a paper authorizing them to charge my credit card for the shipping costs. However, there was a misunderstanding regarding the shipping and it resulted in the shipping being much more expensive than we thought. The hotel had my approval to send it, and I was back in Sweden, so they could have ignored me. Instead they were kind and friendly and agreed to split the shipping cost. Great service!

We were told at the desk that they should be there and then given to us for us to take them up. I walked off showing that they could bring them up to me. What else am I paying for?

I should have known from the price that this place was a dump, but I'm adventurous, pretty easy-going and try to avoid cookie-cutter chains ... however, even I have my limits. First, the skateboard shop on the lower level plays music so loud you cannot hear on the telephone. Closing the window doesn't help. It starts early in the morning and doesn't wind down until well into the evening, but then the bums are ready for their shift. They sit in a courtyard under the windows and talk all night. Oh, and they get louder as they get more drunk. If you have a nice car or are worried about your rental-car deposit, you don't want to park in the lot. You must park so close to other cars that there's virtually no way to avoid getting dinged. If you get back late at night, there are no spaces left, so the management wants you to leave your keys with them so they can move your car in and out of the center aisle so other cars can get in and out. I wouldn't give my keys to these folks under ANY circumstances, even if my car were a junker. Yes, the hotel is on the beach, but the room windows, which are crowded by the fire-escape stairs, are so small you can't see anything unless you're sitting right next to them. And remember, this was their top \"suite.\" I can't even begin to imagine how horrid the hostel rooms must be. Everything in the room was sticky and grimy. The room stank, and I've seen better furniture dumped near Goodwill bins. The TV was a circa 1970 19\" black and white ... I think ... because I could't pick up any stations anyhow. The shower didn't work, which I dealt with, but when I told them at the front desk as I was leaving, they looked at me like, \"yeah? so what?\" If you want to see Venice and Santa Monica, just pay for a parking space near the beach, they aren't that expensive, or take a cab or public transit, then go back to a better hotel. There are tons of very cool older motels that people are buying and fixing up all around Santa Monica, so if you want to avoid the chains, it's not difficult.

Actually, there are only about 15 to 20 spaces and cars are jam packed; and when we arrived around 11 p.m. at night, there was no where to park. The hotel clerk told me it wasn't his problem and that it was first come first serve parking situation. Secondly, the minute I parked by the hotel entrance, 2 people came up to me (they were either drunk or on drugs) telling me they'd call the police if I didn't move my vehicle ASAP. Next, I decided to see the inside of my room. It was nothing like it showed on the picture. The room was about 200 square feet with 3 small beds. The overall appearance of the room was like a homeless shelter. The entrance door didn't have deadlock, just one key. There is no air conditioning in the room. It so happened the day we arrived it was very humid and hot outside, and very stuffy in the room itself. I was also a bit concerned about our safety. In a matter of 10 minutes I saw all kinds of people hanging just outside, and inside the hotel.

I suspect that many of the bad reviews are coming from people who had expected something more for their money, or from rival hotels, who knows.

I went to Manhattan Beach and Hermosa, and those two places felt like gentrified Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. Venice is crowded with really cool little stores, kiosks, lots of street performers, including a group of Chicago break dancers who made me proud.

The music from downstairs in the day is enough to drive you insane. The homeless folks out front are nice enough, but they like to chat until the wee hours, and you will hear them while you roll around in bed, desperately hoping for some sleep. The otherwise very friendly management will try to make you stay three days minimum and charge your card completely up front. I'm sure they've implemented this very unusual and somewhat unethical practice because so many people have changed their minds after staying one night. Don't do it -- and especially not on a weekend -- or you'll regret it. LA is one city where you must rent a car to get around, and it's strongly advisable to stay at different hotels in different areas each night. E.g. if you want a night out on the Sunset strip while staying the three nights at the Cadillac, plan on long drives and/or $80 in cab fares or 2 hr bus rides each way.
