After reading some poor reviews, became appprehesive, as we have previously stayed at the Hilton Vacation Club, and we're sure anything would be a let down. Upon our arrival, which was early, we were treated like valued guests and within an hour, our villa was ready. Everything was perfect, the location across from the pool, the cleanliness, amentities, etc. We were so pleased with everything, we made reservations for next Summer. The activities for kids was great, our daughter loved the magic show and crafts which were at no cost. Any maintanence problems were dealt with promptly and was even giving a jump start when the battery in our rental car died (I left the lights on). Everyone at this resort is great with the exception of the sales staff. We got talked into the 60 minute presentation to keep from being bothered every day during our vacation. Big mistake. Four hours later, after 3 very rude sales people, we were let go. There is so much to do at the resort, we only went to the atttraction twice during our 3 week stay (Busch Gardens and Dinosaur World).", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNothing is really what it seems!\u201d", "Author": "EllaRuby08", "ReviewID": "UR122633521", "Content": "Timeshare, that word itself will cause a reaction. 90 minutes becomes 4 hrs of interrogation, \"obviously, you are going to go on a 10 day vacation every year\".

There was a total of 6 adults and 4 kids (all girls) ranging from ages 3 to 10. This resort is very accommodating to kids of all ages, and has many activities including a water park, minature golf, and an activity center in the main office. We stayed in building 406 on the 3rd floor, which was not an issue due to the building elevator access. We stayed in a very spacious 4 bedroom suite which included 2 master bedrooms with King sized beds, jacuzzi baths tubs & walkin showers. The other 2 rooms were equipped with 2 full size beds and a guest bathroom which were very spacious as well. We enjoyed a large living area with 52\" LG HDTV and DVD player, as well as 2 fully equipped kitchens. The rooms were very clean when we arrived as we were very impressed with the accommodations. The resort is within a 10 minute drive from all the Disney parks which made travel to & from during the day very convenient. There are many other convenient amenities located very close to this resort. There is a Wal-Mart and Target located within 4 miles for your general shopping needs. Overall I would highly recommend a stay at the Summer Bay Resort and I will be returning for my next Disney vacation stay.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Qualicum Beach, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFansatstic place!\u201d", "Author": "misspriss033", "ReviewID": "UR97097281", "Content": "I stayed at this resort with my daughter, son-in-law and 4 grandchildren for a week, and it was the best holiday we had ever had, and we vacation together every winter.

Check In: We got there a little early and had no problems getting our room they even moved us closer to the kiddy waterslides. We had Zero hastle from the ladies giving the sales pitch. They just asked us if we were interested, told us the times and handed us a brochure. Room: Awesome, clean and pretty big. It had balcony that overlooked a pond with ducks that the kids loved. All of the towels were formed to make hearts or swans, very nice touch. The \"florida house\" as the kids called it came with a little goody bag that included dishwashing and laundry detergent. A TV in each of the rooms, and the bathroom in the master suite was large, to include the jaccuzzi. Amenities: The Kids LOVED the water slides. Dad liked having a bar at the main pool. Golf course is nice and pretty cheap. We never made it to the beach or looked into renting the paddle boats and jet ski's. Location: 15 min from the Disney locations, with a Walmart in walking distance. Price: We booked through the AFVC so it was only 350.00 for the week, can't beat that price. DOWNSIDE: The only negative comment me and my wife could come up with was that the WIFI was expensive.

Its not the newest of resorts, but we got a rate of $299 for the week for a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit with a full kitchen...they were so accomodating that once i saw the room they had for us, i wanted a unit that was closer to the kids pool, they switched us right away with no issues. It was clean....it had leather couches and chairs! It was close enough to town and Disney but far enough to feel away from it all....it was awesome and i am glad those reviews didn't scare us away, because we had a wonderful week. The only main downfall that we experiences was we had to pay either $9.95 a day for in room wi-fi, or $39.95 for the week, which is the one we opted for--it turned out to be the weakest connection and kept kicking us off....but that was the only downfall.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201c90 minute presentation?
