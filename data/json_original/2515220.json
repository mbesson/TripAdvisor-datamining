I wish we had not. The photos on the hotel website were obviously taken a long time ago and our two rooms were now very run down - horrible stains on the wallpaper, lots of rips and damage to the wall paper and chipped furniture and window frames. One of the bathrooms did not have a shower screen so we all had to shower in one room. It also had horrible brown damp patches and peeling flaking paint on the ceiling, dirty window frames and big stains on the floor tiles. The brown velvet curtains separating the bedrooms from the bathrooms were dirty and stained, the wine glasses in our room were very dusty, light bulbs had gone and not been replaced.... I could go on and on. In addition the extra roll out bed we had paid for for our third child was not there so we had to chase for it. The downstairs outdoor terrace which looks so pretty on the website has had all flowers and attractive decorative items removed and was being used as a store for staff scooters. All in all the worst hotel we have ever stayed in - a two star experience at rip off four star prices!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "Diana P", "ReviewID": "UR126030857", "Content": "Small and cozy hotel, very well situated in a nice neighborhood!

I was told that the hotel had a very strict cancellation policy and that no matter what I would have to pay the full \u00a3345 for a room I wasn't going to stay in despite the fact they had 5 full working days to sell the room again. I asked if it was possible just change the date to still stay at that hotel - no flexibility there either. Also, I asked if they sold the room again whether I could then get a refund but no chance of that either. I was simply advised to try my travel insurance. Not impressed by either Le Placide or Mrs and Mrs Smith. Yes, I knew there was a 5 day cancellation policy so I do take responsibility for that but the fact that I couldn't contact the booking agent on a Sunday made it impossible for me to give the required notice.

The bathroom was easily two-thirds the size of the bedroom. Due to the design of the bath nozzle, it wasn't easy to keep the floor dry. A fatal design flaw was the faucet knob. There were completely no grooves so forget about trying to turn it with your soapy wet hands. Unlike a large impersonal hotel chain, the advantage of staying in a small boutique is the personalized touch. At 11pm, the concierge managed to dig up a tube of sample toothpaste for my emergency use. Needless to say, they were also very helpful with maps and directions.

The cold cuts were simply rotten. No bread available in the morning, croissants were dry and really too expensive for the quality and quantity of food. Avoid the breakfast in this hotel. Go out and turn to the left twice and you have a breakfast deal for 10 euros. Much better. - Noisy, noisy and really noisy. We heared doors cracking every single minute and even with the ear plugs you can hear everything: metro (all night in the weekends), street's noise, people in the other rooms, chairs moving and cleaning people. - Maintenance very weak: every fourniture in the room had a problem and we could see that the level of maintenance was low. The television was in black and white!!!!! - Size of the junior suite is simply ridiculous. When you are three persons in the room, you can't even move around. In conclusion, the owner of this hotel is really abusing to charge almost 444 euros per night for three persons in a junior suite (following their standards) with such poor service, breakfast, size of the room and noises.

I had a booked my room through the hotel's own website, which offered me a good deal (business package including breakfast - a better deal than through regular hotelbooking sites). The hotel only has 11 rooms, of which the one on the ground floor I believe is for the disabled and which is smaller. The other 10 rooms are divided over 5 floors, which means there are only two rooms on each floor (with a tiny elevator in the middle) - and each floor has its own decoration theme. My room on the fourth floor had walls with a black and white tree patterned paper and colored Kenzo cushions and bedspread, which looked cheerful but was a bit loud to my liking. The bed was good, the pillows were a bit too firm for me. There was a business desk in my room with a free internet connection that worked without any problem, which was pleasant and which is not for granted in Paris. I was informed by the hotel that the rooms on the top floor (fifth floor) do not have this business desk but instead have a small balcony. The bathroom is sufficiently spacious. My only point of criticism here would be that the showernob cannot be fixed to the wall, leaving no option but to sit in the bath tub showering (or simply take a bath). My booking included a \"simple French breakfast\" in my room every morning. I know what French breakfast usually means and was very pleased to find that at this hotel, the breakfast also included fresh fruit, freshly pressed juice, yoghurt and a range of bread rolls, pies and croissants.

Eventually, the hotel staff located a private car service to transport us to Madrid, one of the only functionning airports in Europe, where we finally found our way home.

I only had a few days in which to spend in Paris, and the staff made my visit a restful and extremely pleasant one. The top-floor suite was clean, elegant, and QUIET -- quite remarkable for a hotel in the heart of the Rive Gauche/6e. I slept like a baby -- no earplugs or sleep mask needed. The decor was very modern and chic -- great lighting, a deep tub for soaking, and a comfortable chair in which to sit while I read or knitted. I also liked having a balcony, though I couldn't enjoy it because of the rainy weather. (Next time!) Hiring the hotel's car service to and from the airport was a very smart thing to do -- well worth the 90 euros. As for travel around town, Le Placide is about three blocks from the Sevres-Babylone metro stop, so it's very convenient. I was very impressed with the staff's friendliness and helpfulness, and they helped me muddle through my rusty French speaking skills. I intend to return to Le Placide often -- it will be my home away from home.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "JJHGG", "ReviewID": "UR35639628", "Content": "Great hotel, great location, great decor and even better staff.

Enjoyed hardly ever my breakfast that much being in a hotel. The 24h meals are also above standard, but as usual overpriced. Staff: Was always very friendly and caring throughout our stay and made a great effort to speak English AND teach us some more French. The concierge/porter was always to hand when needed.

I was totally angry at the way the person at reception dealt with what was clearly a mistake on their part. I had specifically requested a top floor room with a balcony, which, along for the location, is the main reason to choose that hotel. I had a written confirmation by email and by their automatic booking system. When we arrived, the lady who was supposed to get us to our room was hastily halted by another receptionist (the manager?) who took us to our room which, once we got out of the lift was on.... the second floor. So no balcony ! When I pointed that to the guy he said \"oh but you had booked a junior suite\". I didn't have my paper with me so didn't figure the difference between the two kinds of rooms but found it strange. He then muttered some vague explanation about bookings etc.. and the schedule not being free for the top room when I booked! After settling down, I went back downstairs, paper in hand (retrieved from my bag) where it clearly stated the availability and confirmation of a top floor room with a balcony. I showed that to him and he once again, didn't apologize, and proceeded to say something even more vague about the booking system. He then said, oh but we upgraded you, your room is now 4 square meters bigger! Big deal! And as I was saying that I still would have preferred a smaller room, he said \"but you won't be charged for the additional space\"!! Thank GOd !! So basically, they made a mistake, probably handed our room to someone else and instead of apologizing and providing champagne or whatever else that could have sweetened the deal, they fed me some lies. The location, space and style of the room didn't compensate at all for this terrible welcome and I couldn't wait to get out of there. I must precise that I am French so the whole conversation was in French and there was no room for misunderstanding due to language !! My advice, try Hotel Mayet a few streets down, same good location, 3 times cheaper and adorable service. Or if you want a 4 star hotel, L'Esprit Saint Germain is lovely. I really regret not being able to stay there this time. We generally like luxury hotels and don't mind paying for it when it's worth it.

They were clean, well appointed and pleasant. We go to Paris every year and we have stayed in hotels like the Plaza Athenee, Pvailion de la Reine and the boutique Hyatt at Malsherbes. Though all were equally good in varying degrees, Le Placide has won us over in terms of service. We felt like very welcome guests in someone's home. The location, of being in the Saint Germain area is also a definite plus. From the time we arrived ( we requested for a car to fetch us at the train station), every request we made was catered to quickly and warmly. Restaurant reservations were made on our behalf and everyone, from Madame Marie, Nicholas, Christophe and even the guy who poured coffee for breakfast was genuinely accomodating. One thing that stands out in my memory was when we requested for a taxi to wait for us at the CDG airport- we went to Spain after Paris, and we were flying in from Granada and going straight to catch the Eurostar to London, we didn't want to have to queue for a cab or take the train afraid of delays and all that. So we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for that date (note that we wouldn't be guests of the hotel by this time) We communicated via email and all was set. When we arrived the taxi was there and my phone started ringing, I didn't answer as it was an unknown number. A few minutes later, the taxi drivers phone rang, and it was the hotel asking if we were picked up. Nicholas even asked to speak to one of us to see if everything was ok.
