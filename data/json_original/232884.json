We kept special offer on a Roman Hotel Web site and we paied 65 euro per room per night ! The Hotel is just 10 rooms but it's a well kept secret in the heart of a Residential area ! By RoomsAccomodation.com we'd also special informations about transportations and Restaurants in that area! It\u2019s a modern area of Rome. You may bump into a celebrity jogging in the nearby Villa Borghese if you are lucky, but that's about it. Parioli became what it is now between the two World Wars when wealthy Romans (and diplomats - quite a few embassies are located in this area) moved in, building elegant villas in its spacious and green environment. Don't Miss... Make sure you visit the new Auditorium. It replaces Rome's last AuditoriumThe old one was destroyed by Mussolini in 1934 and includes three concert halls, an open air arena and a recording studio. \u00b7 Auditorium - Renzo Piano\u2019s latest feat \u00b7 Olympic Stadium - Go and see Roma or Lazio play \u2013 the atmosphere is amazing \u00b7 Monte Milvio - Where Constantine thrashed Maxentius back in 313AD \u00b7 Stadio dei Marmi - Athletes perform in front of a crowd of 15,000 as well as 60 marble statues \u00b7 Villa Borghese - Perfect spot to get out of the city\u2019s chaos Restaurants tend to cater for upper middle class Romans to the stinking rich, so make sure you check menu prices before sitting down to have a meal. However, you will always find cheaper pizzerias and bars if you are on a budget offering great food at decent prices and a much more genuine and friendly atmosphere. Look for such places in the piazzas of the area.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Coppede Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d232884-Reviews-Coppede_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$65 - $142*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Chiana 88</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00198</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232884", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/be/86/60/coppede-hotel-thumbnail.jpg"}}
