Throughout our vacation, we stayed in excellent hotels and enjoyed the warm Spanish hospitality. Our last stop at the Grand Melia Fenix was like the icing on the cake and we ended our visit to Spain with a bang ! Though our first impression of the hotel was that it was a little run down, the hospitality and service was absolutely wonderful and more than made up for the looks of the lobby n front desk. My family was celebrating two major events with this holiday and though I had written to all the hotels we stayed at, the Grand Melia Fenix was the only one which greeted us with a lovely bottle of Cava wine, a platter of chocolate dipped strawberries and a large tray of candies for the children. The gesture was very touching. The hotel also accommodated our request for a late checkout (as our flight wasn't until late in the night) at no extra cost. Further, breakfast was very sumptuous, our rooms were well appointed, the toiletries in the bathrooms were of an excellent quality and room service responded to every request within minutes. All the staff were extremely courteous and helpful - especially the doormen who got us taxis very promptly. We were also happy with the location of the hotel - walking distance from Retiro Park and short taxi rides from most Madrid landmarks. The Hard Rock Cafe and Hop On Hop Off Tour stop right next to the hotel made life very comfortable as well. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and would love to return someday.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northamptonshire", "Title": "\u201cFive star in all respects!\u201d", "Author": "Caesar63", "ReviewID": "UR139096487", "Content": "It was an absolute pleasure staying at the Gran Melia Fenix in Madrid. My wife and I chose it as it is centrally located, seemed luxurious but good value and already had some great reviews. We were pleased to discover that it didn't disappoint in any aspect at all. It is indeed very well located. We took the Metro from the airport which cost just a few Euros, is easy to navigate and delivers you to the Plaza De Colon just two minutes walk from the hotel. The journey from the airport takes about 20 minutes. Once settled in, the hotel is perfect for exploring all areas of Madrid. Whether you want to visit the Prado, the Retiro Park, the Serrano shops, the Plaza Mayor, the Palace or the Cathedral, all are within a maximum of thirty minutes walk. Alternatively, if you want to explore further afield (or would rather not walk) two metro stations are just nearby. My wife and I were spending four days over the August bank holiday in Madrid (which also coincided with our wedding anniversary). I had mentioned our anniversary when booking online and was pleasantly surprised when we were congratulated immediately upon arriving at the check-in desk. When we reached our delightful, luxurious room we found chocolate-covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne on ice, with a personal note of congratulations! A very thoughtful touch. Check-in was very slick and friendly and our room exceeded all our expectations (we'd booked a premium room). The decor was impressively stylish, the room large, the bed beautifully sumptious and the furniture and fittings comfortable and high quality. It would be difficult to imagine a nicer room to stay in. The bathroom was equal to the bedroom with smart, modern fittings with black granite surfaces and Clarins products. We also had a fabulous view of the plaza which made us feel a part of the bustling city. When we finally turned in after walking for miles around Madrid, we were pleased to find that the curtains completely blacked out the lights from the square and the windows were 100% sound proof. Perfect for a great night's sleep (helped by the extremely comfortable bed!) Downstairs for breakfast the following morning continued this excellent experience. The public areas including the lounge and bar are fabulously furnished and decorated, feeling more like a comfortable palace than a hotel (indeed, having walked around the actual Palace in Madrid on the second day, the Gran Melia wins hands down!!) I don't usually enjoy hotel buffet breakfasts as they tend to comprise a bland selection of cereals, pastries and luke warm cooked breakfast. Again, the Gran Melia defied the norm. The food selection was not only vast but we also discovered that everything was high quality and extremely fresh. The fruit selection was excellent, the cereals, cold meats and pastries inviting and the yoghurt was hand made by the hotel. Delicious. We didn't have the hot food and so can't comment, but given the high standard of the rest of the buffet I suspect the hot food would have tasted equally good. This is the first time I have ever thoroughly enjoyed a buffet breakfast in any hotel I have stayed in throught the world - I actually looked forward to breakfast each morning - a first! To add to the cosy atmosphere, excellent decor and good value, the staff throughout the hotel were all very efficient and keen to help - superb service which the whole team should be proud of. If returning to Madrid in the future we would book again at the Gran Melia without reserve - there seems no reason to even consider other hotels. Thank you all for providing us with such a perfect stay.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel!\u201d", "Author": "DenCarAtlanta", "ReviewID": "UR138864792", "Content": "We stayed 2 night in a small interior room but beautifully decorated and furnished.

Unfortunately it\u2019s a very small and very busy hotel and we felt like no one wanted us there. This is the first Leading Hotels of the World hotel where our membership was totally ignored. While we did get breakfast (because we asked for it), we didn\u2019t get any upgrade (nor a sorry for not getting an upgrade) and there was no gift for us. We actually reminded the reception that we were LHW members, but only after explicitly asking for it, we got our free gift (a fruit salad, but no welcome letter). The room was extremely small for a couple. For a couple with a child, it seemed unsuitable as we couldn\u2019t move. I do not recommend this hotel to people who need an extra bed. The bathroom was extremely small. We are thin people, but we had trouble moving around in the bathroom. One morning we went for breakfast without leaving the \u201cDo not disturb\u201d sign. When we returned to the room, the maid continued fixing the sheets, without taking any notice of us. We felt like intruders, as she wouldn\u2019t stop. Since the room was too small for us to reach for things while she was there, we just left for the museums without taking the things we wanted.

The Gran Melia Fenix is the flagship hotel of the Spanish Melia hotel chain and is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World. Location: Plaza de Colon on Calle Hermosilla 2 in the heart of the city, the same building houses on the opposite the Hard Rock Cafe Madrid. Access is easy to the attractions of the Spanish capital, the hotel is surrounded by famous art institutions, restaurants, cafes, the underground train and glorious shopping. First Impressions: A grand and beautiful building with a wonderful entrance, doorman was inside, saw us coming in the hotel, took our luggage and we could check-in, the lady from downstairs brought us upstairs to the RED LEVEL Lounge in which we could check-in and had a nespresso in the meantime while waiting a few minutes until our room was ready. Our room: Premium room with Jacuzzi and private terrace. A great room type, very elegant furnishings and great luxurious feel, ideal for our stay, this was something we looked forward too. From the fantastic bed with high quality linens, jacuzzi on the terrace, fully marbled bathroom, Clarins Paris bath amenities, large TV with international channels, fast internet access to a fully stocked mini bar, pillow menu and even a personal scent menu was on offer. RED LEVEL: Our room type included RED LEVEL lounge access. We loved this lounge during our stay as much as the whole hotel. The services offered are fantastic as is the lounge itself a masterpiece of hospitality. We encountered friendly staff, free newspapers, complimentary champagne, gorgeous happy hour with a real dinner offering and breakfast with a la carte items, all included in our overnight rate paid. Even when we think right now about the RED LEVEL we melt away in our positive memories. Eat || Drink: Beside the fantastic offerings in the RED LEVEL lounge, we enjoyed also room service incl. Spanish omlettes, fried rice specialities and hot chocolate. Overall, highly recommended. Overall: A wonderful heritage hotel in the heart of the Spanish capital, a true luxury hotel which had many famous names seen over the years. We had a wonderful experience at this hotel, Gran Melia Fenix is beautiful, elegant but not overbearing. This is what luxury is all about, special for the guest and special for the hotel, employees have shown pride to work there. We felt just that as guests too. Psssst.........As members of the MELIA MAS rewards program we received also a 40 Euro discount towards eating and drinking in the hotel, which reduced our final bill on check-out.

The check in procedure is consistently swift, and the front office staff are very courteous. If anything there seem to be too many people behind the desk, and roles are not really clear since the reception and concierge desks are one and the same. The issue with that is that you might end up waiting to check in while another customer is getting copious information about good restaurants in Madrid. In a couple of instances the key did not work, therefore I had to return to the front desk, which is annoying but not unheard of. The room size and layout are normally good, but when it comes to the position, it gets trickier. I have been in rooms that pracitcally face a wall on the first floor, and others that face the square on the sixth floor, all for the same price, therefore use your charme wisely upon check in. While the quality of the bed is average, the pillow quality is definitely below average. Most times I have been able to get a decent pillow after asking for it. The acoustic insulation is not great, and at times you can hear the next door neighbour watching TV or the traffic outside. The toiletries are really good, with complimentary shaving and dental kits. While free, wireless access is a bit of a pain, since you need to keep inputting the password every time your iPhone goes on stand by, and also need to get a new password every 24 hours. Breakfast in the morning is really nice but expensive if all you want is coffee and a croissant.

The indoor deco of Gran Melia Fenix is far from chic or stylish, a bit dated but very grand, e.g. the red carpeted stairs, the marbled lobby, the chandelier, etc. The room we got was on the Red Level. I assume only if one asks, the hotel would suggest an upgrade to the Red Level (not for free though). Such upgrade, at 80E per day in our case, was well worth the money. Private check-in, free buffet breakfast, snacks, free flow of soft drinks and even hard liquors and champagne all day plus free unlimited use of Wifi are all included in that price!! The room itself was reasonably sized. As other reviewers have commented, the bed was very comfortable. With double glazed windows, the room is practically insulated from any noise from outside despite its being on a rather busy main street. Sevice of the staff was superb!!

Melia seems to be a sleazy chain. Be careful. second the night before I checked out I asked for express checkout --because the reception is tiny and I'd noticed morning queues. No one knew what I was talking about...amazing! The next day I had to queue as a result. Sloppy. I stayed 5 nights and overall the stay itself was comfortable.

There are plenty of places to eat nearby, from cheap cafes to more expensive restaurants. The Prado etc. are a reasonable, and pleasant, stroll down the Paseos Recoletos and Prado, and personally, I liked the area; however, it is a little further to e.g. the Palacio Real and Plaza Mayor - but still manageable on foot, or you could grab a cab or the Metro.

I wouldn't completely write it off, when in Madrid again, as the staff, location and breakfast were very, very nice, but I didn't feel the overall hospitality that usually comes w/Leading Hotels. Here are some of the reasons for my verdict: Although early check in was honored, we still had to wait over an hour for the room to be made available (not really pleasant after a 14 hr. cross Atlantic commute). They allowed us to choose between two rooms (a very nice gesture) : A larger one w/view of a wall, and a smaller one, with a very nice view. Since view is very important to us, we ended up picking the smaller one, only to find out, it lacked a coffee maker (which would have been in place in the larger room as described in the details of our reservation) and an ironing board. They brought both AFTER we requested them, only to take away the ironing board the next day :( If room changes occur unexpectedly, they should be done w/the same amenities as would have been available in the original arrangement (IMHO:). Concierge was friendly but not so helpful. Example: WE requested a map of Segovia as we would be headed there the next day, only to be told \"We have a map of Madrid, but not Segovia\"... Well, w/in 5 minutes of the conversation I got on the PC and made a crude map of the requested city through the Trip Adviser website.... Hmmmm I found it odd that I could be so..... \"Creative\" in finding a map to a very popular destination nearby, but the concierge couldn't.... I should also mention recommendations for dining establishments were no different than what I had already found on Trip Adviser.. And in some cases directions were clearer online than through concierge. On the positive side, as mentioned before, the breakfast staff is fantastic, and pre-arrival correspondence is very prompt, professional and pleasant (Sandra and Sylvia in particular were outstanding :). OH, HUGE POSITIVE: Their fitness facility is under renovation so Gran Melia made arrangements for guests to use a nearby facility (Reebok Fitness Club 4 blocks away). Let me tell you, initially you may be turned off to have to leave the hotel for your workout...... UNTIL you get there.... ABSOLUTELY fantastic facilities. It's an upscale fitness club complete w/Steam rooms, state of the art equipment and with a tanning terrace worth visiting just for panoramic pics of Madrid. Worth going to JUST FOR pics off the terrace even if you're not working out (do wear gym attire if you go as you will not be admitted otherwise... Very, very impressive. I can't emphasize it enough. Gran Melia truly impressed me in this arrangement for it's guests.

That floor includes a gorgeous breakfast spread (open until 11 each morning) of the most delicious, high quality foods: Iberian ham, fresh fruit, eggs, cereal, and every kind of beverage imaginable. In the afternoon, this club room has appetizers and snacks, changing throughout the day into the evening.

And they let us in our room several hours early since we had arrived from the States and the room wasn't occupied. That extra touch really made a difference! The room itself had a wonderful, private patio with a private jacuzzi. And it was a modern, clean, wonderful jacuzzi, just for our room, which they heated to our specifications!

After discussion with the Manager, that fee was waved for us. Recommended city dining by the hotel staff fell short of expectations, as did our request for \"must sees\" in the area. Dining in the hotel was also generally sub-par, with the exception of the breakfast buffet, which was quite tasty. One odd thing that happened was that, during a rainstorm, the elevator shaft begain leaking and water literally poured out between the elevator car and it's door, thus shutting down one of the few elevators in the hotel. Finally, we were not told that we would have to endure the floor below us being painted. The fumes from this work traveled upwards into our room, creating an unbarable, toxic-like smell for 2 days. We kept the windows open during this time, but it was miserable none-the-less. So, would I stay at the Gran Melia Fenix again, probably not.

The hotel is in a very upmarket part of town and is very pleasant to wander around these streets at any time. But what was even better was the hotel itself. We are big on hotel quality and this one did not disappoint in any way. I had booked a room with Red Level facilities, which includes a private check in, and private lounge facilities. The facilities were second to none, the lounge was very comfortable and spotlessly clean, there was an outdoor terrace where you can enjoy breakfast and champagne! The staff worked tirelessly to make ours (and everyone's) stay as first class as possible - everyone spoke perfect English, and were very understanding of my rudimentary Spanish - they could not have done more. Gemma especially made us so welcome on our first night, suggested where we could eat, even booked a flamenco show for us, told us exactly how to use the public transport, how much everything cost, which buses to take, which shops to go to, how to order tapas... everything in fact! If she is a product of the hotel chain's training programme, then my congratulations to them, they are obviously world class at this game! In fact there was no member of staff from porter, to doorman, to concierge to mamager who failed to impress with their high level of service and courtesy, always polite, smiling, eager to help.... a credit to the hotel and the Madrilenos I also considered staying at the Ritz for my visit - I mean no disrepect to that venerable institution, but I doubt they could have bettered this exceptional hotel on all counts.

Fresh flowers everywhere, but especially in the large lounge/bar at the back, brighten the place up nicely. Breakfast was a very nice addition - plenty of choices, excellent fresh juices and fruit, and a nice selection of hot and cold choices.

Whilst it's true that the rooms are on the small side, and the floorplan configuration can seem a little odd, they are almost perfectly equipped. Our preferred aspect of the room was the large bed and wonderful bed linen. What we liked least was the lack of wi-fi in the room (available only in the lobby -- admittedly, for free) and the apparent lack of thermostat control on the a/c (either on or off, it seemed). The breakfast is as copious as described in other reviews. It's not of the highest quality, especially for a 5-star hotel, but it makes up for it in variety. The staff at the hotel seem to fall into two categories -- either upbeat and ready to help, or a little jaundiced. I sense that general management has not really created a universal culture of pride among the staff. Don't misunderstand me: this is a very pleasant hotel and we would recommend it. However, there is no real \"Gran Melia Fenix\" experience to distinguish this hotel from other 5-star hotels. Some reviewers have written that the hotel is well situated. This is true, especially if high-end shopping is your thing. It's a 25-30 minute walk into the historic part of town, however, which may be a consideration if you have small/young children. The metro is close, though, and it's cheap, clean, safe and simple to navigate, even for a foreigner. Taxis are abundant and good value for a family. On the subject of young children, the Hard Rock cafe is just around the corner from the hotel, offering huge servings of American food at very reasonable prices with waiters whose English is good. A blessing if you can't get your littl'uns to agree to another Spanish dinner. If museums float your boat, you're spolit for choice in Madrid. The local parks are also lovely. We also went to the nearby nature reserve (called \"Faunia\"). We were sceptical on the way over, thinking that it would be a disappointment, but the kids and we loved every minute of the four hours we spent there -- there's a wonderful selection of animals, many of which you see in very close proximity -- in a clever layout and with helpful signs in Spanish and English. Well worth the (admittedly steep) 25 euros per ticket. All in all, we enjoyed our few days in Madrid. It's a clean, relaxed and interesting city and well worth a trip.

Prices generally in Madrid are very high and the standard doesn't really match it compared to London. Meal s out are very expensive. However the area around the hotel has some very good bars/restaurants etc, just dont forget the credit card. One big downside of Madrid and this hotel is that smoking seems socially acceptable virtually anywhere and everywhere! It seems to be legal in restaurants, bars, you name it. A very pleasant lounge became very unpleasant due to cigar and cigarette smoke. There are no smoking areas in restaurants but to be honest its a bit of a farce when half the room will be for smokers.

It is nice enough, don't get me wrong, but my experience failed to live up to the palacial standards I was led to believe I would encounter. It is worth mentioning however the location is truly excellent - very close to metro, decent restaurants and of course all the sites. Firstly, and importantly, this place is a building site at the moment. They are crashing around on the street (they are literally tearing up the road just outside) and in the hotel at all hours of the day, and as such there is dust and dirt all over the communal areas of the hotel. The reception area is also pretty small and failed to overwhelm me - in fact I was more impressed with the foyer at the Holiday Inn at LHR. To be honest the whole place needs a good clean and repaint after all the work is finished. Our room was well decorated and appointed but tiny, and oddly we were given a disabled room so everything in the bathroom was really low - not a real problem for most but we are both 6 feet tall! There was also a lack of natural light owing to the enormous and permanently closed curtains. The array of toiletries and traveller amenities are exceptional, I have never seen so much stuff next to the sink in the bathroom. There is however no coffee/tea making facility in the room. The bed was without doubt comfortable and we both slept soundly - except that maid service starts at ridiculous times, we had them walk in (without knocking) as early as 7.45am. They are friendly enough though, and do a great job.

I could not help but notice the dusty and dirty edges of the carpets. Gran Melia should do a better job in cleaning the carpets more often.

We paid \u00a3100 per night for a standard double room instead of the normal \u00a3200. Still nowhere near a good deal. The place looks like something from the 1950s - not in the stylish trendy sense, but in the garish, overly lavish way. it's like someone tried to imitate the Ritz and failed. Gold everywhere, not a single inch of space untouched by some sort of decoration. When we stayed, a conference group was also staying, and we had to fight our way through tens of loud business men and women smoking, chattering, and taking up all of the staff's attention. There was even a cheap looking table set out in reception with a note board behind it, announcing the timetable for the conference. Not five star treatment for us at all. We booked a double room and requested a double bed ('cama matrimonial' - make sure you request it on every trip as a couple in Spain or there's a good chance you'll be given twin beds). They said they'd run out but could push the twin beds together for us, or, for 40 euros we could get a room with a double bed and a nicer view. Nice - upselling in our first few minutes in the hotel. They weren't bothered at all and barely tried to help. And we had to stand in the bedroom and wait whilst the staff made the bed for us. Classy. The room was cramped, the bathroom was tiny, and the air conditioning didn't work. There was a snazzy machine by the bed to control lights, air con etc. that didn't work either. Because of the air con, we complained and it took them half a day to move us to a room with a double bed (beware - the double beds are small). One of the staff on the concierge desk was helpful (young guy named Jesus) but apart from that they were condescending, unhelpful and rude. I filled in a complaint form which guaranteed that if they hadn't repaired our aircon or changed our room within 1 hour they'd offer us a free night or a refund. Needless to say i heard nothing back from them. Location isn't great for sight seeing - you need to take Metro or Taxi to see anything worth a visit. Room service is incredibly expensive, as is laundry. No swimming pool (how can this place really be 5*??) and internet is only free in the business centre.

Due to the hectic schedule, I often forgot to take it to reception meaning to ask them to help me find a glue. On the 2nd last night when i got back to the room, i was pleasantly surprised that the stone had been glued. I went down to reception and ask the reception who was the lady who make-up my room.

After reserving the hotel, I was scowering the net for the usual tourist info on things to do and came across a website that was offering an additional 15% off the same room I booked. Ah ha I thought! What luck!! Since the Sol Melia ADVERTISES a LOW RATE GUARANTEE, I'll send them a claim form. Uh-oh, they \"kindly\" informed me they couldn't honor the rate because the sites \"cancellation and payment policy\" doesn't match their's! \"Huh?\" What the heck does cancellations and what payment options I use have to do with the fact that the exact same reservation I made is $400 less than the low rate guarantee you offer your customers? Oh, and when they checked the website, they couldn't find what I was talking about. I had taken a screenshot of the travelnow.com discount and saved it to my word doc so I replied to them with it PLUS I pointed out that the travelnow.com website indeed have the same policy as them - travelnow.com DOES NOT CHARGE A CHANGE OR CANCELLATION FEE up until the day BEFORE your arrival. They only impose the HOTEL PROPERTIES cancellation policy which they have to pass on to the customer's. The ONE difference that apparently VOIDED SOL MELIA'S \"LOW RATE GUARANTEE\" was due to the fact that TRAVELNOW.COM charges your card UPFRONT for the reservation (even though there is NO PENALTY TO CANCEL OR MODIFY YOUR RESERVATION UP UNTIL 24 HRS BEFORE ARRIVAL) but Sol Melia charges you on the day of check-out! WOW. Sol Melia, if you DON'T want to refund folks their money, PLEASE TAKE OFF THE LOW RATE GUARANTEE YOU ADVERTISE! It only makes you look bad. BTW folks, I haven't heard from them since I sent in my screenshot....i will keep you posted. BTW - while purusing the web, I found an even BETTER option (especially for folks with families) renting a Madrid Apartment! WWW.SPAIN-SELECT.COM have WONDERFUL apartments, all 5 star reviews...worth looking into, more options (due to full amenities like kitchen, microwave, fridge etc... if you have kids and need to keep stuff stocked).

I'm sure many of you seasoned traveler's probably know about the apartment option but wanted to point it out for other folks who may not know.

There is a metro stop just 2 blocks away which requires you to transfer to get to Old Town but their metro is very easy to use so we had no issues getting around.

There is a nasty sign on the minibar saying anyhing moved would be charged but reception were OK as I had tried to manouevre some space and had dislodged some items. Apart from this sign we were made to feel very welcome, and everyone spoke good English. The breakfasts are superb - the best I have had in 10 years - the waiters are very accommodating eg. we asked for chilled milk for cereal and this was no problem. The maids do get a bit carried away with the slippers they leave you - after we returned to our room every night two fresh pairs plus small sheets would arrive - but we never asked or used them. Got the usual chocolates too - would have been nice if they had left us a bottle of wine/champagne as we got in Nice last year. There have been a lot of comments about bar prices - yes theya re expensive - but worth paying 7 or so Euros for a small beer to sit on the terrace when it's sunny - we got a selection of nuts free every time - very tasty! The hotel is very conveniently placed. We got 2 day tourist bus passes for 22 euros each and commuted this way - the bus stop is right outside. Madrid itself was spoiled by so much road works when we were there - if you ever wan't to see sewer/trench/piling works at first hand this is the place to be - you can get within inches of workmen - they don't close streets like in the UK, just narrow them. My advice is to go to Barcelona rather than Madrid - Barcelona is more fun and there is a higher proportion of tourists to business people. Also you have to search quite hard for good restaurants in Madrid - we did find just enough but they are not plentiful where we were. Top tip - from the Airport get the No. 200 bus (only one Euro and every 15 mins) and it takes you to the central bus station where you can get a taxi for about 7 Euros.

Worst thing was the darkness of the room, we were on the first floor so virtually no natural light felt like we were at the bottom of a tunnel. To be fair they did offer a free upgrade but didn't have an outside room with twin beds, they offered a choice of 2 rooms and really did try to help. The breakfast was wonderful, everything you could want and lots you didn't realise you wanted, Also not rushed away at the end, they asked each table if they were finished.

As we only had a short time in Madrid, we wanted a well-located, upscale hotel. Further, as we were traveling with our two sons (ages 19 and 22) and needed two rooms, we didn't want to spend a king's ransom. In all these regards, the Gran Melia satisfied our needs. The rooms were a bit on the small side, but very nicely appointed. My younger son was particularly impressed with his room and took a photo for posterity. Our king room had a small entry foyer with a french door to the bathroom on the left and a french door to the bedroom on the right. The rooms were well equipped with air conditioning, flat panel TV, lighting and many other functions controlled by a touch-screen on the bedside table. There was was also turndown service and highly efficient housekeeping - they magically appeared and were gone if you ever left your room. The main drawback to our room was the bathroom which had a smallish main area with sink and tub/shower separated from a smaller room with a bidet and toilet. These were separated by a frosted glass door (a nice touch) but the geometry of the rooms made it quite difficult to get to the toilet and close the door. The space planner or architect responsible for this either believed in form over function or was a slender contortionist capable of executing the necessary moves. We ate at restaurants outside the hotel (including Botin's in the Plaza Mayor) so I can't comment on food service. Like most similar hotels, breakfast was shockingly expensive and we preferred a small place just next to the hotel frequented by locals. We enjoyed the stay and, given the rate paid (\u20ac128 and 176 for the twin and king rooms, respectively) felt it was good value for this quality of hotel.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thames Valley, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with some excellent deals available\u201d", "Author": "LondonGent", "ReviewID": "UR31896001", "Content": "We stayed in the Gran Melia Fenix for three nights in early June and would wholeheartedly recommend it. We found a great deal on Hotel.Com about a week before our stay. This was a fraction of the rack rate but we were still given a very nice room on the outside of the building, on the third floor The windows were quadruple gazed so even though the hotel is located next to a very busy road, noise wasn't a problem. There were also blackout curtains so there was no problem with light entering the room from outside if you tend to wake at dawn like I do! The room was a good size with two windows looking out onto the street, quiet and reliable air conditioning, a good size marble bathroom with bathrobes and all the toiletries you could possibly need. Staff were also very friendly and efficient. Location is on the edge of Madrid's centre but within walking distance of most attractions. It's roughly 20 minutes walk from the Prado, 15 minutes from Chueca with its lively nightlife, and five minutes from the nearest Metro. My only caveat about this hotel is that, as expected of a five star, it was incredibly expensive to eat or drink anything. For example, a packet of crisps was 5 Euro - close to a 1000% mark up. Not really a problem as there are plenty of good restaurants within a 15-20 minute walk, just don't be tempted by the mini-bar!! Finally I would recommend obtaining a MAS loyalty card from Solmelia's web site before you stay.

We were at the hotel by 10:30am and they had our three rooms available immediately. They asked if we wanted the best or the quietest rooms upon check in. We went with the quieter rooms. They were on the interior of the building, so no view, but the rooms themselves were great! The bathrooms are all marble. The rooms were very quiet and they were so dark at night, you never knew what time it was! We got turndown service every night, with slippers laid out at the foot of the bed. We had a drink in the hotel bar one night on the outside patio. It is a great patio but the drinks were quite pricey. We never took a taxi once becuase the metro was so convenient to the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel either becuase there are so many other choices! The service from the front desk to the maids was exceptional. Everyone was very friendly and polite! Only down side is there is construction going on around the hotel. We didn't hear it from inside so the noise is not a worry, but walking around near the hotel was made a little difficult.

This was a spontaneous booking to break up the spring, and as a lucky, extra holiday, budget was an issue - especially with the sad demise of Stirling against the Euro. So we were thrilled to find a fantastic deal at the hotel through Travelzoo, including an upgrade to a Premium room with associated gifts etc. And what gifts - not only fruit and water in the room but lovely chocolates on arrival, as well as the nightly turn-down service - chocolates on the pillow most nights and an Easter egg on Good Friday! My only single complaint of any sort was the size of the room. We were on the Plaza Col\u00f3n side of the building overlooking the fountains, and I imagine in the smallest of the Premium rooms. Which is fair enough considering that the price we paid which was less than 50% of the published Easter rate. However, the room had all the style and advantages described by previous reviewers, and we found it easy to enjoy the 5* luxury and service, the fantastic breakfasts included in our package and the superb location while still keeping costs controlled. Madrid is a fairly expensive city, but worth every Euro. If you were able to splash the cash I'm sure the hotel's room service and mini bar were great, but at over \u20ac20 for a G'n'T we hit the streets for our own entertainment. It's about 20 minutes from the hotel to the centre of everything around Sol and Plaza Major with all the cervezerias, wine and tapas bars, but the streets are really interesting to wander and if you get the sort of blisters we did from pacing miles of pavements there's a great bus service outside the hotel and choice of two metro stops. Our only regrets over the trip were that we took the wrong clothes. Over 2 days it ranged from a high of 24 degrees one afternoon down to 13 degrees the next and we had taken more smart clothes than comfortable sightseeing ones - while people in the hotel make an effort for breakfast, Madrid is more about style than bling and more or less anything goes sartorially. If you're not using the hotel restaurant but are aiming for beer and tapas, you certainly don't need to overdo the collar and tie. We also took the wrong footware (those pavements are hard!), an out-of-date guidebook - use Maribel and the Tripadvisor guide as others have advised - and didn't have a Spanish phrase book. We didn't find many people who spoke English, which is fine - why should they? - but with our very rudimentary Spanish we missed out on some things such as some food items, and having a chat with locals rather than doing the English thing of pointing and talking louder! But we did have a wonderful time and are hoping to go back very soon, with the right shoes and a better phrase book. And Easter is a great time to visit. Finally, as well as the old town the hotel is walkable to the Prado (we didn't), the Reina Sofia (we did - but found you could see everything in the same sort of time it took to queue to get in - the Spanish seem good at that), the open space of Retiro Gardens and Atocha Station. Go to the station for the experience alone, even if you're not going to take a train. It's incredible - Kew Gardens with terrapins. We did take a train to lovely if touristy Toledo, but be warned that you need to book in advance - they only take bookings for seats and when the train's 'complet' it really is. You might get a ticket if you hang around for a cancellation, tickets come and go by the second. We got two tickets sitting in different carriages just after we gave up all hope, so you can be lucky. In summary, a great hotel, if classic in style rather than contemporary, and a little mean on space in some rooms. Wonderful beds, wonderful service, wonderful breakfasts and wonderful location.

Older TV in big armoire that took up too much space. Tiny bathroom but has 2 sinks and lots of beautiful marble. Bed a little hard but okay (hard beds seem to be the Spanish way). Small windows but we had a great view of the Plaza Colon. Avoid north and east views... they look directly into office buildings. The courtyard rooms have views that seem really claustrophobic.

Group of 4. Husband and Wife. Son and Grand Mother. Note for Spain twin rooms - the beds are seperate but always together and will need to be pulled apart to suit 2 people sharing. Booked Gran Fenix on a special low season deal that included breakfast. My initial reaction was slightly dissappointing. Looking back, however, it was quite a good hotel. Location proved to be excellent (wouldn't stay in the old part of Madrid). The Colon plaza down to Retiro are excellent locations and out of the \"ugly\" side of Madrid. Gran Fenix is near the best shopping and close to a Supermarket. Easy access to sights (train, cab, bus and open bus tours stop near building). Gran Fenix rooms are well appointed and hark back to a Grand style. Carpets could be replaced and there are some tattered edges which have been referred to by other reviewers. Bathrooms have some irritating clutter and the usual outdated bidet. Direct in-room cable internet was the fastest we experienced in Europe. Gran Fenix buffet breakfast was 100% the biggest and best served up in all 6 European tours thus far - but lost on a 1 bowl of cereal and 1 pot of coffee person. Bar and Lounges are this Hotels biggest plus. Hotel staff were good quality hospitality personnel. Restaurant is fine dining but not really an \"experience\". If travelling with family try the Pizza Garden (other meals served) around the corner. Clean, fast and quality food at good price. Hard Rock cafe below hotel (part of building). Hyatt is being gutted and re-fitted up the road. Will probably set a 5 star benchmark and be ready after mid-2008.

The two areas where we were unhappy were the room allocation and, in particular, the restaurant service. The public rooms, porter service, concierge and security were all exemplary with courteous staff and a good standard of decor and cleanliness (with the usual exception of the TV remote control). The room we had booked and had confirmed was described as non-smoking, deluxe interior with queen bed and patio view. While the room's standard of decor and cleanliness was good, it was rather cramped, overlooked a metal curved hood of some sort and, we discovered later, was noisy. The noise being generated from both the in-room air conditioning and mechanical or electrical noise from outside and below. Because this was a one night stay en-route to the airport, we did not bother requesting a room change at the time. Had I realised that the room was going to be so noisy, I would certainly have done so. Our primary area of complaint was, however, the restaurant. When we arrived we were 2 of the 3 customers present. The chair was not pulled out for the lady and the table not fully laid. The starters were well prepared and the wine good although improperly uncorked. Due to a mix-up in the kitchen, the first main course was not cooked as ordered and the second delivered cold. Although we had to attract the waiter's attention and were not asked whether everything was satisfactory, the problem was resolved. One of the dessert courses was again incorrect and I felt that 9e for the other dessert which was, to all intents and purposes, diced jelly and ice with a sauce was excessively expensive. Although present, the head waiter spent much of his time talking very audibly on a mobile phone or pager and at no point asked whether we were satisfied with any of the dishes. Nor did he apologise for the errors. The other waiter present may have been in training, but was polite and did his best to sort out the problems. Having stayed in a number of the 'Leading Hotels of the World' we were expecting a similar level of service and facilities. While many areas lived up to our expectations, we were very disappointed with the quality and service in the restaurant and not entirely happy with the room itself.

One day I was expecting an urgent fax (I was on a short business trip, did not bring my laptop, and the business center only got two computers), and they lost it. The next morning (due to the time difference between Spain and South America) I inquired about my fax at the front desk (I got confirmation from my office that it was sent out), and they undoubtedly affirmed that no fax was received for me. So that same morning my fax was resent to me, my secretary call me right after to say it did go through, but I needed to wait over 30 minutes to get it at my door, despite all the incidents around that fax... So I asked again about my lost fax at the front desk, and they now accepted they may have lost it. The funny thing is that the fax machine is right adjacent to the front desk!

An easy drive from the airport - took about half an hour. We loved th hotel and would definitely stay here again. The hotel is next to Plaza Colon in a good district handy for shops and restaurants. You're right next to the metro and a couple of bus stops so great for sight seeing. It was also an easy walk to the Retiro park. Our room (704) was on the top floor - one of the 'club' rooms. These rooms have a separate reception/concierge on that floor as well as a large lounge area where you have breakfast. Breakfast choices were great - cereals, breads, pastries, cheeses, meats, fruits, champagne, fruit juices, coffee, tea - hard not to find something you liked. After breakfast (from 7am - 11am) they always had cheeses, fruits, pastries, a variety of tapas, breads etc available throughout the day up until 11pm - as well as a very well stocked help yourself bar - no-one minded if you wandered in, poured yourself a couple of drinks, helped yourself to a plate of tapas and took it back to enjoy in your room. This was great after a day's sightseeing and then to finish off your evening with a nightcap under the stars on your balcony. Ah yes, our room - nice spacious lobby area, large bathroom but with tiny bath with shower over. Decorated in black & gold - not to my taste exactly. Bedroom was small but huge king size bed took up most of floor space but nicely decorated in formal English house style. Quite sombre and dark - very firm bed. Room was quiet so no traffic noise. Nice surprise was large balcony with table and chairs for four and steps up to a huge hot tub jacuzzi which was brilliant - very hot and very bubbly. Just be careful on a weekday since (room 704 anyway!) faces towards the 'back' of the hotel and you overlook adjoining office blocks and although your hot tub is well screened, when standing up to clamber out you might attract some interest! When you're sitting out on the balcony though you are totally secluded and private. We were very well looked after by all the hotel staff who were unfailingly professional, polite, friendly and helpful. Special mention must go to our reception/concierge Patricia who recommended great restaurants for us. She saw our look of despair when at first she recommended a flamenco restaurant - we're really not keen on the well-trodden tourist places and she came up with some other ideas for us. On our first night we ate in El General - a down to earth tapas bar restaurant full of loud noisy Spanish families - the food was excellent, no-one could speak a word of English and we loved it - just getting by on sign language and lots of laughter (and lots of vino!) Another restaurant we tried for Sunday lunch was Asador de Aranda - this is actually a very popular Spanish chain of restaurants and there are serveral in Madrid - don't let this put you off. They only serve Castillan white fleshed lamb - cooked in a vast oven with herbs on oak charcoal embers - atmosphere totally Spanish (again we were only foreigners in there and again no-one could speak English) and the lamb was amazing - pick it up and eat with your fingers for maximum enjoyment. Final evening for something totally different we ate at a Thai restaurant just around the corner from hotel. We love Thai food and this was very good. Everyone spoke English, it was full of English and Americans so very different but very pretty restaurant and service was excellent.
