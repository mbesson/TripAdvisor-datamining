The pictures looked great and the hotel appeared to be in a central location. In reality, the room itself was quite small but considering it was only for sleeping and showering, I can't complain. The twin beds were pushed together to give the appearance of a double bed. The balcony is actually just a patio door that you open with a glass partition to stop you from falling onto the road below. The windows are not double glazed so you hear a lot of street noise and also from other guests walking down the corridors. The hotel is apparently a 4 star, but I would say it's more a 3 star trying to be a 4 star. In terms of location, it wasn't central for the majority of sights. However, it is a 5 min walk to the local metro station where in 10 mins you will be at La Rambla or Sagrada Familia depending on which line you take. My biggest dislike is that wifi is not complimentary and outrageously expensive. Other 4 star hotels I have stayed at offer this as complimentary so I was disappointed. The channels offered on the TV within your room were all in Spanish. The few TV channels in English were all news or constantly lost the signal.

So 2 days of nicotine smell was what we had to deal with. 2. The food in the restaurant was very good but make sure you have ample time to wait for service. About 30 minutes... The gentleman next to me was about to finish his beer and leave when finally his starter showed up. It was during the normal Spanish dining hours though. 3. The lighting control system creates such a buzzing sound it is better to switch it completely off when watching Tv or at night. Overall a disappointing experience in returning to this hotel.

No idea how to make a good pot of English breakfast tea but that's what you expect in most American or continental hotels.

The hotel itself is decorated in a contemporary design and is very conventionally located close to the Plaza de Espanya (first stop on the airport bus) and metro stations. The front desk staff was wonderful and bent over backwards trying to listen to my attempts at speaking \u2018Spanish\u2019 (born and raised in Miami it\u2019s a mixture of dialects).

I have heard many Americans complain about the lack of AC while traveling around Europe, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE HERE!!!!! Room temperature was as cold or as warm as you could ever ask for. My only two truly negative remarks (i.e. concerns that need to be addressed before I return) one WiFi is not free (Someone please explain to the owners that free wiFi is now a more basic requirement as opposed to something paid for), and having someone manage the restaurant. For what they wanted to charge you for breakfast I expected a lot more (I eat lite breakfasts and still left hungry after paying 18Euro each). All in all my experience was very nice.

The reception desk is not straight in front of you as you enter the hotel but is tucked away in a corner to the right. This, together with the dark decor and low lighting of the reception area and the lounge area, gives a rather unwelcoming first impression. The corridors leading to the rooms are extremely dark and, once again, the mood created is gloomy rather than welcoming. We would agree with some of the other comments about chipped surfaces in the bath and indeed some of the tiles on the walls around our bath were cracked but, overall, we found the room clean and well-maintained. The hotel is very handy to metro stations (just a short walk to Tarragona and Espanya metro stations). Start your journey from Tarragona, if you can, as it involves a lot less walking underground than if you use Espanya. There was some street noise, especially in the mornings, but a certain amount of street noise has to be expected in a city location. We didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel, so can't comment on the quality of those meals. However, the breakfasts were excellent. Wireless internet access is extremely expensive. Considering it costs hotels relatively little to provide a wireless internet service, it always feels like a rip-off when they seek to charge you so much for it.

Very modern and chic interior that was sp spacious and inviting that we tossed up whether to leave the room at all. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious with a lovely bath that I tested later, and the ameneties were great too. Overall, I had paid peanuts for what felt and looked like 5 star. The hotel is close to the main station, but not close to much else really. It meant we werent kept awake by traffic (soundproof glass ahoy!) and it meant that the hotel wasn't full of tourists with their kids.

It was an absolute steal for what we paid (~$160/night) because we received a gorgeous suite on the top floor. The one issue for me was that it was difficult to find, being situated on a side street. We arrived late in Barcelona's airport and took the last train into the city. Although the hotel is very close to Barcelona Sants (main train station), we took the wrong exit and were further directed in the wrong direction by locals. This was clearly our fault for not being able to read our maps correctly, but Barcelona addresses can be deceiving (i.e. Commerc 24). The reception was a bit frosty, and I would not describe the concierge as friendly, but we were checked in quickly and also directed to a nearby convenience store since restaurants were closed by the time we arrived. The hotel is very trendy with dark decor. When we stepped into our suite, we were very impressed by the size, decor and vast array of amenities that were included. It had separate closets, a large bath, separate toilet \"room\", a chaise and desk, complicated lighting options (\"mood\" lighting from romantic to bright), a private balcony with a jacuzzi (which was unfortunately broken and only filled with cold water despite a call to fix it). We were so impressed that unfortunately I appear to have forgotten to take photos (usually the first thing I do after setting down any luggage).

Super clean. Felt new, too. Two sliding doors open up to the bedroom area -- to the left, the bed and two chairs; to the right, ample closet space separated from the bed area by a desk. We're talking the entire wall was closet space. I loved our room. Since we were on our honeymoon, we didn't mind spending time just relaxing at the hotel and enjoying the room. In fact, we did do a good amount of hanging out there b/c the hotel is kind of far from the heart of the tourist action, which was a con. We'd go out during the day and be exhausted by 6pm, come back to the hotel to rest, but be too pooped to trek back out for dinner. Although the hotel is just a short walk to the Metro, the walk feels kind of long by the end of the day--especially since the other buildings surrounding the hotel are kind of run down. The hotel is off the main strip. Also, none of the tour books I used recommended any restaurants remotely close to our hotel, which was a bummer. In short, the room/hotel was really nice, and they provided very helpful and very friendly service. Ramon went above and beyond to help us settle in, and everyone at the front desk was nice. The location wasn't the best, and I think we missed out on some Barcelona action just because it was far from the heart of things and we ended up getting too tired to go back out after retreating to the hotel to rest early-evening.

Well, not really.... The Vincci Arena is pretty good, it's colourful, modern and trendy. But apart from an excellent dinner service, there isn't much more to make it a top choice. The reception is a fridge of coldness - temperature aside, it's dark and moody, with a tiny reception desk and 2 ultra slow lifts. Rooms are average size, with cold wooden floors (but tidy), a 'balcony' door that hardly opens for ventilation, a small minibar, reasonable bathroom, small screen TV with English news channels, and a funky lighting system - but somehow it doesn't allow the bathroom light to be switched on individually. Odd. The module housing the TV looks like it's straight out of an Ibis, but somehow it's befitting to the rest of the decor in the room. The beds are very hard too, which meant 4 nights without a good sleep. The windows are double glazed, but the door that opens half a foot or so doesn't close well enough to offer good soundproofing. That said, it's not overly noisy outside. Outside your room your going to a) die of dehydration and b) probably fall over your luggage, as it's exceptionally hot and poorly lit. Whilst you may be distracted by the snazzy lit door numbers, I really don't think this was a smart move. One of the more noticable plus points (apart from the useful location) is the staff at the desk, who always acknowledge you when you pass, and they speak very good English.

Read the reviews, and ultimately chose it because they were positive and indicated that it was in a good location. And definitely met my expectations! Located minutes away from Plaza Espanya. Took the Aerobus to the hotel by getting off at the 1st stop, which is Plaza de Espanya. then found the hotel in no time. I originally went to aerobus's official website to check out a map of the region and easily found Consell de Cent on it, drew it out before I left for my flight, and then easily found it once I arrived. Check in was easy. Arrived at 11ish and check-in was at 2. So they kept our luggages for us in the office next to the check in counter, and we then went to walk around outside for a bit and get to know the area. Afterwards, we got back at like 1:30 and our bags were all up in our room already. We were on the 6th floor facing a street. No problems with noise at all. Pretty quiet neighborhood in my opinion. Rooms are nice. 2 twin beds pushed together though. Lighting and decor is lovely. Toiletries in bathroom. Room and bathroom cleaned every day. Must leave towels in bathtub to get new towels every day. Never any issues really. Watched CNN+, which is the spanish CNN every morning to check out the weather and news. There is a supermarket called (Hipermarket) a couple blocks away. Ask the front desk and they will tell you. Also, nearby, there is Cafe Nou, as others have reported, as well as a cheap internet cafe, where I also bought a 5euro phone card to call back to the US. There is the little store run by an Indian guy nearby as well. But can get more and cheaper if you get to the supermarket. Bought juice and stored it in the mini fridge in the hotel. Hotel is only a few stops away from all major tourist attactions by metro. It really is in the most ideal location. The Aerobus to get back to the airport is also very close to the part of Plaza de Espanya near the hotel. Essentially, it's at this little stop that is across from the Hotel de Catalunya (I think that's what it was... basically the big hotel right on the Plaza) just off the sidewalk and directly across from the metro stop. No need to cross many streets. You will see a sign at the bus stop that says Aerobus. Staff at hotel were great. They could speak English pretty well as well. I think I remember a blond haired man (Ramon?) and woman, who spoke English well and were pretty helpful. On the last night, I wanted some bath soap b/c the cleaning service didn't leave any and also another hand towel. The front desk told me it'd be up in my room immediately. And sure enough someone brought it up in a few minutes. Would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was in Barcelona. Actually wished that I could have explored the area around a bit more and enjoyed the hotel more, but was always out and about site-seeing. Oh, and yes there is a fitness room, but it only has 2 bikes and 1 treadmill. There are a sauna and steam room, as well as showers. Never used any of these facilities as I never had the time. But they were clean and nicely laid out.

It was one of the better experiences we had. The front desk folks were great. Very accomodating and helpful. We asked for a \"quiet room\" and had absolutely no difficulty with external noise. Although it is true that you can hear people opening and closing their doors. The room was well designed and very clean. We loved the location. We were very close to the Olympic Site and the Miro Art Gallery. It's a 20min walk to Las Rambals. One of the cheapest and best Tapas places is just 2 blocks away, the hotel will direct you to this quaint little place (a couple of blocks from the main Train Station). Our favourite place to eat was the fish bar/kiosk in the BACK/Centre of the Market. Go early, everything starts to shut down around 3pm. The other great place is in the old town....CAL PEP. Utterly fantastic. Tips: If you're coming from the airport...take the bus directly across from the information centre in the airport...the bus is very inexpensive a few Euro's and get off at the first stop,,,Plaza Espania...the hotel is only 2 blocks away... it could not have been easier. Avoid taxis every time we took one it was a hassle...overcharging...taking us on unnecessary long routes etc. All the stuff people say about thefts and scams are true. We met several people who had been robbed, at the train station and on Las Rambalas. Also, on Las Rambalas there is a group of Russian scam artists...one guy has 3 containers with a ball under one container...the idea is that you are to guess which ball is under a particular container. If you guess right they give you money. The scam is that they have their friends pose as tourists are 'winning' alot of money. Then real tourist take a turn, they first win a few Euros and as the wager get higher ie $100 Euros then suddenly you lose and they all run away...with your money.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murcia, Spain", "Title": "\u201cSpace age style\u201d", "Author": "AguilanTravellers", "ReviewID": "UR12434023", "Content": "smart super styled hotel very ultra modern styling the corridors are like something from startrek. rooms are small by any standard and the lighting is an art form and you need a computer programming degree to operate it Bathroom is an ultra modern experiance pitty the sink plug had to be extracted by prising out but not a huge problem good for a fwe days and well located for the centre of the city", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cNIce homepad to visit Barcelona but too noisy too sleep\u201d", "Author": "Steph_Jul", "ReviewID": "UR12033626", "Content": "The Vincci Area has style, courtuous personnel, a decent breakfast buffet, and it is well located - there are three subway stations within 300 meters.

We came there for our honeymoon, and it was the worst hotel experience that we\u2019ve ever had. We travel a lot on business \u2013 working for a big international company in Russia - and for vacations, and we\u2019ve never met hotel crew that irresponsible and merely mean. We came to the hotel right from our wedding, therefore we had with us the glasses that were given to us as a gift by our parents. They were not cheap, of course, but not extremely expensive \u2013 we had our clothes and other things that cost more in the room - so we didn\u2019t think of putting them in the safe. We were using them sometimes having a bit of wine \u2013 and enjoying our time. One day the glasses disappeared. We reported to the service desk, they said they will find them. For the whole day they were saying \u2018we will let you know as soon as we have any news\u2019. Of course, we were very upset \u2013 as this was our wedding gift. In the evening, they told us that their cleaning lady took the glasses (\u2018she thought they were ours\u2019), put them on a cart and they disappeared. They told us they\u2019ve been looking for them for the whole day, the manager came, the Principal came,etc. They told us the cleaning lady was fired and they will compensate for the glasses. We were saying that we would rather prefer them to find the glasses, but they made it clear to us that they will compensate as they can\u2019t find the glasses. We called to our parents (who got very upset, of course) to learn the price and reported it to the service desk. The service desk lady said the sum was too big and she had to call the Principal. She called the Principal and told us it\u2019s alright, the Principal will compensate if we provide the checks. We already were not so confident in the hotel trustworthiness, so we requested a written confirmation, but the service lady said \u2018You should trust us. We will compensate\u2019. Ok, the situation was [-], probably we shouldn\u2019t have had the glasses around, but the Principal promised to compensate, so we felt at least a bit relieved. And so, we left for Russia, and here the whole mess started. We sent the checks to the hotel the same week \u2013 by fax \u2013 and emailed them. No response. We emailed again. No response. We called them. The service desk said they received everything, but there would be public holidays, so they would get back to us the following week. We asked them why they didn\u2019t respond before the holidays \u2013 having plenty of time, but they failed to explain. A week later \u2013 nothing, we called to the hotel and ask for the manager. They asked who was calling and said manager was not available. It lasted for a couple of days. After that we sent a rather angry message to the manager, to which he eventually responded the following day. Mr. Ramon Alegret (beware!) wrote that he consulted their legal department, and is not going to compensate. He gave out all the [-] on that we had to keep the glasses in the safe. That \u2018we would like also inform you that all the staff have been selected through hard programs and all of them have our confidence from the first moment that they are considerer our staff\u2019 And he even wrote \u2018we can not check if you have or not on the room a wedding glasses\u2019. This was so appalling that we requested Mr. Ramon Alegret to provide us with the contact of the Principal \u2013 the one who actually did suggest compensation for the glasses \u2013 it was not our idea \u2013 we just wanted the glasses back. But of course, Mr. Ramon Alegret is keeping quiet. It would all have been OK if they mentioned all the [-] about legal department and the safety box when we were there. But they suggested themselves to compensate and promised to do so if we provided the checks. Does it mean that their properly-selected staff is properly-trained to lie to get rid of the customers whose property disappears in their ill-famous hotel? Probably, yes! The story is not finished, but it is clear that neither ourselves not the people we know throughout the world will ever stay in the Vincci Hotels. We urge you not to do so, either, if you want to support us \u2013 and all other people who might have suffered from this chain \u2013 against corporative thiefs and liars.

(7th - 11th October 2007). All in all we have nothing but good reports for this hotel. Its very modern, good sized rooms overall. We were located on the 6th floor directly opposite the elevator which we thought might have created lots of noise but quite the opposite...very peaceful. We had a double room which was really two single beds joined together but it was ok. The only complaint we had was the heating in the rooms. Without the air conditioning on we were nearly roasted alive as the windows wouldn't open. However with the air conditioning on it was way too cold. Wardrobe space etc was good, TV only had one English speaking channel. This wasn't a huge concern to us as we were not spending lots of time in the hotel. Breakfast is available from 7am till 10.30 am and is 15 euros per person. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel during our stay as to be honest you can get brekkie for far cheaper in any of the small cafes near to the hotel. The hotel itself is located near to Place Espagna where you can catch the Tourist Bus around Barcelona and also the underground. We had a 2 day tourist pass which was great as you can hop on and hop off the bus wherever you like on any of the 2 routes available. Only down side to this is that these buses get very busy and you have to queue at each of the attractions to get back on the bus....this can take quite a while at peak times. For us the location of the hotel was fine however I can understand that some people may find it a bit out of the way. Maybe about 15 minutes to Las Ramblas. Its sometimes nice to see other areas and there were nice little markets on at night near the hotel so it was nice to see other goings on other than in the \"tourist zone\". Plenty little supermarket shops nearby too if you want to stock up on water, juices etc. All in all a really nice stay at this hotel, would definitely come here again.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Vincci Arena", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d609760-Reviews-Hotel_Vincci_Arena-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$124 - $214*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Consell de Cent 51-53</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">(esq.
