We were extremely satisfied with the overall hotel experience. The details are: - Location - Taksim is an excellent location, close to all public transportation in Istanbul and also walking distance to many historical sites so staying in this area really allows you to explore the city by foot and also to use metro/bus/trams (Istanbul has an excellent infrastructure). It also felt less touristy because the locals also come to Taksim to shop, eat and enjoy the night life. - Cleanliness/room: This hotel earns top marks for its cleanliness. There is always that first impression when walking into a room - here the smell was fresh and clean. Once inside of the room, all was modern. For example, I never hang my clothes or uses hotel drawers - this time the room felt so clean that I had no concern. Daily housekeeping service was very good and it showed. The toiletries are good and in the room you also get slippers and a nice selection of magazines in English - TimeOut Istanbul (very good to check out what's happening in the city) and another magazine with good restaurants. - Service: The team at the reception and doorman was excellent - the whole team (Hacer, Emer? and the two gentlemen in the afternoon shifts thank YOU!). Always smiling and helping us with recommendations. They recommended 360 one night and we really like it - good place to go and have a pre-dinner drink or after dinner drink. The hotel recommended tours which we didn't use and this was something I would do differently. There are many long lines when going to see the Topkapi palace or the Blue Mosque and having a guide means you don't have to wait as well as you get the whole history. The prices quoted in the service recommended by the hotel was also more competitive than what you get when you go to the museums and try to get a guide there. Transportation - we used the hotel service to and from the airport. It was included on the way to the hotel and we decided to use it on the way back. The cost was 70 TL - it was convenient and reliable. Having said there is a cheaper service using public transport that I understand goes every 30 minutes and cost around 15 TL per person. The hotel can give the details. Breakfast/Eating at the hotel - we didn't have breakfast included and at 14 EUR for breakfast at the hotel, we decided to explore the local turkish cafes rather than eat at the hotel so can't rate the food. If you chose to eat out for breakfast I can highly recommend the \"House Cafe\" in Istakl (spelling?) street - around 10 minute walk from the hotel and has excellent breakfast selection. All and all - a wonderful experience in a very good hotel!

Overall it was a very good experience. The hotel is situated right by Taksim square, in a pedestrian enclave where there are many hotels. Taksim square is crazy busy and noisy 24/7, but Midtown hotel was very very quiet despite being so close to it. So you get the best of both worlds. There are many options around for food, drinks, and snacks. I highly recommend the 'simit saray' chain which has 2 stores on Taksim square, right by Midtown hotel. You can get wonderful Turkish snacks there, such as boureks, sweets and the amazing simit loaf. Also you can get the original kahraman maras dondurma, which is the absolutely BEST ice cream in the world :-) The hotel has nice modern decoration, it was very clean and it offered the amenities expected from a 4 star hotel. The AC is individually controlled and it is very powerful! This is very important in Istanbul, if you re coming during the summer. TV has many satellite channels covering several languages. Hotel staff was helpful and polite, but some of them did nt speak English well. However as we found out this is a general issue in Istanbul, so it can be useful if you can understand and say a few basic phrases in Turkish. The only we did nt quite like at Midtown hotel, was breakfast. We paid 15 euros per person, per day for breakfast and it was definitely not worth it. It has the usual variety of breakfast items, you can find in any 4 star hotel, but we were expecting to find more Turkish breakfast stuff like for example simit, pide breads, kaimak creams etc. The worst thing however was the coffee. You can only have filter coffee from a big machine, which is boiling hot, very weak and pretty awful... If you want a cappuccino, an espresso or a Turkish coffee you have to pay extra. In my opinion this is unacceptable and we have never encountered it in our numerous stays in 4 star hotels elsewhere. To sum up, breakfast is basic and average ( except the horrible coffee ) but its definitely not worth 15 euros. So if you can avoid it, do it. You can get a much better deal in the nearby 'simit saray' store.

There was also the usual complimentary bottle of water, some Turkish sweets and a relatively cheap mini-bar plus free wireless connection. - the staff at reception were extremely helpful and were more than happy to assist with directions etc. - the hotel is located in the Taksiim Square area of the city which is modern and as close to European as you'll get in Istanbul. Only a minute or so's walk to the square itself (really nothing to see there) and around 5 minutes from the main (huge) shopping street, Istiklal Caddesi, and the accompanying bars/restaurants. There are also a few decent places to eat and drink right next to the hotel but also a few dodgy places so be sensible, especially at night. - the hotel is a fair old drive from the old town / Sultanahmet, where you'll find the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofia so if you're interest lies predominantly in that part of town you'd be better off getting a hotel there as it's a pain to travel, especially in rush hour. - I didn't eat at the hotel (too many other good / cheaper places nearby, so can't comment on the standard of food. - the cost was very reasonable (at under \u00c2\u00a3350 for four nights) All in all, it's not a 5* (some may even find it a little soulless) but I would definitely recommend staying here for the cost, the convenience and the basic comfort the hotel provided.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cGood Find - Brilliant Location and Value\u201d", "Author": "Shaheenp", "ReviewID": "UR94561620", "Content": "We had an 8 night stay in Istanbul in which we move old city to Taksim.

The Midtown is located in the Takim district of Istanbul about 2.5 miles from the major tourist attractions in the Old Town. Public transportation is convenient to the hotel with a subway station 200 yards from the hotel. I understand you can reach the Midtown from the airport via public transportation; however, I did not try it. The hotel will provide a car for travel to the international airport for 40 euro and during my stay the Midtown. Security is obvious in the tourist sections of Istanbul. The Midtown is located in an enclave complete with security guards who restrict vehicle traffic. This offers the added advantage of minimizing vehicle noise around the hotel. The Midtown also has 24-hour security guards 9as do most of the hotels in the area). If that level of security is not to your Hilton takes security one level higher with complete vehicle searches and every entrance to the property covered by guards. The rooms at the Midtown are small by US standards and similar in size to what you find in other European cities. Although the rooms have 2 chairs they are not really large enough for 2. I would suggest an upgrade to a suite for parties of 2 or more. The only noise I encountered was from the restaurants on the streets below. I would recommend a room on the upper floors for that reason The bed was new and pretty hard with lots of pillows. The furniture was a bit worn but still very functional. The bathroom was modern with a very nice shower fixture in the tub. Air conditioning is important in Istanbul particularly in the summer months. The system in the Midtown is modern and worked very well during my stay. The Midtown provides free wifi enabled internet access. Although other reviewers have covered the free buffet, I still found the quality a surprise. There is something for everyone. The fresh fruit was a real treat. The fresh breads were very popular. The buffet includes both scrambled and hard-boiled eggs. In addition, the chef provides a variety of meats and cooked vegetables that provided menu variety from day-to-day. I had dinner in the restaurant on 3 occasions and found the food quality excellent. In addition, there are a broad variety of restaurants within easy walking distance that serve until late at night. Ramadan was being celebrated during my stay and the restaurant was hosting several large groups The staff at the hotel was friendly and professional. Most speak English and all are eager to please. Room pricing seems to vary widely depending on demand. If you book early and catch them when there is not a major sporting or cultural event in the area you will get a high-quality room at a generally quiet, safe hotel.

This is a great hotel at a very good price (100 euro/double) given its many amenities.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yerevan, Armenia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great everything\u201d", "Author": "quest42good", "ReviewID": "UR54687646", "Content": "I stayed at MidTown hotel for four nights in mid-January 2010, during a business trip. While my company suggested a selection of business hotels in Taksim area, like Nippon and Metropark, I decided to book this one based on the very positive reviews here on TripAdvisor. I'm glad to say Midtown hotel never gave me chance to regret my decision, and I feel like a smart traveller! Now, a detailed review. Price I booked through the website of the hotel at the Internet rate of EUR 68 per night, breakfast inclusive. Considering the offers of other hotels located in Taksim, which is considered the downtown and the bst place to stay for a business traveller, I think it's a great price for the value provided. Location I did read that the hotel is quite near the Havas shuttle bus that connects Taksim and Ataturk airport, however I didn't not really imagine that it's THAT close. Arriving at around 7pm I had absolutely no difficulty finding the hotel - just cross the street and it's there, just around the corner. By the way, I was very happy with my decision to take the shuttle bus from the airport, rather than a taxi - the bus stop is just outside the airport exit, you can immediately see the large modern buses with \"HAVAS\" written on the sides; the bus runs every 30mins, and the trip takes just about 35 mins. The bus is very comfortable, and the ride costs just 10 Turkish Liras (about EUR 2), i.e. about 2.5 times cheaper than a taxi would. Besides, as a solo female traveler I felt safe surrounded by people - mostly locals returning from trips. Not to be seen as biased, however, I must immediately note that I used taxis in Istanbul on a number of other occassions, and it felt quite safe. Another note: having been warned here on the forums about not agreeing the price of the ride with the taxi driver beforehand and insisting upon him using the counter, I must admit I did quite the opposite :). Once, the driver did have the change, but when I left the taxi I found out that he gave me 2 liras instead of five, so you may want to check the change before getting off. Other times it was just fine, but bear in mind that most taxi drivers do not speak a word in English, so be prepared, you may need to learn some basic words in Turkish, like \"how much\" and the numbers - it helps a lot. But where was I. Midtown hotel is located on a quiet but no means boring cobble-stoned street, which somehow reminded me of the pretty narrow streets at Montmartre :) McDonald's and a Pizza Hut are just around the corner, near Havas bus stop. And so are countless small shops selling everything from bottled water to staples, and, of course Turkish food and sweets. Taksim square is a major hub, so an underground station, bus and tranway stops are all very close to hotel (though I didn't have a chance to use any of them). It's a bustling area, so you feel very safe even at night. However, be sure to remember the way to the hotel, as even taxi drivers seemed to have never heard of neither the hotel, nor Lamartin street. Check-in and Reception Once you are through the revolving door of the hotel, you find yourself in what is a very modern and cosy lobby. The picture of it is actually true. As I was visiting in January, they still did not remove the Christmas tree and the two little reindeers beside it, which was adding to the warm atmosphere of the hotel, in a positive way (see my photos). The receptionist was very friendly and efficient, though there was no one else in the lobby, probably because it was Sunday evening. He gave me a form with just a few things to complete (which is actually good, as you don't have to stand there forever, filling in every tiny detail of yourself), and in a minute I was given my e-key.I requested a room with city view (I think someone recommended doing so in their review posted here), but I found out later that it really makes little sense, as the view is very limited due to buildings surrounding the hotel, so next time I would request a room with street view, which is nice (I could see it from the restaurant). One of the days I asked another receptionist for directions, and she was very helpful, immediately taking out a map and providing orientation. The staff spoke English quite well. Room My room was on the eighth floor, right in front of the elevator. As an experienced traveller may appreciate, this isn't too great, as you can normally hear all the ins and outs of hotel guests, as well as any conversations that go on between them. Let me start with the bad (luckily, it's about the only bad) and say right away that insulation seems to be a problem at the hotel, as not only I could here all the conversations by the elevator, but I was aware of every movement and every noise made by people in the neighboring rooms. A light sleeper can really see an issue here. When checking in I requested a room with city view, which appeared to be a mistake, as all I could see were the walls of the neighboring buildings and satellite antennas. Next time I would request a room with street view, which is actually quite nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from what I could see out the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s window. The room itself was quite spacious, with enough furniture in it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a table, a chair, an armchair, and then also a little table, two bedside tables, and of course, the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were all available. The bed was very comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps a bit too hard for my personal liking, but very comfortable and, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure, healthy for one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. I found four pillows on the bed, but they also has a pilow menu listed, which could be requested from the receptionist. The room had a heating system, which worked well (you could turn it on or off, which was far more convenient than a centralized, non-adjustable one). Still, the blanket appeared to be too heavy for me, and I requested a lighter one, which was provided immediately. There were two phones installed in the room and one in the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a feature I missed in a number of hotels of even higher class. Plumbing and bathroom No doubt, one of their strengths. The bathroom was very spacious, and exceptionally clean. And did I say \u00e2\u20ac\u201c CLEAN. Bath with a hugh showerhead and jaccuzzi effects worked seamlessly. They also had this acoustic system installed, which lets you hear what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the room while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extremely convenient for listening to the morning news while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking a shower. The hairdryer worked very well, and there was a very convenient magnifying mirror installed. Towels were in plenty. The only thing I missed was a bathrobe, but I didn't ask them to provide one, perhaps that would have worked. Wi-Fi About the only problem I encountered during my stay was that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect to the Internet from my room. It worked well from the reception and the restaurant, but there was no way I could get it work from my room. To be honest, I never complained about that, bearing in mind I would only stay for three days. Had I complained, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they would have solved the problem. Food and Drinks There was a kettle, two cups and a selection of tea/coffee/creamer in my room, restored daily, and they provided a complimentary bottle of water every day. Each evening the maid left a chocolate bonbon on my bed, which was nice. Minibar was typically overpriced. Breakfast was good, but nothing special and included a selection of ham/sausages/cheese/bread/sweetbreads, scrambled and boiled eggs, fruits, fruit salad, including fresh strawberries (yummy), muesli, flakes, jam, etcetc. There is also a toaster. All the food were fresh and tasty. Then I first entered the room, there was a selection of sweets provided, with a welcome from the manager. And tasty they were, too! Summary Great cozy yet very modern hotel in an excellent central location. Clean, friendly and comfortable place to stay in a beautiful city. Does have an atmosphere of its own, unlike those faceless chain hotels. Would definitely stay there again, for business or for leisure. Midtown hotel, you'd better continue to be as good as you are, as I have recommended you to a great number of my friends and colleagues already! :)", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNice Modern Hotel One Block From Taksim\u201d", "Author": "lostsendhelp", "ReviewID": "UR54506944", "Content": "The Midtown Hotel is a nice, probably fairly new, hotel in a good location.

We had a room with Bosphorus view - it's nice but actually not exactly worth the value cause the view is very limited because of the roofs of the other hotels. If you dream about Bosphorus panorama - better choose some hotel closer. The room is rather small but very nice furnished and very clean - that's really important in Turkey. The photos are completely true - nice chocolate colours are very attractive, and the bathroom is very good and clean. The breakfast is excellent- lot of fresh vegetables, fruits and sweets. We haven't had problems with the personnel but haven't got chance to receive any positive experience also - so I wouldn't comment on it. Reception was polite and professional in spite we arrived late at night. But any discounts because of late check in weren't available also - still it's not a problem.

I, my wife and our 3 year old son stayed here 2 nights in our 10 days' long Turkey trip. We noticed that the pictures we had seen before booking in various websites were not tricky at all, and we found the hotel more roomy than the pictures showed. I discovered that the hotel was a \"personal project\" of the owner who is an architect. It was sort of explanation of many well-planned, designed details. For instance you can notice many horisontal ines in many things: from the furniture to the doors and wall papers - and a very good balance between the squared sharp lines and the soft and more organic lines. I did not notice any detail that was left to the chance. But I believe that all above would not make any differences at all without the right spirit of the hotel personnel we met during our 2-nights'-3-days' stay. The first surprise was that there was prepared and additional bed for my son, free of charge. Well, it could be thought as protecting the good quality mattresses from a toddler's likely wetting issue but this was not the case for our son. On the other hand, the regular double bed we slept in was 200x200 cm that is above standards. Beautiful. I had written our room preferencesabout the room in booking process, (in upper levels, and quiet), and this was taken into consideration. Breakfast was much better than those of some 5 star hotels we knew regarding the quality and its presentation. We regret, however, we did not have the chance of trying the restaurant for lunch or dinner that seemed very promising. The additional info I received was that the chef is also the founder of the Turkish national cooking team for international contests. There were lots of bakery products (of the house) in the nreakfast buffet. 1 of our reasons for choosing this hotel was its convenient location for shuttle busses from and to the airports that is less than 50 meters' walk. In our last day we were going to pick up our luggage around 19.30 hours and it was a rainy ouside. Although it was only 3 pcs. pretty heavy luggage plus the loose and handluggage, and it was only 50 meters (accross the Cumhuriyet caddesi), 1 hotel employee accommpanied us by carrying 2 of our luggage, and another hotel employee lended my wife an umbrella, that would walk with our son. I do not think we would have received same attention and personal care in a 5 star hotel. That is why we thought it has been a perfect choice for us.

Whats Good about this hotel ?: Location is good - thats why I picked this hotel. In Taksim area - where there more that 30 hotels in this area. The rooms/bathroom are good - decent, clean, modern. Good/wide selection of hot/cold items for breakfast. Whats Bad about this hotel ?: Several things! Started right from check in! I had did a booking for 2 pax - however their online reservation system sends a confirmation but for 1 pax instead. I requested for airport pickup(at an additional cost) - that didnt happen. I had a Twin Bed room - however, there is only One wine glass and only one drinking glass. And one mineral bottle for 2 occupants. I was promised by the reservation manager that he will put 2 mineral bottles for us every day. That didnt happen. Bad service - when you go for breakfast dont expected to be greeted or spot a smile on any of the staff. They have a good selection of fruits for breakfast - apples, banana, oranges etc - take as many as you want. However, if you make use the orange juice maker/extractor yourself which is kept in the buffet table or ask the staff to extract juice be prepared to pay 5Lira. When I complained to the F&B manager that it doesnt make sense, I can eat any amount of banana, apple and even orange, however, if I want orange juice I have to pay 5Lira ? If they want to charge 5Lira then dont put the orange juice maker in the buffet area - keep it in the kitchen and take orders and charge if you want to. He agreed with me. And said he will bring up in the morning meeting. I also told him about his staff who are grumpy and dont even greet hotel guests - he said that will change. After the meeting, he comes and tells me there is no charge anymore for freshly squeesed orange juice. Yeah! Well, not so. The next morning, I asked the grumpy staff and was told the orange juice costs 5Lira. I met the GM that morning told him all the problems I had even the orange juice incident - he agreed with me - said that they will not charge for the orange juice from the next day. Yeah right! Next day, I asked the grumpy staff, he looked at me like, \"didnt I already tell you it cost 5Lira\" ? Well, it still cost 5Lira. I told him his GM said they will not be charging anymore. He apparently was not imformed. Then the F&B manager sees us, 2 minutes later, 2 glasses of complimentary orange juice gets delivered to our table. I didnt drink it at all as I noticed they were still charging OTHER customers despite promises to cease charging. On check out - I was billed for these 2 glasses of orange Juice. Spent 10minutes convincing the staff I didnt order it - and it was give to us complimentary - which I didnt even drink! The General Manager had promised a one litre of mineral water bottle instead when we told him the reservation manager promised 2 mineral bottles for us. That didnt happen. These are just some of the problems. Would I stay here again ? No. I dont need bad service. There are many other good hotels within 1minute walking distance. FYI, as of my last breakfast, they were still charging for the orange juice and the staff were still grumpy without an greeting - you get warmer/better service outside the hotel! - thats the true turkish hospitality Im familiar with!", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Midtown Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d671225-Reviews-Midtown_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$166 - $395*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "671225", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0a/e1/0ae1413a1cc7b135b9171ef9bf2768451large.jpg"}}
