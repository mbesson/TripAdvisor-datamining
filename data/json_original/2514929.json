But it was tucked away, and we were just going to the restaurant downstairs for dinner (delicious, incidentally) and honestly, I didn't want to be bothered lugging everything with me when I'd just lugged it across the Atlantic. This is a five-star hotel, after all. So I left it. And when we got back, it was missing. We were on the sixth floor and my husband checked to make sure the door was locked before we went to dinner. At least two people had access to our room: the housekeeper who did the turn-down service, and someone who brought a bucket of ice up to chill some wine at my husband's request. It was only about 75 Euros, thankfully, and at first I just chalked it up to an idiot penalty for my having left it in the first place. What was disappointing, however, was the total failure of the hotel to address the situation. We reported it the next morning, and the gentleman who took the report was very professional and apologetic. He asked all the right questions and said all the right things: this can't happen, we're so sorry, we will investigate and follow up with you, thank you so much for telling us, etc. We decided not to change hotels, figuring that it would be a hassle, it could have happened anywhere, and it seemed like the hotel was committed to making it right. But then, six days later, we were checking out and we'd still heard NOTHING. No \"we just wanted to let you know we're continuing to investigate,\" no \"let us at least buy you breakfast or a drink at the bar,\" nothing. It was this ultimate failure to follow up that has caused me to write a negative review of what otherwise could have been a very pleasant stay. The staff -- the concierges, doormen, and restaurant staff in particular -- were unfailingly courteous and professional. They were extraordinarily helpful with restaurant reservations and directions. The decor was lovely. Our room was a generous size for Paris, and the bathroom had the type of modern amenities that can be hard to find in an older hotel (giant tub, marble everywhere). Our only complaint aside from the theft was the deafening street noise that woke us, without fail, multiple times every night. Our room was on the street side (I understand the courtyard rooms are quieter, but we were out of luck on that one), and we would get bar noise from about midnight to around 4am-4:30 (last call at the \"Hustler Club\" two doors down, maybe?) and then the construction/trash trucks would start around 5. There was no way to control the temperature in our room (there was a thermostat, but it was either broken or the air conditioning was turned off throughout the hotel, because adjusting it didn't do anything). When we were there, it was 70F every day, so the window to the street was the only way to get some air into the room. The noise, however, was an inconvenience but not a dealbreaker. Once they turn the air on, I expect it will be less of an issue, and I should note that we did not complain about it/give the hotel an opportunity to correct it (I was reluctant to appear like a whiny, high-maintenance American). Ultimately, this is a beautiful hotel with a very pleasant staff at which I would never stay again in light of the theft. It seems to me that, at close to $600 a night US, you should be able to find a place where you won't get robbed, or, at the very least, where a robbery will be addressed.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorba Linda, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!!!\u201d", "Author": "David M", "ReviewID": "UR126417283", "Content": "I spent quite a bit of time researching different travel sites for our choice of Hotel in Paris.

Due to previous comments on Tripadvisor I had requested a room overlooking the rear courtyard which was beautiful.The hotel is just finishing off a complete renovation and everything looks very french and lovely. We stayed in the basic room category and initially I was worried about the size/bed etc. However, the rooms are about 25 sqm which although not huge is a very decent size for Paris especially if you only stay 2 nights. The bed was only queen size and could have been more comfortable but with only 2 nights it's not a bid deal.The bathroom was lovely with separate WC. We had breakfast included and I have to agree with previous comments that this is probably the closest one can get to a Michelin star breakfast. Although not a huge choice everything is so beautifully presented and of course delicious. The only down side of the hotel are its extra ordinary prices with food and drinks (mini bar and lobby lounge). 10 euros for a fairly small bottle of Evian, and I think the minimum prices for simple dishes such as Onion Soup or a Club Sandwich were between 20 and 25 euros.

We stayed in a suite that was huge, even by American standards. Parisian hotel rooms are notoriously small, well, this room was basically an apartment. Breakfast was excellent. The croissants were to-die-for! The staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating. The hotel's location is prime in that you are within walking distance of Le Louvre, Tuilieries, shopping on St. Honore, etc. You are also very close to Laduree on Champs Elysee (a tourist trap, but go anyway) and the \"Golden Triangle,\" which is the area of the Hotel Georges V. Do yourself a favor...have an afternoon cocktail and nibbles at the Georges V. Yes, you will need to take out a second mortgage, but oh, what a treat! Please, please, please do not show up in sneakers and a fanny pack! This is posh Paris at its finest. Live a little! Jeans are acceptable, just dress them up a little and you will be fine.

Since we booked this through our Virtuoso travel agent we obtained an upgrade from our deluxe room to a premier room on the 1st floor, facing the street. The Lancaster is perfectly located, a matter of steps from the Champs Elysees on Rue Di Beri; also a few blocks away from the prime designer shopping on Rue Faubourg St Honore. As some other reviewers have mentioned the concern about the noise, let me give you my perspective; yes its steps away from the major artery of the city, yes there is a bar across the street, yes it has 18th century sound proofing ... but is it really \"noisy\", in our case the answer was acceptably no. We were disturbed one morning by the recycling (bottle) garbage collection and an early morning delivery truck, and the occasional early morning riser in an adjacent room ... however overall I would say that we slept well and were not frustrated by any extraneous noise. The room (premier) was large by european standards, and very comfortable, including a flat screen tv, minibar, a writing desk and a couple of easy chairs. Again as some other reviewers pointed out there was some wear, however honestly we did not notice any of any significance, and my paranoia as created by reading such reviews was unfounded. We had a package with full breakfast included, which was enormous and delightful ... room service included. We never got a chance to try the restaurant but we did avail ourselves of the lounge and found the staff to be very friendly and attentive, Coffee, tea, wine, food and Wifi were all available. Overall the staff were SUPERB! ... very friendly, helpful and attentive, even when we had to change our travel plans to adjust for French ATC striking and our flights to London were cancelled the conceirge was there to arrange a car to take us to Gard Du Nord for the Eurostar. Also the same conceirge nailed a restaurant recommendation to Le Stella a quintessential Parisian Bisto which we would totally recommend! (We also dinied at the Buddha Bar and La Coupole in Montparnasse) Another very nice service is the complimentary limo which you may use in the evening to take you out to dinner etc. All in all, despite reading some of the negative reviews prior to staying here, all our worst fears were not realized, quite the opposite, the Lanc is a very small, sophisticated, comfortable and welcoming hotel smack in the center of Paris ... you would do well to stay here", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Staff / Great Location\u201d", "Author": "tryapepsi", "ReviewID": "UR78129536", "Content": "The Lancaster is a boutique hotel.

When I arrived in Europe, I checked my email and found that I had mistyped a digit in my credit card number and that my card was invalid, and my reservation unconfirmed. My partner called the hotel directly and spoke to a gentleman at the front desk. My partner provided the correct credit card number and asked for a confirmation, but this gentleman indicated he was not in reservations and could not confirm. As the Hotel Lancaster is part of the Leading Hotels of the World, and I am a President's Club member, I contacted LHW in the US. They could not pull, through any of their systems, our reservations and said that the hotel was full. Three times I emailed the hotel to secure a confirmation, but I never received a response. My partner tried calling again, but he was unsuccessful in securing any word of \"confirmation\". We, therefore, scrambled to secure a last minute reservation in Paris. Imagine my surprise to receive a $941 charge to my Visa upon my return for a reservation no-show. The hotel firmly implores that we had a confirmed reservation, yet we had no confirmation number and our last written email from the hotel said our reservation was now unconfirmed. Three full months of wrangling with the hotel and with Visa proved fruitless. The $941 charge stuck. I travel domestically and internationally on a weekly basis. This is the first time, in over 16 years, that I have ever been charged a no-show, because I completely understand how reservations, confirmations, and cancellations work. Despite having everything in writing and a cell phone log, I still got stuck with the charge.

The exercise room is small - one bike, one stepper machine and a single weight unit. Better than most small European hotels, but don't be fooled by descriptions. Spend the extra and stay up the street at the George V or spend less and be right in the mix at the Marriott Champs.
