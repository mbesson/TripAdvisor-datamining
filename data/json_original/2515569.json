I decided to follow other reviewers and asked for a front room. I was given a side room facing the courtyard. Yes, there are trains, but no matter where you stay downtown there are trains, and you can hear them no matter where you really are. The train tracks are directly behind the hotel, and there are several trains that go by, and yes they blow their horns. But, being only 4 window lengths away from the tracks, I can honestly say that the noise was not as bad as some people wrote about. That was the ONLY reason why I was not going to use it. But there was a special on expedia for a very good price so I grabbed it and hoped for the best. First and foremost, my BIGGEST RAVE about this hotel is that due to scheduling I arrived at 11:30am or so, check in is not until 4pm. I expected to be told to leave my luggage secured and hopefully by 2pm I could get a room . Once I went to the desk, the clerk, who was very friendly, informed me that my room was ready and gave me the keys. Not too many places would do that! The lobby is open, clean, there are 2 computers, 1 is strictly for boarding pass/airline info and the other was a general use one. I read someplace here that the elevator were slow, that I have to agree with, if your in a rush in the morning you can wait up to 5 min to get one, and there are 4 of them. I guess maybe the cleaning carts are blocking them or something, but once the afternoon rolls around they are fine. The room was clean, they wash all the bedding after each guest which is a plus, as I said my view was the courtyard, 4 windows away from the tracks, with the air on in the room we did not hear much at all. We are heavy sleepers, so that may have something to do with it, but you are given ear plugs everyday left on your pillows, we did not need or use them. I do have to add that the train was loud when we were awake in the room without the air on and the tv low, but that cannot be avoided, and most of the hotels in this area have that problem. The pool was clean as was the pool area, it was too cold for my liking, as it was chilly out there, but my son swam in it without a problem. There is also a little patio area outside of the gated pool where you can sit and enjoy a book, coffee, or just relax on a nice day. Breakfast, which is included is your typical Hampton Inn breakfast. cereal, muffins, eggs, Belgium waffles, coffee, juice, tea. We only had the waffles and muffins and they were good, and the food area was clean and constantly being cleaned by the staff working there. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate is available 24 hrs. There is a shuttle that will take you places other than the airport or the scheduled zoo trip, those take priority but if they are free they will take you within a certain radius, we used it to go to a popular taco place about 2 miles away and picked back up again, all within a reasonable time, just make sure they have no airport trips scheduled or you will have to wait or take the trolley which is also right there. I cannot stress enough how great the staff was, friendly, professional, and were always on top of their game. They offered suggestions on where to go without even asking. Very great staff! There is also an exercise room, again a typical hotel gym, nothing huge, treadmill, weights, bike, elliptical, and a TV. We checked it out and it was clean and had cleaning stuff for after using the machines. My son used it the days we were there and said it was good enough to keep up your routine. Make sure you book your airport shuttle the day before, they ask for 24 hrs notice, I just booked it when i got there so I wouldn't forget. The shuttle driver for the airport was prompt, and left on time. Once again, great service. The area around the hotel, and generally the whole seaport area does have a lot of homeless people around but they really do not bother you. I am a mother with 2 kids and went out at night walking around and felt safe. Another great deal is your a few blocks from Little Italy, and across the street you have the USS Midway, and Seaport. Great shops, food, and scenery. I would recommend giving this hotel a chance and put aside the train noise, it was worth the money, clean, helpful and just an overall greatly centered place.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sugar Land, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL AND INCREDIBLY LOUD!!!\u201d", "Author": "BGHera", "ReviewID": "UR128015712", "Content": "I'm really at a loss trying to describe this hotel! I actually paid for 2 nights at this hotel and had my mother, sister and niece with me. It was so embarrassing that I found myself apologizing over and over for the state of the hotel and for booking us there. I have been a Diamond member of the Hilton chain for a long time and have stayed virtually all over the world with them. I can safely say that this hotel ranks as the worst! Aside from the train noise (which is not mentioned anywhere that I can see on the hotel website), there is trolley noise, street noise and the thinnest walls at the hotel itself. The service (if you could call it that) at the front desk was awful. I was speaking directly to the front desk person and she's looking off into space somewhere! It took at least 15 minutes to check in when there was no one else in line - which most Hilton Honors guests know is a bit long as especially in a small hotel. What happened to the zip in/zip out check in? I asked if there was a room upgrade available and she did not even pretend to look at her computer, just said \"no\" . Okay fair enough, maybe she knew her inventory. She handed me the room keys without further explaining about how or where to get access to the parking and how to get to the room. She just looked bored and zoned out most of the time. It was not hard to figure it out the logistics, so we managed, but it would have been nice to act like she cared. The room itself so incredibly dingy, small and cramped, that hadn't it been close to midnight, I would have moved us to another hotel. I was glad I remembered to bring my flip flops from home because the carpet was nasty looking and felt it too! The noise from the train did stop at midnight but started up at 6:00 a.m. However, the hotel sits right on a busy street which was very loud with road noise. Oh yeah, the garbage trucks early in the morning were wonderful to hear too! Then there was the noise from all the airplanes flying overheard. Needless to say the dinky little ear plugs did NOT help. Even noise cancelling headphones didn't help! Anyway, when morning did finally come after the miserably noisy night, I decided to look out the window since we had a view of the pool. It was really dirty with a lot of leaves in it. Ick! When I went to check out after we were done with the 2 days, I had different front desk people awaiting. They were more interested in talking to each other about what was going on in their world than helping me check out. I waited a good 10 minutes before they finished conversing. Absolutely no apologies for anything whatsoever!!! I know that I didn't pay all that much (although $205 per night for an extremely subpar hotel is a lot as far as I'm concerned!) but I certainly should have warranted a certain amount of respect since I was a guest of the hotel (as ANY guest should)!

The hotel is located right on the train tracks running through downtown. Even though we had a room as far away as possible from the tracks it was impossible to get any sleep without ear plugs (my wife used them, but I needed to listen for the kids). The constant (oftentimes several times per minute) arrival of all kinds of trains, trams and locomotives announced by their horns, bells and whistles was accompanied by the fantastic cling-clang of the railroad crossing sign, which is at the corner if the hotel. I am sure a train lover would have enjoyed staying up all night spending time identifying every type of engine and car rattling by. I really didn't, as I was hoping for a night of rest after a week of visiting Southern California amusement parks.

She simply circled a few places on the map and said that it usually is a personal choice on best restaurants. I was a bit taken aback. Since she worked days, I waited for the evening shift to ask the exact same questions. The answers were completely different. Alex was wonderful. I had friends meet me at the hotel and he gave us great ideas on places to eat and enjoy ourselves. The hotel was practical and exactly what I needed on this trip.

Rooms were very nice. Internet was free and pretty fast. The complimentary ride to the airport was nice and the gentleman driver was very friendly. The trip to the terminal was less than 10 minutes. Only concern, as others have said, is there is a busy train line right behind the hotel. The crossing nearby has a bell sound that could get annoying, and the tracks are busy until after 1:00 am and start up again a little after 4:00 am. If you are a light sleeper, request a room away from the tracks and the crossing. One advantage of the rail line is that there is a trolley station literaly right behind the hotel.

I, too, read about the train noise. I did not receive ear plugs on my nightstand nor did I need them. During the week, (I was here for business) the train stops running around 11pm. Before that, it is a bit noisy and takes a little getting used to. I guess if you're a light sleeper you should find another place to stay. The train noise didn't start again until sometime between 4am-5am the following morning. I slept peacefully through the evening and actually got used to the \"train noises\" after the first night. As for the train - it's not like this is the only hotel that is affected by the train. It runs through downtown so most of the hotels in the little Italy area and various hotels thoughout the downtown area will hear the train noise. My friend actually lives several blocks up from the train and can still hear it so I'm not sure how easy it is to escape the noise. As for homeless people wandering into the hotel - that's ridiculous. I felt completely safe throughout my entire stay including walking to and from the hotel through various parts of town. It's a big city - there are always pockets of not-so-nice. The lobby doors are locked throughout the evening and you can only access with a key card. The parking is somewhat limited. I never had a problem, but I was only there during the week. If I would have had a problem - the front desk personnel were extremely helpful and I'm sure would have found alternate parking. There's plenty of street parking that is free after 6pm if you end up having to wait a bit. The front desk people were extremely kind throughout my stay. They helped me look up information about my rental car, provided info on where my guests could park, and gave area restaurant recommendations. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It's conveniently located next to Little Italy, the Beach, and is even within walking distance to the Gas Lamp Quarter. They even have a pool that faces the ocean so there were some pretty nice sunsets (I even saw someone have pizza ordered to the pool). The rooms were very clean and I didn't have any problems with my stay. People should remember this is a Hampton Inn not the big fancy Hilton in the Gas Lamp Quarter.

I stayed in room 649 toward the front of the hotel. It was off a courtyard. The train noise was endless. It seemed that every 15 minutes a train would go by, blasting its horn, made worst with the echo of the courtyard. The reviews earlier had the manager stating that there was to be a \"Quiet Zone\" the first quarter of 2011. Well its July 2011 and there is no quiet. Another big problem is the parking. I came back from an evening out and could not find a place to park. I did find one, but the next evening the same thing. I had to park on the street for 2 hours before a spot opened. When I left on Sunday, my car was unmoveable becasue of 2 cars parked so close I could not get into my car. As the front desk does not inquire about licence numbers, they had no way to know who was parked next to my car. I had to wait 3 hours before i could leave. Thank goodness I didnt have a plane to catch. Also on Sunday morning, every spot was filled including handicap and even parking in front of stairs and elevators. I could not go up stairs as they were blocked, a ever unsafe pratice. San Diego as most large cities has a large homeless population. While sitting in the lobby awaiting friends to pick me up, 2 homeless people came into the lobby and went to the breakfast area and got water. No one at the front desk asked them what they were doing. Made me feel aliitle unsafe. I wouldn't pick the hotel again. I asked about the \"Satifaction Guarteened\" sign at the fron desk. The desk clerk seemed unsure what I was talking about.

Too bad I didn't check reviews until it was too late. Overall the hotel was nice, and easy to find. Quite a few places are within walking distance, and everything else is just a few minute drive. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing we noticed initially that first night were all the trains that go by. They don't just go by, they blow their horns as they are passing through the city. This happened each night until around 11pm or so. I guess after that time they have to be \"quiet.\" It would then start up again around 6-7am. Our second night there we had someone above us letting their kids, from what we could tell, jump off the beds onto the floor and run around. The night management put a quick halt to that, which was nice. They even offered to move us to another room on the other side of the hotel away from the tracks. We only had one night left so instead of packing twice we decided to stay. At breakfast there was a decent selection: waffles, some type of egg, sausage, muffins, bagels, toast, cereal, fruit and yogurt. You could definitely fill up before heading out. The pool, which is on the 2nd level was fairly small. They advertise \"heated\", but it did not feel like it was when we were there. As I said before the hotel and staff were great.

My VISA debit card was hit for $899 for the room and $250 for incidentals, but because I was not intending to settle my room charges fully against this payment type I didn't have almost $1200 extra in this account.

I never had a problem except when we were leaving because we had all turned in our room cards and yet we needed one to get out of the garage. I pressed the \"help\" button and they buzzed us out. The location was great for being there for 4 evenings. It is within walking distance of the ocean front (right at the Cruise Ship Pier) and Little Italy and other great restaurants (Indigo Grill is amazing for higher priced food, Burger Lounge is incredible for lower prices.) . Any of the Italian restaurants are recommended. Breakfast at the hotel was good. Standard Hampton Inn fare. Internet was good, but only wired in the rooms (bothered me because I like to use the Hampton p[illow desk and work while I sit in bed and I couldn't here). The reason I would come back? Nandu. Nandu works at the front desk and he is incredible. He is friendly and knowledgeable without being cloying.

It's also next to a well-used railroad track, When we checked in, the clerk told us that we could have a room on the west side of the hotel away from the railroad track due to my Hilton HHonors status and I was very pleased. When I got to the room, I looked out the window and there was the track just to the left. I asked the clerk about this and he said that the hotel was full and my room was the best he had when I checked in. I was happy to hear little train noise between 10 PM and 4 AM - but that 4 AM train was LOUD. And the frequency of train traffic quickly increased after that.

The location was great, the breakfast was great and the service was great. The fitness room was nice, usable and cool. There's one night girl that's either little surly or just lacks personality, but other than her, everyone else is wonderful. The trains are horrible. Horrible. We started out in a room on the side that faces the train tracks. Me and my husband are in our very early 30s and thought the trains wouldn't bother us. We thought wrong. We go to sleep fairly late but do like to get up pretty early in the morning. We heard a train at 11:30 that night (though we were still up) and then again the following morning starting before 6 am and continuing, I am not joking, EVERY TEN MINUTES thereafter. All day, the entire day. We promptly asked to be switched to a different room. Luckily, it was a Wednesday and wasn't too crowded so we were graciously accommodated and moved to a 4th floor room overlooking the pool. It smelled somewhat of mold and old cigarettes, but that's nothing compared to the trains. You really have no idea how loud those trains and trolleys can be until you're listening to them every 10 minutes. It's like some sort of mental torture. The guy at the front desk told us we should have booked through Hampton and we would not have had those rooms. He said when people book through other places, like Hotels.com, they put them in those rooms so fair warning. Their shuttle service was great; they even took us to dinner at The Prado at Balboa park for the Thursday night prix fixe special (very highly recommended for anyone. Delicious food, amazing setting. It happens every Thursday night and for $75 per couple you get a bottle of wine, seriously delicious three course meal and two tix to the photographic exhibit next door\u2014which featured awesome iconic rock 'n' roll photos when we went). For getting around, we used the trolley service behind the hotel (yes, the ones that come by every ten minutes), which was awesome and cheap. We just didn't want to sleep next to them. I would totally recommend this Hampton to someone looking for a great deal and great location, but you MUST make sure you avoid the train track rooms. I thought people were perhaps over-reacting. They were not. For dining, I'd recommend the Prado for romance. The Indigo Grill is right down the street from the Hampton as has some of the most deliciously huge portions I've ever seen. The food is a sort of South American/American fusion and the corn pudding is AMAZING. We also grabbed half price tacos and drinks on Tuesday at the swanky hipster restaurant/bar El Camino, which is in little Italy. We didn't make it to Papalecco's, but heard good things.

The trains run fairly frequently but if you know about them in advance and expect them to be there, they quickly fade into the background. You slumber will be peaceful, because the beds are _very_ comfortable. Firm mattresses with a soft top, clean crisp sheets and big fluffy comforters make for a very deep sleep (until Charlie comes along).

When I called from the airport to ask about the shuttle service, she looked up my reservation and called the shuttle, but when I told her I was still waiting for my luggage she told me she would have to cancel the shuttle and I was to call back when I had all my luggage, as it was hotel protocol.

The other hotel clerk who was checking me in was almost finished when I remembered to show them my AAA card (she did not inquire about it). The head clerk said it was too late, as the other woman had already \"pushed the button.\" What?!

While small, it had a number of cardio machines in good shape (including the elliptical--which is hard to find!) and sturdy free weights and a stability ball, and a water cooler.

Though, the hotel does offer free shuttle to/from the airport. We only used the shuttle service when we headed back to the airport. If you want to use their shuttle, remember to give them 24-hour advance notice. It was extremely convenient to have the Trolley right behind the hotel (fyi: it is the \"County Center/Little Italy\" station stop). We used it everyday. Especially coming home at night, it was a savior knowing that we just had to walk down the block and we were 'home'! It isn't the Trolley that's loud, more like the Amtrak that passes by (I do believe) that makes the most sound when it blows it's horn upon passing. Honestly, with the tv and a/c on in the room and being exhausted, you really end up not caring for the noise. It really isn't a big deal. I mean, you do hear it but it's only temporary for a brief moment. At one point, it was so loud (horn) it startled me, but I gruntled a bit and that was it. It passed. No big deal. ---Room--- Since everyone mentioned about the noise since the railroad and Trolley is right behind, I did try to request for a room opposite of the railroad! I got a room on the inner side of the building on the top floor (6th floor). I must say, what I loved most about the room was the nice soft/comfortable King-size bed and the comforter. I slept comfortably. So this makes up for the negative (i.e. noise) for me. ---Amenities--- What I didn't enjoy so much were the bath amenities. The towels were hard to the touch - really, they should consider using fabric softner! Though, luckily, the bath tissue was soft which was a good thing (Angel Soft brand). The other bathroom amenities I didn't enjoy. Using the shampoo made my hair rough. Bar soap as well. The next day I went and bought my own trial size shampoo and bar soap as a consequence. Again, this is no big deal, minor sacrifice! ---Other--- It was great to wake up in the morning to complimentary breakfast. That fueled me well for the day. Free newspaper on the weekdays.

Having been former residents of San Diego, we were full aware of the location - between busy Pacific Highway and the train tracks that services the SD trolley system, commuter rail and the Amtrak. Being aware of the \"night train\" made this hotel fine for us. But all who plan on staying there should know that the trains are loud, shake the room, run most of the night and regularly honk directly behind the hotel because it is next to a crossing. I am rating this place average not because of the trains but because of the service. First, we waited 40 minutes for the free airport shuttle to retrieve us from the airport despite calling ahead and being assured they would be there just a few minutes after we got our luggage. Knowing the area, we seriously could have walked there quicker. And second, once we arrived at the Hampton Inn, I specifically asked the desk clerk if we were getting a back room (we were checking in late - around 9pm local time and we figured if the hotel was booked we'd probably be in one of the back rooms and right next to the tracks). But instead of saying, \"yeah its late and that's all we have left,\" he said \"no, you are very far away from the train tracks.\" Well, that was a blatant lie because we were in the closest room to the tracks on the 4th floor and had a perfect view of the Beech Street railroad crossing. What was the point in lying? Other than our issues with the service, the hotel was quite nice. The room was clean and spacious. The continental breakfast was plentiful and there was free internet service in the hotel.

The location is ok for those looking to visit downtown San Diego but not stay at the expensive hotels in the Gaslamp. It is outside downtown and there are a few restaurants nearby in Little Italy but it is only a 25 minute walk or 5 minute trolley ride to the Gaslamp.

Stayed her from June 30th to July 5th. We got collected from the airport by the hotel shuttle which is a very nice gesture, just had to wait about 5 minutes after ringing. On arrival we got the keys to our room and went up only to find it wasn't ready (no big Deal). We rang recepetion who apologised but mentioned a restaurant nearby (voucher maybe) but by the time i carried all the luggage back down again this was not mentioned again. After that start every thing went really great the staff were really friendly and the front desk staff actually got to know us by name. The room was average size with a large bathroom at the front of the hotel but was very comfortable, so no train noise nor traffic as the higway runs by the front but was always very quiet no matter what time of the day it was. The pool area was never busy and great views of close by ships and harbour area. The front desk area and breakfast area and bedrooms were very well maintained and clean. We hired a car for 2 days and went to Carlsbad Outlets (not really worth the visit) and also went to North beach and Old Town which were well worth the visit, it was cloudy the whole time in North Beach but my daughter got really burnt.We also visited Torre Pines golf club as it was just after the US open. The hotel is very close by the Harbour, Seaport Village and the Gaslamp area which has great restaurants and if you walk through the Gaslamp you end up the Convention Center and Petco Park. We stayed over the July 4th Holiday and enjoyed the fireworks, but people actually put up camp all day to watch which in my opinion wasn't really worth it. San Diego is a great city to visit and we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel I would highly recommed this hotel to everyone and hopefully will be back again.

We could hear the trains and I thought it was kind of cool, there are regular passenger and freight trains and the local trolley. The back rooms are right on the tracks, the rooms facing west face the street. We stayed there for the annual Comic-Com comic book convention and frankly I was afraid of the price, $169 per night, but other hotels - dives, psudo Motel 6's with bars on all the windows - were going for the same price or more all along the block, and other hotels, the Holiday Inn across the street, the Marriott, the Hard Rock were $250+ and more. The hotel looked just like it did on the website, sorry no pics of my own, but the lobby is very airy, it can be described as art-deco or upscale Ikea, the rooms were great. I've stayed in 3 Hiltons in the past year and the rooms at this Hampton Inn were comparable in every way, just a little smaller. The beds had the \"Cloud Nine\" description which is a great big (clean) fluffy comforter with cover, sheets, fluffy pillows and lap desk. TV in armoire, clock radio, two phones, coffeemaker in the bathroom, the usual, but it was all nice. Hotel cons - got stuck in the elevator on our first day there. The emergency phone calls the front desk and the clerk hung up on us twice because we think she couldn't hear us. Hotel pros - free breakfast! This in itself was worth it! Breakfast was 2 hot dishes (our stay = eggs and sausage), various pastries and bagels to toast on your own, a selection of juices, whole fruit and fruit salad, cold cereal, instant oatmeal, milk, coffee, tea hot chocolate and yougurt. All day long there is coffee and tea service in the dining area as well as whole fruit (oranges, bananas and apples for us). Eat a BIG breakfast, grab some fruit and you can make it through most of a convention and grab dinner later on. The website advertised breakfast to go, but no one said anything to folks talking food up to their rooms or stopping by on the way out. Other Pros - transportation - the hotel again is right on a trolley/train line. The trolley stop is right behind the hotel and there are 2 ticket machines there. Two blocks south is the Santa Fe/American Plaza station which is a transfer point for the trolley as well as the Amtrak and Surfliner local trains - you can walk there easily as well. Across the street is the Holiday Inn and the waterfront. For our stay the Holiday Inn was also a shuttle stop for Comic-Con, but the hotel is an easy 15 minute walk I think. It wasn't that far in my mind at all and I don't walk much, on a map it looked really far but it wasn't. Food - the hotel is right next to a taco stand that's open early and late, and 100 feet away is a Jack in the Box. If you go behind the hotel and up the hill is an area called \"Little Italy\" and the clerk at the hotel told us nothing about it when we asked for a place to eat, but it was wonderful! There are pricey and moderate cafes, restaurants and chains coffee shops, but we ate Filippi's - a great old-style place with wine bottles hanging from the ceiling, employees eating on their breaks right next to the customers and great CHEAP food! Ask for the waitress Irene, she's fun and tell her the bingo girls wrote about her on the internet. The place is full of character and good food. For some the area around the hotel may be iffy, there are those low budget, in my mind \"scary\" hotels a few blocks down - 1 block north is a Courtyard by Marriott, then 2 scary hotels, then what looked like an industrial area. 1 block east, not even a block, was the trolley stop and 2 blocks east was Little Italy. 1 block west was the waterfront, and to the south were the main train station and city center-ish area, so for us it was ok walking around after 11pm, but again there were 100,000 people in town too, lots of taxis, pedi-cabs, etc. so just use common sense. I noticed a room being cleaned had a microwave and mini-fridge, you can probably ask for that at check-in. There is a 7-11 if you go out the front door of the hotel, make a right then make a right. In that neighborhood, alcohol sales stop at 10pm I think. But Filippi's sells 6-packs to go too! You need your hotel key to get into the ice and vending areas on your floor. Parking is $12 a day with in and out privileges and it is added to your bill at the end. You need your key to get into the parking lot - underground, 3 stories and TIGHT if you get in late - and you need your key to get in the elevator from the parking lot. On our last day, we packed up the car, checked out and left our car there until we were done at the convention, caught a trolley back, got our car and left. Not sure if that was Kosher, but it worked for us and saves us parking fees. I'm trying to book my stay for next year's Comic-Con again now! Oh, if you book through the convention, they do use this hotel at about the same rate we paid but with a harsher cancellation policy, 72 hours I think, and with our booking directly through the hotel it was 48 hours and no credit card deposit - I'm a HiltonHonors member though so don't know if that helped. Oh and free daily paper, or almost daily, frree wi-fi in the lobby, free internet in the rooms, and they have a shuttle too! Ok, and this may sound funny, but I think they steam or poach their eggs in a microwave, so they look really bright yellow and white, someone said like Play-Doh food, LOL, but they tasted fine!", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cLoved this Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "DSievers", "ReviewID": "UR17752700", "Content": "The beds were so comfortable!

I understand that mechanical devices have defects and just breakdown out of the blue. But as I spent an hour in the elevator, I realized Hampton Inn failed to do several things that could have prevented the situation or have been a bit proactive in resolving the elevator failure. I noticed the conveyance certificate had expired since Aug 17, 2007. The elevator had been in use for 6 months without inspection or if inspected the certificate was not displayed as required. Inspection every year is required or recommended. But with any inspection requirement, I understand schedules are full and inspectors are limited. When this failure occurred \u2013 my first action was calling for help. Pressing the call button numerous times on the elevator resulted in no assistance or notification of the front desk. I patiently continued this for quite a few minutes, but the only thing I heard was a faint dial tone \u2013 and never someone responding to the call. Once again \u2013 as hard as it was to believe this was happening \u2013 I was realistic of the situation. This isn't the worst thing that could have happened. At this time I decided to press the fire department button in the elevator. It seemed to be depressed already. Like the call button previously pressed nothing appeared to happen. There was no confirmation that the distress call had been transmitted or received. This could not be happening was my only thought. I had nothing with me but only my room key. There was no other way of calling for help except for the equipment on the elevator. My final option of getting any assistance out of this elevator was the alarm button. Lucky for me it worked. I pressed this for several minutes, until I could hear someone hitting an elevator door, but unfortunately it wasn't the one I was in. A few moments later I heard a staff member and soon he finally heard me and could understand me. Possibly a good 15 minutes later after the start of this ordeal \u2013 I have a conversation through the elevator speaker system. The staff member then ask me the most logical questions regarding my health and if there were any other passengers. He told me through the intercom that he's working on getting me out. A few minutes later \u2013 he informed me that the fire department was called and would arrive in 45 minutes. I thought to myself \u2013being stuck in an elevator must not be a high priority or there was a 2 alarm fire nearby. Long story shorter \u2013 The fire department personnel were required to open the doors. Several things concerned me. I entered the elevator on the lobby level to go to my room on the 4th floor, but when the fire department opened the doors I was in the parking garage level (one level below the lobby). The inspection of this elevator was not performed as required by the Department of Industrial Relations. Emergency communication within the elevator was inoperable to the front desk and to the FIRE DEPARTMENT. I understand things do happen that are out of our control, but in this situation Hampton Inn Downtown San Diego dropped the ball with preventable and basic provisions.

Everything else was fine and the bed was good but in San Diego's climate, you need a cool and quiet room to sleep.", "Date": "September 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location but NOISY TRAINS\u201d", "Author": "grahamkuk", "ReviewID": "UR5818805", "Content": "As the final part of our journey down Route 66 we decided to return to San Diego again having stayed here (in another hotel) 3 years ago, plus we do not like Santa Monica (we stayed 55 minutes to take photos at the end of the Mother Road). We stayed here for 4 nights on the basis of the location and comments. I was slightly concerned about some of the review comments about the trains and trams - my concerns were well founded. We had two rooms, one facing the back and the train lines and the other on the side facing down town. I heard the first trains and tried to move rooms but no others were available that night. My Wife usually sleeps through most noise but this room was the exception. Neither of us slept all night - what a racket these trains make - hooting and tooting all night long - and during the day. Our Daughters stayed in the other room and were also wakened but not as much. We moved next day into a side facing room which was a bit quieter but we still never got a full sleep. It's a real shame because in every other way this hotel is great. It has an integral car park, a swimming pool facing the sea / naval base, fantastic complimentary breakfast and is within walking distance of down town. You can take the trams but at $2 a ride why bother - the exercise does you good. Perhaps double glazing is needed to cut out the noise or the toiletries should include earplugs but that would be unsafe - you might not hear the fire alarm. So if you are a trainspotter this hotel will do you fine, if you are a light sleeper (like me) then perhaps the Holiday Inn just over a bit from this hotel and further away from the trains is the better choice - it's where we will go next time. It's a real shame that the hotel was built so close to the rails - see my photos.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cAwesome location, but....\u201d", "Author": "MetMan", "ReviewID": "UR5693610", "Content": "This Hampton Inn is a terrific value in downtown San Diego, just a block from the waterfront and the Star of India, as well as the maritime museum. Also, a short walk to the Gaslight District for great restaurants and nightlife. We even walked to Petco Park for a Padres game. The trolley stops right behind the hotel for convenient transportation to other area attractions. However, that's the rub. You can hear the trolley's and trains quite clearly, and the trains go through all night. There is a crossing which clangs as well. I wore my noise cancelling headphones to bed! The hotel itself appears to be quite new, with wonderful rooms and bright, cheerful decor. If you're a sound sleeper, it's a great value!", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hampton Inn San Diego - Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d224353-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_San_Diego_Downtown-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$93 - $224*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1531 Pacific Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515569", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/41/8b/418bac7a6745e082ef89a4e9421573c64large.jpg"}}
