The hotel is in an excellent location, both convenient yet peaceful. It is well-placed for some interesting restaurants  shopping. The roof-top pool is a peaceful haven in this busy city, with wonderful views.We stayed in a Junior Suite overlooking the facade  cloisters of the Santa Maria Novella church. This was very specious with a seperate sitting area  a long but narrow balcony, again with wonderful views. Nice details for us like complimentary mineral water, tea/coffee/biscuits, robes etc. Not sure if you get these in all rooms.The staff at this hotel are exceptional. This is spearheaded by Mr Stefano Fussaro (sp?, sorry), the front office manager. Nothing is too much trouuble. When we arrived (hot  bothered from the journey) I was concerned that the A/C in our room was not strong enough. Stefano offered us 3 different options to resolve this, personally showing us around to other rooms. After discussion, we decided to stay in the original room which was one of the nicest Junior Suites in the hotel. Stefano assured me that the A/C would be adequate  it was (the A/C had been turned off for some days for the previous guest  the room needed to cool down). The reason I am relating this story is to illustrate the trouble they will take to ensure you are perfectly happy, at a time when the hotel was very busy too.The duty managers in the Breakfast room are the same, charming  wanting to ensure everything is right for you. Breakfast offers a wide range of options, too much to mention here. There is also champagne available each morning  every day we indulged in a glass to celebrate our holiday.Although we arrived quite early in the day, our room was ready for us which I much appreciated.The Grand Hotel Minerva has been our regular haunt in Florence  I see no reason to change.

Traveled to Italy in dead heat of summer and tourism with teen son and daughter and used a Travel Agent to book part of our trip. Florence was our second stop and we were really disapointed by this hotel--think it tained our feelings of Florence. We really wanted to love this hotel--the location in Florence was good and close to the train station and the Duomo. The staff was the BEST we encountered in Italy and went out of their way to help and please us. The food was terrffic, although we were twice one of the only people in the restaurants. (Breakfast was busier.) However, I am perplexed reading the reviews--did NO ONE else notice that the entire plaza in front of the hotel was torn up with construction going on (or NOT as in our case?) Not even the natives knew when it would be done nor the rennovation on the lovely adjacent church shroud in cheese cloth (or so it appeared. )What a downer. But the rooms weren't any better--the A/C was weak, they were very traffic worn and clearly needed some fresh paint, new carpets and updating. We were in a large room that did have a lovely HUGE bathroom that was great, but the closet--although also huge had a burned out light that was never fixed and the pants presser didn't work. (No irons in Italy--bummer!) The kids couldn't wait to hit the roof-top pool, but blink and you'll miss it. There was no room for them and the other guests pretty much monopolized it--and the lounge chairs. However, the tiered roof-top area was lovely with a bar and very nice appe's! We very much enjoyed the complimentary party one night and the singer and her band was EXCELLENT--wish she had a CD! What a treat (for hubby and I at least!) Maid service was slow and although I left a daily tip--which is not expected from what I had heard, our meager requests were not met (new light bulb--extra towels--minor stuff.) Next time, I would stay more central Florence and try to avoid any constrution--which would be difficult: we counted EIGHTEEN from the rooftop!!

My husband and I stayed in the GHM for 3 night on our honeymoon in June/July and I have to say we were very disappointed.The main reason we chose this hotel was because it had a rooftop pool and terrace - somewhere to chill out after a hot days sightseeing, such a shame we didn't really get to use it......The second day we were there there were posters up saying there was a party for guests at the pool that evening, however you had to pay to go up there (I think it was around 15 Euros), we had already decided after paying 310 Euros per night for our room, which included use of the pool, there was no way we were going to pay again to use the pool to go to some party which we didn't even want to go to.So, already annoyed that we wouldn't be able to use the pool or even enter the rooftop terrace or bar that evening (if you didn't pay you weren't even allowed up the stairs)! We decided to finish our siteseeing early and spend some time relaxing by the pool. When we got up to the pool, mid afternoon, there were half the sunbeds that were there normally and they were all taken, when we asked where they were we were told they had been moved so that they could set up for the party that night. My husband said this was unacceptable and that we wanted some sunbeds brought back up as the party was not starting for a good few hours, the staff said they couldn't do this so my husband went down to reception and after a long argument with the rude reception staff they agreed to bring up some sunbeds. We waited almost half an hour and in the end some people left the pool area so we took their loungers.The next day we saw that some new posters had been put up stating the pool would be closed tonight as there was a Private party. We were out on a tour all day so as soon as we got back we went for a swim and then relaxed on the loungers in the early evening sun looking over the city, it was beautiful, we decided we would lay there and watch the sun go down with a bottle of wine, and then as we were nodding off over came the staff telling us we had to move as they needed to set up for the Private Party, we refused saying that we had paid for a hotel with a pool and this was the second eve we couldn't use it. In the end we had to move- this completely ruined our evening and we had to go back to our room (which had no balcony to sit out on)!I went down to reception and said that I was very annoyed that we hadn't been able to use the pool 2 out of 3 nights we were there, but unfortunately there was no one there to listen to my complaint and I had to go back to see the Reception Manager in the morning.He was extremely rude saying that guests paid for the room and breakfast only and that the pool was basically just a bonus! I told him that if this was the case they should not show the pool as one of the facilities on the website. After a very long, heated discussion and he eventually gave us a discount our room, but this was not the point, we booked this hotel mainly because of the pool and didn't really get to use it, we would rather have had no discount and been able to use the facilities advertised.

The staff was warm and welcoming especially Roberto. The hotel room and bathroom were a nice size and quite comfortable. What impressed me the most was how clean this hotel was. I have never stayed in a cleaner hotel and believe me I am quite picky about that. There were alot of nice touches like free internet use (our five-star hotel in Rome didn't have this),a coffee maker with cappucino, hot chocolate, coffee , a variety of teas(our five-star hotel in Rome didn't have this) , candies all around the lobby area (our five-star hotel in Rome didn't have this), a piano in the lobby, all of which made for a welcoming atmosphere. We were visiting our daughter who is studying in Florence, and all of the staff were very friendly to her as well. The breakfast was also very good. It was a buffet with eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, teas and hot chocolate. As far as location , we thought it was great. It was right near everything. It was close to the train station which was very convenient for getting to other areas like Rome, Sienna, Venice , to name a few. I understand being near the train station in Rome is not a good thing but this doesn't seem to be the case in Florence as all of Florence feels safe. I've read reviews were people commented on the undesirable people who hung out in the Piazza outside the hotel. We did not find this to be a problem, however we did go in February and it was rather cold; perhaps in warmer weather this is a problem but I would not let this keep me from enjoying the comforts of this wonderful hotel.I guess everything has at least one negative - there were a couple of annoying noises that we heard when sleeping. One of the noises we figured out when we were at breakfast. You see the hotel including the rooms are not carpeted ( which I personally like) and when the chairs move they make a screaching noise. Our room was right over the restaurant and we heard this noise when people got up and down from their table. The other noise we never figured out. I'm sure we could have gotten our room switched but we had adjoining rooms and there was not another set of adjoining rooms available, so we decided to live with the noise which for all we knew may have been a problem in all of the rooms.Florence is such a beautiful city and if we ever return we would definitely stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "Mar 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR354738715", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A great hotel!
