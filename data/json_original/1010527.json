A great place to stay and unwind. Surprisingly for an all-inclusive resort in this area - this hotel is small and the quality of the food and service is excellent. Well worth a stay. A jewel, though with a few flaws. The hotel has a wonderful setting, direct onto the white beaches and clear blue sea. Getting a sunbed on the beach was never a problem. The sea is a little shallow, though round the man made breakwater there were still lots of fish to see. At the moment there are no other hotels nearby. There is however a small marina and regular boat trips or jetski trips do spoil the peace and quiet. They are also building nearby. Every staff member had a different story about the development - in any case there will be more activity in this secluded spot in the future. The service is very good and every staff member was friendly. Sometimes the constant questions about 'is everything okay?' leaves you feeling worried that you should be constantly giving everyone a tip - a worry enhanced by the behaviour of the predominantly american visitors who seem to have an enormous pile of dollar bills tucked into their swimming trunks. Personally we found giving a tip at the end much easier and there were several members of staff who deserved it. The food was good, with 3-4 restaurants. No booking needed which helped further with the relaxation. No buffets here with food sitting there for a few hours. The waiters were always efficient. Food could have a little more spice. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. There are different sorts from the ' basic' seafront to rooms with pools (small) and some villas. The villas are quite amazing, though unless you are planning to stay indoors the whole holiday a little unnecessary. The lobby does look a little like a portacabin - do not be put off! If you see some of the marble palaces which greet you at some of the other hotels you begin to question your choice. The reality is - you see the lobby at checkin and checkout. Not a real criticism - but the hotel seems to be unsure of its identity. Is it a quiet, luxurious getaway - something it could easily achieve, or is it a resort for largely middle aged adults with activities? There is also a sort of holiday loyality club which you can buy into - they are very keen to emphasise that this is not a timeshare, though the selling presentation seemed a little like brainwashing, telling you what you should be thinking and largely ignoring your questions. apparently 7 of 10 people are seduced by this and therefore return annually to the hotel or another in its chain. All in all - an excellent place - don't expect perfection but do enjoy the friendly service, the food and the beach!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Osage Beach, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cLOVED EDM!!!\u201d", "Author": "GunnerMO", "ReviewID": "UR126502376", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from a week in paradise at EDM! We have been to this area several times and I will have to say that this was by far our best experience in Mexico. We were upgraded to a swim up suite (room 701) and loved it. It is one of the rooms further back, but we preferred it since we had more privacy there. The room was perfectly clean and everything we asked for we received. One example: one day at lunch my wife asked if they had fresh Red Snapper? They checked and said no, but had 3 other choices. But before my wife could choose a different fish they asked if we would be willing to wait 30 minutes? We said of course, it was vacation. In 30 minutes they brought her a beautiful plate of fresh Red Snapper. We were surprised and asked if they had to go to a different restaurant to get it? They said no, they went out and caught it! We laughed, thinking they were kidding, but were not kidding...they acually went out on a boat and caught it for her, while we waited!!!

Its one of the most relaxing place. Its super clean, very classy lovely food, lovely rooms, lovely beach and lovely people. Accept its best to go with some gifts and lots of $1 bills for tipping upfront daily for best services. We saw mostly ages from 40 and up ( retired) Its in the boonies very isolated.very nice . My husband and I went there for the first time looked forward to all the lovely stories we were told by the travel agent. until we reach to the front desk around 9pm very tired . We were given a welcome drink as we sat down to do the paperwork. We were then told to go to another one of their chain hotel called cassitas,because they said they have no more rooms. Which wasnot true at all . There was some other rooms for sure. we asked for the honeymoon room which we paid for and promised to . Then later on they came up with a very nice infinity room on the 3rd floor. We looked at it and accepted it. Locations was great, right in front of the spa.next to everything . We loved our stay accept we came accross some little catches. Dealing with consierge and Lomas Travel was a bit of challenge. Things often didn't go as we were promised, once booked. It kept changing. either the time or cancelled. We were kind of wondering about that thinking maybe others give better tips or ????. All the waiter, waitresses, cooks , managers , bartenders were very nice. Service was excellent. Rooms are very classy , very nice . Great stay.. We think the kitchen staffs , land scapers, beach staffs, also deserve some tips etc. They work super hard. We gave tips daily for 8 days they loved it. Just go and enjoy the most you can . Smile all the way Be very happy. Snorkeling on the beach was not the best. Rent the seadoos and go further up its much better or going on a snorkeling trio to elsewhere. sailing is not available We went to the cave at the Secreto river very nice. The weather was scary the time we arrived there stormy night but after that it was very nice windy and sunny . Water was a bit cool. We relaxed at the beach and time went very fast. .We did take a trip to Playa del carmen but we were not very impressed . We strongly recommend this hotel to all but please be sure you get what you pay for . When we mentioned to the hotel that out travel agent said that they already spoke to them about us and and its all set up. The hotel said travel agent not always do that they just say it . So then who do we believe. We dont like games. We expected to get what we paid for We'd love to go there again in future with some of our friends.or by ourselves.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quincy, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWonderful and Amazing\u201d", "Author": "gormanca", "ReviewID": "UR126271376", "Content": "We just returned from our trip to the Eldorado Maroma and wish I could have stayed forever it was absolutely amazing!

The sand is like white powder and the barriers keep the waves down and it's shallow so you can walk and play. The only thing that we didn't like was the concierge talking us into listening to the Exotic Travels sales presentation (that's not how she described it). The young girl who did the presentation said it would not be a high pressure situation but as soon as we said no she began the pressure. Thankfully another guy there told her to basically back off.

We are average vacationers, a few cruises and a few all-inclusives but were blown away by the experience at El D. Maroma. The moment we arrived, we were treated to scented, cool towels and a nice small drink. We were fortunate enough to experience the swim-up room with a double bed on the porch (Honeymoon Suite, I think). There was an occasional odor in the toilet area for the first day or two but when we mentioned it, somehow it was taken care of; deodorized that day and eliminated the next day for the rest of our stay. That was the only issue and typical of the service we received. Pool toilets were very pleasant; clean with a jasmine smell. Food was very good overall. Anyone complaining must be really looking for trouble. The staff was a highlight. Very friendly and consistent- tucking towels onto your beach chair (one of which was always available) before you sit down, bringing drinks and plates of appetizers to your beach chair, sun lotion available, magazines, books on the beach, walking by and offering drinks while we lounged on our porch, taking your plate and escorting you back to your table from the breakfast and lunch buffets, etc. This is a relaxing resort so the \"action\" was mild and we're in our 50's so we weren't looking for that anyway. There were a couple of wedding parties while we were there having fun but overall this was a quiet resort. We hired a taxi through the resort to drive to Playa for a morning, were picked up and delivered to the airport by a professional service (Lomas) and didn't feel uneasy about being in Mexico. The resort PEOPLE are fabulous!! We went to Jamaica last year (Sandals) and would never spend another dime there. All four of us were totally happy & would return to El D. Maroma in a heartbeat.

We were met at Lobby entrance with cool damp face towels to freshen up from our journey which started at 3am AST. When we entered the lobby we were offered a Mayan drink, a honey type liquour and anissett and ice. A nice drink, but not an all day type of thing. Our rooms were not ready as we arrived around 1:30 pm EST. Gabriel put our luggage in storage and we were off to Papitos for lunch. Close to 3 pm we checked and our rooms were ready. Our room a honeymoon infinity (341), and our frineds Mi Hotelito room 215 were enjoyed and met what each of us were looking for on our vacation. The infinity pool was clean and refreshing. Refreshing does not mean heated! The ony improvement we could ask Karisma to make to this hotel is to heat the pools, and other than maintenance to the existing facility, DO NOT GET BIGGER! Most meals, if not all, met what we were looking for in an all inclusive resort. No where does the hotel advertise to hold a Michelin Star, I can see where the Gormet Inclusive could lead people to expect more. The food at Maroma is the best We have had the priviledge of enjoying at any resort we have stayed at. From Dominican Republic, Jamicia, to other Karisma Resorts, all restaurants at this hotel satisfied our appetites. Getting to know the routine helps. If you ask them to change the menu around a little bit, they will on most occasions oblige your wish with a smile on their face. New this year was the Maroma Beach party which was a Bar-B-Que buffet on the beach, very well presented and prepared. My Wife has a shellfish allergy and when we notified ANY staff of the allergy, the were well aware of what we trying to say and they looked into making certain her meals were shellfish free. We had other couples mention similar allergies and how well they were taken care of as well. Through this topic we had the chance to meet Franchesco, the Chef for the resort, a wonderful guy who took the time to ask us whenever we ran into him on the resort how were our meals and that everything related to our stay was perfecto! The Beach is wonderful and provides a lovely place to walk or run, the next resort north is about about 2.5 miles one way. Lovely swimming opportunities along the way. Swimming diretly in front of the resort is limited due to the resorts beach infill program. There is swimming out past the man made surf breakers or sand bags but only on days with a yellow swim flag up. The resort provides some kind of lifeguard service and a guy blew a whistle when people were out past the sandbags on windy days. During our stay we did not encounter any amount of sulfer smell, we did get the occasional whiff, but nothing offensive. The night life is what you make of it. Broadway it is not! It is fun to meet at Ricks Bar for a drink with people you met at the pool during the day. We enjoyed prettty top shelf liquor, at times you had to ask, but as a rule no problems. The wine would be the best place for Maroma to spend some effort improving as what they offered was drinkable, but that is it. Grounds were immaculate, public washrooms were spotless, pools were clean. There were days when it was really windy and palm fronds and debris from the roofs would land in the pools, but there isnt anything you can do about that. The rooms are all well appointed, clean and everything functioned well. We had a small water supply issue one day, but apparently the water service was under repair. All in all, we enjoyed our stay, again and would recommend this resort to anyone who wants a quiet, well appointed destination to relax, unwind and get looked after by some of the most friendliest people.

The first thing you will notice upon arrival is the service. The moment we stepped of the bus someone was waiting for our luggage and another with a cool cloth. Our check in was easy, we were the only people there. You sit down at a small desk and a drink is brought to you and everything explained. Our travel agent had secured us a free upgrade to a swim up suite although there was none available. We were offered a private dinner on the beach or massage instead so we choose the dinner. I was initially disappointed but once arriving in our room I didn\u2019t mind. The rooms are gorgeous. We had a 2nd floor Jacuzzi suite overlooking the main pool. If you want a view get a top floor suite, we looked into palm trees\u2026 but the decks are big, private and comfortable. The resort is small, beautifully manicured, clean and quiet. As previous posters say\u2026.do not come here looking for a party. This place is great for couples. The demographics seemed a bit older than us and we are in our early 40\u2019s. There were a few weddings during our stay and they looked beautiful. The weddings brought in a bit younger crowd too near the end of our stay which was fun. The service is top notch. Maid service includes turn down service with aromatherapy, waiter service on the beach, they even tuck your towels in around your beach chair and make a pillow for you and bring you waters when you step on the beach. In the afternoon someone will come around and offer you snacks from a tray\u2026.life is good! The drinks are served in big glasses and top shelf alcohol available with no extra charge. The staff seems to learn your name right away and makes you feel like you are genuinely a pleasure to have there. The nightlife was pretty quiet, we went to Rick\u2019s bar a few times but not too exciting. The cheesy 80\u2019s videos were entertaining to watch and good for a laugh. The Michael Jackson show was the only one we saw...pretty good. There is no \u201cparty around a swim up bar\u201d type of atmosphere, the pools are pretty small and no music plays. The sand is like baby powder, you will never have to fight for a beach chair and we mostly always managed to get a beach bed on the beach too. We had two couples massages in the Spa, a private dinner on the beach (fabulous), ate at every restaurant and went parasailing at the Marina next door. We booked a tour to Tulum through Luis on the resort (got in a Mexican fender bender\u2026.interesting). We went to Playa twice, one afternoon when it was cloudy and one night after dinner to check out the shops and action and stopped at a wine bar for snacks/wine. If you have any questions about any of this please feel free to message me. As a note we did a beach walk to Secrets Maroma one afternoon and checked it out. It is a beautiful resort\u2026much larger but certainly a different feel. The beach there also seemed crowded and uneven but the lazy river and pool were very cool. This resort was the best service we have experienced. We have been on twenty 5 star tropical destinations in the last five years.

It is an all-inclusive. I think one of the reasons the top resorts in the area have switched back to \"european plan\" is that is is very difficult to give the kind of quality some travelers expect under the all-inclusive model. Food at the El Dorado Maroma ranged from decent to terrible, but, in general, I'd say it was mediocre. However, if the fact that you can eat as much as you want at anytime of day is a selling point to you, this review is probably not for you. The meal we had at the \"specialty\" asian restaurant was downright terrible. The \"house wines\" that are do not cost extra are mexican and near undrinkable. For good food we happily shelled out the $20 each way to go into Playa del Carmen by taxi, where the dining options are excellent. The drinks were fine, but not creative, and I found that you had to be watchful and insistent or else your top shelf margarita would become well liquor after the first or second. The service was good. All of the staff was polite, especially considering some of the drunken behavior I saw. As this was an adults only resort, there were many 45-60 year olds who were enjoying being away from their kids/jobs. By enjoying, I mean drinking free drinks like there was no tomorrow. In defense of the accommodations, we were coming from a large suite at the Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach in Cancun, but our room suffered in comparison. Also, our travel agent had booked us in the lowest level room, which was not a great fit. Our room was not very nice, but I can say that I am pretty sure we had the worst room at the resort, so most were probably nicer than ours. Our view was of the wall of the next building and the gift shop; no pool, ocean, or garden. We were on the first floor of a three story building, which was also a major disadvantage. Without the height, you had no view, but the bigger problem was that the footsteps or doors closing in the rooms above you resonated through the whole structure and were loud enough to wake you up, or keep you awake. It literally sounded like there was a herd of elephants above us at times, which was surprising as the buildings are made of concrete. Sound-proofing is a major issue, to say the least. I found the plumbing to be finicky in the shower; getting up to heat and keeping a constant temperature was an issue. One morning, we found that the water to our unit had been turned off for some reason. A phone call rectified the situation, but it was odd. Also, the materials in the room were all faux, which is not that big a deal, it just lead to the general impression of the resort trying to be something it is not. If you have a choice, ask for a room not in the 1100 building, especially not on the first floor. This resort is for people that really want to relax, by which I mean do nothing and not worry anything. If that is your idea of a vacation, you will like this resort. If the quality of the food is important to you, and you have discriminating tastes, and enjoy the process of finding unique restaurants to dine at while on vacation, book someplace else. Similarly, if you like to be active and explore the local culture, this resort is not for you. This experience has showed us that we are not \"all-inclusive\" people. Had I known what I know now, I would have stayed in Playa del Carmen. I love to plan my vacations carefully and do a ton of research before I go. With the proper research, you can find everything El Dorado Maroma offers, plus a great deal more, by researching Playa.

The restaurants had great food and my wife thinks this place has the best Sushi. The only thing is small protions so we learned quicky to order more food. The pool was great, the ocean even better, best sand (a little hard cause it is groomed) and the best water. Seen a few crabs, a lot of stingrays, Star fish, normal fish, shells and more. The water was so calm even when the wind picked up due to the setup they had out in the ocean. There are a few racoons and other critters running around that scared the wife but I didn't mind them. The resort is very isolated which was nice and even though our travel agent screwed up some of the details, the Hotel tryed there best to accomodate and when our travel agent missed picking us up, the hotel got us a cab and covered the cost.

I have to tell you - just book the trip, pack your bags and ENJOY. From the moment you walk in the spa scented lobby to the sad moment you pack your bags to go home, everything will be special. We were greeted with lovely scented cool hand towels to wash our hands and face. Check in was quick and easy. We had a lovely lunch by the beach and tried a few new drinks. Our room was like we had gone to heaven. We were in a Honeymoon Suite on the 4th floor and I cant begin to tell you how perfect it was. The large, comfortable day bed made for a restful wonderful sleep each evening - yes we slept outside most nights. The bed inside was just as comfortable, but really.. why sleep inside when you can stare at the stars and listen to the waves. The hotel grounds were beautiful, lush and spotless. The main pool was refreshing always with drinks on hand. The service staff was FANTASTIC. Special gracias to Linda on the beach. What a beautiful woman inside and out. Gaby at Soberes was such a pleasure to talk with over dinner. All the wait staff was friendly and ensured each meal was fantastic!! The evening shows were great and full of life. The cabanas and day beds by the beach were always available with fresh towels. The walk up the beach was just breathtaking. We loved each theme night at the restaurants. I have to admit we were a little hesitant about the small resort, but honestly.. I cant imagine going to a big hotel now. Wonderfully laid out, enough lounge chairs - sun and shade, great choice of restaurants, rooms and places to walk about. We had a lovely romantic dinner on the beach and David P was excellent. When we got back to our room, Olga had done our room up with great pride and such lovely decorations of rose petals. I have to give a very special warm gracias to Catarina and Adriana. Both women went completely out of their way to ensure our vacation was nothing short of perfection. Each of them welcomed us with open arms (literally) and we are so appreciative of their special touches. It was a pleasure getting to know you!!! Muchas gracias amigas!!!

This was our first time to Mexico, so we had no idea what to expect. We just returned from 6 days at the El Dorado Maroma and can only say.....MAGNIFICENT!!!! This resort exceeded any expectation we had, tenfold!!! If you are looking for a completely relaxing, quiet, intimate adult-only all-inclusive resort, on the smaller side, this is absolutely the resort for you. If you are looking for lots of activities, lots of people, and great nightlife, than this is NOT the resort for you. We wanted to unwind, have cocktails on the beach all day, fabulous meals, and just totally disconnect- this is exactly what we did. The resort is small, about 102 rooms, and feels like a little village, rather than a hotel. The landscaping is beautiful, with winding paths, which lead up to 3 different pools, all of which are quiet and peaceful. 2 swim up bars (so fun!) The staff is by far, the friendliest we have encountered in any resort. They make you feel like you are their only guests. Someone mentioned the service was slow on another review.....but you are on VACATION!!! The idea is to get away and relax!!! The service was not slow at all- we just felt totally pampered and relaxed the entire time. We were upgraded to a 1bdrm suite, which was actually too big for us, although we appreciated the service. The rooms had every modern amenity you could ask for. The beds and pillows were absolutely fantastic and luxurious! And each room has a day bed on the patio- fabulous!!! We did have a hot water issue, but it was addressed and fixed immediately. The food was absolutely delicious!! I was expecting average, at best, since this was our first all-inclusive. It far exceeded our expectations!! They would make special plates up for us, and each time, it was amazing. And we are big foodies....Bring lots of $5 and $1, as there is no ATM and the staff is so appreciative of tips- and they truly deserve them!!! The staff was at your beckon call- anything you wanted, just had to raise your hand and someone was there to accommodate you. The beach was spectacular- white velvet, and the water was clear and warm!! One thing, however, the pool water was probably 2-3 degrees too chilly for February. It didn't stop people from swimming all day, but sitting in the shade at the pool bar got a bit chilly after a while. I think in the winter months, they need to heat it up just a few degrees, as there is a nice breeze every day. At any given time, it truly felt like there were only 50 people in the whole resort- just peaceful and relaxing!!! Minimal activites, but there is a marina right next door, and you can go on booze cruises, parasailing, and jet skis. But we did not come for all that- we just wanted to unwind, read, eat fabulous meals and experience the beautiful Riveria Maya.The nightlife at Rick's is definitely lacking, but we did not come for nightlife- we made the most of the beautiful days, with cocktailing all day, had a great dinner and were just looking for a few after dinner drinks. As casual as the resort is, there is such an elegance about it as well, with the beautiful canopied daybeds, both on the beach and poolside. They did a fabulous fire show one night, with a full beach buffet, which was outstanding. Even though there are only 4 restaurants, we had a different meal each of the nights we were there, and one was better than the next!!!!I would stay here over a Ritz or Four Seasons any day, now that I have experienced this incredible place!!!

A Relaxing, Casual but Pampered Beach Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Melissa K", "ReviewID": "UR125422086", "Content": "My husband and I just came back from a 6-day trip to the El Dorado Maroma for my 40th birthday with another couple. We chose this resort based on the beach and ocean, adults-only, and because it was not a huge resort atmosphere (we did not want noise, endless activities or 100s of people). It was our first time trying all-inclusive. If our criteria is the same as yours for a vacation: quiet, stress-free, easy-going, but still elegant casual with modern amenities and pampering without being surrounded by a crowd, El Dorado Maroma is for you! First and foremost, El Dorado Maroma is amazing for its staff. We never met a hotel that had such an energetic, lovely, hard-working pleasant group of people. They remembered us from Day 1 and brought us our favorite drinks, made us special plates, chatted and laughed with us, and went out of their way to make this a relaxing, special trip. Kenneth, one of the \"butlers\", readily made rounds and true to his word, if you have an issue or complaint, raise it with one of the staff while you are there and they do their best to rectify it. They truly pride themselves on being available and well-received by their guests. So if something is wrong while you are there, speak up then to the staff and let them do their best to amend it for you. Rooms: We originally booked the Oceanfront Jr. Jacuzzi Suite, which were newly built. We were upgraded in the same building to a one-bedroom suite with an infinity pool. I do agree with other reviews that we would have more use for our personal pool, as well as the other pools in the resort, if they had some sort of heating element. We just went into the pool bar at the heat of the day; otherwise, too cold. Our personal pool warmed up or a hot tub would have been heavenly to enjoy... We loved our location. Because the resort is so intimate, we were not far from anything, but were away the more populated areas where other guests could look into your rooms if you were on the ground floor. Our building had 3 floors and we were the 2nd, with a beautiful view of the marina, ocean, and beach - a few feet from a 3rd pool in the resort that was right below us. Our view was only obstructed by a few palm trees - stunning! I never stayed in an \"oceanfront\" room actually so close to the beach. Our friends were above us and their view was breathtaking of the beach and water. I highly recommend the 1000s building if you want to enjoy your own piece of heaven away from the more \"populated\" pool and restaurant areas. Rooms were very clean; modern with double sinks, jacuzzi tub, spacious shower, separate toilet room, flat-screen TVs, refrigerators, with a separate living area with sectional, another wide screen TV, powder room, and unused kitchen and dining area. Beds were heavenly and comfortable! Housekeeping service 2x a day was wonderful and they answered our requests for extra cervezas and bottled waters daily. We love the beds on our decks! Brilliant idea and perfect for naps or to look at the stars at night! Food: We found the food to be excellent and exceeded our expectations for an all-inclusive. I think travelers should keep that in mind; you are not going to your favorite, specialty restaurant from home. We enjoyed breakfast at Papitos daily for the view of the beach and amazing, delicious quick buffet. We fell in love with the menu at Sabores for lunch after a few drinks at the connected pool bar. We ate there twice for dinner, enjoying the excellent Italian themed night and their regular Mexican flair menu (we opted out of the Mayan themed night after reviewing the menu). Even though we came in late, we were treated graciously by the staff. We enjoyed steaks at Papitos, but note, as it is when you travel, obviously their proteins and food (based in food intake and lack of chemicals given) will be different then what we are used to in the U.S. This in mind, with their sauces, it was still delicious! We enjoyed Kiyoka (the sushi not the best I ever had, but great for being in Mexico; the sashimi and other dishes, divine!) and were truly pleased by Mio, where our waiter had the chef put together a collective tasting plate from their entire menu based on our preferences! We had fun waiters throughout the week that put together tequila tastings, suggested cordials, and dessert plates. We were treated well! We enjoyed our drinks and they were made well or the bartenders were open to our modifications. We only used room service for chips and salsa and guacamole (yum!) because we heard it could be slower and we preferred the atmosphere of the restaurants. Again, service at all was exceptional! Beach: The beach is right within feet of the hotel; it is not surrounded by other resorts - nice for us! The sand and water was gorgeous and staff maintained them well. We never had to wake up early to secure spots in any of the lounge chairs or beach beds. You had excellent drink service all day, along with the staff to help us with towels. We did not mind the \"whales\" (sand bags) which created a nice inner beach area. Having traveled to Mexico before, I knew the ocean water usually only went up to your waist for quite a distance. Gorgeous! Nightlife: If you are looking for a late, crazy nightlife, this is not the place, which was fine by us. We did go up to Rick's Bar after a later dinner each night and didn't take the entertainment or DJ song picks too seriously. We enjoyed meeting the other great guests staying at El Dorado. Maybe it is the clientele they attract or just the contagiousness of the easy-going, pleasant attitude of the staff, but everyone was friendly and relaxed. On our 2nd to last night, the Hotel set up on the beach a beautiful Caribbean buffet. It was par to a wedding. The staff put such pride in the beautiful set-up, which began in the morning and went all day, and extensive buffet. Tables were beautifully set and there was an energetic, fire show. It was great to see the Hotel guests gathered together to enjoy this gorgeous night under the stars. Each morning, I ran north along the beach and felt completely safe with people running or walking or doing water activities. I was able to clock over 3 miles round trip, stopping before reaching the other resorts. Tipping: We were not sure how to go about this, but followed reviews and brought with us about $100 in $1 bills. Given how everyone went out of their way to take care of us way more than you would find in the States (where it is expected to tip for even mediocre service), we did not mind giving a few bucks after a day on the beach or when we left a bar or daily for housekeeping. Definitely at least $5 after dinner. Make sure you bring American cash with you! No ATM on site and there was none working in town. Spa: My friend and I did a massage over the ocean and it was excellent! Highly recommend you treat yourself! Activities: We heeded warnings about possible solicitation for activities and timeshares. Once on site, the gentleman, Luis, in the activities office introduced himself. Once we explained we were not interested in anything except staying on site and enjoying the beach, pool, and bar, we were never bothered and he remained friendly. We were not approached by any timeshare presentations. My husband arranged before our arrival a fishing excursion. The staff helped him and our friend secure a cab to the dock and back. Other than that, we did not leave the premises once on-site. Addressing complaints: Our only complaint was the inconsistency with the hot water in the tub and shower. However, after mentioning to Kenneth on staff, it was resolved immediately and we had plenty. We were located diagonal from construction and we never heard it while we slept or from our deck or room. I only smelled briefly a sulfur smell upon arrival to the front office and never again our whole trip. Using stairs did not bother us at all and our bags were always carried by staff. Because the El Dorado Mamora is surrounded by nature, you may find a critter or two -- an abundance? No. We found 2 bugs on our deck the whole time and our friends had one of those little lizards in their room. Before we left, our friend could not find his iPad. We feared the worse and that our vacation may be marred by it being stolen. Soon after talking to the front desk, management tracked it down to the 24 Bar and it was safely returned (too much rum to blame for leaving it behind there). Like you do anywhere, use the pushpad safes provided in your room. Overall, this was one of the most relaxing, peaceful vacations of my life. We lived it slow, soaked in the natural settings, enjoyed our beautiful room and the Hotel's amenities and learned how simple elegance mixed with a casual atmosphere and an accommodating staff can make for an amazing trip! We definitely hope to return!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWARNING: You will not want to leave this paradise!!!\u201d", "Author": "fun_in_the_sun94", "ReviewID": "UR125407198", "Content": "We stayed at El Dorado Maroma Feb 18-25 in a Mi Hotelito suite in building 2. We absolutely loved the small resort and our room location. We chose location over \"view.\" We had a room on the ground floor and could walk out our patio and had Bar 24 and the pool right there. We were also steps from the beach. We found the convenience far outweighted having a room up on the 4th floor in the other building. When we come back we will book a Mi Hotelito room again and not do an upgrade. Resort: We stayed at El Dorado Royale last year and loved it, but we would pick EDM again for next time. We loved having everything within a short walking distance and not having to wait for a ride to another part of the resort. The rooms & pools are all steps from the beach (lots of stairs however if you have a room up on the 4th floor). The grounds were immaculate and staff friendly. Check-in and out were easy and well explained. They do put a $375 hold on your credit card until you leave. Not a problem, it was removed as soon as we left. The marina next door was very convenient - we preferred having it next door instead of having to take a bus. The smell on the beach was there, but we only noticed it once or twice a day. When it was there, it was awful. It would be nice if they could do something about this. Room: Our Mi hotelio suite was the only room type that did not have an outdoor shower, but we didn't miss it. These rooms were all recently renovated and were decorated beautifully. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom had double-sinks and a walk in shower. What we loved most was our location and access to the pool & beach right out our patio door. Our patio also had a nice size table (where they set-up your room service) and a bed. The lighting in the bathroom was adequate, however the room itself was very dim. Agree with other reviews, update the safe please to have a keypad instead of a key. People: I have never experienced such wonderful hospitality. One of the benefits of such a small resort was that the staff got to you know you and where you were from. After day 1, we were called by our names from many of the staff. Our concierge, Ruth, took very good care of us. We caught fish deep sea fishing and she arranged to have it prepared for us (at no cost) at Sabores. Our favorite bartender was Emilio at Bar 24 who always took good care of us. Diego & Linda also provided outstanding beach/pool drink service. We never went thirsty. Luis from Lomas was very helpful in planning our deep sea fishing trip at the marina next door. Food & Drink: Compared to other all-inclusives the food here is fantastic. I wouldn't compare it to a nice restaurant in the US because you just can't. The only meal we didn't care for was the \"Meat the Butcher\" night at Papito's. The cuts of meat were very poor. We loved breakfast at Papito's and lunch at Sabores. Our favorite dinner was at the Italian place - Mio. We also ordered room service a few times. They are \"green\" and do not print any menus, but do display on your TV which was just fine. The room service was so fast - couldn't believe it always came in under 30 minutes. For drinks, we loved that they had brand name alcohol, maybe not what we would consider \"top shelf\" in the US, but better than a lot of other resorts. They had bacardi, absolute, sky vodka, captain morgan, crown royal, tanqueray to name a few. Also loved the 43 liquor on the rocks.

Our luggage was stored, and Jorge gave us a tour of the resort, stopping to introduce us to Emilio, the bartender at the 24 bar, who we got to know well.

I assured her we could wait, but she was determined not to have us unhappy with anything. After lunch she found us back on the beach to show us to our room.

Bottom line is this, each and every traveller will have a distinct and different experience. You will find a lot of negatives pointed out consistently through many of the reviews, they are all true. Management may very well overbook and not honor your reservation (and payment). Happened to us! Although we prepaid and reserved a swim up room, management lied stating they never received reservation and there must have been a mistake. Truth is this, they had complete and confirmed reservation received through Sabre, but they chose to overbook and then simply lied. Ultimately I received a complete refund for the night. The biggest problem with this part of the experience is the mgt made it very clear that not all guests are so called VIP's and treated the same. Mgt directly commented treatment is different based on how much a guest pays! No need to go into the gritty details, but if you really must know, ask me and I'll assure you you\"ll be shocked and disappointed. The food? Well, the consistent comments \" not gourmet\" is accurate. Yes, breakfast is very good with a lot of good choices and decent overall quality, but for the most part that's really about it. Anything else ranges from ok to very poor. The overall cut and quality of the meat, poultry and even seafood is really poor compared to decent restaurants elsewhere around the world, including the States. The so-called sushi is absolutely disgusting, couldn't even eat it. The Italian restaurant is at best ok, but truth is you'd get a better meal from a pre packaged Italian entre from Costco! Sad really. The themed Mexican restaurant had some okay dishes but then some not so okay dishes. There is no way in the world the food even marginally rates as gourmet. Where in the world is the fresh fish? The so called fresh fish lunch is a friggin joke. The fish was frozen and then just deep fried or prepared in some other funny way. But bottom line it was gross. I fish regularly in the ocean and eat a lot of fish, so hopefully you trust me on this. Selection of alcohol is very good. They do carry a lot of very good brands and \"labels\" but they can improve on actual bartending skills. I found both margaritas and mojitos well below \"great\" and would describe both of these particular drinks as poor. But who knows, you may like them. Not likely if you really enjoy a top shelf, well made cocktail though, more likely if you think margarita mix in a bottle is good. The multitude of comments regarding the sulphur smell are all true! YES, there is an issue with the sulphur and no, there's no mystery where it comes from. It comes from the continual \"dredging\" of the sand next to the makeshift marina. The funny looking berms sticking out of the water are there to protect the poorly constructed marina, nothing else. You'll likely see a worker regularly dredging sand with a hand pump from around the edges of the marina and then depositing sand directly in front of resort. Thus the sulphur odor and the shallow, stale water. The sand creates large \"mounds\" making swimming impossible. You can walk fifty feet out and be ankle deep! The staff does a good job raking the beach and keeping it pretty nice. As well as the activity joint next door to the north. Actually, they have much better sand on their beach. But......I suspect you will be disappointed with the visual impact of the berms and the sulphur odor. Walk either north or south and you\"ll find decent water. And other comments are 100% correct, this is not the resort referred to as having one of the top ten beaches. It's just in the general area is all, nothing more. The rooms? I thought they were very nice. Maybe an occasional glitch with quality control and finite cleanliness, but overall very nice. I found the beds very comfortable, a big plus in Mexico, and the decor nicely done. Yes, there were some details that needed attention, but overall I would think you'd be pleased. I will say this though, the cost of the place is high, so if I fairly compared to other resorts elsewhere, they would only get a \"c\". Just average. Average is not necessarily bad, it's just that, average!! Very, very disappointed with the pools. In the cooler winter months (aka peak season ) the water is too cold to comfortably swim in. The water is not heated and is simply put COLD. I had a very nice conversation with one of the vacation membership owners and he explained it has been an on-going problem for years. The place has tried different makeshift solutions but to no avail. Okay, how about this Maroma, hire a swimming pool contractor and install a Teledyne Laars heater! It's not a mystery, just spend the needed money and stop with the attempts at cheap solutions. Overall, sad....you pay for an expensive so-called swim up room, but it scares the hell out of you to get in the water!!! It was very cold!! The grounds of the resort are very nice, kudos to the groundskeepers as they do nice work. Tip though, don't use the gas blower next to the guests, wait until no one is there or maybe consider a rake. It was comical actually, watching the young guy use the machine, as he knew it was disturbing guests, but it also probably conflicted with his \"orders\". The resort is quiet. This is a good thing if you want a peaceful, relaxing romantic trip. If you're looking for Cancun, then go there, not here. At the end of our trip a large loud obnoxious party came in, and REALLY pissed off some guests, and staff. Of course, never saw management come and solve issue, only saw \"staff\" go up and try to say something. We're grateful this was the last two days and not at the beginning. Speaking of the staff. They are fantastic! I'm only referring to the folks who actually work, not the management. Jonas was absolutely amazing. What a great great guy and fantastic employee. As well as Diego and all the other beach staff. Just an great bunch of really happy, energetic and kind people! Really liked them all. They each went out of their way to please every guest. If you choose to leave the resort and go to town, be prepared to pay dearly for a taxi. Fifty bucks round trip as compared to four bucks (or less) that a \"local\" pays for their transportation. This is a common theme in Mexico (and elsewhere) but just seems to be a bit more pronounced in Mexico. But in my opinion, why pay for the resort if you intend on leaving it? Do you really need the trinket made in China that bad? A quick comment on \"tipping\". Contrary to the resorts advertisement that gratuities are included, it is simply not true. The staff expects to be tipped regularly and I know it does create a difference in service. I visited other inclusive resorts in other parts of the world, and it has always been handled differently, as in tipping is forbidden and if an employee takes a tip then they are terminated. I'm not at all opposed to gratuities, but they are just that. There is an expectation here and the management should really correct this. I witnessed some folks get caught up in uncomfortable situations because of this. They thought included but in reality not so. Read, read, read the other reviews. Bottom line, would I go back to this resort? No, I wouldn't. Would I recommend a close friend or family member go? No, I wouldn't. Would I discourage someone from going that has his or heart set already on going? No, I wouldn't. It was difficult to come up with the right \"star\" rating. I vacillated between below and average, but picked below based on my our personal experience. We paid an awful lot of money for this vacation and it simply did not measure up to our expectation, thus the two stars. It is a fair and accurate assessment based on our individual experience.

The hotel is adults only and is approximately a half hour south of the airport by car. The grounds, pools and beach are well maintained and exceptionally clean. We stayed in one of the MI Hotelito Beachfront suites. My understanding is these suites are the original structures and were recently renovated in the last year or two. Our room was tastefully furnished, the back patio opened next to Bar 24 with its pool, then a few steps to the beach. There is several other room choices with plunge pools or villas directly on the beach or with garden views these rooms are in buildings added to the resort over the last few years. The hotel staff is very professional, quick to say hello and are eager to please yet are not over bearing. The hotel assigns a personal concierge to you a nice touch. They will arrange spa treatments, reserve you a table for the themed dinning evenings and can help you with anything else. They also see if you are interested in joining the hotels vacation club, our concierge was very professional about this and was not pushy which I appreciated. The food was very good. I would rate breakfast and lunch best dinner second. There are four restaurants Kiyoko (dinner only) it is Asian inspired this was our favorite. Mio (dinner only) serves Italian, Sabores serves Mexican/Caribbean and Papitos offered pretty much anything else. Ask for the Green juice at breakfast it is really good! The only food criticism I offer is the wine selection. The house wines were not that good. The resort did offer other wines but it was extra, not cheap, and those selections were not that great. We were told by one of the waiters that management was changing the wine selection. That said we switched to tequila, ole! I would recommend some filed trips off of the resort. See Luis the Lomas Travel service representative who has an office just off the main reception area he was excelente. Trips are at an extra cost and can be charged to your room. We enjoyed the Camel Safari Brandon and Bernard are great tour guides. This took about 3hours was near by and fun. We also visited Tulum, a Mayan Village, Coba and snorkeling with turtles. This was an all day trip that was about 11 hours. The hotel offers free shuttle service into Playa Del Carmen on Wednesday and one other day, don\u2019t remember, it would be nice if they offered this more frequently. The hotel had an entertainment program with many activities but I noticed no one participating. We seemed to have a mature crowd the week we stayed who preferred to lounge, and take it easy. Next to the resort, but not part of it, is a marina that offers boat tours, parasailing, jet ski\u2019s etc\u2026 A note about the rotten smell mentioned by other reviews. I did notice it on occasion but it was not overbearing, consistent or a nuisance. Not sure if this has anything to do with the smell but the resort is surrounded by a mangrove swamp. We had no issues with mosquitoes. Overall this was a beautiful and quite resort that provided excellent service, good food and a very nice beach.

My only complaint was that the people staying above our room left their jacuzzi tub running and fell asleep (I'm assuming they were drunk), resulting in a flood. We were awoken at 12:30 a.m. with water dripping from the ceiling onto our pillows and my boyfriend's head, and discovered it was also flowing down the walls. The staff arrived within a 10 minutes of our call and after some assessment gave us a different room to sleep in for the night because our bed was directly under the leak. Unfortunately, the AC in the new room wasn't working, and between that and the commotion of having people come in to photograph the damage and us switching rooms in the middle of the night, neither of us really slept that night. Other than a brief apology during the move, we didn't receive much of an apology for the inconvenience - I thought more could have been done to make it right, given that we lost a night of sleep (and sleep is important when you're on vacation!) and a night in our room as a result of this. We aren't the types to complain or demand extras, but at least an apology the next morning from the management would have been in order.

In general the staff is very friendly and helpful, but we left the resort with a bad feeling because of the following: we brought some cash to the hotel, we couldn't lock it in our safe because we only got the key to the safe on day three of our stay. We didn't realise until after a few days that someome had taken money from our cash, only small amounts each day, but well worth it if you accumulate these amounts. We went to reception to inform the hotel about our suspicions. They initially seemed to take it seriously and investigated the case. Then on the day of our checkout we were told that they did not find any proof that one of their staff members had taken the money, basically they made us feel like idiots and told us to send a complaint to their customer services email address if we wanted.

I couldn't wait to write a review of this property! Our vacation was perfect! Transportation: We had a private shuttle from the airport arranged through Lomas Travel. We were instructed to walk directly through the airport, not to talk to anyone, and when we got outside to look for the men in turquoise shirts and white pants. There are many people in the airport that try to get you to talk to them, and offer transportation to your resort, but these people are just trying to scam you. So don't make eye contact! When we got outside, it was easy to find the Lomas people, and we were soon on our way! They do offer Corona for the ride at $5 for 2 bottles. Definitely a great way to start the vacation! Arrival: the trip from the airport is about 35 minutes. The worst part is the road from the highway to the resort. It is narrow and bumpy but I felt it just added to the feeling of getting away from it all! When we pulled up in front of the main lobby, we were immediately greeted by staff and ushered into a cool reception area. We were met by our concierge who checked us in quickly. We were taken on a quick tour of the property which did not take long, and before long we were shown our room. Accomodations: we stayed in a honeymoon suite which was on the 3rd floor. There were stairs to deal with, and no elevator, so if you have problems walking please request a ground floor room. Even though we had to walk up and down the stairs several times, the room was spectacular! It was spacious with a king bed, sitting area including table and 2 chairs (great for room service). The bathroom had a double sink, separate toilet area, jacuzzi tub, and shower. We also had an outside shower which we used frequently, The water pressure in the indoor shower was not fantastic, but the outdoor shower had good pressure. The room and bathroom was extremely clean and smelled wonderful. The A/C worked well and kept the room at a comfortable tempurature. We had a lovely balcony with table and chairs, a day bed with numerous pillows, and 2 lounge chairs. We had an amazing view of the pool and ocean, and at night we could see the twinkling lights of Cozumel. There are little lizards that like to hang out on the balcony at night, but as soon as you turn on the lights they quickly scatter, so no need to be afraid! We were next to Sabores so there was some noise from the kitchen in the evening, but everything went quiet after 10pm. Resort property: the grounds are lovely and very well-maintained. You definitely feel like you are in paradise. There are 2 pools that are beautiful, and we especially liked the one by Sabores. The resort is small and it only takes minutes to get anywhere by walking. No need for shuttles! It was wonderful! Food: Even though this is a small resort with a few restaurants, they presented a wide variety of food options. Breakfast is served at Sabores and Papito's. I ate at both places. Sabores offers an a la carte menu with several options. Eggs Benedict was good. Ask for the \"divorced-style\" eggs. I got a kick out of that dish especially since this is a resort that promotes romance! I ate breakfast mostly at Papito's because I liked sitting outside with a view of the beach and ocean. They offer buffet items and made-to-order omelettes. Fabulous. Also make sure you try the green juice. I don't know what is in it, but it made me feel healthier somehow. Lunch is served at Sabores and Papito's as well. We loved Papito's because every day was a different theme. They had a taco bar, hamburger bar, fish market (fresh fish, serving seafood that was literally caught that morning), paella, and Sunday is Prime Rib day! We never got bored! Papito's also serves a special water of the day, different every day. For dinner, you had a choice of Sabores, Kiyoko, and Mio. Kiyoko is asian. We ate there twice. They have choices of appetizers, sushi, main courses, and fried rice. I loved the summer roll which is like a vietnamese spring roll. The sushi was okay, but I eat a lot of sushi and I've had better. It is prepared before dinner service not when you order it, but it still was fresh. I fell in love with the Malay style yellow curry with chicken and had it both times I ate there. My husband had the tepanyaki meal with a sampling of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, salmon, and mahi mahi. For dessert, do not miss the spring rolls with bananas and nuts. Delicious. We felt like our best meal was at Mio, italian. Saltimbocca was tasty as was the gnocchi with pesto sauce. We never ate off the regular menu at Sabores. They do offer 3 special themed nights during the week, Mayan, Italian, and Mexican. We went to the Mayan and Italian nights and found our meals to be well prepared and tasty. Papito's also has \"Meet the Butcher\" nights which is basically steak heaven! I had an excellent prime rib, and my husband enjoyed his strip steak. Bars: there are 3 bars. There is a pool bar outside Sabores with a swim-up bar. There is also a swim-up bar along with patio seating at the 24 bar. Rick's Bar is open in the evening, and stays open until 2am. It is indoors. Every night they have different entertainment. We went to listen to a live band one night which was good. My favorite was the Mayan and Mexican show, with dancers performing several dances. One of the ladies pulled my husband up onto stage to dance, and I laughed hysterically! I thought the quality of the drinks were excellent. My husband discovered a new drink called an Iceberg. It is a tall glass of beer with a frozem margarita topper which apparently keeps your beer cold. I usually asked for the bartender to make me his specialty drink, and loved being surprised. They do make excellent mojitos and mango margaritas. Never any shortage of choices! Staff: simply amazing! I don't think we had a bad experience with anyone! Our concierge Adela was very helpful, and would come to find us on the beach or at the pool to see how we were doing. The housekeepers did an excellent job cleaning the room, and we especially loved the turndown service with chocolates. The wait staff learned our names quickly. Everywhere you go you are met with \"Hola!\" The beach staff kept your hand with a drink all afternoon! Beach: this beach was beautiful. The sand is soft and plentiful. The ocean water was comfortable and clear. It is shallow and you can walk all they way out to the sandbags. Yes there are sandbags. Some people have commented about the unsightly appearance, but they do serve a purpose and did not bother us. You can get snorkeling gear for free, but my husband actually bought us each a mask and snorkel in the gift shop for $50. Lomas Travel has a representative on location. Luis was amazing. We sat down to talk to him about various excursions. He asked us about our tastes and recommended 2 excursions. We went on an \"Ocean Sarfari\" next door at the marina, which consisted of wave runners and snorkeling. We snorkeled at 2 sites, including a cenote, which was beautiful. Our guide did an excellent job of pointing things out to us, even diving down to bring up a starfish for us to examine. I had a blast on the wave runner even though it began raining on the way back. The other excursion was to Rio Secreto which is a maze of underground caves and rivers. They provide a wetsuit, lifejacket, water shoes, helmet and light source. You are in a small group and led on a tour throughout this magical place. I will do a full review separately. This resort is small and intimate. It is not a wild party place, and it seems as if everyone was asleep by 10pm. It is a place to relax, be pampered, and eat well. My husband and I definitely felt like we reconnected with one another and rekindled the romance! We met a lot of friendly people from all over. Because of the small size, you run into your new friends everywhere! Special shout out to our new friends from Canada, Michelle and Dave. I miss having mojitos on the beach! I'd like to recognize some of the staff. Carlos at the 24 bar. Antonio at the Sabores pool bar. Diego and Linda on the beach. David at Kiyoko. Alfredo and Victor at Papito's. I'm forgetting a lot of others.

Not a wine snob or someone who takes 5 trips a year to resorts. Only advice i would give for this resort is save your money on getting the infinity pool rooms.97% of these rooms do not have functioning pumps. This leads to a stagnent body of water sitting on your deck which is perfect spot of mosquitos and all sorts of bugs to breed in. Maids due there best to keep it clean but within a couple hours its full again. It doesnt matter how much chlorine you put in these pools the bugs will come if water isnt moving through pumps. The resort as a whole is nothing short of perfect. The comments on the sewage smell are not as bad as it seems. We maybe would smell it 2 or 3 times a day in random spots and wouldnt last more than a second or two. Most times being on beach closer to the marina. No there isnt much to do at night. My girlfriend and I are in our mid 20's and it didnt bother us a bit as we were up daily at sunrise to get the most of the day so were in bed by 9 at the latest everynight anyway. And couldnt help but notice that we were one of the few at the resort that were tipping daily. We tip 20 peso a day to maid, 20 for breakfast and lunch and for every 2nd or 3rd trip the waiters made for us on beach or for bartender and 50 for dinners. Its hardly anything for us and I have to work really hard for my money so to see all these people who were far better off then us to not tip at all started to bug me. These guys hussle like crazy and will do anything you want so bring some spare pesos each day and tip. Wont hurt most of your pocket books. Ya, its all inclusive but that doesnt help the servers wages at all. Without a doubt a 5 star resort. Hopefully management brings in a snack menu for the beach and by pool and FIX THE INFINITY POOLS.

Not many people are willing to do many activities at this resort but for the few that he could get to interact he made it lots of fun. had some good laughs with him -Leydi( evening turndown and aromatherapy)- in our room alot in the evening getting room service so ran into her a few times. Enjoyed seeing her and interacting. she had a laugh that was contagious and was a highlight to each day. Dont understand why they wouldnt have a girl like her waitressing or working at front desk because she was great Cindy(host) and Mancal(server)- both great people with posotive attitudes. Everything from watching cindy bring butterfly to a nearby bush to watching Mancal run non stop all day and night long with a huge smile made us smile.

We stayed in a One-Bedroom Suite with a partial ocean view, and it was more spacious than we could have imagined (2 person max occupancy??? LOL). The one trick we learned quickly was to let the hot water run for a couple of minutes for the shower since it was explained that we (in Room 1101) were on the farthest extent of the system, but once you know that, then no problem. The food was fantastic, both in the restaurants (our favorite place without a doubt was Papitos) as well as room service, with plenty of beverage options to choose from.

There is no construction and no resorts near you, so it is peaceful! We read that the marina next door was noisy as well, again, not the case. I actually think it's nice having all the water sports one can possibly want a simple walking distance away! The beach was amazing! Yes, there was some seaweed sometimes on the beach, but considering where you are it is to be expected. It was not so much that it became disgusting. There was beach service for drinks, but it was a little lacking some days. There were days it was great, usually when Diego was working, but when he was not we often had to go to the pool bar for drinks ourselves. Really, not a big deal. We originally booked an infinity pool room, and were under the impression that it had an ocean view, it did not. We were a little disappointed by that, but talked to Caterina, I believe she was the room manager, and she happily upgraded us to a 4th floor honeymoon suite with a stunning view!! Our concierge, Carmina, was wonderful. She was very helpful and friendly. So was the Lomas travel rep, Louis. We did not find them pushy as others have stated. We asked about going over to Cozumel for the day and Louis mentioned the tour they have. When we told him that we just wanted to go on our own he helped us book our ferry tickets and cab without problems. I really liked that the staff took the time to know, and remember, our names. It was only the 2nd day there and they already knew us! We took advantage of the candlelight dinner on the beach and the massage huts on the beach. They are both expensive, but amazing and worth the experience. The entertainment was a little lacking here, but we came to relax and enjoy our time together, so entertainment was not a priority for us. If it is for you, you may find yourself bored. The fire show and Michael Jackson show were good. There were some staff that stood out to us in particular that made our trip that much more amazing, Carmina, Caterina, Diego (best beach server!), Carlos in Kiyoto and Phillipe at the front, every time we ran into him it was such a pleasure to! Before we even left we were trying to figure out when we can come back, it is an amazing resort worth every penny spent!", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Ellyn, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLaid Back & Quiet\u201d", "Author": "donnie57", "ReviewID": "UR124258784", "Content": "While staying at the El Dorado Royale at during the week of January 28th -Feb 3rd, I had the opportunity to spend a full day at its sister property the Maroma (courtesy vacattion club presentation).

Having the ability to order food from the after-hours menu was a plus when we were out sight-seeing and didn't get back until 11pm. The beach is nice and was never overly crowded, and you can take a walk up north about 500 yards or more and be away from most of the folks and have a slice of beach heaven all to yourself. All the fun activities were right there at the property next door - boat rides, dinner/sunset cruise, water craft, para-sailing - you can walk 50 yards to it all, while others have to be transported in. When you're there, you must take a trip into town (Playa del Carmen) for a day - very fun. I think the resort has a van that takes folks in free of charge every Wednesday - be sure to put that on your schedule. Perfect resort. Now, the information that you will want to know. Like everything nice, small, and quaint in Mexico's Riviera, things are changing... We were there in May of 2011 and El Dorado was partially completed with an expansion that would double the size of the rooms/property, and they were going to remove the less-expensive small two-story rooms from the property - no more small, quaint vacation stay - additionally, they were pushing hard to turn the additional rooms into time-shares. Also, no more open beaches and long walks on deserted beaches - they are building large resorts one after another next to El Dorado Maroma. So, it was one of the best places to stay for a small, secluded getaway, but all that will change probably by the time you read this. You may want to do some research on the area and talk to them if you are still expecting a small, secluded, 70+ people resort - that will not be the case shortly.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cParadise Found, Again and Again\u201d", "Author": "Ellen L", "ReviewID": "UR124178008", "Content": "We are about to take our sixth trip to this idyllic small resort.

This was our second visit to this property. Let me start with the things we truly enjoyed both times we were there. If you want to know the negatives, skip to the bottom. It is a beautiful place with gorgeous rooms. We have stayed in an ocean view room on the third floor, and a swim up suite next to the main pool. The swim up suite was superior largely due to not having to climb three flights of stairs. Overall, the level of service is excellent. All guests are treated with kindness. We appreciated the personal touches and over the top attention. I must admit, my husband was more eager to return a second time. He now agrees that two visits probably exceeded our desire for the type of vacation we desire. Here are the reasons why. First, we did not appreciate, especially on a second stay being questioned about the type of package we had booked and ultimately were refused services that were a part of the package. In addition, our personal concierge suddenly became invisible when we declined a tour to promote ownership. Very disappointing. The food this time was not as good. The \"Asian\" restaurant was subpar. The attempts at \"Italian\" food were acceptable but definitely not authentic or excellent in any way. The Mexican dishes were good. We would not recommend the tours offered. Tulum could have been enjoyable and informative but was neither because of the Lomas representative. They are aggressive and eager to promote them....with the agent going so far as to tell us that booking a tour would really help his family. The beach was constantly cluttered with seaweed and smelled. Certain areas of the resort also have a terrible odor. We couldn't explain why but it was very unpleasant. El Dorado Maroma is very secluded. For some, this is perfect... but if you want to do anything on your own, off the resort, it is a chore.

Overall this hotel is fine to stay. I believe from other reviews one can see lots of good things about this hotel. Since previously we stayed 6 nights in Secrets Maroma Beach Resort, my review will focus on the comparison between these two. We got upgraded from Honeymoon Suite to Infinity Pool Jacuzzi Suite because it was our honeymoon. Thanks to the courtesy from the management. The room is very spacious, bed is comfy, and the pillows have variety to choose, softer or harder. The room has both indoor and outdoor shower, which is fancy. There are few restaurants to choose. We picked the Asian food for our dinner and the quality was good. The breakfast was served in only one restaurant and the quality was nice too. However, you'll have to line up for some time to get a customized omelette. Wifi will be charged for $15/day but the signal is strong and fast. The staff was nice and polite and very considerate. Now, speaking of the downsides. The room doesn't have doorbell, or the staff just prefer to knock the door. After we checked in during the first 3 hours there were 4 groups of staff knocking our door and I had to get up and answer the door while resting. This was kinda annoying. The management didn't cascade the info to the staff that we just moved in. So the staff just followed their routine to knock everyone's door and asked if needs to change towels, refill minibar, etc. Besides, there's no option to make it \"No Disturb\" at the door. So there wasn't option for us not to answer the door. The jacuzzi was big, but the weephole was somehow broken and couldn't seal properly. Therefore, we couldn't use the jacuzzi. The indoor shower was spacious but the water pressure was weak, and the floor couldn't drain the water fast enough so you would have to stand in the water while showering. We didn't get to try the outdoor one so maybe that would be better. There's a private pool facing outside with a good view at our patio. There are also daybed and chairs ready for you to lie down and relax. However, there were tons of dead mosquitoes on the daybed and in the pool. I guess the hotel forgot to clean it. Therefore, we didn't want to try the bed or the pool at all. The room service menu is on the TV channel, not in a booklet, which is not easy to read and find the things you need. Besides, the options are not too many so we didn't find anything we liked. The beach doesn't have a super amazing view but was just ok due to the artificial reefs the hotel put in the ocean. Sand wasn't very white and kinda hard comparing to Secrets'. Water didn't seem very clear or blue at the beachfront. Again, overall the hotel is fine if you are comfortable with staying by the pool or your own room. It is a little cheaper anyway. However, by trying both hotel we think if we came back to the area we would probably pick Secrets Maroma rather than El Dorado Maroma due to the reasons mentioned above.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lubbock, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay with family\u201d", "Author": "wdsj", "ReviewID": "UR123707025", "Content": "My wife and I traveled with our three kids 21, 19 & 16.

This resort is about 35 minute ride from the airport. Once you turn into the resort, there is about a 2 mile (but 10 minute) ride along a very windy road to get to the lobby/resort. There is nothing over-the-top or grand about the decor or overall look of the resort. But, it has a VERY intimate feel with a lot of palm trees, beautiful landscaping, and flowers. When we arrived, the hotel was at 45% occupancy. Since there are only around 90 rooms, there weren't alot of people there. I wondered if this was going to be TOO quiet for me. However, I absolutely loved this place!!! The service was unbelievable - you rarely had to ask for anything, they anticipated most of your needs. Waiters came around contantly to see if you needed another drink by the pool. Diego was one of those waiters and was so genuinely friendly to everyone. He knew our names right away. You never felt worried to find or \"save\" a spot by the pool or the beach - there were always chairs and beds available. The chairs by the pool have heavy cushions on them and they also have very soft towel-like covers which made them extremely comfy. The beach was really pretty. Yes, there are sandbags out in the water. Obviously, it would be prettier without them but they are protecting their beach and didn't bother me. We ate breakfast and lunch at the restaurant by the beach and it was fabulous! Our best meals were here. They were buffet style, which normally turns me off - I'm usually not a fan of buffets. However, they were great! Breakfast consisted of homemade omelettes made to order, plenty of fresh fruits, yogurts, granolas, cereals, breads, and each day they had a variety of hot dishes such as french toast, hashbrowns, sausage, etc. They offered a green juice in the mornings that was REALLY good - ask for it! (I am not a huge fan of drinks like this normally). Lunches were different everyday and they had their menu on a decorative chalkboard above their grill. It was all very fresh and consisted of a great variety - paella, fresh fish, prime rib, bbq, steak, etc. They also had a different drink of the day (nonalchoholic) for lunch everyday. They were all fun to try, and very good. I am on a gluten-free diet and one of the first questions the concierge asked me was if I had a specific diet. I told her I am gluten-free, but I never thought they'd do anything about it (and I didn't expect them to). The concierge immediately emailed all the cooks so they would know. That is the kind of service you receive at this resort. Dinners were also good (a la carte) but we preferred lunches and breakfast. I personally would prefer a more straight forward dinner menu.......I think most people have no clue what is on the menu since it is quite fancy. From what I could tell, most people didn't know what to order based on the wording on the menus. We stayed in a Hotelito rooms which was very nice - it had a large balcony with table and chairs and a bed. There were new AC units in the rooms and our rooms was always cool. As I said, the beach was pretty. We tried walking both directions, but you can't get very far to the South. You can go for a very long walk to the North, it is really pretty walk and alot of it is undeveloped. The marina is next door, and it was really pretty to see all the sailboats out in the water. They offer a free shuttle into Playa Del Carmen twice a week. We ended up not taking this only because we didn't want to go when it was offered, but we still thought this was a nice extra. (Taxi to Playa is $20-$25 U.S. each way). There are different activities going on each day. We played beach volleyball, and also went to the magic show, which actually was pretty good, and funny! Just for some background, my husband and I have been to Rivera Maya and Cancun about 10 times. We have stayed at Secrets Maroma (great), Secrets Capri (good), Iberostar Grand (great), and a few other places. While these other places were also good/great, I have to say that the service at this resort was the BEST that we have had.

We often received drinks delivered directly to our room if we were lounging on our patio. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was nice to have a sitting area in the room to relax prior to dinner. There was plenty of storage space, a double sink vanity, Jacuzzi tub, indoor and outdoor shower, king sized bed, desk and a table for 2 to enjoy room service. The outdoor patio was huge with a double day bed, a table and 2 chairs and 2 loungers to sit right in the pool. The resort was beautiful with manicured gardens that were constantly being tended to. One of the beautiful aspects of this resort is that no matter how full it is, it never feels busy or crowded. There is always room on the beach, by the pool(s), and in the restaurants (quite often at dinner it was us and 1 other couple in the entire place). If you are looking for peace and quiet, you will find it here. The beach is gorgeous \u2013 the best I\u2019ve seen in the Mayan Riviera. It has powder white sand and clear blue water that is shallow enough to wade far out in. You can walk a long distance past the marina until you hit the next resort. I\u2019d be remiss to sing the praises of El Dorado Maroma without mentioning the best aspect the resort offers \u2013 the staff. From the moment you arrive the staff will learn your name and remember it for the rest of your stay. They are friendly, over accommodating and genuinely interested in making your trip wonderful. At the end of the stay we filled out a survey and it asked if any staff made our trip special \u2013 we had a long list. You never go long without a drink on the beach or by the pool (Luis, Linda and Diego are always coming by to offer another). Renee at the swim up bar was fantastic \u2013 such a genuinely nice man. The wait staff at all of the restaurants are fantastic. If there is something not on the menu you\u2019d like, just ask \u2013 they will do their best to make it happen. An example of the service you receive: one morning we headed to the beach to enjoy the sun and were greeted by a staff member who grabbed 2 towels and asked us where we\u2019d like to sit. After deciding on a spot, he laid the towels out for us and tucked them into the chair so they would not blow away in the wind. Another day, we decided we would make it an early night and enjoy room service dinner. The waiter, Jonas, heard us and offered to make a special dinner for my husband. He asked what time we wanted it and it showed up right on time as requested. It was one of the best meals we had there. While tipping is not required, it is certainly appreciated and I was happy to tip the waiters, housecleaning, bartenders and staff to thank them for a job well done. We did have a massage on the beach which was very relaxing and wonderful \u2013 you are soothed by the lapping waves and the sea breeze \u2013 remarkable. The food is top quality and it\u2019s nice to have a la carte dining without needing to make reservations. Breakfast and lunch are wonderful. I\u2019d agree with some of the other reviews that the dinners tend to be not as great \u2013 but still good. Our favorite dinner spot was Kiyoko \u2013 they make a very refreshing iced green tea and the food is excellent. The specialty dinners that your reserve for in advance were not bad. The only \u201cmiss\u201d was the dinner around the world which was very poor quality and several guests apparently complained to their concierge about it the next day. We did share with the hotel that we felt the house wine could be of better quality. We did pay to order a few bottles of wine during our stay but when you offer top shelf alcohol for everything else (scotch, vodka, tequila, etc.), the wine should be decent as well. There was snorkelling right off the beach by the sand barriers. My husband saw a star fish, manta ray, angel fish and lots of other smaller and colorful fish. We didn\u2019t partake in any tours but did do the sunset catamaran cruise which was very nice. We did get to see one of the new one bedroom suites which were very nice. Large suites with tons of room and your own pool. The only minus is that the view is just of the gardens rather than the ocean. The beachfront suites look amazing but were quite pricey when we initially inquired about them. To summarize, this was definitely our favorite El Dorado Hotel and the Karisma chain is one I will return to often. The staff has mastered the art of hospitality and you will leave with the desire to return again soon.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201cVERY ENJOYABLE HOLIDAY\u201d", "Author": "dentalmike", "ReviewID": "UR123398495", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel from the 26th December 2011 to 9th January 2012. The room we had was in block 7 on the first floor, when we walked in it had the wow factor. There was absolutely nothing about the room not to like it was always kept very clean, the toiletries always stocked, so no complaints there. We had a slight issue with our infinity pool, spoke to Victor and within minutes it was sorted. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, you ask, you get. The only issue we had was with the food. If you are here for one week no problem, but coming from England we have no choice but to stay a fortnight, so it is the same menu every week. Again, we spoke to Victor and voiced our opinion about having to have the same food again for the second week. Again you ask, you get he even brought the chef to us on the beach and we were told we could have whatever we wanted. That evening we were given V.I.P. treatment the food was wonderful. We were always told if we wanted anything different just ask!!!!!! What more could you ask for. The service from everyone was fantastic. We wanted a fortnight of just relaxing, lots of good food and lots of drink. They had every top shelf drink you could think of, when we asked for vodka and coke, we were asked what vodka??????? You have a choice of what make and then what flavour, so whoever said the drinks are not top shelf is talking rubbish. We even managed to get our favourite liquor which is \"43\" we can't even buy it at home very easily, so to come here and find it well that was fantastic. The beach service, we had DIEGO, we read in a review before we went on holiday that you are bothered all the time on the beach, how wrong that person is. If you don't want a drink for an hour, just put your order in for an hours time and they will be there on the hour, which we were amazed by especially with the amount of people they area dealing with. Diego was such a lovely person, he remembered our names within a day and it was nice to be on first name terms. You get food brought to you on the beach, cold towels to cool you down and your towels are taken to your sunbed and laid down for you, again what more could you want. We went on a few trips which we booked with Luis who is based on site who works for Lomas. He works extremely hard and very very long hours. If you plan on doing any trips make sure you go through Luis, again he goes above and beyond his duties. He is so friendly and helpful, a few times we had a couple of concerns mentioned it to Luis and he got it sorted and it wasn't even his job to sort them. During the day at the Bar 24 you have Amelio 'Luvly Jubbly' again a very helpful and friendly person. During the evening Carlos, whatever you asked him for he managed to get for you. He was a perfect gentleman. We always had our breakfast and lunch at Papetos so we could look out on to the beach. Jeremy was our waiter, again so helpful. We ate mostly in the evening at the Italian and Japanese, never went to the Mexican as we didn't like what was on the menu, the Italian was our favourite, lovely food. Just one thing to get this first class service, you do not have to tip, you get it no matter what. The whole place is spotlessly clean and being cleaned all day every day. We had a really good New Year with the meal, the gambling on the beach, the show, they really tried hard. We started the new year differently which is what we wanted!!!!!!!! We would definitely go back and i envy those who are going this year.

We told her that this was also going to serve as our 10th anniversary trip. She smiled and reviewed her list of available rooms. She asked if we'd like a quick tour of the property and lunch while she worked to secure us a room. We agreed. An hour or so later, a bellman found us on the beach and asked if we liked surprises. We said that we like some surprises - the good kind. He smiled and asked us to follow him. He escorted us to a two story 2000 square foot plus beach front bungalow - indoor and outdoor shower, our own pool, kitchen, full sized refrigerator, dining room, outdoor dining area, our own beach bed and chairs, on and on. We were thrilled!!! The dining options are very good - the service is a little on the slow side, but what's the hurry - you're in paradise. The chefs do take great care to create unique dishes with lots of flavor - great steaks, fish, and Carribean lobster. The mixed grill fajitas at lunch are phenomenal. Diego came by every half our to provide fresh drinks at our bungalow, We ordered room service for breakfast once, and several times at lunch. Each time it was quick and professionally served. The nighlife is of course limited because this is such a small resort, but the bartenders and entertainment coordinators are extremely friendly. We enjoyed a really fun casino night on New Year's but unfortunately, the fireworks got out of hand on a windy night and set fire to an adjacent restaurant. I'm sure someone else has commented on that. The resort had the are entirely fenced in and started the rebuilding process within a day and a half. I would bet that it's nearly complete now. Overall - this resort is small, but uncrowded, with great dining, and phenomenal accomodations. The restaurant service is on the slow side, but I wouldn't let that deter you from discovering the great beach and relaxed atmosphere.

Very secluded, quite and with a top notch staff prividing excellent service. If you have concerns about the quality of food and beverages at this all enclusive put them to rest. The best food I have had at an all inclusive and the selection of liquor is very good. No single mal scotches or Grey Goose vodka, but if Chivas, Johnny Black and Stoly will do you then you are set. The 3 restaurants (Mexican with several themed nights, Italian and Asian) available for dinner were excellent. I had a chicken dish with huitlacoche (a delicious corn fungus) that was top shelf. The Yellow Tail sashimi was fresh and delicious at the asian restaurant. The portions at dinner are presented beautifully although the portions are probably smaller that you might expect. However if you are eating breakfast (always an interesting mix of items and you can always have a custom made egg dish cooked for you) and lunch you'll be glad that the dinner portions are somewhat smaller and you won't feel like you need to wear that t-shirt to the beach the following day. Try a deep tissue massage in the Palapa on the beach, the staff is excellent and will work on specific areas that you direct them to. Also the service staff is great, they'll take car of you while on the beach, at one of the 3 pools or at the restaurants. Suggestion - bring some ones and fives to tip with. No need at the restaurants (unless you feel compelled by over the top service) but it's nice to have for the wait staff bringing you drinks on the beach or at the pool. Use the fives for the transport drivers or if you take the free shuttle into Playa Del Carmen. Internet service is $15 a day per device. If you're coming here to relax leave the computer at home, they have a couple of computers set up in the lobby if you really need to send an e-mail or check a website (not sure of the cost if there is one). Bring: iPod - there's a radio with an iPod dock so you can play tunes in your room. DVDs - each room has a DVD player to go along with the 42\" flat screen in the room and the cable selections are a bit limited so a movie or two from home won't take up much room in your luggage and could provide a nice escape after drinner.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mauritius", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at El Dorado Maroma\u201d", "Author": "sunloverMauritius", "ReviewID": "UR123294260", "Content": "This year we decided to take our four weeks break around Christmas/New Year and return to Mexico's Riviera Maya which we last visited in 2006.This time( from 19th Dec. until 16 January 2012) we stayed at the relatively small boutique resort El Dorado Maroma with just under 100 rooms in various categories.

This is definitely not a place for singles, persons with disabilities or seniors who may have to climb several stairs to get to their room. The resort is very isolated and small. The meals are repetitive and very short on choice. The beach is beautiful and clean and the staff are superb. There are always enough deck chairs available at the beach and small pool. The bar staff is very friendly and want to please you by making your favourite drink. The shop is very expensive, so are the water activities and the spa. There are free daily activities, but they are not well attended nor interesting plus, they are the same every day. The nightly show, in the very small bar, is loud and one hour long, with most of it being a recorded tape playing on a white screen. I would recommend the Michael Jackson show, but the others are sub-standard with the cast wearing torn and mis-fitting costumes. The resort seems to roll up its walkways at about sunset which, when I was there, was 4:30 pm. Really, the only thing to do there is sleep, eat at restaurant designated times, and sunbathe in the 30+C sun (which I could only stand for a maximum 20 minutes per day). There are books available for you to read and I noticed a good variation of titles and authors. I booked a trip to the Mayan ruins, but it was cancelled just 30 minutes before I was to meet the bus. I had some trouble at check-out having the cost reversed. There is a free trip to the shops every Wednesday & Sunday which is 5 hours in length. The stores are open air, so be careful of sunburn and heat stroke. My facial at the spa was a rip off and, in my opinion, not a real facial. The staff member got lotion in my eyes and it took quite a long time for her to reduce the burn affect. She had no eye wash available. Upon checkout, there was a 10% service fee added without my knowledge. My initial room was beach front. In the past, any beach front room I have reserved has been literally beach front. This room was fronted by the evening bar and walkways, and backed onto the pool bar, seating area and very small pool. The beach was visible if I squinted through all that and the trees. I had to upgrade for a bigger and quieter room, which cost me an additional $400 US. I had to climb 52 steps to get to my new room. I was offered for $10 to apply to my upgrade and one spa treatment. Neither were applied to my total bill. I took part in para-sailing. I had to wait half an hour, at the beach bar, for others being bused in from other hotels. Even though the bar is on the hotel property, it was a cash bar. The description stated a maximum of 8 per boat, ours was 9. You get approx. 12 minutes in the air and then watch the others take their turn. I enjoyed the activity, but feel it was too expensive and I didn't like the crew asking for tips as we left the boat. I always tip while away from home but noticed that no-one tipped the staff while I was at this resort. The cost of an internet connection is extortionate, but when there is nothing to do, you are forced to pay it. You have to supply your own computer.

Overall, it is a very nice resort but there were a few surprises that I'd like to share. I will preface this by saying that I do have expensive and good taste so if you are okay with mediocrity, you will be on top of the world with this resort. The two best things about the resort were the rooms (fabulous!) and the service (excellent!). We stayed on the fifth floor in a Honeymoon Suite and I HIGHLY recommend this option. There was a bed on the balcony with total privacy and an outdoor shower...absolutely fantastic. The people on the resort bent over backwards to make sure that you are happy, they know you by name (or at least try) and they are always smiling. So kudos to the management team for hiring such an awesome team and breeding that type of culture in the staff. The beach is beautiful...really beautiful. Surprises: 1. The liqour is not top shelf - Absolute was the best vodka there. 2. They will not \"deliver\" alcoholic drinks to your room nor is there any liqour in the room. How about that evening cocktail on the balcony? It would have been very nice to have it in the room and not have to go ask the bartender for 2 drinks and one without ice each night... I had that at the Iberostar Grand...I would have expected the same here. 3. The house wine choices are horrid - really - and I am not a wine snob. I drink Fetzer as my table wine. I couldn't find any that were worth drinking and ended up having to buy one of the more \"reasonably\" priced bottles of wine at $56! I was not happy. 4. Lunches and breakfasts were wonderful. Dinners were not. There are only 3 restaurants here so choices are limited from that standpoint as well as the menu. There was only one dinner out of 6 that I kind of enjoyed...in the Italian restaurant. The New Years' Eve dinner was terrible...mushy lobster. If I were running a resort in Mexico right now, I would be recruiting new graduates from culinary institutes in the US. I believe most of the clientele is from the US and we expect better cuisine. At least one more notch above... 5. We were there when the fire broke out next door...New Years' Eve. We were asleep in the room and no one came to knock on the door...the alarms (which was hardly an alarm) could not be heard from our room. It was a scary thought but luckily for everyone...and amazingly, no one was hurt. Management, you really need to get your act together to plan for emergencies. 6. I had difficulties getting on the internet during the first day of our stay. I called the concierge...she provided a temporary solution. When I checked out, I had over $100 worth of internet charges to the room because I kept trying to connect.. I explained this to the staff and after 30 minutes of them \"calling to find out what happened\", we had to leave so that we would not miss our flight and I left extremely upset about this. I tried to sign up for a 3 day, $36 pass and ended up with 3 of them because of the problems. No one seemed to care...the concierge I had spoken to about the problems was \"off\" for the day, and they had no solution for me.

The room we stayed in was appointed with modern amenities ( Ipod docking station, indoor and outdoor shower, mini-fridge, our own pool). The bathroom was also modern and clean, and I love when the closet lights come on when you open the door. Nice little touch. Because of our package, we also recieved champagne and a fruit plate in our room upon arrival. For the most part the breakfast and lunch staff is accomodating and friendly. As far as \"all-inclusives\" go, breakfast and lunch were good and they had a nice selection of options. Dinner is where things become a problem. Where I'm giving the resort overall a \"Very Good\", I'm giving dinner a \"Very Bad\". They try too hard to be \"fancy\" with dinner when they should just stick to good flavors and good service. The meals are \"artfully\" arranged on the plate and are meant to look high-end gourment. When in fact the flavors are \"off\" or bland, and the service was slow. Our best dinner meal by far was when we left the resort to eat at an Uruguayan place in Puerto Morelos. Dinner aside, they offer a nice variety of activities, and we had a lot of fun fishing and playing beach volleyball.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPiu' di un miglio di spiaggia bianca morbida, con un mare verde e cristallino!\u201d", "Author": "Beatrice G", "ReviewID": "UR122736927", "Content": "Il resort e' meraviglioso!

We stayed in the Honeymoon suite it was spacious with a breathtaking view of the ocean. We loved the bed on the terrace and the outside shower option. The bed in the suite was also very comfortable. The restaurants were great, our favorite was the Mexican, Andreas was very friendly, polite, helpful and made sure to ask if we needed anything else at the end of dinner. There were many choices on the various menus to satisfy any palate. The green juice in the morning was refreshing after our morning runs on the beach.

He went out of his way to make sure we were happy and had anything and everything we requested. As always Carmina made every request or dream come true. Every trip she has surpassed all expectations. The previous reviews rave about the property and they are all accurate as EDM is gorgeous. But we got a new view this trip which was nothing short of spectacular.

The beach: -The beach is absolutely gorgeous. Soft white sand, crystal clear water. The man-made buffers made it possible to swim, float, and wade in the water without any rough surf. -We never had trouble snagging a beach bed to spend the day lounging on. We always chose one way off to the side so that we could have privacy, read, and relax. -The beach service was incredible - we never had to go to the bar for a fresh drink. The waiters would always cheerfully find us, remember our names and drinks, and pop off to the bar to get something for us. This was so nice! The room: -We stayed in the seemingly newly renovated Mi Hotelito block on the second floor. The room was large and cheerfully decorated. There was a small fridge always well-stocked with water and beer, a flat screen tv w/ HBO, a very comfy king sized bed, huge vaulted ceilings, and ample closet space with a safe for our passports, etc. The bathroom was very large, updated, and had a shower big enough for two. -The balcony was big with a table and two chairs and a full size outdoor bed for lounging. The balcony looked out over one of the pools and a small bar. The restaurants: -The food was great! We always loved breakfast - especially the made-to-order eggs and omeletts at the beachside restaurant. -We almost always did lunch at Sabores which is right by the pool and did Mexican food, salads, and sandwiches. We'd gorge ourselves on chips and guac before starting in on delicious fajitas! -Dinners were our least favorite. You can tell they try really, really hard to make it special so I feel bad saying anything negative but nothing really \"wowed\" us. -The Mayan night, Mexican night, and Italian night were all super fun though and the meals very tasty. We particularly liked Mayan night - and everyone should check them out! -The bars were always quiet but the drinks were quite strong and used good quality liquor which we appreciated! It meant no nasty headaches in the morning. The service: -Oh my GOSH we felt like we were treated like kings at the resort!!! The people who work here could not be any more accommodating, kind, or friendly! They were all incredible. If you needed anything at all they would bend over backwards to make it happen for you. -Special thanks to Luis, Diego, and Linda for cheerfully teaching us a bit of Spanish while keeping our cocktails coming! -Also huge thanks to Ophelie and Aurelie (sp?) for giving us such incredible massages and being so amazing at it. -I wish I remembered more names, but really, everyone who worked there had a huge smile on their face and seemed genuinely pleased to see you and help you. (This was particularly sweet on Christmas when I know everyone would rather have been with their families at home than serving us food/drinks!) -Luis at the Lomas desk was wonderful and the female manager (Catarina?) was just a sweetheart who you could tell worked really hard to make everything perfect. -They also added nice little touches like a holiday display made out of chocolate left in our room on xmas eve, desserts and champagne in our room, etc. So special and so kind. Overall, this resort is perfect if you're into quiet, relaxation, and friendly service. The nightlife is pretty nonexistent (the shows in the evening are hit-or-miss and generally done by 10:30pm) so don't expect it to be a \"spring break\" type of place. What makes it so special is its boutique size, beautiful beach, and impeccable service. I'd go back with girlfriends or my husband in a heartbeat. We'd never felt so pampered. However, there are a few small things that I think that could make the whole stay just a tiny bit better... 1) It was chilly in the evenings and would have loved to been able to sit in a jacuzzi outside with a drink. There weren't any at the resort - they should put one in! 2) We brought about $150-200 to tip the staff with over our stay. When we were close to running out a couple days before we left, we asked staff for an atm. There was none. The only way to get money would have been to run into Playa Del Carmen and find one there which would mean paying for the taxi ($25 each way and we'd miss our beach time!) so we tried to make do with what was left. We felt like huge jerks not tipping when we ran out of $ and had to choose between tipping the maids at the end of the stay or tipping our fabulous Lomas shuttle driver who took us to the airport. It was uncomfortable for us not to tip and we felt awful about it because everyone was so nice. The staff never acted as though they expected tips but they absolutely 100% deserve them. So if you go - bring TONS of $1s and $5s for tips. Even better - EDM should have a way for guests to access cash. 3) It was our honeymoon but other than a bottle of champagne at the onset of our trip, we didn't get anything special. No free massages or candlelight dinner. No free upgrade to a better room. Would have been nice to get some perks because you only get one honeymoon and we'd been saving for this trip for a year. 4) The Mi Hotelito rooms, because of their proximity to the bar and pool, could get loud in the mornings and evenings. We didn't have any problem until the last few days when people started parking themselves below our balcony at 8am to have their coffee and yell back and forth to each other. Then this repeated in the late evenings with their cocktails. We like to sleep with fresh air and use the screened door instead of A/C but the noise level made this impossible. Overall, this resort is 95% perfection and you won't regret going at all!

Our room was gorgeous, although the ocean view was blocked by palm trees. The palms did offer privacy, however, while we lounged in our own private infinity pool. The most difficult decision my husband and I had to make was whether to lounge on the beach or by the pool. A peek at the beach in Playa Del Carmen while on a shopping trip only served to reinforce how wonderful the beach was at El Dorado Maroma. It was never crowded and always had lounging chairs and beach beds available. The same went for the pools. Plus, nothing beats beach and pool butler service! I also highly recommend getting a spa treatment or two, especially the couples beach massage. The food was amazing! This resort has ruined all other all-inclusives for us. The Gourmet Inclusive concept is a winner, for sure. The food was so amazing, we had a hard time believing we were at an all-inclusive. But....the best part of all..... the staff! Now, with all this said, I feel I should offer a warning about one unfortunate experience my husband and I had during our very relaxing, very indulgent, very wonderful vacation. The concierge will offer you a $100 voucher to attend a Loyalty Program presentation. I don't know what my husband and I were thinking when we agreed. The more than 60-minute long sales pitch (taking away precious suntan time) to join the Exotic Travellers program for more than $10,000 left us feeling very uncomfortable. We paid for this vacation; it's not as if we received a free trip to one of those time-shares where we would expect to be solicited. The whole thing was very pushy and I feel a bit angry even thinking about it now. My husband and I both agree that we would go back to El Dorado Maroma and we would recommend it to friends, but with this warning to AVOID the Exotic Travellers presentation!!!

We spend our entire day on the beach; literally dawn to dusk, so we decided to try something different and stayed in Mi Hotelito instead of a swim-up. We are so glad we did! I will discuss the accommodations and restaurants first: The Mi Hotelito rooms have all been remodeled recently; I think we were the second guest to stay in our room. We were in #105 on the ground floor, looking out on the \u201c24\u201d pool & bar. The room was beautiful, with a totally remodeled bathroom complete with glass doors on the shower & toilet area, as well as dual vessel sinks, beautiful marble everywhere, etc. There is however, no bathtub in these rooms. The main portion was tastefully decorated with lots of turquoise, yellow, & orange throughout. Flat screen TV w/remote, DVR, a mini-fridge well stocked with water, sodas, and most importantly, cervezas! Not all will agree, but I really like their super-firm mattresses. On our private terrace there was a small table w/ two chairs and a full size bed, all protected by sheer floor-to-ceiling curtains that swayed gently in the ocean breezes. I had to do some work during this trip, so I spent about an hour on our terrace each morning with a pot of coffee and a plate of dulces (sweet rolls). There are 4 restaurants on the property: Papitos is casual, open-air, & located directly on the beach. This is an \u201copen kitchen\u201d concept, serving delicious breakfasts and lunches. Rafael makes a fantastic omelet to order, or will whip up another type of egg dish if you prefer. There is also an abundance of fruits, cheeses, cereals, and granolas, as well a fresh assortment of breads and sweets. The lunch offerings at Papitos rotate on a daily basis, with Prime Rib on Sundays, Tacos on Tuesday (these are traditional, fresh offerings!), Paella on ???? The days are running together now, but you get the idea. Sabores is open for breakfast, lunch, and usually dinner. This is a little nicer restaurant, with white tablecloths and lots of glass and chrome. They also have an outdoor seating area by the pool where we usually ate. Try their fajitas and quesadillas! The Italian restaurant serves dinner only and is called ????? Regardless, we thought the food was tasty, and service by Vitale was outstanding! Ask for his section; you will not be disappointed. When my wife could not decide on a drink choice, he prepared his \u201cspecial\u201d drink for her- a delicious margarita with a splash of Amaretto. He also works at Sabores sometimes, so be sure to look for him. In addition, Gaby at Sabores is an excellent server. She will always make you happy with her big, beautiful smile and loving, outgoing personality! Next door to the Italian restaurant is Kiyoko, the Asian-themed restaurant. Not one of our favorites but that is strictly due to our personal preference; when we did eat there, the food was delicious! Kiyoko is also only open for dinner. Of the three bars, \u201c24\u201d was our favorite, and not only because of the proximity to our room ;) . This bar is usually manned by Carlos (evenings) or Antonio (days), with service on the beach provided by Linda and Luis, aka \u201cSexy Boy\u201d. I can\u2019t say enough good things about these individuals. Take a few minutes to introduce yourself, and they will remember your name & favorite beverage the rest of the week. You actually leave at the end of your vacation feeling as if you have four new friends. Be sure to tell them Bill (Mai Tais; \u201cduble rum\u201d) said hola!

This was our first trip using our membership of Exotic Travel Club, a timeshare type ownership programme which we bought into last December 2011 at El dorado Royale, just up the road. I have to admit we were sceptical but we could not have been more wrong. Joining the programme was one of the best future vacation decisions we have ever made. To the resort: It is much smaller than normal, only 100 rooms and suites of which about 70 were occupied. The hotel rooms are really nice, with their own balcony, but the owner's suites vary from fab to incredible! We had a glorious suite with king bed, jacuzzi, 2 bathrooms, 2 big televisions, a full kitchen, dining room, lounge, 2 minibars, champagne and spirits cabinet. The bars are great with a full range of international brands, Ketel One vodka being our favourite. Restaurants are also good quality, with loads of theme nights. I can't say that all the food was great cos one or two things we tried were just ok BUT at all the restaurants we did find a number of items which were really good, eg Beef tenderloin at the Italian (ask for the \"meat the butcher\" menu. Melt in your stuff that. We had it loads of times. The sashimi at the Asian is great, but the sushi not so good. Also the tepanyaki show was great with ace food coming from the talented chef. Watch the knife spinning! The grounds are absolutely immaculate with staff tending to them pretty much all day. And then the beach, amazing white sand, turquoise sea, with giant sandbags keeping out the rough water so you can swim and snorkel almost anytime. Gorgeous walks up to the other resorts about 1.5 miles up where you find \"hordes\" of people crammed in on their sunloungers and then when you get back to El Dorado Maroma you realise just what a quiet, uncrowded, romantic piece of paradise you have landed in. I have read moans on Trip about this place and I feel I ought to challenge some of them,eg -staff and waiters pushing for tips, Not true. We tipped occasionally partic in the early days, but only a dollar and we never had any negative service of any kind right through the whole two weeks. - waiters pestering you on the beach offering you drinks! Yes I read that, believe it or not. Not true. The service is unbelievable. The staff come round very regularly, offer drinks, and snacks and if you say you are going to have a snooze, they leave you alone. Perfect stuff. - moaning about the green hose across the bay underwater I must add. The whole point of that is that is shifting sand to make the marina deep and the swimming area shallow and safe. It has no bearing on the experience whatsoever. Forget the moans and get yourself over there. Special mention for some staff, Viktor, Fernando, Ivan, Israel and Rosy at the restaurants. Cesar, Luis, Alex and Hermelinda on the bar staff. Michelle, Ivan, Camacho and Alberto on the entertainment staff, Diana, Carmina, Areli, in fact all of the Concierge staff. Reception were all good, Felipe the bell boy. And then John Corbett the sales director for Exotic. Boy his brain and mouth are flying at 100 mph, but he's Irish so can be forgiven!! He and all his staff believe really passionately in the product they are offering. I have to say that after returning via the programme to Mexico and also doing 2 exchanges in the UK onto a canal narrowboat which saves us about $750 per week of use against the going tourist rate, we now also totally believe in it which is why I have no qualms about recommending that you have a look round whilst you are there and get involved! We thought Maroma was superb from all angles, but most of all the staff, the quiet romantic feel of the place, relaxation, good gym if you want it, just the best holiday. Go for it guys, you will love it. PS at lunchtime ask for a coconut flavour ice cream and a shot of Malibu. Dreamy stuff PPS Nearly forgot, check out Luis, the guy who arranges trips and days out.

We have stayed at several different resorts in the Playa del Carmen area. This is our New Home. We search no further for the perfect getaway! El Dorado Maroma provided our group with top notch service, meals and accomidations. All the while we enjoyed the best beach we have been to in mexico. Priced just right. 5 star and diamond status treatment. Safe and secure! I know all the hub bub about travel to mexico at this time, but I will continue to return. I have never felt uncertain about my safety at anytime. The resorts rely on tourism, it is their lively hood and the People of El Dorado Maroma treat and protect you like family. Everyone in our group drinks the water and eats the food. Have no fear, they want to keep you healthy and make you happy so you will return! They serve bottled water everywhere. I have found in the past I sought after excursions to get away from the resorts I have stayed at in the past. This year I was so at peace with the environment at the El Dorado I did not want to leave. No reservations for dinner required. Payments are all charged to your room and handled upon checkout. No need to carry more than some cash to tip with. However....I will warn you the service is so excellent you will want to tip everyone! No trolleys or long walks to dinner. Everything you need is close to your room. I only have one con - - I was bitten by either sand fleas or mosquitos not sure which but boy do they itch! I will bring bug spray when we return.

The service is excellent and the beach is breath taking. After 10 years of traveling, it has become number 1 on our list. It would be hard to beat this beautiful resort. The only issue I have as an exotic member is making reservations and room assignments. On our May 2011 trip to EDM, we reinvested into the updated jewel program with new perks. When scheduling our Nov 2011 trip, I made several calls to the reservations department in Florida. After waiting 2 days,I was told no \"royal suite\" was available the week we wanted. I was assured I would receive all the royal emerald benefits with our infinity pool suite due to the unavailability . When the confirmation call was made a week before our trip, I confirmed that these benefits would be available to us. This became different when we arrived at the resort. We were told since we booked a sapphire room we only got those benefits. While at the resort, I expressed my frustration with this situation with the staff of exotic travel. I was told this was an on going problem and that an emerald room was available and it should have been offered. I was given an email address to contact exotic travel at EDM directly to make any future reservations. We did not have this problem on previous trips before changing from platium membership to the new jewel program.

The all-inclusives we have stayed at prior are Sun Palace, Excellence Riveria Cancun, Couples Swept Away and The Caves. We always like to try new places and we chose EDM based on its location and it's small size ( in comparison to other Riveria Maya all-inclusives) I'd like to preface this review by saying we had a great vacation and if someone had told me they'd already booked at this resort I would in no way try to dissuade them from going there but we felt other resorts we've visited just do it better. THE POSITIVES: - Service at restaurants and by the pool and beach was stellar. Every person had a smile and wanted to know if we needed anything. We have nothing but wonderful things to say about the bartenders, wait staff, etc. -Bed was very comfortable, room was very clean. We loved sitting on the patio and being able to get right into the pool and swim around to the main pool and get a cocktail. -The beach was gorgeous. My husband isn't a strong swimmer but loves being out in the water and the waves and tides are often too strong at other places in Mexico for him to venture out very far. Because of the sandbags or \"whales\", the water at Maroma Beach is clear, calm and the deepest it got was to our hips. I understand this could be a negative for some but for us it was perfect. We'd often wade out, sit in the sand and just talk about life! -Breakfast and lunch at Sabores and Pepitas were very good. Nice variety of options. THE NOT SO PERFECT: -While the room was perfectly comfortable, it was rather dark. I didn't really understand what other reviewers meant when they mentioned that. It wont ruin your vacation but I often felt like I was getting ready in a cave. -The air conditioner in our room never seemed to be at full power. It was muggier in our room than we have every experienced on any of our tropical vacations. To be fair- it was tolerable so we didn't bring it up to management or attempt to change rooms. -I had a difficult time at the workout facility. The hours posted outside say 8 am to 11 pm but I get up earlier than 8 am and the room is never locked so I was in there every morning around 7 am. Unfortunately, I always had to go get someone to turn on the treadmills and the air conditioning. HINT- if you want to use the treadmills, there's a switch at the very bottom in the front. And they keep the remote a/c control somewhere the guests can't get to it cause the staff always brought it in, turned on the a/c and then left with the control. Again- this isn't a big deal but one of the reason I chose this resort was for the gym and it seemed silly to me that I couldn't just walk in and use it. -We had some minor mishaps with the front desk/conceriege staff saying they would take of something and then having to follow up on it ourselves. -The food was defintely average for dinner and for room service. Sabores was a our favorite dinner but they paired my delicious mahi mahi with an odd banana puree. My husband liked the Japanese well enough but I wasn't fond of most of the items I tried. Overall, there was a lot to like about EDM but when comparing it to Sun Palace and ERC, it just fell a little short for us.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cClose to perfection but not quite\u201d", "Author": "TheEfamily", "ReviewID": "UR121358737", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a Monday through Friday stay at the El Dorado Maroma for our 25th wedding anniversary. Overall we were very happy but the resort missed the mark for perfect (Excellent) on 2 points. A 3rd point is not the fault of the resort and doesn't affect my scoring but I wanted to share it for other travelers like us who don't come to the Riviera Maya often. I will cover those 3 points first before going into all the great parts about this resort. Don't discount it just because of the first items. - Many people in other reviews reported problems about rooms not being provided which match their reservation and this also happened to us. We arrived at the hotel at 8pm on Monday to check in to our Honeymoon suite. I had called reservations the day before to confirm that we had requested a Honeymoon suite and preferred something near the front in buildings 3, 4, 5 or 6. They confirmed this was in our reservation and noted again our preference. When we checked in I didn't bother to ask about it and we were escorted up to our suite. It turns out that we were not in a Honeymoon suite but had been given a suite in a brand new building to the left side (north) of the resort. It was brand new and on the 2nd floor. I realized instantly that this wasn't a Honeymoon suite and insisted we go back to the front desk. The young woman at the desk rationalized that we were in an \"upgraded\" room and couldn't explain why we weren't in the requested room. It was late so she finally stated she couldn't do anything about it that night and said we could come back in the morning. My view is that the resort does not take true room \"reservations\" but instead treats them as room requests, this despite the fact that they charge different rates and the rooms have different amenities. Long story short, we enjoyed our newer room for the rest of the trip (more on that in the room recomendation) but the resort could have made arrival much better with a little more training by their person at the desk. Saying right up front, \"I'm sorry Mr. 'Smith' but your room doesn't match your reservation. We've given you a better room but if you don't like it we can work wit you to make changes.\" They did all this after the fact but some damage had already been done during the first 30 minutes of our stay. - Related to the above, we were in a new building on the far left (north) of the property which had a waterfall wall on the front, very pretty. However on 2 different nights during our stay the waterfall pump malfunctioned and began making fairly loud sounds which woke us up from deep sleep and prevented returning to sleep. We called maintenance on both occasions and within 10 minutes had come to turn it off, it seems by turning off the power. They need to make sure this doesn't happen, probably part of being a recently opened building. - 3rd issue is not a resort problem but worth mentioning for people not used to this area. In December, the nights get cool and if there are clouds during the day (we had cloudy afternoons on 3 days) it can also be cool. Bring clothes and casual wear according. People who looked like \"regulars\" had sweatshirts and warmer evening attire than we had packed. So now for the good stuff. We loved the location of this resort. The only activity on this stretch of beach is this small(ish) resort and a marina. As far as the eye can see to the north and south there is no other commercial activity. While the beach is narrow to the south, it has a wild and unspoiled look. To the north (toward the marina) the beach is wide and perfect for walking. It is roughly a 3 mile walk around a small cape before you reach any more resorts. We walked that far and encountered about 10 resorts all one after the other and beaches with hundreds if not thousands of people. By contrast we probably never had more than 30 or 40 people on the beach. The water was quite calm at our location and very comfortable to wade and swim. To protect the beach there are large sandbags off shore. (Some call them whales.) You can wade out and snorkel around the bags even if you are not an experienced snorkeler. It isn't great snorkeling but there were a variety of fish small corals (just starting) and large star fish. If you aren't inclined to go out into the ocean to snorkel at the reef it is a good option. Other than our check in \"issue\" the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful as so many others have noted. While we are not regulars at All Inclusive resorts (this is our 3rd one) the food and drinks were by far the best. The food was as good as many restaurants and far, far better than food we had at the other AI resorts. Drinks were also very good and not weak or watered down. We splurged on our first night on an upgraded bottle of wine but drank the house wine on the other nights and it was just fine. Don't expect 5 star restaurant level food but overall we were quite pleased with all of our meals. The grounds are small and intimate and peaceful. If you aren looking for quiet and intimacy this is a great resort to connect as a couple. Don't come here expecting a big party life. Quite frankly as a couple who was intent on being focused on each other, we preferred to stay away from the larger groups. I can see why some people were bothered in other reviews by large wedding parties, it would really disrupt the feel of this resort and its biggest strength, a paradise built for two. Right next door to the resort is a marina with many activities: parasailing, scuba, deep sea fishing, sailing excursions, snorkeling, wave runners, speedboats. It was never loud or obtrusive. We enjoyed two excursions and loved the fact that we could walk directly over without any taxis or buses. The snorkeling trip goes directly out of the marina out to the reef about 1000 meters so it was very convenient. We happened to take a wave runner snorkeling tour which included an ocean cenote (sinkhole) it was a unique experience. Here is another hint, the resort gift shop is expensive but if you walk 20 meters over to the marina they have a gift shop with much better selection and lower prices. Overall, if asked I would recommend this resort to any couple looking for relaxation, romance, good food and drink (great for an AI), great setting and great service.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwful Honeymoon and terrible Service!\u201d", "Author": "Allentuttle", "ReviewID": "UR121342116", "Content": "My wife and I had our were married in Playa and stayed at the Maroma for our Honeymoon.

No trouble with transport from airport. Upon arrival, we were shown a gorgeous huge suite, but it did not have our full ocean view suite ready yet....so we advised that we had booked the ocean view room and were prepared to move to another hotel if necessary. We were promptly moved to first floor, ocean front, Room 1002 and it was absolutely fabulous. Had our own small pool right off the patio that had a double outdoor bed and gorgeous view. At first I wasn't sure if it was all it was promoted to be but by the 2nd day, felt that I had discovered paradise...by the third day, was absoloutely in love with the place. Guys, this is a total hassle-free vacation with no pressure and no big decisions to make. Walk from any room 100 feet and you are on the ocean. Walk another hundred feet and you are at the main pool with the swim up bar that is not crowded. Another 100 or so feet and you are within reach of a restaurant or bar. This is especially good if you are older or have a physical disability as did my friend. But be assured that the younger and more active guests likewise had plenty to do! The conversations of others and music are not intrusive at all. The staff is all very interactive and attentive, without being bothersome and they seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and pleasing the guests. I love to explore new towns and resorts in Mexico, but can say that my exploration stops here as it would be difficult to find a more perfect place if you are looking for a beautiful, clean, tranquil absolutely stress-free vacation. I will definitely be back as soon as I saved enough pesos to go. Finally, we stayed at this resort four days and then left on Sunday to rev it up a notch before leaving Mexico where we then transferred to the LeBlanc, the number one ranked 5 star spa hotel in Cancun for our last two days. It was likewise awesome with a whole different atmosphere...much more upscale and gourmet like a California resort. Saw many of the rich and famous these last two days. While it would be difficult to choose which one would be considered the best experience, if given only one choice, I would forego the glamour and little bit better gourmet food offered at the LeBlanc and opt for the beautiful little treasure called El Dorado Maroma. And yes, you party animals would probably be happier at one of the larger sister hotels, but it doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with this little beauty. Do have the sky massage, dinner on the beach after dark and see the Michael Jackson show. All things you will walk away from being glad you did! The only recommendations I would have is for the resort to provide a little better house wine (remember, when we like our wine, we tip much better!) and for these prices and a five star resort, wi-fi and computer access/long distance should be included.

I have stayed at the El Dorado Maromo 5 times now. Each and every time out does the previous stay. The hotel is one reason why I stay there so often, but the staff is the main reason. I usually stay in a swim up jacquzzi suite, which are absolutely amazing, but I know for a fact that all of the room catagories are really nice. I was there in October for 7 nights for a wedding and again in November for a few nights. Upon my return in November, all of the staff hugged us and welcomed us back. Its little touches like that, that make your stay that much more memorable. The food was great, starting with breakfast and lunch at Papitos, where for breakfast, you could have just about anything you wanted. During lunch, everyday has a theme to it. Burgar Bar, Tacos, Skewars, etc... and for dinner you have Italian, Japanese, and Mexican or latin. The staff goes above and beyond to make thier guests feel at home. One Morning, the general manage Jose Portocarrero stopped by every guests table at breakfast to see if they were enjoying their stay and if they needed anything. I have been to many resorts and haven't seen management take the time to do this. Rene, the swim up bartender was great making new drinks for us everyday. Jonas, Gabby, and Angel, made our dinners everynight even more enjoyable with their wonderful personalities. You can always tell when people love their jobs and they sure do. The beach is one of my favorite in the area. You can rent wave runners or go snorkeling for a small fee, or you can sit on the beach and do absolutely nothing.

And we had a FANTASTIC TIME!!! Upon arrival, we were welcomed to the hotel with big smiles and as we were given the tour of the resort, the staff was very friendly and always greeted us as we walked past - regardless if they were a gardener or a sales representative. At first we thought this was because we were being given the tour, but this was standard for the staff to do. The room was nice - we stayed in a Honeymoon Suite and had a fantastic view of the ocean. The room was clean, neat, and welcoming. Knowing we had planned to be married, the room had a wedding video playing with champagne waiting for us - which was a nice surprise. It really made us feel welcome. We were on the top floor of the building and with no elevator, the bellman had to carry our bags up the stairs and did so with a smile. The grounds were nice - because we were there in late Oct/early Nov, we expected some work being done on the hotel - off season - and their was work remodeling the older areas of the resort. We also arrived after Hurricane Rina had gone by so they were cleaning up from the storm. (Wasn't too bad but they had to put up some curtains on the beds by the pool and such.) We LOVED the beach. Very peaceful and calm water thanks to some man made barriers about 100m off shore. We relaxed on the beach a couple days and enjoyed a \"Maroma Lemonade\" relaxing on the sand. I cannot speak higher of the staff at this resort. I had stayed at the Iberostar with my company 5 months earlier. I felt as if the staff there didn't care about us at all. They did their jobs and that's it. We found that, when we left to come home, we were leaving friends. We were always welcomed with smiles and questions about how our day was. We got to know some members of the staff and could tell their interest was genuine. We did get married while we were on the resort. The chapel overlooked the beach and the wedding coordinators worked with us to make it a very memorable occasion. It was PERFECT! Elena and Fernada guided us through the ceremony and were very, very on top of the details. Because of the Hurricane, we arrived 2 days later than expected. They had to reschedule everything - blood tests and such - so we could have the wedding as planned on November 1st, but have the date on the marriage license be the date of our wedding. If the pieces didn't fall correctly, the date would have to be changed. They made sure that wouldn't happen. Questions we had after the wedding regarding the ceremony and our pictures from the photographer we hired were answered with speed and professionalism. You could tell, they cared. The food...was...AMAZING! Every meal was delicious. As I mentioned earlier, in May we stayed at Iberostar - two resorts down from El Dorado. The food their was OK at best. Every meal we had was delicious - The duck I had was PERFECTLY prepared...the lamb was fall of the bone tender. Room service was prompt and even made the extra trip for my wife's cappuccino I forgot to order. We did a tour to Coba while there. Lomas Travel is at the resort every day. Luis was who we worked with to set up the trip and he not only went over the tours with us but the day after our tour, he came looking for us to make sure we had a good time - which we had. Like I said, the staff treats you like more than just a customer. You're more like family. We did use the spa while there. We both highly recommend a couples moonlight massage on the beach - did that the night before the wedding. Well worth it! My wife also used some of their services the day before our wedding and did get ready for the wedding there. She had a slight wardrobe malfunction while getting ready. (The clasp at the top of the back of her dress broke.) They quickly worked to repair it without making my wife stressed out about it. She was calm but she felt as if she wasn't, how they handled it would have kept her calm. Negatives...no ATM on site. We made some purchases on our tour and used the cash we had vs credit. We were not able to tip some members of the staff simply because we didn't have money to do it. I also understand the concept of the hotel - disconnect from everything and relax - but I was shocked that the WiFi was not free. There was a snow storm at home that caused the person watching our pets to lose power. We had to coordinate a possible change of location for them from the resort. Free Wifi would have made that a lot easier. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this resort to anyone. The staff and food were amazing and the room was beautiful as was the view.

Our suite\u2019s other surprises included welcome champagne on ice, an indoor AND outdoor shower, and a jacuzzi for two, complete with bubble bath! The food? Japanese, Italian, Mexican restaurants, buffet breakfasts with a Mexican slant as well as the standard \u201cyou-pick-the-ingredients\u201d omelets, cereals, tons of variety of fruit and cheese [try the \u201cgreen juice\u201d at breakfast ~ an interesting drink that tastes healthy ~ made out of celery, etc (I won\u2019t spoil the surprise)]. Every day had a themed lunch buffet; you were always entranced by what there was to eat. We are not wine drinkers, so the house wine was fine. The mixed drinks were heaven, and easy to over-indulge in! It was easy to meet people, make friends, and remember their names because there weren\u2019t so many! The serving staff (gracias to Alfredo, who was our server at our candlelight dinner on the beach, as well as a few of our dinners) were amazing; they were all so wonderful I can\u2019t name them all; they anticipated our needs at the meals and appeared at our side when it wasn\u2019t even totally apparent to us that we needed anything. Table tennis was a lot of fun (we met a number of people that way), and the swim-up bar in the main pool was a natural place to start conversations. There was another, smaller, shadier pool that also had its own swim-up bar, for when the sun really got hot. And if you chose to stay on the beach, there were no worries, the staff were out there too to take care of whatever refreshment you were looking for. While we didn\u2019t participate in the kayaking or snorkeling, we did walk out to the man-made breakers, which appear to be gigantic sandbags. This made the water closer to shore less turbulent and easy to snorkel, swim, and walk in. The only problem with this vacation? That we had to leave. :(", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cVery, very relaxing.\u201d", "Author": "cb6", "ReviewID": "UR120754191", "Content": "We spent four entire days relaxing on the beach and at the pool in mid November. It was wonderful to relax in a beach or pool chair or lounge in one of the beds on the beach. A waiter was never far away to take our drink order. Yoga class in morning was my favorite activity. And the long walk along the beach is terrific, all white sand and great views. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at both the buffet and pool-side restaurant. The dinners tried a little too hard to be \"gourmet\". A few simple dinner choices would have been more to my liking. The first day we did not tip simply because we didn't have our act together, not because we didn't mean to. We had every intention of making up for it the next day. But, the next morning at breakfast we had absolutely terrible service. I guess the lesson is don't forget your dollars on the first day, tips are absolutely expected. (But the service is wonderful) The lobby is not very nice, at least compared to the other lobbies you see when dropping people off at other resorts. Check-in was a bit of a hassle since it was so late at night when we arrived and they do not take Discover card. The honeymoon suite was nice. I loved being on the top floor with the great view even though that meant climbing a lot of stairs. The bed on the balcony was especially nice. The outdoor shower was just a shower with no roof off the bathroom, I thought it would be different. Take note, if you turn on the air-conditioner at night there is a button on the remote to turn off the light that is on the air-conditioner as it is very bright when the lights are turned off, as is the alarm clock.

They over price everything by 300 to 500% and the exchange rate they use is 7.5 whilst the real exchange rate was hovering around 11.

Many times I've thought of letting it go, but I can't. Where to begin? Maybe with the little stuff: the faint whiffs of sewerage at spots around the resort, with the small unattractive beach, with the shallow totally artificial swimming area which is hemmed in by massive sandbags, or with the piledriving on the beach that began early in the morning and finished at 5? How about the big stuff? This place bills itself as a gourmet facility. Except for breakfast, which is tough to ruin, the food was awful! Gourmet? Not on your life. One of their \"theme\" restaurant is Japanese. Not only are the portions tiny, but I had some of the strangest sushi that I have ever had in my life. I can't imagine where those recipes came from. And I know sushi. I live in Vancouver. The Italian \"theme\" restaurant isn't a whole lot better, with its clumps of undercooked or overcooked pasta. But it is far better than the Japanese. The service was very slow at both, and you often will not receive your complete order. What Japanese restaurant ever forgets to bring the rice? Here's a tip: the servers cannot handle orders from large parties. We were 11. Split your party into smaller groups, and you might get everything you order, and you might not wait more than an hour. I keep telling the staff to turn the music down until they do it. And keep telling them if you want to talk over dinner. At lunch, at the beachside grill, you can observe perfectly good salmon filets being destroyed. They'll put a dozen on the grill and then take them off to the side to be reheated as they are ordered. You learn rather quickly to head for the salad bar and to stay there. What they don't have to cook, they can't ruin. Towards the end of our stay, some of our group gave up on the resort restaurants and started to order from the room service menu. Or finally at wits end, we'd take $50. return cab rides into Playa so that we could eat at good local Mexican spots. The fact that the resort is an all-inclusive became irrelevant. We were happy to pay over and above for good meals. So finally to the clincher: at the end of your stay, the resort will slip a feedback form under your door. The other people in our party had already submitted their feedback forms to the front desk, and had left for the airport. We however checked out, but had to kill a few hours on the beach before our flight home. We too handed on our feedback form. All 11 of us had complaints similar to mine. But we were the only people who had to stick around for a while. Our favourite beach waiter, Diego, had brought us a few drinks, and my wife and I were enjoying the last of the Mexican sun, when a front desk woman, and a man claiming to be the resort manager, and the chef appeared before us on the beach. The manager proceeded to berate the two of us for not raising the food issue right away. He actually said that if we didn't like the food, we could have ordered anything we wanted, and they'd have prepared it for us. This he did rather too loudly, and he drew many incredulous looks from others nearby on the beach. The poor embarrassed chef didn't say a word. He looked down at his shoes, wishing he were anywhere else on the planet. I've read many of the rave reviews of this place, and I am shaking my head! Did they go to the same place? Can I find something positive to say about the place? Yes I can. Diego takes drink orders on the beach. He is delightful. Tip him well and you will have made a very good friend. Also, the New Years Eve celebration on the beach was more enjoyable than I expected it to be. It had an authentic, genuine feel to it.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAnd we thought the poor reviews were just people who like to complain...\u201d", "Author": "amandahugnkiss13", "ReviewID": "UR120121979", "Content": "This was our honeymoon and we arrived on October 24, 2011. I would like to preface this by saying, I travel extensively for business, so I have seen just about everything in terms of service-level. From the moment we arrived in the lobby, I could tell something was a little \"off\". The staff did not even acknowledge us for a good 10 minutes. Finally, someone told us to have a seat, but did not address us again for at least 5-10 more minutes while she typed away on the computer right in front of us. This person finally started to check us in, but didn't know the answers to any questions, including how to upgrade our room! It was quite a long drawn-out process, but after a Manager came to help and finish the transaction and a little over $500 later, we were on our way to our swim-up suite. Bang! Bang! Bang! Have you read other reviews about the constant banging in their rooms? Well, I can confirm that this is not exaggerated. Since we knew that this had happened to others, my husband didn't wait even 5 minutes after we got into our room to call the front desk and tell them we wanted to move and the Manager (I think her name is Adriana) came to show us 2 other rooms that we could choose from and they moved us immediately. I will say, the rooms are breath-taking and the peacefulness of the property overall is something you will have a hard time finding elsewhere. Unfortunately, we also had the power go out for a couple hours on our first night there. It was quite frightening because the room was pitch black and when we tried to call the front desk, it would just ring and ring. What was very interesting was that in the morning, a letter appeared that was worded as if it had been slipped under the door the day before and warned of this possible power outage due to work at a nearby \"power plant\". Now, we know that this was not placed there the day or night before because we were in and out of our room until later in the evening and also had late-night room service delivered an hour or so before the power went out. Oops! Nice try, though. The staff in the restaurants and at the beach are great! Special shout out to Jonnas for being such a joy. He made a lot of the experience better and even brought us drinks at our swim-up suite a couple times when we were out there. We had him as our server for our first lunch and the only other time he didn't wait on us was our breakfast on the 2 days we were there. So, I cannot say much more about this resort because Hurricane Rina was on it's way by Day two and we were informed by a staff member while we were eating lunch, that they were closing the resort the next day and we would be moving to El Dorado Royale (a MUCH larger resort where we would be safe). By Day 3, we were set to take a taxi to the new resort early in the day, so we could enjoy the sun that was amazingly out and take advantage of the \"calm before the storm\"...BUT, by the time we got to the lobby to get our taxi, the staff refused to allow us to leave! I was baffled because they were the ones who arranged for us to take the taxi!! It's just another oddity with the front desk staff at this resort. Needless to say, I was not happy, but we finally complied and waited to take the charter bus over to check-in later in the day. El Dorado Royale was a very nice property, but filled with adults that were on vacations with different intentions than what ours were, since we had paid for a very private, relaxing honeymoon without distractions. I think I would go back to an El Dorado resort, but probably Casitas or Seaside, instead of Maroma or Royale.

We booked through Fun Jet and our ground transport was with Lomas Travel. Travel: We had a direct flight and had no trouble clearing customs. Our Lomas representative was waiting and we were taken directly to our resort (about a 25min ride) which, for Mexico, was very uneventful. We arrived at the hotel about 11am, check in was smooth. Our room was not ready but they held our bags while we had a tour of the resort and ate lunch. When we got to the room there was fruit and a bottle of campaign waiting. Room: We had booked a Mi Hotelito Room, however these rooms were under renovation during our stay so we were upgraded to a presidential suite on the third floor. This was a HUGE room with a full kitchen(at an all inclusive??) dining and living room with a balcony and big screen TV. The Bedroom was very spacious had a very comfortable king bed and a second balcony with an excellent ocean view. We appreciated the blackout curtains to allow for sleeping in in the morning. The Bathroom was also very spacious and had a large all marble shower and jacuzzi tub with window overlooking the ocean. We always had plenty of hot water, the AC worked very well, and in general did not have any problems with the room. -Only thing that might bother some guests-dead mosquitoes. They did a good job of keeping them under control on the resort and we encountered few live ones, but between cleanings dead ones would collect on the bathroom floors(not a problem for me, at least they are dead) Food: All the food there was very good. We particularly enjoyed breakfast at Pepitos, they had an excellent selection of omelet ingredients(my husbands favorite), breakfast meats from bacon to smoked salmon, breads, varying hot dishes, and very important to me a great selection of fresh fruit. We ate the themed lunch at Pepitos most days but also had several good lunches at Sabores. The hosts and hostesses, as well as the waiters were always very friendly and helpful. The dinner food was very good. They moderate the portion sizes expecting you to order several courses (appetizer, soup, entree, dessert) My only complaint would be that much of the dinner food is very rich, and by the end of the week we were so stuffed we could only make it through one or two courses at dinner. Food Quality at dinner- I have been to a variety of all inclusive resorts and this is by far the highest quality food I have experienced. We never had a bad meal. That said, it is not the same quality you would expect from a gourmet 4-5 star restaurant in the USA. However always good, with surprisingly high quality steaks cooked to order. Activities: It rained heavily (stalled tropical depression) for 3/4 of our trip. The staff told us they arranged for group activities in Ricks bar which sounded fun, but we mostly opted to hang out in our jacuzzi tub reading and watching the storm/ocean. After the storm they offered snorkeling, Kayaks, horseshoes, bocci, chess, and volley ball on the beach. The activities people were friendly but never intrusive. I also had a massage in the beach hut which was good and very relaxing. Excursions: Having the Marina next door was very convenient. The Lomis travel representative helped us reschedule our scuba diving 4 times(due to the weather) When we were finally able to go out it was great to just walk next door and get on the boat. Our room was very near the marina and we were never bothered by noise and liked looking at the boats. On my own I booked Horseback Riding through Rancho Baaxal, which is VERY close to the resort. They have the only healthy horses I have ever seen in Mexico and I highly recommend them. Beach: The #1 thing you won't get at any other resort in Mexico. I have been to quite a few and this is by far the nicest beach. Wide with soft white sand. They have placed large sandbags off shore. This keeps the sand from washing away, but also creates a nice area for wading and lounging in the water. If you turn left on the beach and walk past the marina you can walk a good distance(maybe a mile) on the beach before you reach any other hotels. Very romantic ;) There were always plenty of beach beds and they were very good at always keeping your drink full as you lounged on the beach. The staff was excellent. My husband was sick one day and the concierge had the kitchen make chicken soup to send up to the room. They also checked in with me several times to see if he needed more soup, Gatorade ect .... I'm terrible with names, but we enjoyed everyone on the staff and appreciate their help and friendliness throughout our stay. This resort may not be for you if, you are traveling in a large(noisy) group, you want wild night life, you are an exceptionally picky eater(not willing to try new things).

It fit our desire for a smaller, more intimate resort with less people that would be relaxing.

While the water is shallow and extends that way for awhile, I find this to be nicer than some of the deeper beaches at resorts nearby where the waves are pounding you and the beach area is thin. Maroma is a nice wide beach. After reading some of the comments below about the odd \"smell\" at the beach, I have to say they are exaggerated. While we did experience the odor from time to time, it is brief lasting for only a minute or so when the wind is blowing in exactly the right direction. I actually believe it comes from the motors running nearby at the marina. The snorkeling nearby is actually excellent. The reef right off the resort where you can see the waves crashing is certainly not dead and we saw some great stuff. Perhaps it depends on exactly where your guide takes you. The food here was actually excellent and definitely exceeded our expecations for an all-inclusive. The grille near the beach is excellent for breakfast and lunch everyday. Some of the themed dinners left a bit to be desired and the entrees were hit or miss, but you can always ask for something else or to see the steak menu, which can be ordered at anytime. There is no \"menu\" for room service as you can literally order almost anything you want. Drinks at the swim-up bar at the pool are made with a generous amount of liqour and I did not experience the \"watered-down\" drinks many complain about at all-inclusives. The only negative comments about this resort and what I believe keeps it from being 5 stars are mostly logistics related. We had originally booked an ocean view honeymoon suite which was supposed to be on the 3rd or 4th floor with a nice view. When we arrived, we were told for some reason the room was not available and we were taken to an alleged \"upgraded\" suite in the new section. While this suite was nice, it lacked what we had booked and really wanted- the ocean view and something on the 3rd or 4th floor. After some complaining they eventually confessed that they overbooked the resort and gave our room away. This is not a good business practice and I don't know why they do this. We were, however, able to move rooms the next night to what we had originally booked and paid for. We also received spa credit for the issue. Transporation - The resort does not have its own private cars or transfer services so you are left paying a third-party service and cram packed on a shuttle to and from the airport or to go to Playa. Other nice resorts have private SUVs that can be used. Also, there is no ATM at the resort and you have to go all the way to Playa Del Carmen to get cash. They also apparently cannot charge to your room/credit card for cash so this was a major inconvenience. There was construction going on at the resort while we there and one of the main pools and bars is closed while they renovate the area. We would hear the occasional chain saw, hammer, or power equipment, but I understand it's something that couldn't be avoided. Wine - the included wine left a lot to be desired. While the liqour and bar drinks were great, the included wine at dinner was of the bargain basement variety and the upgraded wine menu also lacked a good selection and seemed to be very overpriced. Overall though, it was a great resort, great trip, and we got what we expected. Because of the price and all-inclusive I think you definitely get a good value with El Dorado.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oakville", "Title": "\u201cReturn to Paradise\u201d", "Author": "dreamakerOakville", "ReviewID": "UR119498278", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel a year ago and had such a wonderful experience that we couldn't wait to return.

We asked for cookies and because they didn't have any they actually baked a batch for us and delivered them to the room piping hot. If we didn't like what was on the menu at the restaurants all we had to do was ask for something else and it was served with a smile. Please try the cheeseburgers and waffle fries from room service, They are truly amazing.

If you have discerning tastes and want to be able to enjoy a stress free vacation then this is the place for you.

We failed to realize how significant some negative aspects of the resort, identified by past guests, would become during our stay. I'm writing in the hope you don't make the same mistake... The most serious problem with this resort is the beach and ocean along the resort. Simply put, they smell. You cannot, while on the beach, ignore this smell. It is persistant and pungent. (You will not get a straight answer from any of the staff about the source of the smell. We surmised that it resulted from the barriers located about 100 yards off the beach, in the ocean, to deter erosion.) These barriers prohibit the constant flow of fresh water. Consequently, the water is too warm, murky, shallow, and stinks. Another problem is with the management: they are initially helpful upon your arrival but problems we encountered soon after -- such as with inconsistent room service -- and expressed to the management were never fixed nor was any serious apology offered to us. (On the other hand, the staff are mostly helpful and could not be nicer.) Other observations: \u2022 Good food, except at the Oriental restaurant, which is poor, but not gourmet, as advertised \u2022 Terrible snorkeling; the reef off the resort is dead \u2022 Occasional loud drunks at pool/beach, which management ignored.

I have high standards for my clients and forge great relationships with each and every resort. This resort, based on location, size (boutique feel), and entertainment value is a 5 star IF you are looking for quiet. Ratings can be confusing and each person rates on what they personally like. I am rating on comparables in THIS area, not on my emotions. Keep in mind, this is a much smaller adult only than any other in this area of Mexico, so if are wanting the boom, boom music by the pool and tequila vollyball games, this is not the place for you. What you will get is fantastic service whether it be front desk personnel, room service, beach or pool butlers, concierge or wait staff. They make you feel like family but not intrusive! =D ROOMS: There were always 4 types of rooms here, but they added a few more recently including villas!! Since this resort is small, no matter where your room is, you won't have more than a 3 minute walk to the beach. There are no elevators here, so if you get a 4th floor room, be prepared to climb to a wonderful view! The older section is being totally renovated as I write this, the Mi Hotelito side. This is the entry level room for this resort. Nice sized two story buildings with thatched roofs. You will get a double bed with privacy curtains on your deck and most rooms have partial oceanviews. The Maroma side has 3 room categories, Infinite Jacuzzi Jr Suites (infinity pool on your deck), open ceiling romantic shower (private, but you can see the sky/stars), then the swim up rooms which of course are located on the 1st floor and the Honeymoon Suite which sits on the upper floors with the best views. Your deck is huge with double bed, table chairs, 2 additional lounge chairs and a side cabinet. All of these rooms has the jacuzzi for 2, open air shower. The 1st time I reviewed this resort was about 5 years ago and since then, the vegetation has really matured, so the full oceanview rooms can be somewhat obstructed by palm trees. Higher the floor the better views. The new VILLAS just premiered last week and I did get a chance to see them, quite nice, spacious, and some even have a double jacuzzi over looking the beach. These rooms you walk directly onto the beach from your villa. Connecting rooms are also available for groups. Still need to be at least 16 to stay here. Beach, BEAUTIFUL! Voted top 5 beaches in the world. Entry into the water is smooth, but you have to know, you can go about 100 yards and it will never go past your waste, if you dip under the ropes, then it drops about 20 feet. They added sand to this resort not long ago to make it wider creating this easy, calm swimming area. SO if waves are your thing, you won't find it here. NOTE: Bring inflatable raft, perfect for just lounging in the pool or ocean. Outstanding beach and pool service, you will never be without a drink or snack! FOOD: I dined around, for dinner, Italian and Asian. I personally liked the Asian Restaurant the best, tempura shrimp was amazing. Not to say the Italian was bad, but liked the Asian more. They are moving these two restaurants soon to expand the size, that will be exciting, but don't fret, you won't even know when it is happening and no restaurants will close during this time. Papetto's was my favorite for breakfast and lunch. I posted a pic showing the different offers during daily lunch time. Part closed in part beachfront, part buffet and part fresh grill cooking. Food was ALWAYS fresh and loved the daily lunch specials. Sabores has A/C and open for breakfast, lunch and dinner (ala carte). This has a nice pool view and fun pizza menu for afternoon snacks lounging by the pool. POOLS: The main pool is where we stayed during the afternoon in a bali bed. I never needed to get up early to grab a chair or bed which was refreshing. Swim up pool bar was fun but it is quiet! There is another pool near the Mi Hotelito side, but it was smaller. Night Time activity, not too much going on, but something every night will take place. Ask concierge what is going on every night, sometimes it is fire dancers, bands, etc... The vegetation has really grown a lot since my 1st visit there years ago, so if that sweeping oceanview is important, the highest floor the better. LOVE that no reservations are required for dinner unless it is a special event. Walking was great, head to the beach and hang a left, we walked to the little lighthouse and snapped gorgeous pictures along the way, about 1 mile each way. Secrets Maroma is about 1 1/2 mile walk from this resort. Marina is walking distance from this hotel where you can rent jet ski's, go snorkeling, parasailing, ATV's in the jungle and horseback riding to name a few.

We also like to cruise and have yet to find a resort that tops or can measure up to a cruise... well we found it with El Dorado Maroma. We stayed for a week Sept 12- Sept 19 in a beautiful swim out suite. From the minute you arrive at the resort you are greeted with cool towels and escorted to your suite. The service is extremely personalized. The resort only has 72 suites and during our stay that staff I'm sure out number the guests. We liked the intimate atmosphere yet after a few nights we were ready for some action. The resort has entertainment every night of the week yet so that gives you an option. We preferred to venture to nearby Playa Del Carmen after dinner for some shopping and some nightlife. It's a $25 flat rate cab ride- door to door its about a 20 minute ride and you are dropped off right by Coco Bongo in the heart on Playa. We were iffy about safety but found the cab drivers to be very friendly and felt very safe at all times. The streets of Playa were quite busy on Friday and Saturday night (lots of tourists) and we would stay out quite late at the nightclubs. The beach is beautiful we walked for a good 25 minutes and there were no other resorts unlike many other areas of the Mayan. There is waiter service on the beach and ample amounts of umbrellas, chairs and beach beds to use. They also come around with appetizers during the lunch hours which were always good. I must mention the outstanding service of Luis and Linda. They were wonderful- always checking up if we needed anything. Thank you again! Make sure to take the time to do the massage on the beach at sunrise... it was great and fairly inexpensive compared to the spas in any major city. You can wade in the water for quite a distance and it only hits your knees. The water is crystal clear and really nice to swim in. There are a few areas of seaweed but one can expect that in the ocean. We saw lots of exotic fish as well if you like to snorkel we heard there is a good coral reef. There are two pools... a smaller pool with a swim up bar and a larger pool. We spent all our time in the larger pool that was connected with our swim up suite. The grounds of the resort are lush and the pool was always clean. We especially recommend the wonderful bartenders Rene and Carlos. They were so nice! The food at this resort is THE BEST I have had at an all inclusive resort. If you've ever cruised before then I can tell you it's similar to quality of the cruiselines. There are no buffets at the resort (except for a themed lunch buffet near the beach that changes every day). There is an extensive 24 hour room service menu which we always take advantage of for breakfast. The place on the beach (I forget the name) always had different themes (taco day, ribs day etc). There are no reservations required for any of the dinner places and there are 3 in addition to the \"theme\" nights which believe it or not we didn't attend but heard from other guests that it was quite good. We loved the italian and japanese dinners... good menu and the portions are perfect sizes. It was great! Finally, I would recommend spending the extra and splurging for something above the standard Mi Hotelito suite. Our suite was over 700 square feet and had a beautiful sitting area and a very comfortable king size bed (similar if not better to the Westin Heavenly Beds). The bathroom had double sinks, large jacuzzi tub and a seperate shower that led to an outside show (soo amazing!). Our patio had two lounge chairs, a small table and a full size bed. We also had our own pool loungers as our patio led directly into the pool. We really loved it. They also had a dvd player with movies available should you choose to \"stay in\" one night like we did. I highly recommend this resort... you will not be disappointed! We are already talking about returining sometimes this year. We also noticed that a lot of the guests here had stayed at other resorts in the Karisma chain- we also heard good things about the El Dorado Royale and the Sensatori Azul.

There is a small marina next door, which was great for excursions like snorkeling, jet ski tours, and parasailing, but it seemed that you have to walk about 2 miles to get to any other resort (which I thought was a major plus!). You could walk on the beach for miles - also a plus for me, and not possible in some island locations. The food was great and had a gourmet, fresh feel to it. There are only 3 restaurants, but the resort offers special dinners several nights each week (Mayan, Italian, Around the World dinner), so we never got bored with our food options and we were there for 8 nights, too. The resort is a little quieter. There's not a lot of partying going on, but the resort offers quality (and not cheesy) entertainment every night.

This was a significant anniversary for us and we were very excited. We arrived at our at the front gates about 7pm on a thursday night. We had a bit of a problem getting through the gate which concerned us. We liked the security, but were a little taken about when we were held up and had to be verified. When we arrived we sat down and there was a lot of whispering etc. Well turns out they did not have our reservation. Yes, we had a confirmation number all through platinum travel with AMEX> The young man explained to us that two hotels had recently split and sometimes reservations were mixed up . I was speechless, which is very unlike me. It took about an hour but they gave us a room, not the one we booked. We were assured by noon the next day we would have our room, swim up. We were told to leave our bags and they would be moved for us to the new room the following day. Well, we went to special Italian dinner night which we had to have a reservation. The food was terrible. Our waiter's English was not great so we left and went to another restaurant. The Mexican food was good and we enjoyed ourselves. Although, in my opinion to consider the food to be gourmet and to have a great wine selection is a far reach. The following day we went and met our concierge Paola. Paola was very nice and apologetic. It was noon and we had heard nothing about our room. We went and got massages. Do not waste the money... in my opinion. Paola was really great and after about 4 we received our room . I truly felt she hustled to help us. I had also asked Paola about the price difference in our rooms and if we could be refunded the difference. She said to talk to the front desk. Well ,no one could make that decision except a manager. Needless to say we never received any compensation. I asked about this about 5 or 6 times and was told they needed to talk to the manager to no avail. Finally the afternoon before we were leaving I asked Paola again and she said the manager told her he would give us a couples massage for compensation. She said he would find us and he had to write it out... That is where that was left and we never heard anything further. Our room was lovely, a bit dirty, but roomy and pretty. Bed was very very comfy. We had the swim out room. Just a lovely set up. The pool was dirty and the water was pretty icky. My husband surmised that the pump was not running properly. Raul was out there everyday skimming it just was not enough. We have a pool in the south and we understand that bugs are bugs but caked on yucky stuff is not the norm. Overall pool experience was okay. In the main pool our bartender was Carlos and he was fantastic. (Makes a mean no sugar margarita ). They say that the room refrigerator is restocked daily, but ours was missed twice. We were always able to go and find our beverages. The food gourmet???? We have traveled a lot, to many different countries and sampled many different cultures. The food was okay. Most of the meals we ate there were good just not what I would consider gourmet. In the buffet restaurant Tania was WONDERFUL... She met us with a smile everyday. Too bad she was off on Wednesday we missed her. The drink selection was good. I would recommend that the higher end brands of liquor be available, especially since it is billed as \"gourmet inclusive\". We ended up going into Playa Del Carmen for most of our meals which was GREAT!!!!.. Too bad we paid a ton of money for food that we really did not eat. We live and learn. And yes we have been to inclusive places before and had a wonderful time and enjoyed the food immensely. We were really hoping that the \"Gourmet\" part of the resort would make up for only having a couple of restaurants to choose from. Best thing about this resort was a guy named Louis with the on site travel agency, Lomos Travel. He was spectacular. We went to Playa Del Carmen , he gave us the name of several restaurants, yummy. He helped us with taxi's when we could not find anyone available to help us. We visited Xcaret and loved it. We saw a show CoCo Bongo, Wow.... great. He set us up with the best seats and transportation. He could not have been more helpful and we would recommend Lomos travel to everyone. Above and beyond helpful!! The most attention that we received was about my lost cell phone, which was very odd to me. We came back to the hotel from Playa Del Carmen by taxi, thank goodness I got the guys card. I used my phone in the car, thought that I had it in my purse. Went to Rick's bar danced around, did not use it there. Went back to the room ordered room service and went to bed. The next morning early I realized it was gone. I was walking, in a bit of a panic, to the lobby . The guy in the lobby was on the phone and Louis walked in, he helped us. I gave him the card from the taxi and he called Antonio but he said he had not seen it. Security came and searched to no avail. But oh my goodness we had people after people coming to talk to us all day. It was kind of crazy. I am glad they were so helpful, had they been so attentive to our vacation needs that would have been wonderful!!! Even upon our departure the lady in front came over and gave me an incident report to fill out, 3 days later. She wanted details and very helpful with the specific information I should include. Overall our experience was okay. I can not say that I will never return again , but it is highly unlikely. I would like to recommend to the Hotel back off on the \"Membership\" push. It was interesting to me that the push was made join the \"Club\" although we were still not satisfied with our stay. Yep, the person pushing, very nicely, the membership knew all about our I would also like to suggest that staff in the lobby be careful about talking negatively about other guests. You never know who really understands you and who does not. It would also be nice to have an activities person who tries to actively get people involved in what is offered. Maybe, an announcement about events just before they are to occur would be good. The staff can surely round folks up the the Membership promotion, I am sure they can get folks to participate and socialize with one another.. We enjoyed Playa Del Carmen and will return.

We were on our honeymoon and stayed here for a week. We used the safe in the room to put away valuables-cash, passports, jewelry.... Our last night there, as we were packing, we realized we were missing a ring from the safe. The ring that was stolen was my fake engagement ring. I didn't wear my real ring just to be safe-thankfully. We quickly realized that all the cash in my husbands wallet was gone as well. He had a few hundred in USD and pesos in it. We ALWAYS kept the safe locked. We kept the key hidden in the room. We immediately went down to the front desk to report the theft and were met with indifference. The person at the front desk called \"security.\" They told us the only key to the safe was the one we had. Unlikely, but the thief could have looked through our room for the key anyway and used it. They had us write down what happened and said they would look into it, but that there was really no way of finding out who could have done it. All the employees on the grounds (housekeepers, pool cleaners...) have a key that gets them into any room on the resort. We will NEVER return to a resort that would employ a thief that has the gall to rummage through a room and steal (what they thought was) a wedding ring. Aside from the theft: When we arrived, the water in the pool in our room was brown when we got there. We were told it would be cleaned immediately. It took them 3 full days and 2 more calls to finally clean it, so our pool was unusable for almost half of our stay. Food was good-not gourmet-but good. Get a room on the third or forth floor if you want an ocean view. Otherwise, you'll see trees only. Our room had a great view-room 342. The rooms are spacious and the outdoor shower is nice.

Having stayed at many all inclusive resorts in the past 16+ years I was curious to see how they stacked up against this tiny resort and I can say it exceeded them all for service and dining. Travelling solo I was a little curious as to how the reception would be as this is primarily a honeymoon & couples adult only resort but the concerns proved unfounded as the staff went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. I liked the intimate size compared to much larger resorts in Mayan Riviera that are so large you can't easily walk around them. My room was on the second floor, 212, and it's a \"MiHotelito\" room, meaning it's close to the beach in the original section of the resort not the newer addition with its swim-up suites. I'd read other reviews recommending against staying in this room category but for my stay it was more than enough luxury. The large king bed is complimented by a double day bed on the large balcony and they will even make it up for an overnight stay should you wish to cleep closer to nature. The solid wooden planks on the balcony gave it a real tropical feel and I spent many hours out there both morning and later afternoon & early evening, though later in the day the banter from the smaller of the resort's two pools is hard to tune out some days. There are fabric privacy screens that add an intimate hideaway feel to the balcony as well. The bathroom has a large shower stall only, no tub, and again met my needs though isn't brand new if you're picky about those touches. While the sink water pressure and temperature was super the shower ran hot & cold at times and was a little weaker pressure than I like but that's not something that hugely impacted my stay. The room had a nice huge cabinet holding the TV and mini-bar which was restocked daily with 4 Tecate beer, juice and small 200 ML cans of Coke, Coke Zero, Dier Coke & Sprite. One item about the room that I wanted to mention as taking some getting used to was the use of the AC unit which has a remote control and does an exceptional job cooling the room but it is a little loud. The first night I tried sleeping without the AC or the celing fan and roasted so tried the ceiling fan only the second night and while better it was still hot in the room and I woke up several times. On night #3 I tried the AC and fell asleep quickly and had a long night sleep so it wasn't loud enough to keep me awake. The purle LCD display does stay on as long as the unit is working and it casts a funkly glow over the room and also took some getting used to as I'm a fairly light sleeper. The grounds are very lush and tropical and nothing is more than a 5 minute walk away so quite easy to navigate. The restaurant choices are good especially for a one week stay as there's not much repetition. I started the first few mornings at Sabore's which is the main restaurant and it overlooks the large main pool. Later in the stay I discovered while not listed on the being open for breakfast on the in-room dining guide, Papitos became my a favorite way to start the day as it's steps of the beach and offers superb views out to sea. The dining is a choice of indoor or outdoors on the patio and I always chose outdoors. Papitos is also open for a lunch and the has different themes such as seafood one day, Mexican another so the menu changes enough to keep it fresh & interesting. Sabore's is a comfortable restaurant which also has different theme nights but is a little more formal and requests long dress shorts or pants for the men and dresses or nice pants for the ladies. Kiyoko and Mio Italian Cuisine were specialty restaurants and had excellent choices for every taste. The little stream in the middle of a long, central table at Kiyoko was a unique feature. The dining was all a la carte, no buffet, and in looking back I think helped me save a few pounds as it was nice but not huge portions and so didn't overindulge during the week. The food itself I found to be of a high standard and was always fresh, hot and tasty and was presented well if a little more artistically arranged than I expected. There are a few nights that they request reservations but a quick stop at the concierge office took care of that the few times I required it though it didn't seem rigidly enforced. Couples can opt to dine by themselves on the beach in a candlelit meal that can be arranged through the concierge at a small cost. Overall the dining was much better than past experiences at other all inclusives and is as El Dorado advertises as offering a \"Gourmet Inclusive\" experience. The beach while raked several times a day I got the sense it was a sculpted, created and not a natural beach. What I mean is that elsewhere I've been able to sink my feet into the sand almost to the ankle but at the Maroma was only able to scape the top surface off and go down only a inch or so. It's soft and white but not the same as other beaches I've been on. The sunken barriers offshore have also created a very shallow swimming area that varies between ankle and knee deep, though it does get much deeper past the barriers and the water there offers better snorkeling. You couldn't go too far out however due to the personal watercraft from the adjacent marina so the beach & water were drawbacks, though the availability of both loungers and the bigger and better day beds was never an issue and I spent most days lounging in the shade and reading. The main pool is large and has several different levels allowing you to put loungers right in the water. The swim up pool bar was always active and the friendly bar staff always had a smile and a drink ready. One thing I noted was that the liquor selection at these bars and around the resort was far better than I'd expected. There were at least a half dozens kinds of run including Havana Club from Cuba which is a personal favorite. The beer selection also included what became a favorite which was the Dos Equis Ambar or amber beer. The resort staff was always friendly and saying hello and interested that you were taken care of. Since it is a smaller more intimate resort I liked that you got to interact with staff regularly so you got to know each other better than is usually the case at the large mega resorts. When I mentioned I was leaving the hostess at Sabore's gave me a hug goodbye and was a nice end to a peasant week where I felt welcomed without being fauned all over. I did leave smaller tips throughout the stay as the staff works very hard, especially Linda and Lius the oustanding beach butlers who trek up & down the hot sand in hot summer weather to bring me cool drinks. My input would be to take a fistful of single U.S. dollar bills and spread them around for the excellent service received. I didn't experience the spa nor visit the gym so can't comment on either and didn't order room service during my stay. I did book at the on-site Lomas Travel office for a snorkeling excursion off Puerto Morelos and it was a great dive getting to see a shark, baracuda and manta ray up close in the wild. The reef colours were oustanding and this is one of the best dives I've done throughout the Caribbean so highly recommend it. The total including roundtrip transportation, snorkel equipment and lunch was US$70 which was not too bad for a 3-4 hour tour that included two 45 minute dives in two different parts of the reef. I can see now why the El Dorado brand is well liked as this resort offered a more upscale experience I could easily get used to. The small size is a big plus and I hope the newly constructed \"Presidentials\" being added past Papitos don't change the feel of the resort. I'm sure the other sister resorts such as El Dorado Royale and Seaside Suites have their own ambiance and I hope to stay there one day also but would return again to this wonderful hideaway of a resort if given half a chance as it really does deliver a quality resort experience unlike many, many others.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery intimate 72 room resort, great personal service, perfect for couples in love!\u201d", "Author": "chef1997", "ReviewID": "UR116986623", "Content": "We chose this resort to spend our honeymoon and we had a very wonderful, relaxing, memorable time. I found a great girl, Crissy at Trip Guy, through another random woman's review that I would like to recommend. We were beyond exhausted in picking our honeymoon destination on our own. Luckily I found Crissy (all by chance) and she guided me through everything after listening to all my \"wants and needs\" within my budget. I definitely recommend Crissy if you're looking to venture out because she has very good insight and good feedbacks from her previous clients. This resort is VERY SMALL (only 72 rooms) but fully staffed and the personal service is exceptional. There were very few folks out in the beach at any given time and all the restaurants were tasty and never any wait. Even though the restort seemed quiet, their daily schedule of things-to-do were filled from early AM yoga to late night shows and people took advantage of it. (5 people at yoga session to 15-30 max people at the late nite lounge/bar) Even though the top floor private pool seemed very enticing, we settled for the swim up suite #501. Our pool's balcony led straight into the bar at the main pool. We were told from many folks who went for the room upstairs that they wished they had booked the swim up because it was such a quick access to the BAR! :) It's really fun when you can carry your tropical drinks across the pool and straight up to your room all the while never leaving the water! The suite was equipped with an outdoor bath and an indoor bath (which we never used because showering outdoor was so awesome! we even had a little lizard come in!), very romanticly curtained and boxed in jacuzzi, huge king size canopy bed, dresser, mini fridge (stocked daily w beer, water, juices), desk, sitting area w/ couches, breakfast table, outdoor balcony w/ a full size day bed & pillows, outdoor chairs, and tanning beach chairs submerged in water. It felt like being in an apartment. One big advantage was the Maroma Beach Marina. It was only few min walk from your room. So you never had to get in a van and be bussed for any water activities. Every activity you chose was billed to the room through Luis (activity coordinator) and we had a great time. Definitely recommend off-site activities as well. The van comes to pick you up exactly at the time given and drops you off back at the hotel. www.lomas-travel.com is the company Luis works for. There were few loud groups who came and went but they all hung out at the bar and it was nice to see people having a good time. But one day you would see them and the next day, they were gone. There even was a wedding on Saturday but from where our room was, we didn't even hear a peep. But through out the entire stay, we felt very undisturbed, which was exactly what we wanted on our honeymoon. So if you're looking for action, noise, and people, this resort is not for you. We participated in the following events and activities, ALL fantastic and recommended! * private candle light dinner for 2 few feet away from the beach * 50 min couples massage at 9pm right above the water under moon light * ATV & Jetski (all from the marina) * Mayan Night w/ Mariachi Band (dinner) * Italian Night w/ Soprano (dinner) * Mexican Night w/ Mariachi Band (dinner) * Around the World Tasting with Executive Chef Francisco Perez (beyond expectations) * Rio Secreto (off-site cave diving at your own risk, very educational) www.riosecretomexico.com * Parasailing (from marina) * Xplor (unlimited zip lining, ATV riding, swimming, paddling theme park) www.xplor.travel (no .com, just as is) FYI's: * When you arrive at the airport, pretty girls will solicite you to come see their resort too. They'll ask you to pay $20 there and tell you you'll be reimbursed when you take a ride down to their resort for free breakfast and a tour. And they'll tell you that their activity rates are a lot lower than the one you'll be provided with at your own hotel. It may or may not be but you'll never know. And bargain shopping is tough when you're unfamiliar with the area. Everything they'll tell you will sound great but once you land on your own resort, they last thing you wanna do is leave to go check out another place, so avoid these sales girls and go straight outside and look for your transportation. * Also, this resort will ask you if you want to check out their \"luxury vacationing membership program.\" We went on this tour and saw their top of the line suites. They are absolutely breath-taking. If you have 11K to throw around as investment, it's well worth it because it's not like a time share, much better. And it's for life time and you can even make money selling it to friends & family. But if you don't have the $ then I would opt out of this tour because it's ~2 hours and it will only make your feeling sour if you don't have the money to spend it. :) I have a cousin who purchased one of these on her honeymoon 10 years ago in Aruba and til this day, she uses them w/ her family and she loves it.

It was our best vacation yet. The location of the resort is great - truly white beach, you can walk for 2 hours one way before the beach ends. The resort is at the end of the beach, therefore it is a very private place. You can swim in the ocean in many places as the bottom is nice, sandy. If you like to walk the beach and swim in private this is a place for you. The next resort is 40 minuts walking distance away. The resort is very cozy. We stayed on the top floor of the honeymoon suite and the view was awesome. The room was closer to apartment than just a room. There was a nice large deck with a bed for great relaxation. Overall the room was nicely appointed. The only caveat you have to like to climb the stairs (54 stairs) to the top but the privacy and view is worth it. The place has nice restaurants with very good food. No reservation was required and there was always room. The hotel has 4 special culinary events and they are worth attending. Remember to state clearly that you are not interested in joining the international travel club (unless you want to buy membership), then you have a peaceful stay and you save yourself some time with salespeople. The staff of the hotel, especially manager Eduardo, Pilar, Gabi were extraordinary. They truly care for your needs and your comments were actually valued and solutions were found. There was also a pleasant entertainment program and a small but well appointed gym in the resort. The travel agent Luis was very professional and you can get well priced trip from the place. We book two events with him and we were very pleased. There is a small private marina next to hotel so you can easily enjoy several water sports without travelling somewhere far. However, if you feel like private trip then walk the beach for 30 minuts and you see a lonely sailing boat. The owner Captain Memo is a great guy. He will take you sailing and snorkling for 80 dollars per couple for over 3 hours, He has all the equipment and lots of interesting stories to tell. We have done it and we had a great time. Snorkling is on the reef which is only 500 metres away from the beach. On the negative aspect there is unpleasant sulphur smell on the beach sometimes (from the surrounding mangrove we were told). The ocean in front of the hotel is very shallow and the colour was so so. We chose to swim in more private spot - 10 minuts walking distance from the hotel. As I have mentioned the location of the hotel is great and if you like privacy, quite beach and lots of nature this is the place for you. There are weddings almost every second day which adds to the romantic atmoshpere. Take a good mosquito repellent as after rain the place has lots of nasty bugs. Overall it was a great vacation and we will definitely come back to this resort.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Secaucus, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it!\u201d", "Author": "Ianco91", "ReviewID": "UR116308753", "Content": "The hotel is great.

You CAN do stuff..there is a marina right next door which offers jet skis, parasailing, deep-sea fishing, and some other stuff and you can book excursions through the hotel.

You can go out at anytime and still get a beach spot...and you can walk into the water probably a couple hundred feet. The sand is so soft. And, if you just want to take a long walk on the beach you can walk nearly 2 miles before you see the next resort...and the beach was nice the entire way. Oh man, I soooooo want to go back! (sigh). Oh, and although there are different styles of rooms to chose from, all of them are right there....right at the beach. If you want a great view...get a room in the 500 building.

We booked our room at the El Dorado Maroma in June of 2011 by phone using a Travel Agent discount. We contract large blocks of rooms in hotels for conferences and incentive trips and we had really hoped EDM would be a location we could use for incentive trips. We never book properties sight unseen, so this was a fact-finding mission for us. I'm sad to say that we will not be using El Dorado Maroma. As our business relies on us trusting our venues, we had grave concerns about promises made and not kept by Karisma, whether verbally given or in written confirmations. Our issues began before we arrived. I spent hours on the phone one day in June with a \"Cheryl Woolward\" getting her all of the documentation Karisma requires for a TA discounted stay agreement. After spending most of an afternoon getting through an amazing amount of red tape, \"Cheryl\" finally told me she had everything they needed. When I received the emailed .pdf confirmation, it included comped ground transportation to the resort from the airport. For the next 3 weeks I received an email a day from KHRreservations telling me that they needed our flight information to schedule our shuttle. I was unable to log in to their system using the link provided, so on July 15th I finally responded to the email with our itinerary and asked for a confirmation. I never heard back from them. On July 26th, my husband, Gary, called the number I had used in June to talk to 'Cheryl'. The woman who answered had a heavy Hispanic accent. She identified herself as \"Cheryl Woolward\" - but this was not the same voice as the woman I had worked with in June. When we asked if she had received the itinerary, 'new Cheryl' told us that they would not be including the shuttle transportation. The conversation went nowhere. Eventually we were told that we could pay for shuttle vouchers over the phone or could figure out a way to get the resort by ourselves when we got to Cancun. (~argh~) I was ready to cancel the trip - 'new Cheryl's' attitude made me more than a bit apprehensive - and angry. We had paid for the entire stay in advance, though and we couldn't get any kind of refund on our airfare, so we decided to try to make the best of the trip. ______ Wednesday, July 27 - Arrival Day When we arrived we were asked to sit down at the front desk and manually fill out more forms, including an unreadable full page, 3 point text in gray on the back of the form. I told the the clerk, Sheridan, that there was no way that I could read the text. I was met with silence as she handed me a pen. I signed (and prayed.) After checking in, we were given a tour of the property. Tropical Storm Don was off the coast, the wind was whipping and the skies were spitting. I literally laughed out loud when we were taken out to the beach and told 'this is the beach'. We were getting wet, our clothes and hair being whipped around by the wind, but by golly, we learned where the beach was! I only wish we had been given a tour of our room. It was two days before we knew that there was a remote control for the AC or that there was a mini-bar (part of the all-inclusive) in our room. My suggestion to Karisma: Unless asked - skip the property tour and have the bellmen demonstrate all of the important aspects of the room. The first thing most people want to do after spending a day traveling, is to get to their room and freshen up. Knowing where everything is and how it works is much more helpful to your guests than showing them the hurricane coming in on the beach. Thursday, July 28 - Day 2 We were awakened on our first day to the sound of banging pipes. It sounded like someone was trying to remove plumbing from the wall next to the head of our bed. The banging would last for a minute or two and then stop for ten minutes or so. Each time we thought they must be done. Since we are self-employed, we need to work wherever we may be. After traveling on Wednesday, we were behind in our work, so we plowed on, doing our best to ignore the noise. By 10 am, it was impossible to ignore and I had had enough. I walked down to the front lobby and met Ariel sitting behind the desk. I explained the situation to him and asked him to be moved. He checked his computer and told me that a 'honeymoon suite' was available in 742 - three floors above our room, 712. He told me that there would be no charge for the upgrade. I walked back to our room and continued the climb up to 742. I was very winded by the time I reached the top and realized this was not a trek I wanted to make several times a day. I went back down to our room, explained the situation to my husband, Gary, and called Ariel back. Gary asked if there were anything farther away from the noise (which we had determined by now was coming from 801 - and that the noise would be as bad in 742 as it shared the same wall that we did with 801). Eventually Ariel called back and said that they had nothing available that day, but would have 322 available on the next morning, Friday. After talking it over, we decided that we could leave the room for the rest of Thursday if we could move on Friday morning and told Ariel that that would work. Later we were sitting on the beach and Ariel came by to ask if we had moved yet. We reminded him that he had said that 322 wasn't available until the next day. He looked a bit confused. I asked him if he had confirmed that we would be moving into 322. He said, \"Yes, sure.\" As he walked away from us he picked up his Nextel and started speaking into it. I should have known then... Friday, July 29 - Day 3 We were awakened to the banging once again. We believed the annoyance would be short-lived, though, so as I happily packed up our room, Gary walked to the front desk to make the arrangements for our move to 322. Sheridan was now at the front desk and she had no record of our noise complaint nor of a promise of a move. She said that Ariel was working that day but refused to call him. And of course - 322 was no longer available - as she had promised it to someone else. They had not yet moved in, but she had promised it, and she wasn't budging. She told Gary to come back in half an hour and she would do what she could to find another available room away from the noise. Gary ran a few errands and returned, only to be told that the only other rooms available were downgrades - that would be made available to us without refunds. The downgraded rooms are on the first or second floor (many reviews warn against these rooms) and open onto the bar area, not private and not quiet. (We later met another guest on the beach who had been in the front area printing a boarding pass and had witnessed this scene - she was as shocked as we were.) Gary returned to our room and after another hour of trying to work with banging pipes, called down and asked if they could simply halt the construction in 801 until we were gone. Whoever answered told him they would \"Try\". Needless to say, the banging never did stop during the day. Saturday, Day 4 BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. Same song, different day. If there were public areas to go - a coffee shop or even a lobby that had internet access, we would have gladly moved just to get some work done. The property is VERY small and no such public areas exist. Unfortunately, these events clouded our experience of a property that otherwise has a very friendly and hospitable staff. Saturday night was our last night, so we stopped by the desk to make arrangements for tips to be charged to our credit card (Don't ask why, but we had come to Mexico with no cash...) Sheridan asked if she could do anything else for us. We asked for a 5:45 am wake up call and coffee room service for 6:30 the next morning, as we had a 7 am departure shuttle. Sunday, July 31st - Departure Day At 6:25 the next morning we both woke up with a start - realizing that our wake up call had not come. Coffee and breakfast arrived right on time, but we were so busy rushing to get ready we didn't have time to partake. ::sigh:: ____________________________ THE GOOD LOCATION - amazingly quiet and beautiful beach, right next to the marina. Our afternoons at the beach almost made up for the banging we endured until almost noon each day. THE STAFF - The front desk and reservation office personnel aside - the rest of the staff is wonderfully hospitable and service oriented. Cindy met us every night at Sabores and Kiyoko, greeting us by name. Emilio remembered not only my name, but my drink - and fixed them beautifully each and every time. Linda, Luis and Diego provided attentive and efficient drink service to us on the beach. THE BED - beautifully made up with flowers and towel animals every day; the mattress was thick and firm and was very comfortable. We slept well every night. HOUSEKEEPING - our room, with the exception of the infinity pool, was immaculately kept. GARDENS AND PUBLIC AREAS - The grounds were beautifully kept. SABORES SPECIALTY RESTAURANT - The Mayan trio, the Soprano on Italian night and the Mariachi band were all talented and fun additions to each specialty meal. ___________________ ___________________ THE BAD ___________________ ROOM - aside from the noise, our room was very dark. The infinity pool was not filled (about a foot shy from the top) and therefore didn't spill over creating the infinity effect. I think this also affected the filtering - as the two spouts that should have been pouring water into the pool were never turned on. As a result, we had a large body of stagnant water on our deck. Clouds of green and brown mold occupied parts of the pool and plenty of dead bugs floated on top. All I could think about when looking at it was 'mosquito breeding grounds'. On our last full day, someone came in to clean the pool. When he left, I excitedly put on my bathing suit and spent no time jumping in - and jumped back out again. He had added water and the bugs were gone, but the filter was still not turned on and the mold was still very much present. _____ There was also an unpleasant odor in our room (I found myself saying \"What IS THAT SMELL?\" each time we entered.) The housekeeper sprayed something pleasant every time the room was serviced - twice a day, but the treatment was short lived and by mid-afternoon the smell was back. The inside shower in our room did not drain. (Maybe this was the problem with the pipes they were trying to fix?) I used the outside shower and enjoyed it until it started raining - which caused water to run off of a wall from the next floor up, jutting out over our shower. The water collected grit along the way and dumped the cold mixture directly onto my head. EEEEEEEeeee... _____________ YMMV - (YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY) or IT IS WHAT IT IS... Karisma advertises \"Gourmet Inclusive\" - We found the food to be OK, but not spectacular. On several occasions, what was served didn't come close to the description on the menu - a seafood cocktail was described as a mixture of shellfish in a light garlic / olive oil dressing was actually several small (think canned) shrimp in a sea of tomato sauce, topped with a dollop of guacamole. The presentation of the food was almost without exception, well executed. The taste was not always a pleasant surprise. The BBQ chicken served at lunch, for instance was extremely fatty. A tenderloin steak I ordered medium rare came out all but completely raw. TOPLESS BEACH As others have mentioned, the beach is clothing optional. If I had as beautiful a body as those going topless, I'd have shed mine as well. I was hoping to avoid sending people screaming and running from the beach, though, so I my top stayed up. The nudity did not bother us - YMMV. 24 HOUR ROOM SERVICE - We ordered breakfast from the room service menu on our first morning - all 6 options include toast, pastries, juice, coffee and fruit. The pastries and fruit were fresh and unique. Very tasty. The omelets were also well prepared and tasty. The toast was a crouton. Is this a cultural thing? It was as if it had been baked all night long in a very low oven. The menu after breakfast is very limited. Your choices consist of a Chicken Burrito, a Club Sandwich, a Hamburger or a Hot Dog. _______ TIDBITS ________ JET SKIS - who knew? You really should be in pretty good shape to jet ski. I had a terrible time controlling the steering - especially in deeper waters. Had I been warned, I would have chosen a speed boat tour. I was sore for two days after one half hour stint. ROUCH! (Gary had a GREAT time. But he does 75 push-ups every other morning and had NO trouble steering... :o/) ________ PREPARE TO CLIMB - Obviously ADA is a USA law, but I was surprised by how IN-accessible much of this property is. There are no elevators anywhere, but steps do abound. ________ BRING CASH - there is no ATM at the El Dorado Maroma and the front desk will not cash checks or advance cash on a credit card - the cab ride into Playa is a minimum of $25. On our last day we were allowed to charge $175 for gratuities to our credit card. This required me to take notes on my phone of every bartender, server, housekeeper and bellman. It would have been SO much easier to have been able to tip as we went. Related: DON'T EXCHANGE YOUR CASH AT THE AIRPORT The exchange rate at the airport was 9.48 pesos to the dollar. We were told that the exchange rate at most hotels was 10.50-11.35 on that particular day. I don't know if you can exchange cash at El Dorado Maroma - as we had none to exchange. Sheridan had made a point of telling us that they had no cash at the front desk, so my guess is that those hoping to exchange money are in the same situation as those of us looking for an ATM. I did notice others tipping with US Dollars, however, and none were turned down. __________ AVOID THE \"GREETERS\" IN THE AIRPORT - After getting your luggage and leaving the customs area, just passed the money exchange, before you can get out the door you are met with a horde of people dressed in light blue shirts, tan pants or skirts and tan ties. The signs on both sides say something along the lines of \"Information\". BEWARE - these folks are there to sign you up for time share tours. We were roped in - we had been told to look for Lomas Travel reps wearing teal shirts and white pants. The pale blue and khaki confused us. Ay-yi-yi. It took several adament 'No's to get away...", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland Park, NJ", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful with some flaws\u201d", "Author": "Schoolsalive", "ReviewID": "UR116222195", "Content": "My wife and I have traveled around the world and often go to Bermuda. We decided to try something different and are glad we visited the El Dorado. Below is my breakdown of the pros and cons of this resort: 1. Service- Terrific. Everything you've read on TripAdvisor about the service at El Dorado is 100% accurate. We truly appreciated the lovely people and felt pampered throughout our stay. 2. Beach- Beautiful (as stated in numerous reviews). Being used to Bermuda's pink sand and beautiful water, we had high expectations. We loved dipping in the shallow water and watching the fish (and stingrays on occasion) all around us. Yes, there are unsightly barriers about 200 feet off shore, but trey did not detract from the overall beauty of the beach. Yes, there is a marina that sends out wave-runners and catamarans beside the beach. Again, this did not detract from the scenery (although it was a bit noisy). The smell you've read about would come and go, but we were able to let it go after the first day. 3. Food- The food was good but not excellent. Restaurants do not serve gourmet-level meals, and the wine list is mediocre. I 4. Room- Our room was likely the finest in which we've stayed in our many travels over the years. Spend the extra money to get the infinity pool room and do be sure to request and wait for the third or fourth-floor rooms (particularly in the Block 3 or Block 4 section). See the picture of our room in this review. 5. Overall ambience- The grounds of the property were lovely. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed strolling and/or just watching the views from our balcony. What I will say was a problem with this resort was the draw of two loud groups of people. As you've read on TripAdvisor, you're out of luck if you come to a small resort like this looking for quiet and are suddenly overwhelmed by noisy and obnoxious individuals. I would advise the hotel staff to be more assertive and firm so such parties can be dealt with properly.

The color of the water and the beach are just breathtaking. One of the morning devotionals we read during our stay talked about stopping to enjoy the MOMENT that God gives us each day instead of rushing around life. We looked around at what we were somewhat taking for granted and were blown away by God's creation. Ocean water where you can see your feet out 100-200 yards in the water from the beach, colorful birds, lush flowers, trees ... a 3D of colors everywhere. Blessed beyond imagination. Accommodations: We spent 2 nights in a Honeymoon Suite (700 unit) and 2 nights in an Infinity Pool Suite (300 unit). Both rooms offered different views; loved the cold plunge that the Infinity Pool Suite offers after a day at the ocean. Had stayed at ED Seaside twice and in a Swim-Up Suite; both have advantages! Rooms have everything you can ask. Once you use the outside shower, you will NEVER use the inside shower again. Beds were extremely comfortable. Property was just opening a chapel last weekend and an adjacent area where a wedding party can stay together in one block. On the south end of the property they are building 1BR presidential suites (10/2011 roll-out). Both new builds will have staggering views but will still keep the intimacy of the property true as far as < 100 rooms. Food/Drink: My wife is a vegetarian, so that can create a problem sometimes ... not here. The Asian food at Kiyoko and the Italian fare at Mio Cuccina were both real good. We ate in Sabores during their Italian-themed evening; food was great and the Opera singer created a wonderful mood and stole the evening. Options for Sabores at lunch are extensive and very good, as well as during breakfast if you don't want the ever-changing buffet options closer to the beach (which are quick and refreshing). Room service options ... plenty. Butlers on the beach were fantastic. Both pools were enjoyable, but hard to stay away from the beach beds because of the view or in an Infinity Pool suite because of the cool water, privacy and the view. If only they could deliver mixed drinks up the balconies! Staff: So many people stress first names in reviews to recommend getting great service. EVERYONE we met exceeded our expectations, but we'll remember Enrique (bellmen), who is a Cali native studying underwater engineering locally; Camacho (activities), you'll never believe he lived in So. Utah for 11 years; Luis (Lomas), be sure to ask him about his wife who is expecting a child in September; and Carmina (concierge), who was simply fabulous. We also requested a presentation from Exotic Travel and Jeannette was very helpful and didn't press for answers. Things To Do: The Marina on the north side of the property is great to have close with plenty of options. We did the Ocean Safari (jet ski/snorkeling) and loved it, but you can do a similar excursion on a catamaran which looks fun if it's a problem for you getting up/off/on a jet ski in the middle of the ocean. Note: The pirate boat (you'll notice the flag) traveling around takes your picture during Marina activities, so check the Marina afterward to review and buy your pics. Book through Lomas on-site. We both had pedis done at the spa and had a great experience. We walked 1.5 miles toward the Secrets Maroma property to the north and plenty to see and good exercise. The busyness at Secrets told us we were in the right place. Walking south you'll see mangroves and more desolate; stay North. Because the property faces the SE (you'll see Cozumel across the way), you won't see a true sunrise or sunset at the beach or looking out from your room.

It was not enough! We stayed here about 3 years ago, but due to circumstances, this was our first chance to return. We have now vowed to visit more often! We stayed in a swim-up, just a few seconds float from the Sabores pool bar. The room was beautiful, but starting to show a little wear & tear. Some of the furniture pieces had chips and defects appearing in the surfaces, but not enough to make the room feel \u201cshabby\u201d. Though the room was beautiful, we will not spend the extra money for a swim-up in future stays because WE WERE NEVER IN IT!!!! With the exception of meals, we found ourselves on the beach or in a pool the entire day! The beach is beautiful, though the water is too shallow for swimming. The \u201cwhales\u201d are unsightly, but are necessary to protect this beautiful site. We saw some people snorkeling, but cannot vouch for their experience. Service on the beach was outstanding, with staff of all levels walking around offering whatever they could to make your day better. Speaking of staff be sure to acquaint yourself with Linda and Luis from the 24 Bar. They take turns serving guests on the beach and do a fantastic job! When they made the effort to identify me sitting in the water 20 yards out, and via hand signals determined whether I needed another Mai Tai, they definitely deserved extra recognition ($$$) at the end of my stay! The restaurants were, for the most part, excellent. Our favorite was Papitos(?) on the beach. We found this to be the best place to eat breakfast and lunch. We introduced ourselves to Lisbeth (the hostess) the first day, and every time thereafter, we were greeted by first name. She would explain the dishes, the culture, and advise of upcoming special menus. This place had a special lunch every day of the week, with skewers one day, fresh fish on another, etc. WHATEVER you do, try to catch the Paella (Saturday?)! Served with Sangria, it was LOADED with chunks of chicken, popcorn shrimp, whole jumbo shrimp, mussels, and a variety of vegetables. Breakfast was a buffet with cooked to order omelets, eggs, meats, potatoes, etc. There is a menu available but we never asked for it. We only ate 1 meal at Sabores (breakfast) and it was a bit of a disappointment, at least for us. Dinners at Mio Cuccina Italiana and Kiyoko (Oriental) were excellent, with a large selection available. Being a pasta lover, the Italian was probably my favorite. If you order something from each course, I guarantee you will be full for 3 days! As this is a small resort (72 rooms), you really start to bond with other guests. We had a great time visiting with Collette & Dennis (Canada), Paul & Joanne (New York), Julie from England & her husband, and Hugh & Lara from Australia. There were many others but I cannot remember all their names (Mai Tai\u2019s clouding my memory, maybe? LOL) Another benefit of the small size was the interaction with the staff. The Bellhop Enrique is a TV and movie buff, and will gladly regale you with his trivia knowledge! Linda & Luis from the 24 Bar have come up with some interesting drink concoctions, including a shot named \u201cThe Linda\u201d. And tell her I recommended one called \u201cPoop in the Grass\u201d.

It was a much needed get away from work and reality. This was our first all-inclusive as well as our first adults only resort. We were greeted with chilled sparkling wine and moist, scented towels. Our bags were taken to our room and we were let to a table by the main pool for lunch. It could not have been any \"easier\" in any aspect. The resort is small, quiet and beautiful! We made tons of friends through playing volleyball, horseshoes, hanging out at Rick's bar or just having drinks at the pool. We were able to get the same cabana front and center each morning and there were usually one or two available at all times of the day. As I said, this was our first all inclusive and so we were worried about the food....unless you are just picky beyond belief, the food is good. Not exactly great, but good. Breakfast was wonderful. Lunch was not bad but after 7 days, it gets to be repetative but that's to be expected. The specialty dinners each night were hit and miss but I think it was more a factor of what we ordered. The beer was always cold....Luis, our beach butler, was like lightning. We always had a drink in hand, even if it was just a bottle of water. All of the bartenders were friendly and actually very \"alcohol educated\". The beach is absolutely beautiful! Gorgeous white sand with wave breakers a hundred yards out so the water is always calm and the sand is so soft. We woke up one morning and got massages on the water and it was perfect! The resort is very new and very clean. The room was HUGE for what we paid and was kept very tidy by the the maid. We loved the outdoor shower as well ; ) I honestly do not have a single complaint about this place. We were attended to, greeted and made to feel like family at the Maroma. Thanks guys!

I will start at the beginning and try not to repeat what a majority of reviewers stated as this was a lovely resort. My wife and I stayed at EDM from 7/10 through 7/17 and were looking forward to a relaxing, intimate, quiet vacation as this resort has only 72 rooms and is adult only. WEDDING PARTIES There was a wedding party there during our stay; we have no problems with wedding parties, but we did with this particular group. I have never encountered a group that was so loud, obnoxious, drunk and inconsiderate of other guests. Here are some examples: While my wife and I attempted to enjoy the ocean front view from our balcony and sit in our Infinity pool we could see a few people in this group at the main pool below. One individual flicked a lit cigarette at his friend into the pool ( yes the pool that ALL the guests use) and proceeded to jump in the pool with his can of beer and wrestle with his cohort, beer forgotten and left to sink in the bottom of the pool that ALL the guests use. This wasnt so terrible, but we paid alot of $$ for an ocean front room with an Infinity pool. Unfortunately whenever we were on our balcony the pool below sounded like a busy Holiday Inn (from the drunken behavior of the wedding party). Rather than hearing the sounds of the birds, the ocean, the breeze etc. we were treated to very loud vulgar behavior. profanity and drunken lewdness of about half the wedding party at a time (30 people or so). We quickly learned that wherever the wedding party went, we simply went elsewhere. Sometimes this was difficult because if we were at the beach for example, we could constantly hear the loud group from either the main pool or the small pool that EDM calls of all things the \"quiet\" pool. I asked my wife if I was being a bit too sensitive concerning this intrusion and she said absolutely not, We had met some other guests and they also were quite upset with the shennanigans of this wedding party. My advice to future travelers: Make sure to check with the resort if there is a wedding party booked for the dates you decide to stay. I am sure that the majority of wedding parties there are never a problem but this one in particular ruined the first half of our one week stay We really wanted this week to de-stress and enjoy each other's company. The good news: When the wedding party left the ambience of the resort changed entirely. The resort became peaceful, quiet and zen-like which is exacly what we read on TA and what we were expecting. THE BEACH The beach was beautiful!! Never once did we need to search out a beach bed or an umbrella and no \"towel game\" here. Hola to Linda and Luis who worked very hard all day long in the hot sun bringing guests cold beverages. The ocean water was very warm, like bath water. Due to the barriers about 100 yards out or so there are no waves at all. It is also a bit difficult to really swim agressively in this ocean because the water as far out to the barriers only comes up to your waist. I am an \"ocean\" person and love riding the waves, swimming etc. but one cannot do this at EDM. This was not a huge deal to me this trip as the beach and ocean was so beautiful. I never had a problem getting snorkeling equipment, it was always available. I recommend as other reviewers have to swim out between the barriers and here you will see some fish and small (baby?) stingrays--I saw just one stingray when I snorkeled. THE FOOD We are foodies and I am fairly certain that with all the planning for this trip I most likely got my hopes to high. Remember that the food is all-inclusive. The food was good, we never had a \"bad\" meal. But at the same time nothing \"wowed' us or compelled me to share a bite so my wife doesn't \"miss out\" on something (which we always do if something is great). If you are used to sushi in a big city, you may find this sushi disappointing--but it wasn't \"bad\". THE ENTERTAINMENT Thank you Ariel--for doing a great job with the night-time entertainment. The Michael Jackson show was awesome ( and I was never even a big MJ fan) and you dont want to miss it! We also really loved the Fire Dance show as well--very cool. Most nights the bar gets very quiet by aroud 10:00 p m or so. Since my wife and I tend to like our drinks more so at night then during the day, we often were the only ones at the bar at 10 and we usually called it a night by 11. THE STAFF Here is where I really regret having written anything negative at all about EDM because we really fell in love with the staff. They are truly wonderful people as almost every previous reviewer has pointed out. Here are some folks that really \"stood out\" and made our trip extra special just by being so great (it is my hope that managment reads this and commends these folks) LISBETH--hostess at Pepitos for breakfast and lunch. Makre sure you get to know Lisbeth--she is not only beautiful but also warm and friendly and always greeeted my wife and me with a giant smile. Every morning she taught me some new phrases in Spanish and spent a couple of minutes each day speaking with us. Mucho gusto bonita Lisbeth! CINDY-hostess? manager ? at Kiyoko and Mios. CIndy has to be one of the sweetest and kindest people we have ever met at any resort. By the end of the week she was giving the wife and me hugs every time we arrived at dinner--that's just how Cindy operates. One really nice thing Cind/y did for us: We were told that the Michael Jackson show was not to be missed and it started at 9 p.m. Well, we were still finishing dinner at around 8:45 so we asked Cindy if it \"fills up\" at Ricks Bar where the show is held. She said not to worry--she will save us a front row seat. This was great but this wasn't what impressed us. What impressed us was that during the show we saw Cindy pop her head in (Ricks is upstairs from the restaurant so Cindy had to leave her post) just to wave and make sure we got our seats that she saved for us. What impressed my wife and me was that Cindy really didn't need to do this--she just checked on us because she cared. We really miss you Cindy! GABY--Gaby is a delightful waitress at Sabores--she even sang a song with the Mariachi band when they performed one night. She was always smiling and took very good care of us during dinner. REUBEN--Reuben was our waiter most mornings and at many lunches. Sometimes we spent as long as 10 minutes chatiing with Reuben if he wasn't busy as he was just so enjoyable- a great sense of humor and quick to laugh. FERNANDO--my wife really thought Fernando was cute--I thought Fernando was very fun-loving and pleasant to talk to as well. ISRAEL--was very professional and polite. ARIEL--I mentioned you earlier ARIEL and again hats off to you on a job well done with the Entertainment. VITALE--was our waiter a couple of times and he is extremely professional. He gave me some ideas as to what tequila to order as sadly EDM does not have Don Julio Silver. Other folks who we thought did a great job were GABO, AURELIO, ALEJANDRO and the excellent maid service. DRINKS We enjoyed all the drinks. They were not watered down and all were very well made--some of the frozen ones were a bit on the sweet side--but that is such a subjective matter. We missed Don Julio this trip so we mostly drank SKYY vodka or Stolis. BOTTOM LINE--We loved this resort. Yes it was a rocky start with the loud group there. But the grounds are immaculate, the beach.,pools and rooms are gorgeous. The food didnt \"knock our socks off\" but it was good and we never had a bad meal. If we come again. which we very well may, we will check to make sure there aren't any large groups booked here.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima", "Title": "\u201cBest staff, best beach, best food.\u201d", "Author": "rossanastyle", "ReviewID": "UR115662446", "Content": "Thank you to all the wonderful staff of El Dorado Maroma for the mervelous days we had there.

It was recommended to us by our travel agent, and overall, we really enjoyed our experience and would return again. PROS: -Great air conditioning. The AC is very powerful, which was a nice treat. We've been to many resorts where there is either no AC or it's very weak. -Comfortable rooms and beds. Everything was very spacious and clean and comfortable. They somehow knew when we left our rooms for even an hour, and they would find time to refresh it and remake the bed or pick up trash. It was surprisingly quiet, too - we never heard a peep from any other guests while in our rooms! -Staff was super friendly, people remembered our names and our drinks and our favorite food orders, we felt so welcome during our entire stay. There's nothing worse than going to a resort and getting a bad attitude from an employee, but there was no chance of that happening here! -Free 24-hour room service!! Fast and delicious, I miss it already! -Food was really good. Loved the guac and black bean dip at Sabores during the day, the truffle risotto at Mio was soooooo good as was the teppanyaki and satay at Kiyoko. Every meal was really good, and there are a lot of options for it being such a small resort. I also loved that they would bring around snacks for the people in the pools throughout the day, which was nice. -On most days there were, at most, 10 people at the main pool and 5 people at the smaller pool. The beach was very large and generally had more people, but it still never felt crowded. There are outdoor beds EVERYWHERE which was so nice. If you want quiet and calm, this is a good place to get it (unless a big group shows up - see below). -They have a travel agent on site who can set up all kinds of activities and excursions for you. He was not pushy and gave us lots of different price options. The trips are pricey, but that's to be expected in a touristy area. We did Xplor and the Dolphin Trainer for a Day and absolutely loved them both. -Swim-up bar at the main pool was awesome, we spent 90% of our time there. The bartenders are hilarious and very friendly, the drinks are awesome, even the snack mix they have is addicting. Our #1 priority for our honeymoon was a good swim up bar, and this one was the best we've seen so far. -ATVs, horseback riding, jet skiing, snorkeling, parasaling, kayaking, and a marina are all on-site, so you don't have to leave the resort to do any of that. CONS: -TV was not great. Most of the stations had very poor reception or had a loud buzzing noise over the audio. There were a lot of stations to choose from, which was good, but only one or two that we could really watch. Surprisingly a lot of English speaking stations, which was great! -Private room pools do not have any kind of filtration, so the water was absolutely nasty after our first day. I saw them emptying and refilling the pools every time a guest left, but honestly they all needed to be cleaned out on a daily basis, or else some kind of cleaner should be put in them. We paid $1000 extra for the private pool room, and I felt like that was a huge waste of money. The swim-up suites or the Royal Suite were definitely the place to be. -Beach is very very shallow. There is a big barrier surrounding the beach area, and I think the deepest area within that barrier was up to my knees. Not a lot of swimming to be had on the beach, just wading. A few things that are worth noting: -This is not a big \"nightlife\" place. Rick's Bar is a bit of a joke - one you can enjoy, if you have a good attitude, but if you're looking for serious clubbing, you'll need to go elsewhere. We enjoyed the Michael Jackson impersonator on Friday nights, that was a big hit! -Crabs in the pool. We found four or five of them every day. They were actually really fun to play with and take pictures of, so for me this was more of a pro than a con :) I stepped on them several times (accidentally) and never got pinched. However we did meet a girl who refused to get in the pools because she was scared of them. -Because the resort is so small, when a large group shows up, they can dominate the whole resort. While we were there a group of 60 people showed up for a wedding, and they were the biggest group of douchebags I have ever seen. They ran around screaming, throwing things, slamming doors, shouting obscenities, bragging about how much cocaine they did and how they were all cheating on their wives and girlfriends (who were too busy dancing drunk on the bars to notice), and generally acting like three year olds, and they made the resort extremely difficult to enjoy. I could tell that the management was struggling to deal with them, considering they were taking up at least half the resort. They even had to shut down the bar early one night because the guys were peeing everywhere. The four or five days the group was there were really miserable for everyone else at the resort. If I were going back, I would check with the management to make sure there wasn't going to be another large group there during my stay. -While there we met a bunch of people who were Exotic Travel Club members, and that sounded like a great deal.. I've heard people complain about the shpiel they give you about the membership, but from the people we talked to who did it, it sounded amazing and well worth the cost. They were all staying there for around $100-200 for a whole week, and they all had the upgraded Royal Suites. Definitely worth looking into if you travel a lot. -There were a lot of activities, but they were not well publicized.. The Activity board appeared to only be updated on weekends, and then only with Sunday and Monday's activities. Would have loved to attend the cocktail making class or the cooking class or some of the other activities, but I could never find out when or where they took place. -A few people have mentioned the bad smell.. There are signs about this throughout the resort, it's the result of the mangroves in the area.. Not the hotel's fault, it's a local quirk. We only noticed it once or twice, usually after a rainfall. Not a big deal. Overall, it was a great resort if you're looking for something small and relaxing. We especially enjoyed the food and room service and the swim up bars!

Half-way through our stay, my wife and I discussed moving to a different resort but decided that we had too much money invested in the vacation to spend more at another resort. We were extremely disappointed given the great reviews on this website. Food - We found the food to be very mediocre, nowhere near their marketing hype of gourmet inclusive. The Japanese (Kiyoko), Italian (Mio) and themed dinners should be skipped altogether. I found that the best way to get decent food is to order room service for breakfast and the pool patio area of Sabores for lunch. Pipitos offers a buffet but the food seemed to be sitting out for hours without being refreshed. Beach - The resort would like for you to believe that they're on the stretch of Maroma Beach that's been designated by the Travel Channel as one of the Best Beaches in the world. The truth is that this distinction is reserved for Moroma Hotel, which is now Maroma Resort and Spa and is located a mile north of El Dorado. El Dorado's beach is adequate but I found it difficult to relax given the constant jet-ski and music from excursion boats at the marina. And the black mounds that are used to prevent beach erosion are very unsightly! Misc. - An issue that you should be aware of is the constant pushing of their \"Exotic Travel Club\", if you do sit through the 90-minute presentation; ask for a resort credit rather than a free dinner or massage. The dinner and massage costs them nothing but the resort credit will be deducted from your total bill at the end of your stay.

My husband and I wanted a quiet, relaxing getaway on a small resort. The fact that this is all-inclusive and adults only is definitely a bonus. The food was outstanding at every restaurant, especially Kiyoko! We feel in love with the sushi! The chefs take a lot of pride in their cooking, and it shows. We ordered room service a few times, as it was nice to have some waffle fries for a midnight snack! Each plate we had was outstanding, including the cheesecake! I can't say enough about how friendly and welcoming the staff is. They go over the top to ensure that you are taken care of and satisfied at all times, but without smothering you. The bartenders at Sabores bar and 24 bar, Carlos, Renee and Franklin, were amazing, they knew us by name and created original drinks for us to try based on what we liked. The beach butler service was great as well. Our room was very clean when we arrived and the staff was prompt about keeping it tidy and stocking our fridge. We mostly wanted to relax on the beach and in the pool on our trip, but we did consult Luis for a snorkeling tour. He was very helpful and friendly. The beach was absolutely incredible. The sand was powdery soft and white. We loved the fact that we were not surrounded by other large resorts, and they were out of sight unless you were to take a long walk around the bend. It was quiet and calm, and there were plenty of daybeds and lounge chairs so we always had our choice of where to camp out. The water was clear and cool. We snorkeled in the swimming area one day and were amazed at what was under our feet! We found plenty of fish, stingrays, crabs, and a lobster! I would definitely recommend grabbing a snorkel and exploring a bit. Overall this was just perfect for my husband and I. We had a blast meeting other couples (usually at the swim up bars). Every one one of them commented on how much they love El Dorado Maroma, and many had been there before. We knew after our first day that this is a place we will come back to! Thank you to the staff for making it such a beautiful, peaceful, friendly place to visit!", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon in Paradise!!\u201d", "Author": "TXTechTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR114942120", "Content": "Upon check-in, the lobby is simple compared to many of the larger resorts in Mexico. We were on our honeymoon and wanted to discuss upgrade prior to checking in, but the desk agent wanted to show us the room options prior to discussing prices. We ended up discussing pricing first and made the decision to upgrade from a Mi Hotelito room to a second-floor room with an infinity pool, overlooking the main pool (for those who are interested, the resort was 60% full and we paid $75/night for the upgrade). We were in room 511, which had a lovely view of the palm trees and main pool with just a sliver of ocean. The patio was WONDERFUL. We spent time each evening and afternoon enjoying the day bed, the infinity pool and the lounge chairs. Many people on here have mentioned the pools being cold, but late in the afternoon (even after the sun was down), it felt great on a sunburn. The upgrade was absolutely worth it for the outdoor space\u2014next time I would book that category. After visiting El Dorado Maroma, I see why everyone mentions the people in their reviews. They are amazing. We tipped often, because the servers worked so hard, took such good care of us and had great attitudes. I am not sure how anyone (and we are both picky eaters and selective drinkers) could have a need unfulfilled at this resort. The employees knew us by name, knew our drinks and did everything they could to make our stay more pleasant. Our favorites (and I am sure we are still leaving some out) were: Alfredo, Lizbeth, Pilar, Isidro, Elizabeth, Ruben, Hermelinda, Carlos, Luis, Diego, Aurelio, Israel, Paola and Sergio. And to management: promote Paulina!! We enjoyed the sunset sky massages (we had a resort credit through our booking with AAVacations) and it was super relaxing. I had booked a deep tissue for me and Swedish for my husband, but we both got Swedish/relaxation massages. I didn\u2019t say anything, but would have if we\u2019d paid for them. We ate breakfast everyday at Pepito\u2019s. I am used to my Starbucks lattes in the a.m., but if you put enough cream in the coffee, it gets the job done. Breakfast was always fulfilling and good and prepared us well for the \u2018tough\u2019 day ahead (laying on the beach). We had dinner at Sabores more than once, the second time we had to go back for more of the shrimp soup\u2014it was addictive. We really enjoyed Kiyoko, the Japanese restaurant. The sushi tasted fresh and we didn\u2019t have any issues with saltiness mentioned by other reviewers. Between my husband and I, we\u2019ve stayed at many nice AI resorts in Mexico (most recently Secrets Maroma) and we\u2019d rank the food at EDM higher than all of them. The liquor was all top-shelf\u2014we\u2019d highly recommend the Coco Loco and the Dorado Maromas if you are looking for something fruity to enjoy on the beach. The beach is just as picturesque as it looks. The sand is powdery soft and the water is clear. You can walk out 100 yards and still only be in waist-deep water. We really liked the lagoon-feel of the ocean outside the resort. You could take a raft out in it and just float a few feet from your frozen umbrella drink. I was a little concerned about whether the erosion protectors would \u2018spoil\u2019 the view, but after the first day, you really don\u2019t even notice them. One of the couples we met took their snorkel gear out there and said there was some great marine life in the man-made habitat. We read this suggestion on here and would highly recommend it others: take a drink (in our case, we asked the bartenders to put wine in a water bottle so we wouldn\u2019t have glass on the beach), some water and a snack and walk about 20-30 minutes north of the resort. There are nothing but mangroves out there and more gorgeous beaches. We had our own private beach for the afternoon. You couldn\u2019t see any other people, the only voices we heard were our own, and it was so peaceful and romantic. This resort is perfect for couples seeking a quiet, romantic trip or groups of friends. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for someone looking for crazy nightlife (one night we were in Rick\u2019s with a few other couples playing songs off of YouTube!). All in all, we\u2019d definitely go back again!

ROOM We booked a Swim Up suite and were in room #801 - second to last away from the beach but very private and we could still see the ocean. The room layouts are all the same in that building, with beds so comfortable to waste away half of the day's sun and just different balconies (swim up, infinity pool or honeymoon suite - with a larger balcony area). Bathrooms are spacious with double sink, jacuzzi tub and oversized shower. Towels are big & soft and lotions are lightly scented. BEACH The beach is truly one of the best in Mexico, with clear (albeit shallow) water and soft sand and the marina next door means there's always something to watch on the water. Couldn't believe how many lounge chairs were at the beach & pool. Enough for everyone no matter how long you spend in bed & sun or shade is not a problem. Love that beach towels are 'help yourself' with a place to deposit used ones. Towel saving does NOT happen here - very refreshing! FOOD They have a new beachfront restaurant \"Pepitas\" that offers a buffet breakfast and different specialties each day of the week. Why would you want to go all the way to Mexico and order a cheeseburger? Tuesdays are Boutique Burger day and trust me, they are unbelievable. The views from this restaurant are amazing and Lizbeth and the other staff will truly make you feel welcome (and teach you a little Spanish along the way!). The Italian restaurant, Sabores (Mediterranean), and Asian were also good. Being from Vancouver, our standards for sushi are pretty high and we ate there twice that week (mostly for the sashimi - yum!). SERVICE To put our stay in perspective, I'm a travel agent and have stayed at most of the 4*+ resorts in the Mayan Riviera & a lot throughout the rest of Mexico & the Caribbean.

Our balcony was filthy, only because the wood beams and thatch roof was old. Food was good, probably better than average in our 5 years of going to Cancun/Playa Del Carmen. Staff was extremely friendly and cooperative. My guess is many of the reviews are from the \"members\" who go down there every year the same weeks.

The beach is very nice. however realize there is a marina literally 100 yrds from the resort beach. Water is very nice and shallow out quite a ways.

The three guys were all celebrating a big 40 so it was a special trip. First, do not let the underimpressive reception area throw you. I am surprised more havent mentioned this, but we were literally scared when we saw the simple reception. We thought we couldnt handle a week of this cheesy little resort. But then we got the tour and it blew our minds. The resort was not too big but not too small, was impeccably maintained and on the beach. The beach area here was especially protected from several barriers right in front, which other beaches didnt have. Second, the manager, Isidro, was outstanding. He was calm, patient, understanding and cared deeply about customer service. We had to wait a long time when we arrived and it left all 6 of us in an unsavory mood....but he was able to turn us all around and we had a marvelous time for the entire week. Third, I am a foodie. I was very skeptical of an all inclusive resort. But the food was very good. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world. This place is not a Michelin 5 star, but the food was good to very good. Top shelf alcohol too, so dont worry about being stuck with just Montezuma tequila. (Although the only beers available were Dos Equis an Tecate). Fourth, the close-by excursions were great. It is not easy to coordinate 6 people, but Luis at the travel desk (not technically part of the resort) did an outstanding job. He found affordable excursions that fit our schedule and each of them were top notch. He would run around the resort and find us even for last minute requests. We put him through the ringer and he handled it wonderfully. Fifth, the rooms are lovely. They have outdoor beds, which I promise you will use. Constructive criticism....the non-pool and non-beach bar, Ricks, is not lively, to say the least. Each night we went there it was a zombie fest. Maybe everyone was nursing hangovers from drinking all day in the sun! ;) Also, didn't like that WIFI cost $15 a day.

We asked to move to the third floor and the view was better there yet we still had palm trees slightly blocking our view. We also had an infinity pool suite. Don't waste your money on these rooms as they are higher priced than the other rooms. The pools do not have water that circulates and there were lots of bugs in ours and algae spots. Birds also bathed in our pool each morning. There are two outside pools with swim up bars. The pools are nice with great lay out chairs and one has lay out beds. The resort is \"all inclusive\" however we were asked several times if we wanted to \"upgrade\" our dinner, our room, and then asked to go to a sales presentation to join their travel club which was $6,500. When we declined, the sales guy acted \"ticked off\" at us and basically pushed us out the door. We were told that we would not be pressured to buy and that we would receive a coupon for a free romantic dinner on the beach. We DID get a \"romantic\" dinner out of the deal after asking for our coupon. While we were there, we had a massage on the beach. The massage is the best thing they have going for them. It was spectacular-approx. $200 per couple if you get the massage before 12 noon. The food was good and we did not get sick during the visit. The mixed drinks were larger than usual. They have coconut drinks on Wed. and Fri. called coco locos. If you are a younger couple (not retirement age) you might want to bring extra money to do some excursions.

There are not many activities to do at the resort unless you want to paint a ceramic( that you have to purchase), go to a spanish lesson, play chess or checkers, or ping pong.

Upon check-in they tried to put us in a room for which was not even in the same category. We booked an infinity pool room with ocean front view. They were going to put us in a section called Mi Hotelito which is not even close to the same category. After telling them that this was not acceptable and reminding them as to what we booked they showed us a room with an infinity that was ocean front, but you could not see the ocean at all due to the overgrown palm trees. You couldn't even see a sliver of the ocean from the ground floor or second story. All the palm trees on the property were grossly overgrown. Finally, after four hours of waiting and calmly explaining that we have no problem going on down the road to El Dorado Royale, they accomodated us with an infinity pool room on the third floor ocean front. Once in the room we loved it. It was clean, decorated nicely and well stocked. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the outdoor shower was cool. However, I would imagine that in a couple of months or so even from the third floor you will not be able to see the ocean for the palm frawns. We must give a shout out to Pilar who was extremely friendly and professional in helping get the matter resolved. Also, Luis with Funjet was extremely helpful. While this resort has its perks it just never felt right. We never felt like we decompressed. The overall placement and layout of the property was just all wrong. You literally could not see the ocean from the main pool or Sabores restaurant due to the overgrown palms. However, the beach is absolutely gorgeous and should be showcased as such. But again, everything is so overgrown that you couldn't see it unless you were standing on it or eating at Pepitos. The sand was fine and powdery and the water crystal clear. The one thing for us that was missing was the sound of the waves. We love to hear the sound of the waves crashing and there was none of that. Also missing from this property were the vast amount of birds and iguanas. They did have a resort tabby cat named Pancho who looked like he was very well taken care of. I loved giving kisses and scratches to Pancho everyday! The food and service was outstanding. We have come to expect that from Karisma. They definately know what they're doing when it comes to food and presentation. Our favorite restaurant was Kiyoko. We have absolutely no complaints with any of the meals or drinks we had during our stay. The sushi was incredible. Another pro we will mention about Maroma was that Maroma Paradise was just next door, which is where you and all the other resorts come to do there excursions. I thought it would be a burden having it next door but not really. We took advantage of that fact and booked two trips with them. One was a tour of riding the SeaDoo to two locations to snorkel and the other was just to ride the SeaDoo with no snorkeling. Both were a lot of fun and the guides were knowledgeable and funny! My husband and I are very much into spa treatments and spending the bulk of our vacation getting spa services. The Maroma spa was horrendous! I scheduled a facial and my husband scheduled a massage. Normally, we get three to four services a piece. First of all, the spa was little and hot! At least at Royale you can communicate with the staff whereas at Maroma it was very difficult. I had to ask the lady who did my facial for some soothing music to which she proceeded out the door to turn a boom box on in the other room! We must also mention that in general the feel and vibe of Maroma was off. I'm not sure how to explain it but the other guests were quite snobby. We did meet one or two nice couples, but in general most of the other guests were not nice people. Maybe it had to do with the two large bridal parties that were there. The majority of the other guests at the resort were in one of these two bridal parties. I mean, I get it, you're getting married, but it's no excuse to be nasty to people. Overall, we will not be staying at El Dorado Maroma again. We will miss Pilar, but hope to see her again as she was one of only a mere few of the perks of our stay.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWonderful honeymoon with a few glitches\u201d", "Author": "lasweetvie", "ReviewID": "UR111490867", "Content": "We spent a long time looking for the perfect honeymoon spot, and finally settled on El Dorado Maroma. We wanted a small (under 100 rooms) all-inclusive, with no waiting for beach chairs or dinner seats, but some daytime activities and nighttime entertainment if we felt like it. We also wanted a romantic room with a view, to feel relaxed and pampered, and good to great food options. El Dorado Maroma promised everything that we were looking for, and they delivered it when we got there. We stayed in a beautiful honeymoon suite on the 4th floor of building 6. We requested to be closer to the ocean, but there are no honeymoon suites in building 3 or 4 (they are all infinity pool suites above level 1), and we think that building 5 was being renovated when we were there, because the last two days we heard hammering from 8 am to approximately 5pm through that wall. Despite not getting the room we hoped for, the view from building 6 was still wonderful and we really loved our room. It was clean and the furnishings were all modern but comfy. The balcony had a daybed that was so fun to lay out on, and we used the outside shower every day! The only real problem we had was the aforementioned hammering that was very repetitive and loud, and woke us up one morning. Not exactly relaxing! We probably could have complained to management about this, but since it was during our last two days there, we didn't feel like moving rooms and spent most of the day outside anyway. I also wouldn't recommend the fourth floor if you have trouble climbing stairs - there was quite a hike up to the room every night - but for us, it was worth it for the view! The food ranged from fair to excellent. We loved every breakfast at Sabores and every lunch at Papitos. Dinner was the only time we had a few 'average' meals, namely at the Italian restaurant and during the Mayan theme night. The Italian was overly salty and nothing stood out during the Mayan night. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant for dinner though, and the mahi mahi we had on the Mexican theme night was the highlight of our dinner meals! For every meal, even the ones we didn't enjoy as much, the food was always creatively presented in a beautiful way. We had a good time just looking at it! We spent 7 days and we did not feel like the food was too repetitive. We also enjoyed dinner on the beach one night, which was tasty and romantic, but it was free for us thanks to a voucher we received before the trip. If we hadn't had the voucher, I don't think the dinner would have been worth the $180+ price tag. The beach was outstanding. The sand is white and powdery, the water is a clear blue-green color, and you can walk all the way out to the sand bags. The sand bags are not very attractive, but we appreciated them being there when we walked down to other resorts and found a steep drop off and strong currents. In a small hut near the beach entrance, you can borrow rafts and beach games, as well as books and sunscreen. We saw many people playing horseshoes, boccie ball, and floating on the ocean. The beach beds were very romantic and cozy, and there were always loungers available (although ones with umbrellas would often be taken during the middle of the day). The marina next door is closer than we realized, but there wasn't any bothersome noise from it, aside from the occasional jet ski. We walked past the marina several days and enjoyed a long walk without any resorts. If you walk for about 45 minutes, you will reach a long stretch of big resorts, but the area in between is mostly jungle. Really pretty! Service was excellent at the resort. We were promptly waited on by a beach butler whenever we were laying out, and all of the restaurant waiters were great. Everyone throughout the resort was friendly, spoke English, and made us feel like we were at home. The nighttime entertainment performers were also charming, and really put everything they had into their jobs. We especially enjoyed the Michael Jackson show! We also had a great time enjoying the day activities, like the tequila tasting, the kayak tour, and the cooking demonstration (all included in your stay). We did have a poor experience with the EDM spa. We were really looking forward to a moonlight massage for our 'one week' anniversary, and even double-checked the time twice leading up to it. Unfortunately, when we got to the spa, we found out that they had scheduled our moonlight massage for 9AM, not 9PM (and trust me, we definitely requested MOONLIGHT!). They had another couple scheduled during 'our' time, so we missed out on the special night we had planned and had to move the moonlight massage to the day before we left. The ladies at the spa were apologetic, but it was a big let down after we planned our evening around it and were so looking forward to it. When we finally got our massage, it took place in the beautiful over-water palapa - but we weren't expecting the several tables of beach diners sitting right in front of the palapa! While being watched was awkward enough, the massage was completely ruined by the loud, live saxophone and recorded backing track that was playing easy listening hits over a loudspeaker for the diners. I swear that we didn't have the saxophone playing during our beach dinner, so I was totally surprised and couldn't relax during the massage at all. For the price we paid, I expected more consideration for the ambiance. The massages themselves were average (my husbands' was too rough and he had a very sore shoulder the next day!) It was a disappointing finale (especially combined with the hammering in our room that day) to an otherwise special and lovely vacation. We didn't notice any bad smell that other reviewers complained about, unless we walked over to the very edge of the resort near the mangroves. This is the area where they are building the new villas, which looked awesome, but those may get hit with more of a smell. I did get a few mosquito bites, even with bug spray on, but I seem to attract them wherever I go. Overall, we had a wonderful time and loved our room, the friendly staff, breakfast and lunch, the lush grounds, and the stunning beach. We were disappointed in the spa, the all-day hammering in the neighboring room, overpriced add-ons (the beach dinner and the moonlight massage), and we also wish that they had had free internet. Those drawbacks are why I rated EDM 'Very Good'. I would still love to go back because of the reasons we enjoyed our stay and hope I could rate it 'Excellent' in the future!", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cMixed Feelings\u201d", "Author": "EMILYRODNY", "ReviewID": "UR110969776", "Content": "I want to love this resort becuase of the nice people, good food and seriously amazing beach. But, I just dont. The rooms were so covered in the smell of Pine Sol, I was close to nausea everytime I entered the room. After 2 days you can smell the mildew coming thru the pine sol smell! The hot tub drain and handles were dirty and nasty and the bathroom stall was filthy as well. Seems like they updated only half the bathroom becuase the counter/vanity area was nice and the new shower was nice (even though there was removed grafftiti on the wall that was still visable.. yes seriously). The outdoor shower was a nice touch but w. the bird poo and moths - we decided to hold off on using it. The pool was very murky - the ocean water was cleaner. The pool is connected to the pool areas outside the room I had which was also murky and looked just uncleaned. The beds always felt a little moist. The room just wasnt clean enough for me unlike other resorts Ive stayed at. Also, I felt very pressured into a moonlight massage - a candlelight dinner - excursions and buying other things not included in my stay by the concierge (which are much higher priced than other resorts!) but, when I asked the front desk to stay an extra night or two - no one ever got back to me with info. So I decided against it. My husband and I are NY`ers at our core. Everyone we met was from the South (Spec. Texas) and Middle America which is great, I LOVE meeting new people but, we honestly felt like outsiders And, we can get along w. a paper bag!

First impressions were good. The resort is small and is set within really lush beautiful vegetation. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Our accommodation for the first 8 nights was a 1st floor Mi Hotelio room. + Loved the bedroom (4 poster bed and rustic dark furniture) and balcony (quite private, great to relax and listen to the rustling palm leaves). - Strongly disliked the dated greenish tiled bathroom. The outdoor shower built indoors was a waste of space. A shower bath (bath tub with showering facility) would have been more appropriate. - Could not play our DVDs brought over from England. DVD players were not compatible. For the last 2 nights we were moved to room 741 (block 7, 4th floor, room 1) as we were not happy with the value for money for the Mi Hotelio room and a few other things. + The room was beautiful. I expected a room like this from the start to be honest for the amount of money we paid for this holiday. + The view from the balcony was great. However, I agree with one of the other reviewers on tripadvisor - if you pay for this room and look on to the roof of a restaurant (Sabores) air-conditioning units, I would not be most pleased either. The view to the sea (could see the lights of Cozumel Island in the night) and to the vast mangrove forest (between highway & hotel - therefore so remote) was still amazing. + I loved the 'proper' outdoor shower. A real treat! Rooms in general - The finish of the fixture and fittings was poor quality, e.g. rattling patio doors, wonky taps, scruffy tiling, the blue light on the air-conditioning lit up the room so made it difficult to sleep. - Mould on tiles in the Mi Hotelio bathroom (this was cleaned upon request). - Leaky showerhead in the Mi Hotelio bathroom (this was changed upon request). Maroma beach + The beach is breathtaking! Having been to Mauritius and the Seychelles, this beach was equally stunning. Clear turquoise waters and nice to soak in (quite shallow) and relaxing. + Great for walks along the beach! There is nothing else at Maroma beach other than the hotel and the sports centre. What a long sandy stretch of beach! Lovely to walk further than Maroma beach and admire the coastline. + The beach beds were fantastic! Managed to get one every day even though it involved reserving one on the way to breakfast. + The beach butler service was great. Hermelina (sorry the spelling) and colleagues were really keen to ensure no one went thirsty - thank you! Sometimes it did take a little longer to receive the refreshments, but given that nearly every other person ordered cocktails, I found this normal. + By the way the cocktails were delicious - thank you Carlos & team! The restaurants + Breakfast restaurant good. There could have been a bit more choice but given that it was a small hotel, happy with it. + Lunch restaurants (same as breakfast or outside Sabores) had a good choice of food. Tasty food and nice setting. - Dinner: Did NOT LIKE AT ALL - NO CHANCE TO SIT OUTSIDE unless you pay for candlelight dinner on the beach. Actually there was one opportunity during our stay to eat out on the beach. It was all set up really nicely and then it started to rain...Just on that one night! - The Italian restaurant was dark (I am aware of ambience) but I could hardly read the menu and the tacky battery powered tea lights (at dinner in the other places as well) did not impress me at all. - The Japanese restaurant was ok. Food was good. - The Mexican (Sabores) was below average. Food standard is poor. Tiny portions, badly presented. + Room service - best option as you CAN sit outside - on your balcony. There may not be much choice on the menu but you can order food from the other restaurants and the chef will be happy to prepare it for you. Internet - As mentioned in a few other reviews, Internet access is not included. It cost 6 dollars for half an hour to use the Internet. In my opinion, this is not acceptable for an All Inclusive resort. Tour suggestion + I would really recommend visiting the ruins of Chichen Itza, Ek Bhalam, Coba and Tulum. They are stunning! The cenote (sink hole) near Coba is amazing and lovely for swimming. We went with Gudelio Alanis of Mayan's Explorer, a great tour guide.

We were married at The Royal in Playa del Carmen and have previously stayed at a few AI resorts in the area and I used these as the basis for our comparison This resort is absolutely beautiful and, despite being less than a 15 minute drive from the heart of PDC it seems to be on another continent. I had previously read nearly every TA review available for the EDM yet was still pleasantly surprised by the isolation and the serenity that greeted us upon arrival. Check-in was fast and efficient and we were in our room after a tour of the resort in under 15 minutes. We were in Room 442 which I would definitely recommend to anyone who can climb that many stairs- it had a dramatic view of the ocean and i would think there not to be many better rooms in the resort. The 3 flights of stairs to get to the 4th floor does get tiring. The best part of the resort is the beach - it is beautiful and they work very had to maintain the area, constantly sweeping any stray seagrass and raking the area in the morning to provide a manicured look to the sand. Their are ample beach chairs and palapas and with around 20 - 30 people on the beach at any time, it feels like you have your own private resort. The pools are nice - we frequented the Sabores pool in the afternoon and again, chairs are plentiful. A close second is the SERVICE - this is the first resort we have been to where we actually got to know many of the staff by name. After our first meal, many of the breakfast/lunch staff knew our name and would greet us even if we were passing by. A couple of the standouts - Fernando and Lizbeth at Papitos the breakfast/lunch spot overlooking the beach, we already miss both of them. Carlos at Bar 24 made a wonderful pre-dinner Margarita and was extremely friendly and engaging. Diego, Luis, and Hermalinda (apologies on any poor spelling), the three wonderful people serving drinks by the beach all day and were able to get the drinks at times faster than I think I could have done myself. This is the first resort I have been to where returning home the thing I miss the most is the people. The rooms were great - not as opulent as the rooms at the Royal but very nice, clean, and functional. The best part is the outdoor shower which we used every evening - the top floor is completely open-air and a real change from the usual routine. The food was good, especially the speciality lunches at Papitos. We also enjoyed breakfast at the same location as they offered a daily special. After every one the chef would ask if we liked it and genuinely seemed to care about the quality of the dishes. More on the food below. A couple of drawbacks: The lack of internet. While I recognize that not everyone values have connectivity when traveling, the inability to connect to check or send a quick email without incurring a fee is very strange and frustrating at times and given that nearly every other top-tier AI offers this service it seems strange this is omitted. While the service and food were wonderful at breakfast and lunch, some of the dinner service was lacking. My wife and I tend towards dining later and I am not sure if this had something to do with it as we were often the last or nearly last couple dining the evenings we were there. However, on more than one occasion, we felt like we were inconveniencing our waiter by eating and they often had started setting the room for breakfast the next morning (at Sabores), leaving us feeling unwelcome. Also, at most of the dinner meals the appetizers were wonderful (beef carpaccio at Italian, appetizer sampler at Oriental, soups at both the Mayan and Mexican speciality dinners); however, the entrees often missed the mark. The Italian restaurant overall was the best dinner we had. All in all, we extremely enjoyed the El Dorado Maroma and would definitely return as neither of the two items above would preclude us from returning. What could do that though is the rather sizable price tag - given that it costs around 50% more than similarly ranked resorts for a similar equipped room, it may be difficult to justify the price tag", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced Gem\u201d", "Author": "Travelready7", "ReviewID": "UR109342184", "Content": "El Dorado Maroma is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff.

There is not much nearby, except a Marina and it's a clean and a fairly quiet spot. bring books, and be ready for siesta. The music is spa music that is played all over the resort. I found it very easy to relax upon arrival. 9) Cleanliness and beautiful grounds - the grounds are always being manicured, pools cleaned, chairs and covers cleaned, rooms are cleaned twice a day, the place is immaculate. 8) Small resort - Most of the time they are running between 70-80% capacity. There are about 80 staff (Good guess) and about 90 travelers at all times. Do the math, there is always someone available to help you, always beach beds and pool chairs, swim up bar chairs etc. available. You wait for nothing, you do not have to get up early to reserve a chair, you do not have to sit with smokers, or you can smoke and not bother anyone else. 7) Rooms - there are small quaint rooms called Mi Hotelito rooms which are cute, small and very near to a beautiful pool and swim up bar. I personally liked them, even though we stayed in the larger infinity pool room. The larger rooms are extremely spacious with all of the luxury you could imagine needing. I personally (heard otherwise from other reviews) really enjoyed the private infinity plunge pool. They are small and the water is cool but after a long hot day on the beach when the ocean water is warm, you are covered in sand and sticky sun screen, can plunge into this cool clean water and have a nice soak. I LOVED it. I will add that they are very private as well....if you catch my drift. The rooms are cleaned twice daily and no touch is left out. In the evening when you return for bed, candles lit, scent is sprayed around lightly, towels replenished, beds turned down......such a lovely touch. 6) the extras - Do have the candlelight dinner on the beach. Someone described the wind and overcooked food....we definitely had some wind, but it is on the ocean after all and is to be expected. I enjoyed the breeze as it cooled things off enough to really enjoy the experience and the waves sounded amazing. We had rack of lamb that was cooked perfectly and really enjoyed the service. Do have a moonlit massage. We met the staff at the spa at 9pm in the dark, they had us change into bathrobes and slippers, led us to the outdoor towers over the water by candlelight and had a 50 minute beautiful massage. The warm wind rolling over your back while listening to the waves crash the shore is quite an experience. When the massage is complete they hand you a glass of champagne and lead you back to the spa for a steam or sauna, then send you home to bed. REALLY REALLY try some of the extras. Unless you are crazy....you will really enjoy them. 5) Bars and Restaurants - The food was EXCELLENT. No it's not the same as going to the best sushi restaurant in a port city, or having beef in Texas - BUT - for a GI all inclusive resort, it was the best I've had. I found the sushi in the Japanese restaurant to be fresh and delicious, the beef tenderloin in the Italian restaurant to be very flavorful and the Mexican Mole sauce in the Mexican restaurant to die for. The breakfasts and lunches were good, fresh and standard food. Salads and fruit were available for all courses and there were lots of options. 24 bar in the Mi Hotelito section was my favorite place in the evening. Visit Carlos, you will not be disappointed. The guy makes the best Crazy Monkey I've ever had. Like a chocolate milkshake with a KICK. There was no drink unavailable...unless your tastes were hard to please. 4) Activities - We did not partake in the activities, however, we watched more days while our noses were half out of our books. The guests were truly having a great time. Volleyball, horseshoes, some kind of sand ball game etc. We did use the snorkel gear a few times and really enjoyed the variety of fish swimming about. We saw people parasailing every day, and using the wave runners everyday - they cost extra but they looked fun. 3) Pancho - Pancho is about 8 pounds of grey, soft, handsome, pure lazy therapy. He is the resort CAT. He lives on the resort and sometimes you never see him. Other times he will curl up beside you - with your permission of course and take a nap. He is a clean, well fed boy and he is entertaining to watch. Makes you feel very Zen when he is around. 2) Beach - My goodness it was an amazing beach. You can walk for hours along a powdery floury sandy clean beach and not see another resort. I have never been to a more beautiful beach. The resort beach is shallow and warm, yet you can grab some snorkel equipment from the resort and still find beautiful fish about 500 feet from shore. Lots of beach chairs available, palapas and covered beach beds. Shade or sun or both. 1) By far the #1 reason the go is the SERVICE. The staff could honestly teach North Americans a thing or two about service. They were by far the most attentive, warm and genuinely kind people I have ever met. Carlos - best bartender in Mexico and kind and attentive to your needs. Hermelinda (Fiona - nickname) beach waitress was funny and energetic and fun the be around. Lizbeth - remembered our names in the first 15mins of meeting her and couldn't do enough to help. Sergio - concierge - great guy - really took care of us. Daniel - from the spa - kind and gentle and soothing to be around. I could go on, there are so many wonderful staff. Go and Enjoy.....you will not be disappointed. In fact, you'll look forward to your next visit \"home\" with them.

Upon arrival, we were very impressed. Check-in process was smooth, our room was not quite ready yet (no big deal) so we took a tour of the property and went to have lunch. As everyone else has stated, the beach is nothing short of amazing. The grounds are all very nice and the layout of the property is genius. We appreciated the smaller size of the resort and from what I can tell, every room has an ocean view. When we finished lunch someone came and found us and took us to our room which was then ready. We stayed in a honeymoon suite and it was gorgeous. We loved the balcony with the large bed outside as well as the fabulous bathroom. We could not have been more pleased with the reception staff, the concierge and the bell boy. The cleanliness of the room was good, not great. There were black dirty scuffs on the bottom of the jacuzzi tub and the tile around the jacuzzi tub looked like it had never been cleaned. Dead bugs, dirt, lint etc. The cleanliness of the shower was questionable as well, with black moldy looking stuff in some of the grout lines. I tend to be over the top with my expectations for that so take it for what its worth. We found that there were always plenty of chairs out by the pool as well as the beach no matter what time we went out there so that was nice. The beach beds were always occupied with peoples belongings with very few actually in use which is annoying, but whatever. Food at breakfast was great and the lunches were the highlight as previously stated. Dinner was so-so. Definitely not \"gourmet\" as advertised. What became a huge disappointment for us as our trip wore on was the service we received from the waitstaff at all the restaurants and the waiters out on the beach. This our 8th trip to the Riveria Maya area and we have frequented resorts such as the Palace Resorts, the Bahia, and the Valentin Imperial. Service at the El Dorado Maroma just simply was not up to par with the service we have received at any other resort in the region. We would order a couple of drinks from one the beach waiters, never receive it and that same beach waiter would come ask us a half hour later if we wanted anything. Things like this are not going to ruin our vacation, we had no problem just getting up and making our way to the pool bar to grab a drink, but it was certainly annoying. At lunch drinks were rarely refilled, we order dessert a few times at lunch and ended up leaving after 15 minutes with no dessert and no waiter ever coming back to see if we needed anything. Dinner was the worst, service-wise as well. One night at the Italian restaurant we were seated an no one approached out table for 15 minutes. On our last night at Sabores, it was the one of the special dinners that you have to make a reservation for, we ordered our appetizer, salads, anti-pasta, and our entrees (there was a first and second course entree). They brought out our first entree, and then the soup, then the second entree and acted like we were crazy when we asked about our salad and anti-pasta. By the end of the week we had grown weary of the poor service. We are pretty laid back people and have had no complaints about any prior resort, and I do feel like we have visited the region enough and visited plenty of other resorts that are not even as nice as the El Dorado Maroma so that our expectations were correctly set. The thing that really blew my mind regarding the service was this: there were never that many people (guests) anywhere. The average number of people out on the beach on any given day was probably seven couples so I could not understand why 3 beach waiters couldn't keep up with the service. Likewise, any restaurant we were in on average only had two other couples besides us dining at the same time. Why the bad service when there are so few people to wait on? We had requested a late check-out as our flight was not leaving until the evening on our departure date. They were not able to accommodate our request, which is fine. We understand that they had more people arriving.. no big deal. They advised us that we could get a locker for our belongings in the spa and shower in the spa before we departed at 3pm. So we packed up our things, got a locker in the spa, and told them we would be coming to shower at 2pm. No problem. When we went to shower.. no hot water. They could not get the situation fixed and we did not have the time to wait so we finished up our vacation with cold showers. All in all, we accomplished what we wanted out of our vacation which was to hang out and relax on a beautiful beach. We are not the type of people to let horrible service ruin our good time. That being said, we personally will never return to an El Dorado or Karisma resort due to our experience.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cAnother fantastic visit to the El Dorado Maroma - comments on changes from last visit included\u201d", "Author": "akandal", "ReviewID": "UR108080048", "Content": "We returned home from our 5th visit to the wonderful El Dorado Maroma on Saturday, May 7th. As usual, we had a great visit! There were multiple wedding parties there during our visit and the resort was at very high occupancy. That being said, during the day the service was wonderful and availability of loungers and beds was not an issue. Dinners did tend to take bit longer due to the greater number of tables but it was, again, not an issue. My only real dining service \u201cissue\u201d was at the special Dinner Around the World, on Friday night, where our table was not offered wine before service began and we had to ask numerous times to have wine and water refilled throughout the courses. It just seemed like a lack of attention to detail as they were trying to move the meal along. Maybe the rush was to get everyone finished for the Michael Jackson show, which was a great show. We have been to that dinner before when it was a much nicer pace with greater attention to detail and I really think it should be moved to another night when a bigger show is not scheduled. As it was it way too rushed. Grey Goose Vodka is no longer offered at the El Dorado Maroma. I was disappointed and really missed my Grey Goose Bloody Mary in the mornings! We also missed Don Julio Tequila. A fellow traveler pointed out that there Glenlivet was no longer offered either (nor was any single malt Scotch for that matter). Other than those items, the drink availabilities seemed to be the same. We had booked a Mi Hotelito room but, due to the weddings filling up those rooms, were upgraded to a swim up suite (a very pleasant surprise). So, we stayed in one of our favorite rooms, 302. Pilar, thank you again for taking such great care of us and being such a sweetheart!! Jackie again made sure that our requests (such as red wine instead of sparkling wine in our room) were taken care of when we arrived (and suffered through my emails, excited to arrive!) \u2013 Thank You very much as well! Rene at Sabores swim-up bar made early afternoons a great treat as did Alejandro taking over in the later afternoon \u2013 Congrats on the day shift Alejandro! (though we missed Alejandro TERRIBLY at Ricks; he would always know our drink preferences, even on our first night there remembering them from previous visits, and would never let them get empty before he brought another round, Emilio just wasn\u2019t up to stuff - an issue since it seemed like every drink order was a nuisance to him, Emilio would also disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time with people standing at the bar waiting to order without any word such as \u201cI\u2019ll be back in just a minute\u201d or \u201cI need to get supplies\u201d, etc.) Rene even went so far as talking with Chef Carlos about getting me the recipe of one of my favorite dishes at the EDM \u2013 which I now have via email and am very excited to try \u2013 thank you both Chef Carlos and Rene for going well above and beyond! Cesar, we missed you behind the bar but enjoyed seeing you and having you fill in when supplies were needed (loved my special birthday surprise and the love connection shots you made for the group)! Congratulations on your promotion, very well deserved \u2013 the EDM is lucky to have you in a management roll!! Israel in Sabores was quite enjoyable (though we are very disappointed that waffle fries, a.k.a. papa waffle, are no longer available due to \u2018standardizing\u2019 across the resorts \u2013 sorry we LOVE them) and Rafael always took great care of us in Pepitos. The morning grill/griddle chef in Pepitos was wonderful and after the first day knew my order, when I would walk up he would ask \u201cHuevos Poblanos?\u201d; to which I answered \u201cSi, por favor!\u201d (I am sorry that I don\u2019t remember his name \u2013 that was before caffeine!). Gaby was a delight in Mio, as usual. The waiters at Kiyoko tried to keep up with us all at my birthday dinner when we filled up most of the big table and most of the smaller tables were also filled but other guests\u2013 great job guys, I know we kept you hopping! The beach was beautiful and quite a of bit of work (dredging up sand from the marina and pumping onto the beach) has taken place to expand it, it is now nice and wide! The 8 new suites are well underway (just to the south of Pepitos so you do not notice the construction unless you are down on that end of the beach) and those will have lovely oceanfront accommodations. It was nice to see updates going on throughout the resort during our stay (though a bit inconvenient at times, such as the day they spent putting up new valences on our swim up patio, but we know that is just improving the resort and they have to do it sometime!). Any maintenance calls (such as a broken lock on our sliding glass door due to the construction on the valences or mess due to the same construction) were handled promptly and we were found the next day by Pilar to ensure everything was taken care of \u2013 great service again! It was great seeing old friends and making new friends who we hope to see during many future visits to the EDM! A big thanks to all of those listed above and Alfredo, Jackie, Chef Efrain, Isidro, Walter, Cesar, Pilar, Paola, Carmina, Susan and many more for making this such a special place that welcomes us back time after time with open arms!

My partner speaks Spanish and we have visited many resorts and colonial cities in Mexico. We really enjoyed being in a small resort (72 rooms) and found that the staff were incredibly attentive. The beach is outstanding. You can walk for 45 minutes on a claen sandy beach before reaching a large hotel complex and the contrast is dramatic. Having to walk past the Marina is less than picturesque but not a major issue. There is never a need to compete for chairs or umbrellas on the beach..the beds are often full but we did not want that anyway. The beach butler service was efficient and pleasant. Being supplied with cool wet towels was a nice touch and you could have instant short massages as well. We were in an Infinity Pool room. These are on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the newer building. Our room was large, clean and all the equipment functioned well. When we had a problem operating the DVD and the jacuzzi, we had quick and informal instruction from one of the maids. The Infinity Pool is more decorative than functional..too deep to sit and too small to swim. We did not have an ocean view..more later under cons. Breakfasts were divine at Pepitos. Lots of eggs, bacon, omelets and fruits. Rafa..one of the cooks was particularly helpful. Lunch at Pepitos is buffet and was different each day and was always nutritious and varied. In additional to Rafa..special mention to Ismael and many others who made this such a terrific experience. The food at dinner is good but would not be considered gourmet. Sabores had the best menu and ambiance. The service was outstanding with special thanks to Jonas and to Vittal. The Italian night was outstanding with beautiful violin music. The Mayan night was disappointing while the Mexican was very good. The non-theme nights were very good. We tried the Italian and Japanese restaurants for variety but the slection and quality were average compared to dining in \"gourment\" restaurants in large cities. There is no pressure to tip but we did appreciate the special service from individuals and provided , by Canadian standards, modest tips at meals. There is little night life at El Dorado Maroma. Rick's Bar is a relaxing place with modest entertainment. Might be a disappointment for those wanting a wild experience. Perfect for us. Do meet with concierge..she will explain the resort..book your dinners and provide essential information. Overall..it was exactly what we wanted. It was a week of tranquility on a beautful beach with personal and attentive service..wonderful ambiance. There are a couple of things which could be improved. We had booked and pre-paid for an Infinity Room and understood that these were on the 2nd and 3rd floors in the new section with ocean views. We had requested a 3rd floor room. When we called the day before arrival, we were told that the rooms were not assigned and that we would get whatever was available (all the way from miHotelitto rooms in the older section to various Infinity Pool rooms) and the rooms vary greatly in design and quality. We had a 2nd floor Infinity room in the 700 block. There is no ocean view for rooms on the 2nd floor and minimal for those on the 3rd floor in the 600-800 block. It was not an issue for us as we enjoyed the room and were only in the room late evening and night. However, the advertising is not accurate. We were asked if we would listen to a Salesperson who would explain how return visitors could have deep discounts. The objective was to get you to buy future vacations today..not really a good deal and not exactly what we had been led to beleive. There was no \"hard sell\" and they did offer two 30 minute massages which were very good and a dinner on the beach which we declined as it was windy in the evenings. The salesperson also indicated that club members would be more likely to get preferred rooms and be less at risk for being bumped to another resort. Lomas travel is on site and offers tours which might be fun if you have not experienced them before. We had and declined. The representative was polite and respected our decision. So...for us, it was an outstanding experience..everything was just about perfect and met or exceeded our expectations. The small size of the resort, the beautiful beach, attentive service and wonderful breakfasts and lunches and comfortable room were the positives. The things that could go wrong are over-booking and transfer to another hotel, allocation to a room different from that requested and disappointment for those expecting a dramatic ocean view.

No time-share spill (by the end of the week, we would have been glad to listen though). We were met with refreshing champagne and moist towels. Our room wasn't ready, but that gave us time to explore and have lunch. The room was awesome. We must have had the best view on the entire resort! Words cannot describe how breath-taking it was. The outdoor shower and jucuzzi tub were great too. We showered outside a lot. Our only issue was some a minor flood (just some water in bathroom and entry area) because the indoor shower didn't drain properly. We called the front desk and went to dinner. It was all cleaned up like it never happened by the time we returned. We used the outdoor shower after that - just in case. The infinity pool was nice, but we really only used it twice. We prefered the swim up bars and hanging out on the beach. Next time we may forego the private pool...maybe. Our infinity pool suite was very spacious (probably bigger than most 1 bedroom apartments). Our housekeeper came twice a day, everyday. We never felt concerned about our belongings and our gadgets - we had laptop and other gadgets that we left out and were never bothered. Our room always looked and smelled fantastic after her visits. Our mini fridge was always stocked at least once a day, everyday. Plenty of bottled water in our room at all times. The pools and beach were beautiful. No complaints at all. Plenty of beds and beach chairs. The prime spots go fast but there were always plenty to choose from - no need in getting up at 6:00 a.m. The beach was always clean and beautifully kept. Pictures do not do it justice! The staff was great! We loved chatting with them. We miss Michelle and Camacho! They were always ready to play games or take us kayaking. Do activites with them! They are a lot of fun. Antonio and Carlos are excellent bartenders, but watch out! They will get you with the Tequila! Mexican water is what they call it. Great guys. Hermalinda will gladly bring you drinks on the beach. Note: You don't feel pressured to tip, but a few dollars here and there go a long way! The staff really appreciate it and will eagerly remember your name and preferences. We saw two of the shows - the Broadway Review and Michael Jackson Show. Both were good and had very talented entertainers. Our sunrise massage over the water was fabulous and reasonably priced. My husband went back for a hot stone massage the last night we were there and I also got a pedicure. The spa is a must. We were very pleased with the food and beverages. Beers and liquors were name brand and great selection. The food was almost always excellent, but I wasn't a fan of the Italian Night or Mio (the Italian Restraurant). Maybe it was just me, but I didn't care for any of the Italian food. Sabores lunch and dinner menus are excellent. Pappitos served really good breakfast and lunch. Room service was really good too and took about 30-45 minutes each time. Our FAVORITE was the Japanese restraurant. We love Teppanyaki and Sushi. We ate there twice. Check out was fast and easy. All in all, it was a very fun yet relaxing vacation. We were sad to go and are ready to go back! I highly recommend it.

Thank You Nancy; we'll be calling you again soon for our next vacation! www.honeymoonsandgetaways.com ARRIVAL-Upon arrival at this quaint resort, we were greeted by the Concierge Staff that immediately stated, \"Bienvenidos en la Casa\" or \"Welcome Home.\" We were each given a cool aromatherapy towel to cleanse our hands/face along with a glass of roset champagne as part of their welcome. After checking in at the sheik, modern, aromatherapy smelled lobby, we were given a tour of the property by Pilar who was a member of the Concierge Staff. While touring the property, we were welcomed by each and every single staff member we passed with a warm; genuine \"Hola~Buenos Tardes\". Lastly, after the tour we were introduced to Enrigue who welcomed us home and stepped in to inform us that our room was ready by retrieving our luggage. ROOM-We stayed in a garden view room on the 3rd floor. We were in awe at not only how immaculate the room was but how stately it was as well. The room had a beautiful; high up; king sized bed (draped in white linens all around and dressed in beautiful white/red bed spreads), a spacious terrace with a cozy bed (dining table and two lounge chairs with the terrace also draped in white linens for privacy), a flat screen TV, indoor and outdoor showers, a jacuzzi also draped in white linen and last but not least a chilled bottle of sparkling wine. Enrique did an amazing job explaining all of the amenities and assisted us in getting settled into our room. The room was turned down nightly with aromatherapy scents of your choice; which we inquired about since we couldn't get enough of the soothing smell of the lavender/chamomile scents in the lobby. BEACH-We were able to see why Maroma Beach is rated one of the Top 10 Beaches in the World. The beach had smooth white sand, and the waters were crystal clear shades of blues and greens. The hotel provided all beach amenities, including beds, lounge chairs, towels, games, books, sun screen lotions, magazines, and wait staff attending to all of your food and beverage needs. RESTAURANTS-The property had four restaurants to dine in, with food themes of Mexican, Japanese, and Italian. All of the restaurants were \"gourmet\" classified. All meals were elegantly plated and presented with the freshest ingredients available. The Chef (who also came out to welcome us) was open to preparing items that may not have been on the menu to assure satisfaction levels. On one occasion, we mentioned to our server how much we enjoyed ceviche, and as a result, the Chef prepared as a surprise for us, ceviche as one of our courses for lunch. At one of the restaurants, it offers a different thematic menu nightly, amongst Italian, Mayan, and authentic Mexican. Reservations are not required as tables are always available. All restaurants on the property offered menu items that were fresh, flavorable, and fulfilling. Room service was available 24/7, and was very prompt and consistent with the restaurants. All restaurants were sheik and modern in design; while achieving a comfortable/cozy feel as well. STAFF MEMBERS-Gracias to our Amigos! Thank you for all of your hard work and for making sure our vacation was a memorable one! Paulina/Pilar/Carmina- (Concierge) These ladies were both extremely knowledgeable about the property and hospitable particularly upon our arrival/departure. Hermelinda/Marcos/Diego- (Beach/Pool Wait Staff) These staff members were always at your service with a smile; and did not miss a beat as far as being attentive to your every need. Be sure to ask Hermelinda about her famous coconut drink, \"Co-Co Locos\"! Rueben/Victor/Wilberto- (Front & Back Wait Staff) We bonded with all of these servers, especially Rueben and Victor, but all 3 of these servers made sure that we were well taken care of whether dining at Sabores, Papitos, or just lounging by the Sabores pool. We miss you guys already! Rene/Luis- (Bartenders) These guys were fun and full of life! They made sure we had enough Tequila in our shot glasses and in each of drinks every single day of our stay. **Make sure to ask for double shots as well as \"the famous blue bottle Tequila- \"Agavero\" Its always on hand but in the refrigerator at the pool, very smooth...!!!! CANDLELIGHT BEACH DINNER-We had the priviledge of enjoying this romantic dinner on our last night thanks to our agent Nancy. We were escorted from the property by the restaurant host to our table on the beach. It was sectioned off draped in white linen with dimly lit illuminations. We were taken care of by two servers and enjoyed a soft background of dinner music. We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks; a three course menu (including duck/cheese ravioli/soup which was amazing but we can't remember what it was called; and a flavorful tender beef filet on top of a bed of potatoes ). Certainly a meal to remember. ACTIVITIES-Many available; we chose parasailing and snorkeling which was fun. The guides are awesome! We did not have an opportunity to take advantage of the SPA on the resort. DEPARTURE-Our departure was smooth and our bill was accurate. The staff encouraged us to enjoy our final drinks as well as the rest of the resort while we waited for our transportation. They encouraged us to come home again soon and we couldn't help but hug everyone on our way out. Again, thank you to everyone who made our stay memorable at the El Dorado Maroma.

The Good: -Most of the service staff (bartenders and butlers) are friendly and work hard to serve. -Room service saved our stay. Service was timely. Food quality was generally better than the sit-down dinners. The (Almost) Good -Papitos restaurant (breakfast/lunch only) offers reasonable fare for buffet-style, though the variety is a bit slim. Lunch entree is different each day, but most everything else is the same. -Mio (Italian) restaurant has a couple of good dishes, but execution is spotty. -Pacing on the meals is about right. It feels a bit slow, but you're supposed to be relaxing, right? As noted in other reviews, drinks are often a bit slow at the restaurants. The Bad: -While wind can't be controlled, event planning and resort layout could dramatically reduce its impact. Apparently, this has not been considered. -The Kiyoko (Japanese) restaurant can be skipped altogether. The sushi and tepanyaki preparation was sub-par (go to any chain in the U.S. - you'll get better food). Everything else was either bad, or very odd in an unpleasant way. -Tipping the wait staff seems to be EXPECTED everywhere - not just for exceptional service. Be prepared with plenty of cash. -The Spa's services are very limited. If you want to be pampered, find another resort. -If you like to take baths, pay a lot of attention the room you pick. Many of them have showers only. The website is not clear about this, even when you know already know it. We had to triple check the descriptions before we figured out where this lack of a tub is indicated. The Ugly: -Constant pushing (hard-sell) of both the Membership Program, and Tour bookings. This got old quickly. We had to get almost belligerent before it stopped. -We had several maintenance issues with our room. On our arrival (Sunday), we found that our sliding door wouldn't lock - and being on the first floor, this trapped us in our room the first evening we were there. Despite both personal assurance from the staff, and 4 calls over several hours this did not get fixed until the next morning - 16 hours after we reported it. The Atrocious: -Candlelight dinner on the beach (extra $)...this was a painful experience. Imagine sitting in front of a sandblaster, trying to eat overcooked and tasteless food. Apparently the owners bring people in from other resorts to \"enjoy\" this experience. You could not have paid me enough to try again. Save your money. Other items to note: -All of the \"nightlife\" at the resort is at Rick's Bar. This is on the second floor of it's building, up two rather long and steep staircases. Anyone with mobility issues will have a difficult time of it, or have to skip Rick's altogether.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFine dining, excellent beach, great staff!!\u201d", "Author": "TheFranticDancer", "ReviewID": "UR105099133", "Content": "If you are looking for a secluded adult resort away from other hotels this is it.

I am a huge Japanese food fan but found the recommended main course I ordered was inedible. The Italian restaurant was much better... nice pastas, but skip the proteins. Many of the fish dishes had a MSG taste. I don't know if they used MSG, but it overwhelmed the fish. Truly preferred the the seafood served at Secrets Maroma Beach. Also Secrets Maroma Beach, a half hour walk from El Dorado Maroma, had finger foods being served around the pools and outdoor bbqs. El Dorado Maroma only allows you to eat in the restaurants or in your room. So no pool side food service. Honeymoon Suites are just rooms where the non-functioning Infinity pool has been boarded up with a deck. In most of the buildings they are on the 3rd and 4th floors, which means you will have an ocean view. The Honeymoon suite we were in was quite lovely. Loved the outdoor shower and the fact the room was HUGE. The travel agent was right. You will find, weather permitting, you won't be spending much time in your room. The infinity suites can either be the best rooms, or the worst rooms depending in which building they place you in. The beach front buildings are structured a little differently and, because of that, can handle the weight of the pools. So every floor, except the 1st which is a swim-up, has one. But the buildings behind those two, because of the way they were structured, have infinity pools only on the second floor (supported with a column) which means there is a good chance your views will be blocked by the building in front of them. The beach itself is beautiful, but for some reason is the depth of a kiddy pool. There are patches of deep water, but not enough really to swim. You can go past the markers the hotel deems safe but because of the busy marina next door you could put your life at risk. Secrets Maroma Beach wins over El Dorado Maroma's beach. I know this seems like a negative review, but once you know all this stuff, you will love it at El Dorado Maroma. I love the fact it is small, and beautifully landscaped. (But you never feel trapped, the layout of the hotel grounds makes you feel like you are in a world of your own). And even though Secrets Maroma Beach, excelled in certain areas, I still preferred my stay at El Dorado Maroma. It is truly a beautiful hotel. Lovely staff and really nice guests made the stay wonderful. One of my favorite people there was one of our waiters Fernando. On those days you feel more tired or worn out he would help set you straight. Be it with his recommendations of food, or getting you to order a sinful drink - or just his sincere desire to see you have a good time - he helped make our stay exceptional.

We didn\u2019t expect this quality of service and food for an all-inclusive \u2013 even one at this price. El Dorado Maroma sits on an undeveloped stretch of beach. You won\u2019t find side-by-side mega resorts here. The next nearest resort is 1.5 miles away in either direction. Be sure to walk the beach. If you walk north around the point \u2013 about 40 minutes at a leisurely pace \u2013 you will see the larger and more crowded resorts. It\u2019s worth the walk. But after that you really appreciate the fact that El Dorado Maroma only has 72 rooms. Even if it\u2019s fully booked you don\u2019t feel like you are in a crowded resort. The beech is beautiful and very well maintained with plenty of chairs and day beds. We never had to go out early to reserve a spot at the beach. Most guests seem to gravitate to the swimming pools in the late afternoon. And it was great. No one got out of hand. We met some very nice people. If you like the clear ocean water, kayak out to the reef and/or take a snorkeling excursion. It is possible to swim out to reef from the beech but there was just enough boat and wave runner traffic to keep me from going out. The reef is great and was in better condition that I expected. Tons of fish, we saw several barracuda and found conch shells in a 25 ft deep cenote just off shore. This is an adult\u2019s only hotel and the night life is very calm. There is some nighttime entertainment that may seem cheesy at first \u2013 the 70\u2019 & 80\u2019s show comes to mind. But the fire show was impressive.

First let me say that my husband and I travel alot. I'm a huge fan of Europe, so travel to Mexico is much lower on my list of places to go. Having said that, we were totally stressed out and really needed to get away. I researched thoroughly all the hotels along the Mayan strip and came to one conclusion, for us, SMALL was what we needed. No boom boxes by the pool, no horrible plastic wristbands that can make the most elegant resort feel more like a spring break vacation, and no buffets. We choose El Dorado completely based on the reviews. A leap of faith??? I have no idea, but I liked what I read. Small, intimate, quiet, romantic were the common themes of most reviews. Our flight was delayed by about three hours so the day did NOT get off to a good start. Combined with our airport transfers which literally left us to the very last (because there was no one else going to our resort and it is a little off the beaten path) - clues here: Arranging transportation may be worthwhile rather than waiting around for your bus (I would do this next time), point two - the resort is definitely off the beaten path, it is a long narrow road through mangroves that feels more like you're heading to the jungle rather than the beach. (We didn't mind it in the slightest, but it's not a resort where you feel you'll be going to the main highway to catch a bus - you need transportation to get out of the resort). Anyway, by the time we got there I was rather fed up with the travel and just hoped that Trip Advisor reviews would not let us down. We pulled up to the lobby - which looked like it might be the back of the hotel it was so simple, and at this point I just crossed my fingers. Our door was opened by Henry, followed by a beautiful young women holding a tray of cooled hand towels and a glass of citrus infused champagne. We were led into a simple lobby, seated and went through a short and very personal check in process (including being given a choice of aromatherapy fragrances for our nightly turndown). I was melting at this point, and not from heat, my stress level had dropped so dramatically in ten minutes I was literally blown away! From check-in Henry gave us a short tour of the property and as we were led through the the small paths with palm trees and flowers, I felt like we we stepping into a spa, not an all inclusive. I was in love, before we made it to our room. We had been upgraded to the newer building which has the infinity pools you have probably read much about. I didn't want a pool so the upgrade cost for that was never considered. Our room was in building seven (don't be mislead by the building number) this is a tiny hotel and actually it is really just one building, and more like \"stair number seven\", we were up two floors which we didn't mind as the upper floors have a better view (not so much the case in this part of the building as it was near to the restaurant and the roof airconditioners). Anyway, I can tell you that every photo I had seen online could not do these rooms justice. They are huge, with more furniture that the average apartment! The weird looking outdoor shower is in fact, fantastic and a wonderful alternative to showering inside with air conditioning blasting. Double sinks, private toilet, jacuzzi tub, and all those curtains you see in photos, are light and give the room a dreamy feel. I had brought things from home \"just in case the hotel did not deliver\" and left everything in my suitcase - great make mirror, robes, slippers, blowdryer etc. There was fresh fruit and a bottle of champagne waiting - which we eagerly opened and took outside on to our balcony - to the dreamy out door beds and toasted finding a jewel of a hotel. We loved El Dorado Maroma, and I don't want this review to be as long as it could be if I covered everything, so I'm going to address a few comments, that quite honestly, I felt were misleading and unfair to the hotel. First this \"smell\" you may read about is without a question sulphur from the mangroves. If you have ever smelled sulphur you recognize it immediately - it smells like rotten eggs not sewage. There were the odd spots to the north of the property (where the mangroves are) that when the wind blew a certain way you'd get a whiff. While unpleasant for a moment, I would NEVER say it is an issue. Secondly, there are many beaches in Cancun that are so rough that you rarely can swim in them. Having almost drowned in Cancun a few years ago - those flags on the beach are my new best friends, I'm afraid of the sea, and this resort allowed me to go back into the ocean for the first time in years. Yes the water is shallow, but it is warm and it is safe. True there was something \"interesting\" going on with this one lone mexican man siphoning sand, but it was fun to watch everyday it it only churned up water in one area. The one day the water was really ugly was natures call, not the hotels. The beach sand is so fine it doesn't get hot, which came as a wonderful surprise. We walked forever, and felt more like we were in Tahiti than Mexico it was so serene. The marina next door to the hotel is fabulous, while we don't do watersports it was perfect for anyone who did as they didn't need to waste time being transported back and forth. Restaurants were fantastic. We met with our concierge on the first day and she explained that the Mexican and Italian evenings which also had some entertainment, required reservations. No issue, just forward planning on the part of the hotel. If you choose not to go, you had two restaurants (Italian and Japanese) that didn't require reservations. The food was excellent and the presentation beautiful. I HATE salt, and the only salt complaint I might muster up is the rim around a Margherita, certainly not the food, which seemed to carry a subtle sense of healthly as well as excellent. Courses are on the small side, but never with the intention of you going hungry, but with the gourmet expectation that you try a few things. Go ahead and have the starter, and the soup, and the main course and desert - do it properly and you will leave the restaurant more than satisfied and you will have experienced many flavours. The staff is amazing, they are treated with respect by Karisma and it shows in everything they do. Warm and happy is the feel around the hotel from every single staff member (and there are many). I can't forget to mention that there is not one paper towel or hand dryer in any bathroom. The bathrooms throughout the resort are gorgeous, very private, so clean and feature granite, lovely soap and hand lotion dispensers and real handtowels each with a little flower. Very pretty and very impressive. So, did I go loco and was there anything negative??? Yes, every so slightly. The resort is very quiet at night, beautiful lit it is dreamy. But there is no central place that feels connected at night. I know its romantic - but because everyone is so relaxed it is easy to make new friends and quite nice to meet up with another couple or two for drinks. I think there should be an area that is more condusive to this, a bit more lighting and seating perhaps around the 24 Bar. Easy fix, and I do hope that Karisa considers this. They try upstairs at Rick's Bar with the shows, but I think its a little hit and miss so overall I'd say it's lacking in entertainment. However, you are so extraordinarily content at the end of the day, that it honestly doesn't matter. We loved the hotel and we will definitely return next year and the year after that! I think if you are looking for small, intimate, elegant, no matter who you are you will be impressed. There were young and older couples there, and yes, I'd say that this is essentially a couples experience, I would never go there alone or with girlfriends, it's just not that kind of a place. If you're teetering on your decision, go with your intincts based on the overall reviews of this hotel, and I don't think you'll be disappointed, and more likely to return home with a sense of wanting to defend anything negative about the hotel. Thank you El Dorado Maroma, and to all the staff who made our stay so memorable - the hotel is not just the treasure, it is the people who run it!

We have tried many resorts over the years on both the Pacific side and the Caribbean side. This trip was divided between El Dorado Maroma and The Grand Velas (Grand Class section of the resort). To be fair to El Dorado this review will not comment on Grand Velas and focus solely on our experience at El Dorado Maroma. I will also post a review and photos on Grand Velas in case you might be interested. We have all seen the scenic photos posted within Trip Advisors and rightfully so. I will post a few more of those along with some photos of what you might run into on a daily basis. Check-In/Rooms - Resort Grounds - They are what you would expect and see at most middle of the road and lower upper end resorts along Rivera Maya. What is meant by this is they are well kept and tropical in nature. I would not however say that they rise to the level of some of the other higher end resorts nearby. Included in that for comparison might include the Mandarin Oriental , Secrets Tulum, Mayakoba and the Grand Velas. There is also a series of new \u201cPresidential\u201d suites being built with ocean views. With that comes the typical construction noise during the day we have all heard at different resorts in the past. No clue on a completion date but a guess would be at least another month before they are completed. In reality the noise is not all that bad. Rooms \u2013 We stayed in the newer section of the hotel where the blocks of rooms run from the 300\u2019s to the 800\u2019s with the 300\u2019s being closer to the ocean and moving back away from the ocean from there. We were given room 741 originally when we checked in on a Friday at around 4:15 pm or so. We were taken to our room by someone who was on their first day on the job. She was a little unfamiliar with the property and took us to the wrong room. After getting somewhat lost she asked us to wait on the walkway while she went to get some help. 5 minutes or so later she came back with someone who was more familiar with the property. The entrance to the 700 block of rooms is located fairly close to a large maintenance building that has a loud a/c unit running what seemed at all times. This noise certainly took away from the hoped sereneness. We were then escorted to room 741. The interior of the room itself was fine, nicely appointed and as advertised for a honeymoon suite. The problem arose when you walked out onto the deck area. The deck did provide a view of the ocean but it also provided an outstanding view of the roof of the Saboras restaurant. On this roof was a very loud a/c unit that again took away from a relaxing and restful feel. You will run into this issue with any 3rd or 4th floor room in the 700\u2019s or 800\u2019s. The lower 1st and 2nd floor suites had the noise from the roof top a/c unit masked by a water feature located on the side of the Saboras restaurant. In order to avoid the overbearing noise try to make sure you get a room in the 300\u2019s-600\u2019s. All up we wish we would have saved the money on the room upgrade to the honeymoon suite and stayed in the Mi-Hotelito suites. It seemed to us that those had a much cooler vibe to them. We asked to be moved but were told everyone had already checked in and the hotel was 100% booked with not ONE open or empty room. We were then told and we could move but not until Monday (3 days later). What we found interesting is that over the next 3 days we saw numerous guests checking in and out. Logically we felt if the resort really wanted to move us they would have prior to having to wait 3 days. However that being said, we were moved on Monday to suite 522 which was nice in the sense that it provided a better view of the ocean, pool and without the incessant a/c noise. Thanks (I guess) goes to the resort management team for at least making some of our time them and the deck portion of our suite useable. Internet \u2013 $10 for 1 hour, $15 a day or $70 for the week. Tried to buy 1hour but could not get it to work. Had to call the concierge for assistance. At first we received some pushback stating $10 for 1 hour was not one of the options available for internet purchase even though we were describing exactly what was showing up as options as you tried to purchase access. After 10 minutes or so of the concierge attempting technical support with no success, we just gave up trying to gain access. No reason a resort that advertises itself as an upscale resort should not provide free internet access. Pools \u2013 As many others have mentioned there are 2 pools located within the resort. Main pool \u2013 The main pool was fine and provide a cool but not overly cool retreat from the sun. There is somewhat limited lounge chair and bed seating at the main pool with the only area really open to this coming on one side of the pool. If you study the various photos of the main pool you will find this to bear itself out. We found on most of the mornings that the lounge beds were all taken/reserved with towels, books, bags etc. fairly early by folks in an effort to mark their territory. Smaller pool (by the 24 bar) \u2013 This smaller pool was nice but a little chilly for our tastes. Plenty of shade with ample seating as far as we could tell when we walked from beach to a drink. Pool/Beach service \u2013 Service was provided for drinks only and what would be expected in terms of speed and frequency. It should be noted that there is NO food service of any kind at the pools or beach. We have never stayed at an advertised 5 star resort that did not provide some fashion of food service at the pool/beach ranging from a full menu to a snack menu. Note to the resort management\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026fix this! Pool towels \u2013 The pool towels for the most part have seen their better days. Several were fading and frayed. Not just 1 or 2 but just about every time you grabbed some towels you would get at least 1 that was badly frayed. Additionally, there were several times during our stay that the resort seemed to run out of pool towels. I witnessed 1 instance where a couple voiced a complaint about there being no pool towels and they were given bath towels to use instead. Really unacceptable for a resort that represents itself as a truly top notch resort. Beach - The beach was indeed very nice! Fine sugary sand and warm turquoise waters. One can wade at least 100 yards out to the large sandbags with the water not getting more than waist deep. It appears this is accomplished by an everyday dredging operation by a resort staff member trying to move sand around in swimming area located directly in front of the resort. All up one of the nicer beach areas we have been to. Beach seating \u2013 Always ample beach chairs and umbrellas. Not so can be said with the beach beds. I am an early riser (6am) and found that most, if not all, of these beds were reserved by that time. I would suggest that if you plan on wanting to enjoy this seating option on the beach you get up early. Maroma Marina \u2013 This \u201cactivity\u201d area is located directly next to the hotel. Around mid morning the train of tours start to come through from other resorts to enjoy what the marina has to offer. Included, but not limited to this was snorkeling, diving, fishing, sailing, horseback riding, waverunners and small 2 person speed boats. So around mid morning you will get to enjoy the drone of engine noise for the rest of the day as the waverunners and speed boats ramble in and out of the marina and back and forth in front of the resort. Gym \u2013 Small but with decent equipment where if you try hard enough you can get a adequate workout. Worked out most mornings and rarely ever saw another person. For any runners out there that prefer the road to the sand, it is approximately 2.5 km\u2019s (one way) from the entrance of the resort to the lobby entrance. Good road with little traffic. Food \u2013 Overall the food served in the restaurant was some of the best we have experienced at an AI/GI resort. None of the restaurants required reservations.

We loved the ambiance of our Mi Hotelito 2nd floor room. The first thing we did was tie up the curtains on the balcony to reveal the breathtaking view of the aqua ocean framed by lush tropical vegetation. Many moonlite evenings were spent star gazing on the outdoor bed listening to the Caribbean wind blow through the palms. We could seriously plan our next visit around a full moon! Each morning was greeted with such anticipation to have a delightful breakfast poolside at Sabores or beachside at Pepito's. Then it was straight to the beach with unlimited selections of beach beds, recliners and umbrellas. So nice not to have a crowd anywhere, very easy to find quiet and secusion. This is the perfect beach for walking also, even getting caught in a short downpour didn't dampen our spirits. Different themed lunches at Pepito's left us stuffed and ready for an afternoon's nap again on the beach. The gorgeous, immaculate grounds are quiet, romantic and dimly lite in the evening, perfect for strolling after dinner. Can't imagine any vacationing couple not falling in love all over again during a stay here, we have recommended the resort to everyone inquiring about our vacaton. We loved our waiters, hostesses, maids........very much service oriented (too many to mention, they were all fantastic). Be sure to check out the water before sunset to watch the stingrays. They come very close to the beach and are beautiful creatures to observe. Also, we recommend to morning trip to Tulum, thanks Luis. Departure day was sad, but we will return!! Our one complaint of a noisey air conditioner in our room was quickly solved when a new unit was installed. Small incidental suggestions??

As everyone has written, it is on a beautiful beach. There are no other resorts in either direction, so the beach is uncrowded, quiet and peaceful. I also liked the size of this resort -- only 72 rooms, so even if they are sold out, that would be only 150 guests on site. The grounds were nice and it was well maintained. And I loved the beach beds! I was disappointed in the food -- yes it looks gourmet, but it is not gourmet quality. Probably the best item I ate all week was a burrito at lunch and I loved the green juice at breakfast. But the dinners were disappointing -- especially the Mayan night when I had this pounded flat piece of tough pork. As far as the service, I was traveling alone and it seems when you are a single traveler, you don't get the same sort of service that a couple or family does -- it's something that the travel industry needs to work on in general -- but there were a few times where I felt invisible (waited about 40 minutes one day for someone to bring me a drink at the beach, when everyone else was getting served, etc.). The rooms were nice, but not \"architectural digest\" nice. I loved the bed on the balcony and the infinity pool was nice. But I was on the 2nd floor and the palm trees block the view of the beach, so if you want a beach view, you need to be on the 3rd floor or higher. They mention that they fill up the mini-fridge each day with drinks and snacks, but the snacks consisted of 1 candy bar and 1 package of pretzels. I was looking for a quiet, peaceful few days on the beach and I definitely got that here. However, it's not necessarily a luxurious resort, so if you are looking for a grand lobby, beautiful restaurants, a romantic beachside bar, etc., this isn't it. But if you want something quiet and the beach is the most important thing, than you will definitely get that here. I would go back to EDM, but I may try another place next time just to see what I would get somewhere else. The Zoetry is also a small resort, but looks a little more upscale, so I may try that one next time.

Don't get me wrong, the food was good for the most part. But it lacked the WOW factor and the selection was somewhat limited. We were put on a wait list for dinner twice during our stay. This wasn't expected at a resort that doesn't require reservations. I can't understand why no other reviews mentioned the smell of sewer gas that was evident for 3 of the days during our stay. The management said it was gas from the Mangrove swamp adjacent to the resort. However, we think it had something to do with the marina that is directly north of the property. It can't be a coincidence that we only smelled it when the wind came from the north. The marina also was dredging to remove sand and deposit it directly in front of the hotel. This process went on for 6 of the 7 days we were there.The result was churned up sandy water that should have been crystal clear. I should also mention that the water was only 1 or 2 feet deep in front of the holel. This is due to to the continuous depositing of sand from the dredging operation.

The waters off the beach are calm and shallow enough to walk out over 300 feet. There is even great snorkeling right there!

The short answer is DEFINITELY. There is no point in going through everything in detail, so here's where we found the previous reviews were right on the money: - FOOD: taste was good to excellent, presentation great to awesome. Breakfasts and Lunches were flawless, few dinner items were forgettable. Italian night was incredible in terms of ambiance and food. Japanese can be skipped - except the dessert. ROOM SERVICE: We had absolutely no problems. So what if the odd individual jam jar was opened - just take another one. Breakfast got to our room from 20 to 35 minutes. Be courteous and call them to pick up the dishes - the room cleaning staff will not take them as they have different responsibilities. (Thanks Elena for a great job!!) - ROOM: Excellent bed, more space than you'll need, large bathroom and great touches everywhere. Two issues: the jaccuzzi needs updating and the sulphur smell during evenings from the mangroves can get strong (you ARE warned in a note in the room and also through the reviews). The smell can be mitigated by making sure you allow the staff to do the turndown service (aroma therapy is simply incredible). - Beach: So if you've ever been to Thailand or Zanzibar or Malaysia, Mexico's beaches are nice but not as breathtaking. But no matter - EDM's beach is private with butlers (yes, your drinks come to YOU), plenty of loungers and beach beds, and steps away from your room. - Entertainment: The MJ show and Cuban acrobats were entertainment enough. This is not a place to party and yes, the music that is played throughout the resort is somewhat 'spa-like', but totally fits the place and relaxes you as well. It would have been nice to hear more Mexican music during lunch and dinner (aside from the themed dinners). BALCONY/POOL: I don't care what anyone says - having a (pretty large) infinity pool on your balcony, with a day bed to boot, is simply amazing. It is true that if it's cool or cloudy the pool will not warm up, but as soon as the sun comes out there is no better feeling than taking a plunge, people watch, sip a drink and close your eyes in total satisfaction - all in the privacy of your own pool. Tip: if booking an Infinity Pool suite, book when weather is favourable...after February. Call the front desk if your pool needs to be cleaned - they come within 30 minutes! SERVICE: 12 out of 10! Seriously, if you're getting bad service here it would be the exception rather than the rule. Not everyone will be constantly smiling and anticipate your needs all the time, but it is as close as it comes! Many restaurant staff, especially, will bend over backwards for you to be happy. The grounds staff (butlers, concierge) even apologize about the weather! The Service is unbeatable and what makes this place worth every penny! Couples Massage: $200 (sunrise, so relaxing) Lobster Dinner: $140 per person - or get it for free if you attend a sales pitch Wireless Internet: $70 per week - very good connection OVERALL: You will be pampered, spoiled and waited on. Count on it. It will be hard to leave. Minor imperfections will be smoothed over by excellent service, strong drinks, and yummy food. For those who can afford it, I am sure this is a repeat location. For those who saved for a special occasion ( we are in that category) - money well spent. So... to sum up: subtract the Japanese restaurant and add more Mexican music, and we do not have anything negative to add. ****Grab a Coco Loco and heaven will be few sips away****", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Romantic Getaway\u201d", "Author": "SarahB212", "ReviewID": "UR101192938", "Content": "My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and had an amazing experience.

Not to say that there wasn't an occasional glitch- (room service missed our breakfast one morning) but this is all part of \"the adventure\"- nothing is perfect, even in paradise. We found the beach to be very nice and very well upkept. Beach side service was very good. The most excellent night skies were darker and the stars brighter than found back home in the city. Surrounding grounds were very well maintained as well. Parasailing at the neighbouring Maroma marina was our most enjoyable local activity. We did the ATV and Speedboat activities- interesting as well- but be aware that these are Mexico grade vehicles- bad clutches, failing brakes (if any at all) and definitely no power steering. The guides however made the experience interesting and worthwhile- if you enjoy these kind of activities. ( Considerable amounts of dust and salt spray in face respectively- should this matter- bring along a \"pot hat\" for use under- helmet with the ATV activity.)

They also had the cold towels and cold beers (we requested beer not sparkling wine for the reception and sure enough they had it ready for us). Princess Diana the Exotic rep had all our reservation forms ready and pretty much just had to sign them and then it was off to lunch. Since we were a group of 11 Walter the Food and Bev Mgr asked us to wait till he could get a table ready to accomodate all of us so we went to the bar and about 10 minutes later the table was ready - he also asked us when we would like to eat dinner every nite and that he would have a group table ready for us each nite. We looked forward to the lunches at Papitos, the ocean front grill, everyday was a different theme. The fish market day was the best. The fried - then grilled whole red snapper was superb, and it was perfectly seasoned. Sitting outside there every morning for breakfast and being practically right on one of the the best caribbean beaches with an ocean breeze was also a highlite of our vacation. Special thanks to Rafa the grill chef and Lizbeth, hostess and all the wonderful waiters their. The resort is absolutely beautiful but what really makes this our favorite is the staff - their amazing freindly, warm, caring attitude certainly is generated by Alfredo the resort manager and permeates down throughout the entire staff. I know I am going to miss a couple of names of some of the people that made our stay extra special but I do want to mention some. Susan, the special project mgr, greeted us every day with a smile and conversation and asked if everything was OK, her positive attitude towards everything and everybody is infectious. - Princess Diana also visited us everyday to ask if we needed anything else - as did Paulina (Butler). Whether we were at the beach or at the pool we all had a blast with the animation group - Michelle and Comacho. Cant forget the rest of the group at the pool bar and beach that made us feel special - Cesar, Antonio, Franklin, and of course Hermelinda who made sure there was never an empty glass especially for the women in our group. They and the entire staff will surely be missed. The only suggestions I have but really are no big deal are - I would like to see an outdoor small beach bar or cabana type bar, perhaps in the sandy area with the tall poles around it located between Papitos and the new construction area.

The charm of the El Dorado is its small size so you never have to fight a crowd around the pool or on the beach. There is always lots of available loungers and beds no matter what time of day you head to the beach or the pool. The rooms are gorgeous, the grounds are breathtaking and, of course, the ocean and beach are like something out of paradise. I can't really put into words how lovely the El Dorado is. As soon as you enter the resort you feel special and we would, without any hesitation, recommend the El Dorado as a wonderful vacation destination. We rarely go back to the same resort twice, but will make an exception in the case of the El Dorado. We're sure as more folks discover what a gem the El Dorado is they're going to be heading down to Mexico as fast as they can. In short, if you want the perfect holiday, head to the El Dorado Maroma. We're sure happy we did. To the staff at the El Dorado Maroma, Hola from Jackie and Bob. Thank you for making our vacation so memorable. Everything was just perfect! :)", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cWONDERFUL RELAXING\u201d", "Author": "llsimon", "ReviewID": "UR98126169", "Content": "Our third time back and will definitely return. Greeted with smiles, \"Welcome Home\", glasses of cold champagne, hugs and warm wash cloths..Customer Service is a top priority with the entire resort. Many staff from our 1st visit are still there, that says a lot to me. They quickly know your names, your favorite drinks and what is special to you. The food is wonderful, many activities are scheduled if you choose to enjoy (even a great Super Bowl party). The beach and water are absolutely beautiful. The tropical grounds and the beach were clean at all times. Everyone we encountered made sure you received what you wanted. If you asked, it was provided and with a smile. We met many friends that we made from past visits, how often does that happen? We spent 2 weeks just relaxing in this wonderful tropical paradise. The rooms are clean, mini bar and bottle water restocked daily, large comfortable beds, pillows, a/c or the great fresh air, the food was gourmet Our favorite restaurant was Kyoto with fresh fish and veggies cooked in front us. The fresh fruit and veggies. were amazing. Snacks and drinks brought to us frequently on the beach, umbrellas for shade or beach beads for naps. What more could one want?? Maybe a shoulder massage on the beach...OK Daniel is there to give you a complimentary one. If you are looking for a wild, party place, this is not the place for you. If you want a great smaller resort, with a beautiful beach, amazing blue warm water, and great service, you will love it.

Probably our best vacation ever. We stayed at El Dorado Maroma for seven nights in February and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, did not want to leave and are already planning our return trip next year to this same resort. The resort is extremely clean, and the grounds, landscaping, lush gardens are meticulously maintained at all times. The beach is simply the best we have had the pleasure of being at in Mexico, white sugar sand beach, warm, calm aqua-blue colored water that you can wade into about a 100 feet or so and it is only waist deep - fabulous. Plenty of comfortable beach chairs with big umbrellas and beach palapa beds. Qualities that set this resort apart from others: cleanliness, beautiful grounds and pools, and fantastic beach. On to the food, three restaurants to choose from Sabores Mexican, Italian and Asian/Japanese. 4 and 5 course meals, delicious gourmet influenced foods, you will not be dissappointed in the menu selections, and the food quality is simply excellent. We did not have one bad meal. Everything was expertly prepared, fresh and the chef's presentations and platings were always unique and creative. We are wine drinkers and were extremely pleased with the quality and variety of the local wines served with our dinners, the gracious and attentive waiters would always keep our wine glasses refreshed throughout each dinner without even asking. The bars have top shelf liqour and the drinks were always great and plentiful. We tried the following drinks during our stay Mango Daquaris, Bannana Daquaris, Mudslides, Miami Vices, Choco-Locos served in a coconut, Champagne, Brandy, Mimosas, Tequila, Pina Coladas, Gin and Tonics, Vodka Martinis, and Strawberry Daquaris - all delicious. Beach butler service is awesome, the staff will bring your drinks right to your beach chair. The staff and service: This is another quality that sets this resort above others. As the resort is smaller, the staff personally gets to know who you are. I can honestly say I was blown away by the personalized level of attention and service given by the staff at this resort, it is nothing short of ammazing how well you are treated by the staff and the attention paid to your comfort. The staff is simply the most courteous and friendly of any place we have stayed - ever. My wife and I would like to thank you all for the wonderful service we recieved during our stay at El Dorado Maroma - Thank You! A special thanks to our conciere Gabriella \"Paola\" for taking such good care of us and who even gave us hugs goodbye when leaving! As for activities, we mostly relaxed on this particular vacation. We did do one excursion off resort aranged by Loius of Lomas Travel who works exclusivley at the resort and is onsite everyday (thank you Louis). At the Marina next to the resort, a two minute walk down the beach you can do the following activities: parasailing, reef snorkeling from the catamaran, jet ski, atv jungle tour, speed boating and others. Excursions we have taken and highly reccomend, Xel-HA Lagoon excursion, Cozumel Island Jeep and Snorkeling tour, Maroma Paradise Beach Catamaran snorkeling tour. For nightlife there are shows the resort offers at Rick's Bar, we saw the \"Michael Jackson\" show, which was quite good. But it is a quieter resort overall, if you are looking for non-stop action, constant activities or more of a party atmosphere and nightlife, this resort would not satisfy that. We particularly enjoyed our sunrise and sunset walks up and down the endless stretch of beautiful beach. We also really enjoyed eating breakfast and lunch outdoors under the palapa covered roof at the restaurant right on the beach - very beautiful and relaxing. Next trip we are planning on having the Lobster Candlelight Dinner on the beach, and full massages at the beach Palapa over the ocean.

The staff made this a relaxing and wonderful vacation. We stayed in the Hotelito section, and it was perfect for us...quiet and cozy but very close to the beach and the pool/bar. BEAUTIFUL setting with lovely plants and very well kept landscaping. Many shady areas when you wanted to get out of the sun for a bit and plenty of room on the beach. We never had a hard time finding a chair, and they had plenty of tables and umbrellas on the beach, and the staff (Hermalinda) worked to keep the cold beverages coming. Try the Coco Loco but you might request the alcohol free version. All the restaurants were great - quality gourmet dishes at every meal, and room service was quick and delicious. We enjoyed the lounge chairs set on the side ledges of the large pool on hot days to dip your feet in the water to cool off without leaving your seat. If you arrive before 3PM (check-in time) you should have some shorts/bathing suit available in your luggage so you can hit the beach or the pool while waiting on your room. Make sure to check the schedule for Rick's Bar in the evenings. We went to the Cirque de Soleil(they call it circus) and it was outstanding. Emilio at Rick's is a GREAT bartender and makes you feel at home. Camacho is responsible for all of the outdoor activities during the day. He is extremely friendly and makes sure that everyone is aware of the daily activities. Make sure you go out on a kayak tour with him and bring a waterproof camera with you. He'll take your picture which turned out great. This was a great place to go on vacation and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

At first blush, this hotel is very unassuming. If you are looking for glitz and glamor this resort is not for you. If, however, you are looking for understated elegance this is the place for you. In the past we have not been big fans of all inclusive type properties. Our brief experience with them had been below average food,many buffets (which we are not crazy about) and a mediocre booze selection...scrap that notion here....all bunk. Food was excellent, especially room-service, reservations not needed and high end liquor is at your beck and call. The rooms are all quite adequate. Many with outdoor showers...others connected to the larger swimming pool...all of the rooms have fantastic outdoor private space with a bed. AMAZING touch!! Toiletries that are supplied are quite nice. We personally would opt for a first floor suite. Easier access to everything that way, especially if you need to run back to your room for one thing or another. Our first room did not meet our expectations as the location was lacking. The view overlooked the roof of the restaurant and was quite noisy. And it was one of the farthest rooms on the property from all activity. My husband went to the front office after our first night and talked with Isidro Bravo, Chief of Village. You could not meet a more gracious, caring guy ever. As the resort is small it is often booked to capacity, and it was. Every single day, Isidro would find us on the property, give us an update on the status of us changing rooms. Finally on our third night we were able to change rooms. It exceeded our expectations!!!!! Isidro was not only \"on it\" he delivered. He truly wants everyone to be happy at this resort and it was very apparent he did everything in his power to accomplish this for us. He never gave up and was always incredibly friendly and professional. Anyone should be proud to have this guy representing their hotel!!!! We more than appreciated his efforts.....it was so great we ended up extending our stay by 2 extra nights. We got the ONE and ONLY room that was available for those nights as well. Had it not been for Isidro's efforts we more than likely would have left when scheduled. Location of property is great. Not too far from the airport and close to some very cool places. Playa del Carmen as well as Puerto Morelos, both worth checking out if you can drag yourself away from the resort. Maroma Beach is lovely....beautiful white sand and crystal blue water. If you wander on the beach and walk about 30 minutes you will find heaven....and I mean heaven.....AMAZING waves and swimming in the ocean. At the resort, the water is calm with little waves and the water is not very deep due to a reef, yet still beautiful to look at and cool off in. My husband and I are avid travelers and often times stay at very high end properties, Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Banyan Trees, Rosewood properties, so naturally we were a bit apprehensive about staying at Maroma. After much deliberation we decided to give it a try because our travel agent raved about this property. He reassured us the food/drink would be better than good, and best of all the price was great. (less than half of what we usually find ourselves paying, once you add food,drink, transportation to and from resort and the like )And yes, we read review after review on trip advisor!!!! After all was said and done we embraced the low keyed atmosphere here very much. The diversity of the guests was an added bonus too. The night life for us was more fun at this resort as the people were seemingly more open to chit-chat and liked to party more!!!!! Overall, a very friendly group of people. We had the best time and met some truly awesome people. We enjoyed ourselves so much we are scheduled to go back again for a week in May!

We treat ourselves once a year to a vacation that requires nothing more than getting there and this year we chose El Dorado Maroma after all of the rave reviews Trip Advisor provided. We are not 'well-travelled' but have stayed at enough all-inclusives to provide a fair assessment. The hotel is beautiful, the beach is breath-taking, the food is satisfying but the people were the best part of all. My fiancee and I both have professions where our performance is critiqued all of the time. We must listen to both good and bad comments and learn from the things that don't highlight you well. We could work in many different environments/places but we stay where we are for the people. There is an immediate trust that takes place the moment you enter this resort. It is small and exactly what we were looking for. We were greeted warmly by the staff and then given cool towels and sparkling wine. We were given a great explanation over the resort, its restaurants, its bars, its activities and finally the room. I take great security in knowing what to expect and it was as if the staff could read my mind. We booked a room in the older part, Mi Hotelito, but quickly realized we were upgraded to the newer addition. We stayed in 521 and had a huge room, king-size comfortable bed, a shower, outdooor shower and jacuzzi tub and finally a balcony with full ocean views. I don't know why this happened, but we certainly will not complain. We travelled just to relax so we did not partake in any activity, show or outside excursion. We spent the majority of our time on the beach, under an umbrella with a cocktail in hand. We sampled all of the restaurants and specialty nights at Sabores (even forgetting to make a reservation one time but no big deal!) and found all of the food to be amazing. Try the strawberry ice cream...you will crave it once you leave. We also had a couples massage in the sky hut our first night. I will warn you it is windy up there so it was a bit hard to completely let go and enjoy. There are too many staff members to personally name so we just want to say thank you to all.

We felt completely pampered and relax our entire visit, my wife can't wait to go again. As mentioned by others the food and drinks were excellent, room service was great. The staff at the restaurants always seem to want us to eat exclusively with them and would temp us with any daily specials. The butler service was great, and often the every loyal wait staff of the restaurants would offer to get us drinks as well. There were several times we had two drink in front of us at any given time. The beach was fantastic. Although we are not big beach fans, we really like the covered beds where we could relax, read, and tailor our sun intake. We preferred to stay at the pool which was landscape beautifully and was even more quiet, plus closer to the bars and the awesome wait staff. The water temperature in the ocean, pools, room outdoor shower, and infinity pools were quite cool so we barely used them. The public restrooms near the pool were always clean and pleasantly fragrant; it felt like you came off the beach and into the spa whenever you needed to use them. The staff was excellent, Luis of Lomas Travel is very helpful but not pushy when it comes to arranging any excursions. The entertainment staff of two, does a great job of tailoring activities. Many times Diego would arrange a special time for a nature walk, kayak tour, or reschedule an activity we may have missed. Our favorite activity had to be making towel animals. There were nightly activities we unable to participate (it was a honeymoon), but several of the other guest highly enjoyed them. We had a great infinity pool room on the third floor. We were lucky to have one of the rooms closer to the beach, but there are many more that were farther back and may have less impressive views. The room itself was very spacious and elegant, it was hard not to have room service just to enjoy the room more.

Everything is with one company and if anything goes wrong, you know who to call. But honestly, we were on vacation and far too preoccupied to actually call Westjet and confront the fact we had to eventually arrange departure details. sigh. Arriving was as expected, WARM, and long lines for getting through customs where we were somewhat entertained by some of the other travelers clearly stuck in the 60s and other nice families that made for some great conversation to pass the time. After exiting the building we walked through a few agents and found the westjet sign and proceeded to wait about 20 minutes for our ride to arrive. There were only 2 groups in our small van and we ended up going straight to our resort first! This compared to Air Canada and others who had large buses packed with people! Everyone was very friendly! As we pulled up to the El Dorado Maroma gate, we were pleased that our names were on the list and we proceeded with the never-ending drive into the resort that had us on the edge of our seats in the dark. The anticipation was KILLING us. As we seen lights and pulled into the resort, we stepped out and had our bags taken by the staff and given cold towels and champagne. So great to be there. We sat for 10 minutes sorting out all the minor details before being escorted by Ariel to our main floor Mi Hotelito suite 106. Fairly straight forward, standard room, amazingly comfy bed, humid (we're in mexico), stocked cooler and our bags arrived minutes later! They had run out of locks for the safe, but we weren't worried at all after all the great reviews on Trip Advisor. We actually never even bothered to get a lock for the safe our entire trip and only ever left it wide open with our Sombrero Santa Christmas ornament to sit! We quickly put on some nicer clothes and headed to Kiyoko where we were treated to some AMAZING food. Beef/Chicken Satay, sushi/sashimi, shrimp tempura, dessert, it was all amazing. Everything was nice small portions so we could literally order so many different things to try out. Very Very satisfied. Happily full, we went back to our room, a 30 second walk away, and showered before jumping into the amazing bed and falling asleep with her under all the covers and me under a light sheet and the AC on. I'll try to summarize the rest: Breakfast We seemed to be up early every morning (6-7am) and found that the buffet style breakfast at Papitos was the best option! Most things were ready to go by 7:15-7:30 but we still showed up at 7am scrapping at the door to get our hands on some delicious bacon, which a couple times was reheated from the day before. The french toast was delicious. A couple days we even went to Sabores for Breakfast #2 as they weren't serving french toast that morning. Definitely go to Sabores if you want the prepared food, but Papitos if you want LOTS and want it NOW. Room Service We ordered room service one day, it took almost an hour and a half. I think everyone must have been ordering it. I called again after waiting an hour and They were there in 20-30 minutes. I think my original order just got lost. We tried room service again for mid-day desserts and again, an hour or more wait. It almost wasn't worth the wait. The third time we ordered room service, we did so while at Kari's Spanish lesson and told them to bring it to the back door as our back patio was just off of bar 24. Everyone was jealous of our room service order. When the guy came out the back door I went and got our food. He seemed a bit ticked off that we weren't at the door and mentioned he was ready to take it back. El Dorado really needs to offer room service to you OUTSIDE of your room if it's going to take an hour or longer to bring food. Lunch We found Papitos grill with daily themes to be pretty good. We enjoyed the variety, and in our usual fashion, ate way too much and loved it! Pizza at Sabores was also good and we wished we would have tried out more flavours! Dinner Sabores Seemed to be the go-to place for food. Good selection of Mexican cuisine ... on the wild side. There was a lot of flair and entertainment value to the food (Try the caesar salad! lol) and it made it fun to eat. The soups that were poured in front of you was very cool, but left some ingredients a little... undercooked. We have lots of photos and hopefully will include some. The Mexican and Mayan? nights were great. Live music was great! My only complaint would be excess use of cilantro in the dishes. Dinner Mio Was good. We only went here once due to lack of time to try it again. The soups and appetizers were good, dishes were good, desserts were good. Photos to come. Dinner Kiyoko Was by farrrr our favourite. Partially due to the excellent waiters/staff/entertainers. We tried it the first night there, and were blown away by the awesome food. The second time we went we ordered exactly what we wanted... such as the Shrimp with veggies and rice.. without the veggies and rice (we love shrimp) and they happily prepared us both plates of delicious shrimp. mmm. the sushi and sashimi was good. Dessert was a bit sloppy as the fried ice cream was just... cream. Definitely recommend this if you like asian styled food. Drinks We soon learned that it is a good Idea to know what kind of drinks you like when you come as they don't have any lists. We started by just getting surprised with them bringing random drinks, but on the second day I had to stop asking for a \"Surprise\" after getting my third \"Sprite\" haha. We enjoyed the mix up and added to that mexico feel. We never mustered the courage to try the Coco Loco. We found all the drinks contained about 5X too much alcohol for us because we are lightweights. We finally figured out the proper terminology \"not strong\" to get less alcohol in the drinks. The long island iced teas were killller. 90% hard alcohol. The chocolate and fruity drinks were all good, and we spent many afternoons laying/walking around the resort drunk. Good times! Activities! Kari was AWESOME with the activities planning. Even if the weather wasn't good, offered to go paddle around with us and get the kayaks out. We went out to the reef twice with her. The second time I even convinced her it was a great idea to cross the reef and try catching some tiny waves in the kayaks. It was great fun! I just wish I had brought my snorkel out! Most of the activities probably weren't well attended. I know this because we were too busy with other things to check them out. We came to eat and relax and we did that! Lobster Dinner We went to the lobster dinner on our 5th night, which ended up being shortly after I proposed to my now Fianc\u00e9e. It was beautiful. They put us up on the Sky Massage for the dinner. Fire works went off down the beach during the main course which was amazing. It was incredibly overpriced. but for the occasion. I thought it was worth it! P.S. it's $140 per person, not $140 per couple! I think you can get a reduced price if you barter when they offer you the time share stuff, but we didn't bother showing up to the appointment we booked. GO US! Unless you're lobster addicts like us, or want to have a memorable dinner on the beach, I would skip this next time. Beach The beach was cleaned every morning around sunrise. The water was calm and great for wading through even on a windy day. There was a mysterious green tube that came from the marina to the north, had some connection just out from the sky massage, and then crossed the entire beach underwater to the south side of the resort. It was a ways out and you cant see it unless you walk out there. My curious nature would love to know what it is. Almost seemed like some operation to pump sand from the marina bottom over to the beach on the south to keep it from diminishing, but that's just my best guess. The sand was nice, LOTS of chairs and beds to use. Beach service was nice the one time we used it. There wasn't anywhere to walk south of the resort but you could walk north past the marina, past the random mansion being built, around the point, past a light house, and up to the other maroma resorts (secrets maroma, Maroma, and some other ones) The beaches here were much more violent and lots of big waves on a windy day. If you like the waves, go to a different resort. Snorkeling I went out to the sandbags, and there were some boring fish swimming around and more green mystery tubing. If you want to snorkel, head out to the reef on a tour or take the Kayaks with Kari. She would love to take you out there! Bars / Pools The pools were all a bit too chilly to sit in at the bar, but because of the bar, you couldn't do much jumping/spashing in them either. They almost seemed more for decoration than functionality. Most people would just stand at the top and ask for drinks from the top. If it was warmer out (30-40C) I could see the pools being more functional. Resort Size At most, you have a 1 minute walk to get from one side of the resort to the other. it's VERY small. I think it's a nice thing. If I timed myself, I could sprint to the beach in 10 seconds or less from the Mi Hotelito lower level suites. Smells At times you could smell something, but it wasn't obnoxious at all like some people make it out to be. It might be the odd couple times a day you might even notice it if the wind is just right. Seems to be a regular thing for the Mexico area. Lets all just agree to live with it. The bathrooms on the resort smelled so good I almost wanted to stay in them longer. Sights The resort was very picturesque. Great for taking photos of. So much attention to details, from the fine care by the staff, to the flowers in bathrooms, and just everything about it. Very tropical and Beachy. If you're thinking about getting married here, the beach scenery isn't anything to write home about. I would look for another resort when it comes to beautiful photos. The sandbags out in the water also kind of took away from the \"ocean\" feel, but did have a purpose. Weddings The wedding that we saw didn't have much for colour, and looked a little uninspiring. This may have been because they just didn't pick a colour and everything was white or beige. Again, the photo locations were limited here (coming from someone who photographs weddings). I would probably look elsewhere to be completely honest. Room Cleaning. The rooms were tidied in the morning, and a full turnaround? service (im new to all this) was done in the evening. Everything was always stocked up. We would have liked to be able to get those little chocolate bars they left in large quantity. To be far, we didn't try asking for more. Sometimes it feels weird having someone clean up all of our personal things, but after a couple days and never a thing missing my mind was at ease and I just enjoyed the service! :) Room Cards We locked ourselves out of our room MANY times. remember that if you go out your back door, don't lock the front door or your card won't work, even for the times you DO remember to bring it. They were very good about getting us back into our room within minutes each time though. Very friendly staff! Staff SO good. Everyone was great. I could try and name names, but I'd feel bad for the names I can't read/write/pronounce/remember. so to everyone at El Dorado good job! We felt bad when we thought someone really deserved a tip, but we were in bathing suits and had no money on us. The bartenders were amazing and deserved it! Being the adventurous type, we definitely got to know Kari the best! She's just such a sweet girl and so very kind and helping and willing to go out of her way for anyone! :) Leaving This was the worst part of the trip simply for the fact that we loved El Dorado Maroma. It has it's quirks, but it was VERY enjoyable and relaxing. We would like to say we'd go back, but given this was our VERY FIRST resort experience together, we want to try other resorts too! Photos I will try and leave you all with a complete photo walk-through if there is enough space to upload them. Those who have been at the resort will enjoy this! -------------------------------- PART 1 - Research before I went\u2026 -------------------------------- I have come to really appreciate Trip Advisor reviews but thought I would switch up the format a bit for fun. I haven't been to El Dorado Maroma yet, but I will be there in the very very near future. For those of you that spend your evenings scouring these reviews to determine \"Is this resort for me\" this is the review for you. Well, it's at least the first part of the review for you! I will give you my impressions so far which are completely based upon my research on the internet. You may like my opinions or hate them, but if you're anything like me, you'll love them! So lets get started. El Dorado Maroma? Sounds lovely! Where is it? I didn't really know. All of the locations on Google Maps, Expedia, or any other site were wrong. I took it upon myself to search the shores from Tulum to Cancun while keeping the mini map from Karisma open. After a few hours of searching I finally found it. I moved a few of the top search results to that location so I know exactly where I will be staying! This makes me extremely happy in an OCD kind of way. How about other trips? There are a lot of good ones, but still some bad ones. What makes a bad trip? What makes these trips bad? I thought I would try and dig a little deeper into the problems people seemed to be experiencing. I've come up with a few popular items: 1. Time Share Salesmen. I hear they're annoying! You don't have to go. I plan to bring a water gun with me and harmlessly shoot them if they don't leave me alone. Problem solved! 2. Room issues and room transitions. From what I can tell, those who have issues with their rooms are those particular individuals that have such specific tastes to which I ask \"Why didn't you look into the room choice a bit more before deciding if you have such acute tastes?\" Seems only logical to me! Anytime you want to switch rooms, there are possibilities of mix-ups and small delays in sorting out everything going on behind the scenes to make sure nobody is scheduled to be in the rooms, that they have been vacated, cleaned and prepped with goodies in the fridge, towel animals, and other amenities. They don't all just appear when you open the door. Right? 3. Unfriendly Hotel Staff. Given the good ratings, my only guesses would be that the cause of the negative attitudes of the hotel staff would be the individuals that talk about bad trips. Some people can come off with a bit of arrogance and snobbishness when they speak. Imagine if you were in the shoes of the staff. If someone talked to you like a slave, or servant and had ridiculous expectations of royal treatment, you wouldn't be so keen on being nice to them. They're humans, not slaves. Treat them with dignity and respect and I'm sure you will have a much nicer experience. 4. Lack of nightlife. DUH. About 70 rooms, quiet and romantic. There is no party or nightlife here. If you're bored of this place after a few days, it's your own fault for not doing a little research before dropping your hard-earned cash. 5. The food is lacking. I've never had gourmet food myself, but from what I know it's small portions, creative, unique and experimental. If there is any way this resort doesn't have something that can satisfy your taste buds, you should probably say home and stick with your routine and familiar comforts of home. I look forward to the experience! 6. Lack of Wine. Not everyone likes wine. Wine is expensive. It would be unfair for every guest to subsidize the expensive tastes of a fraction of the guests that actually visit the resort. It's for this reason that it's also not fair for couples that do not drink to go to all-inclusives. A good majority of the costs come from the unlimited liquor! This can all be researched and known before, so no complaining people. That's about it for the bads... now onto the good things. Well, just go do your own research.... Everything from the staff getting to know your names, drinks and other preferences to their beautiful resort, location, food, drinks, shows and nearby activities. I'm so incredibly excited to go and relax with my girlfriend and not have a care in the world. I look forward to writing part 2 and letting you all know exactly how it was. I will be taking magnitudes of photos of the area and posting them here. Hopefully this pre-review helps you out and allows you to see my before and after opinions and if you share the same \"before opinions\" then you will most likely be in store for the same \"after-opinion\" that i will be putting up in a few weeks! By the way, this will be my first all-inclusive resort experience and I've done a lot of research that has lead me to El Dorado Maroma!

Cannot say enough on how nice and accommodating the staff is at this resort. Enrique, (sp?) showed us around the resort and was a delight. Our concierge, Paola, went out of her way to help us obtain distilled water for my husband\u2019s c-pap machine. A young wait person, Israel, always greeted us with a big smile and made us smile each time we saw him. The beach and pool wait staff work so hard. Good things to know: A large golf umbrella is in each room \u2013 no need to bring one. Only used room service once, but was quickly delivered and you call and they pick up the dirty dishes just as promptly. You do have to call for the pick up; please don\u2019t leave dirty dishes outside your door as there are lemurs that patrol the resort after dark. They are not dangerous and the staff refers to them as raccoons. No elevators \u2013 we were on the third floor of the 300 building and we are both in our 60\u2019s and had no problem walking up and down the stairs. The sand bags to preserve the beach are there and they aren\u2019t real pretty. The water is shallow, chest depth, but the resort is removing some of the sand in front of the bags to deepen the depth of the sea. If you have an outside shower the wind might howl under the door from time to time. We simply put a floor bathmat in front of the outside door and the howling stopped. Shuttles to Playa del Carmen are run twice a week, free of charge. The shuttle left the resort at 12 noon and picked us up at 5:40 pm for the return trip. We walked a lot, shopped a lot, and had lunch in town. Playa del Carmen is geared for tourists and we had a good time. The duty free shop at the Mexican airport is outstanding. If you have the option of a shared non-stop transfer from the Airport to and from the resort \u2013 buy it. The resort was full while we were there. We had no problem getting the chairs on the beach we wanted. We did put towels and a book on the chairs around 7:30 am each morning. But, there were chairs left when we did arrive on the beach each day \u2013 no matter what time of the day is was. There was no wait at any of the restaurants. Morning walks along the beach past the Marina are great. The resort is quiet. We met a lot of folks from Canada, Minnesota, and England. We did not have any language problems. The front desk will cash Traveler\u2019s checks. You will be able to get USD or Pesos. We did tip while we were there. Nothing extravagant, but we did tip. A side note \u2013 we check to make sure everything is working when we first get to our room. The hairdryer, fans, air conditioning, and TV worked, but the Jacuzzi tub did not. We called the front desk and two maintenance men were at the room within 15 minutes. A new motor had to be installed and the resort checked with us if we wanted it replaced right then and there, as it would be about an hour job, or they would have made an appointment to come back. The battery in the remote control for the air conditioner needed to be replaced while we were there and again service was provided within 15 minutes. We can\u2019t complain about any service we received.

I thought I could lend some perspective on the El Dorado Maroma. My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights (5 days) at the end of January/beginning of Feburary. We arrived at the hotel around noon. We were greeted warmly by the reception staff (cool towels, sparkling wine, etc.). We were told that our room wasn't ready yet (check in time is 3pm). They gave us a quick tour of the property and dropped us off to have lunch. After lunch and a poolside nap (but not before 3pm), our room was finally ready. We were in an infinity pool suite. We were promised \"breathtaking ocean views\" and we had absolutely no ocean view. If you craned your neck you could kind of see the ocean through some palm trees, but in no way was this an ocean view. The little details of the room are what separate this place from a Four Seasons-- our curtains were a little stained, one of the patio chairs had a broken armrest, and our balcony door wouldn't lock--nothing earth shattering, but things you would notice. The room was quite spacious. The bed was comfortable (a bit soft for my taste). The bathroom was spacious, but the water pressure in the indoor shower was way too weak and the outdoor shower wasn't really usable--the shower head kind of sprayed all funky and it felt really exposed. The jacuzzi wasn't super clean so we didn't use it. The infinity pool on the balcony was kind of a waste of space. We had very little room to sit on the chairs. The beach bed on the balcony was a nice place to relax. The beach is great-- crystal blue waters, plenty of chairs for everyone, fabulous butler service. No complaints there. The pool was also really nice- a bit cold but refreshing in the heat. Onto the food/drinks. The staff was super duper nice. Absolutely no complaints. They had amazing personalities, chatted with you, and were really helpful and attentive. I felt like they were genuinely friendly people-- they were not being nice because they had to be. They were truly a pleasure and really made the experience more enjoyable. The food is fine. The portions are a little bit small, but you can order as much (or as little) food as you'd like. The Italian restaurant is nice, the Asian one is not bad. We didn't really try the Mexican one for dinner since we had Mexican for lunch every day.

Our goal was to get away for a long weekend, 3 nights, with another couple for a relaxing, enjoyable weekend. At the end of the weekend, we all agreed that it was the best resort we had visited for the combination of the facilities and the staff. Over the years, we have stayed at 7 other properties in the Playa del Carmen and Cancun area, ranging from the Ritz Carleton to Iberostar. El Dorado Maroma was easily the best. I think from the other reviews, you can get a fair assessment of the rooms and the food. Both very good. In my mind, the biggest distinguishing aspect of the hotel is the people that take care of you. Each person you encounter seems genuinely interested in helping you out. I got the sense that the owners and the management of the hotel treat the staff well and that carries over to how they treat the guests. From the moment we entered the hotel and Enrique helped to to our room to when we checked out, all of our needs were anticipated and met. Adela from the concierge staff was very helpful, Diego was an outstanding waiter on the beach and Isidero was very helpful in setting us up in a great room. The hotel was at capacity when we arrived and there was a slight delay, but the staff made things more than right by upgrading us to a fantastic \"Rain Man\" quality suite. We like to get some excercise on vacations and found the beach was excellent for running or walking. Nice combination of soft sand for walks and hard sand for running. If you are going to run on the beach, I would suggest wearing your running shoes. The gyn is servicable for weights with treamills. The Beach is outstanding, there is an artificial sand bar to keep waves at a minimum. The beach chairs and beds are plentiful for the number of rooms so you do not need to get up at 7AM to reserve a space. The pool setup is excellant as well. It seemed like someone came by every 10 minutes on the beach or at the pool to ask if we needed anything but not in an intrusive way. Unlike other resorts in the area, there were no roaming merchants coming onto the beach trying to sell you jewelery, blanklets, sunglasses, etc. The security is un-noticed and good.

The resort is all inclusive and the food is amazing! Very gourmet though, so if your just a meat and potato or burger and fries kinda person, you might go a little hungry.

They also have tiki bars along the beach and if your not a drinker they have what they call a health bar, that makes smoothies and such.

We spent a day at XPLOR which I would recommend for adventurous couples! It was our fist time ziplining and we loved it - they also had underground rafting, ATV vehicle circuits and a stalactite river swim! We took the Tulum Express Tour - photographing the ruins and learning about Mayan History was fascinating. On our final evening we took the Catamaran Cruise and watched the sunset while enjoying drinks and appetizers. We returned to the marina where a romantic candlelight dinner on the beach was awaiting with a saxophone player serenading us. Our concierge, Paola, made arrangements for us to take the free shuttle to Playa del Carmen where we shopped for souvenirs and checked out a few restaurants...a great afternoon of trying local food and beers outside of the resort while people watching during a stroll on the beach. Paola also checked on us throughout the week, let us know of events happening on the resorts and kept us up to speed on the themed dinner nights! We will definitley miss Emilio, our bartender at Rick's Bar, where we went daily for drinks after dinner. I am now a fan of Almond Margaritas and will have to go back for those alone! We had a great time with kareoke and the shows were quite entertaining - dancers and circus show and a Michael Jackson impersonator. Emilio was always entertaining us while the shows where not going on. We spent most of our time on the beach during the day, but we also loved Cesar, the bartender at Bar 24 - always smiling and great service - he makes another favorite drink...Purple Rain!

All along, I was thinking that EDM was going to be an upgrade from the GM and was looking forward to it. In summary, I was disappointed. Part of my disappointment was the weather (rained and was cold the entire time), which is obviously not EDM's fault. When we checked in, we waited 3 hours for our rooms to be ready (which was fine, because we were there before check-in). Our travel agent had previously confirmed upgrades for us (this is one of the main reasons we even picked this hotel in the first place instead of Secrets) and had requested rooms next to each other for us. When we got our rooms, one of us were not the room type that we had been confirmed in and we were not in rooms next to each other. This was really disappointing and we were told that they could not accomodate the requests because they were full (being next to each other, I can understand). I would have liked a little more sympathy for our situation, but did not receive any. The restaurant at the beach and the one at the pool had great food for breakfast and lunch. The food and service were both as good as I could have imagined. I was not at all happy with the dinner restaurants - there was one asian option and one italitan option. They were what I would expect of a typical all-inclusive and not on par with the breakfast and lunch food quality. Since EDM advertises themselves as a gourmet all-inclusive, I had expectations, and apparently that's where I went wrong. The shows were ok - the MJ show was entertaining, the others were really cheesy and amateur. I felt bad for the performers.... one dancer got dropped by her partner on the floor twice. Service at the beach was spotty but good enough and the servers were really nice and friendly. The rooms were very nice - I was favorbly impressed with them. I thought the cleanliness, furniture, size, decks, bath products, bathroom were all very nice. The pools were freezing, so no one was in them the entire time. The beach though was unbelievable! This was the highlight of my trip. The sand was so soft, the beach was expansive and you could swin/snorkel right in front of the hotel. I usually prefer to sit at the pool, but I was at the beach every day - I couldn't stay away - it was so beautiful. Despite the room snafu, I would still recommend this hotel but I would manage people's expectations appropriately (room snafu, food quality for dinner).", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cPerfection!!!\u201d", "Author": "nja53", "ReviewID": "UR93067374", "Content": "It\u2019s taken me a little while to write this as I had 2 sprained wrists and then the holidays were busy. We are Exotic Travel Members and have stayed several times at Karisma\u2019s Casita\u2019s Royale and decided this trip to go to EDM. Before staying there, I was concerned that there wouldn\u2019t be enough variety in dining. Last year while at Casita\u2019s Royale, we visited EDM. We were told about all the variety in dining and so that worry flew away! Our week there was incredible. From the moment we arrived to the day we left, it was perfect! We arrived on Friday and were warmly greeted by the staff. Susan, who maintains Facebook\u2019s Maroma Magic page recognized us from our pictures and came up to meet us with a big hug! We were promptly checked in and taken to our room. We stayed in suite 502, a swim-up Jacuzzi suite. We loved the location. It was private and very quiet. The swimups are numbered (as you stand and look at them from right to left), 301, 302, 401, 402, 501, 502, etc. 301 and 302 are more on the main walkway and not as private. Ours was perfect. The room was as I expected it to be from visiting the year before. Large, clean and luxurious\u2026 the bed was very comfortable! There was a table and chairs with fresh fruit and a bottle of sparkling wine. There was more than enough drawer and closet space. The bathroom was spacious and well supplied with amenities. There is only one thing I wish was a little different\u2026..that the air-conditioning was also able to make it into the bathroom. It really didn\u2019t cause any problems, it\u2019s just easier to style my hair if it\u2019s not warm/steamy. The shower was wonderful with an adjustable height handheld showerhead. That evening we were invited to \u201cDinner Around The World\u201d. There were only 7 couples at this dinner. There were six courses, each from a different country. The food was fantastic as was the service. The chef came out so we could express our gratitude for such a wonderful dining experience. Our days were filled with difficult decisions\u2026.beach or pool, Sabores or Papito\u2019s for lunch, mango margarita or Miama Vice\u2026.lol\u2026.it was tough but we survived! We usually ate breakfast at Papito\u2019s since we could enjoy the ocean views. The food was excellent. One morning we had Hibiscus Water\u2026.YUM! We also ate breakfast at Sabores a couple of times. Again food was excellent. Every day, Papito\u2019s had a different lunch. The Seafood Paella was to die for! The Mexican was excellent, well, every day was excellent. We also ate at Sabores for lunch too. Excellent as well. Dinner options included the two specialty restaurants as well as three themed nights at Sabores. The Specialty restaurants are Mi Cocino Italian and Kioyoko Asian. We thoroughly loved and enjoyed both dining experiences at each restaurant. The chef put on quite a show at the Asian restaurant! The themed nights were at Sabores and were Italian, Myan and Mexican. All the food was not only beautiful to look at, but delicious as well. The beach/pool service was top notch\u2026one time relaxing on a palapa on the beach, two lovely ladies brought shrimp and watermelon on skewers and another snack that I don\u2019t remember the name for. Delicious! Several mornings, we walked up the beach for about 30 minutes and didn\u2019t see another resort. The water was turquoise blue, warm and so inviting. We had a couples massage in the massage sky cabin. The massage itself was heavenly and the breeze, sounds and aroma of the ocean just added to the experience. I don\u2019t remember our therapists names, but they were excellent! I also had a full body scrub followed by a massage on another day. Then a massage by itself on yet another day. Daniel did both of these services and he is also excellent! Many nights we went to Rick\u2019s Bar for the entertainment. The magician was great, as was the circus act. One night they had a Michael Jackson impersonator with 8 backup dancers. I wasn\u2019t sure about it before we went, but it was fantastic! They were simply great! It was fun and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. The grounds are immaculate and beautifully landscaped. It was enjoyable to walk around during the day and very romantic at night. One day on the beach, we met Alfredo, the General Manager. We spent quite a bit of time talking and he expressed concern about a negative review that had been posted that week. I have to say his concern came straight from the heart. I reassured him that most people tend to take with a grain of salt a negative review when the vast majority are positive. I read the review when we got home and it was laughable. What touched me was his involvement in the comfort and enjoyment of his guests. He really cares. Alfredo, if you read the, sorry it took me so long to write this review. I like to give a big thank-you to everyone at the resort that made us feel so special and welcome.

Our initial impressions of the resort were based on our previous stays at its sister resort, El Dorado Casitas Royale, which is a much larger property with more amenities. We spent nine nights at EDM (Dec 15 - 24) after spending five nights in an infinity swim-up casita at EDR. We knew Maroma was small, but upon arrival, we were a little surprised by the quaintness of the resort. I guess we were just used to the more grand & spacious setting at EDR. But by our second night, we had grown accustomed to the cozy atmosphere. It was nice to be able to walk from the lobby to the beach in about a minute\u2026and slightly longer if you stopped to chat with one of the many friendly staff. The resort was small enough that if you were waiting for some information from the front desk or concierge staff, they would send you on your way so you could go about your day. When they needed to talk to you again, they would simply take a stroll and come find you on the beach, in the restaurant or wherever you were. Despite the cozy confines, we never felt cramped or smothered. Our Room: We stayed in a 4th floor infinity pool suite in building #3. It wasn't as nice as our infinity casita at EDR, but was comfortable nonetheless, spacious, and had a spectacular view of the water. Just be aware that there are no elevators in any of the buildings so you pay a price for the view with all of the stair climbing you'll be doing. Just be glad you're not carrying your luggage! (Thanks Enrique!). The flat screen TV was a good size with plenty of movie channels including HBO. The TV also had various connections so you could hook up your camera, iPod, laptop, etc. Dining: Three main restaurants (Italian, Japanese, Mexican) which are open for dinner and two restaurants available for breakfast and lunch. During the week, the Mexican restaurant hosts theme nights which features a different cuisine. We enjoyed fresh made-to-order omelettes at Pepitos. The daily lunch/drink specials at Pepitos also provided good variety throughout the week. The paella was especially excellent! Despite there only being three restaurants for dinner, we found the menus offered enough choices so you didn't have to repeat an appy, entree or dessert (unless you wanted to of course). If nothing on the menu interested you, the staff was willing to make you anything you wanted as long as they had the ingredients on hand. We had ordered room service on two separate occasions (one lunch and one dinner) and the quality of the food was just as good as eating in the restaurants. We never waited more than 20 mins. Overall the food and beverages were excellent. The Beach: One word...AMAZING! The sand is of the white powder variety, always cool to the touch, and groomed daily. And yes, the beach isn\u2019t 100% natural. You\u2019ll see the staff maintaining eroded sections by pumping in sand from other areas. While this may seem fake to some, it\u2019s also what gives you the picturesque, weed & rock free environment that made wading in the water so pleasurable. We enjoyed walking out 100 meters and still only being in water about waist high. We saw plenty of fish swimming around our ankles, including the occasional ray. We also enjoyed watching the pelicans feeding just meters away from us. Any seaweed that did wash ashore was cleaned up by the staff at least once, if not twice a day. The beach servers were very consistent with checking on your drinks every 20 mins or so. The concierge staff came around once a day with a small snack just before lunch. Daniel from the Spa came around with free 5 min massages almost daily. During our stay there was some construction at the south end of the beach (building a new Presidential section) but it never interfered with our relaxation. There are plenty of beach chairs to go around, but beds are in limited supply. They are usually taken by the \"early risers\" who put their towels and other personal belongings out by 6:30 am. While this didn\u2019t affect us, it\u2019s kind of a pet peeve of ours to see the beds reserved but not used until mid to late morning. If this sounds like you, be courteous to your fellow guests and be happy with whatever is available when you finally get to the beach. :) The Pools: Both the larger pool by Sabores and the smaller pool in the Mi Hotelito section looked nice enough. The water was cool in both and the Mi Hotelito pool was surrounded by palm trees which provided shading to the seating during the day. We never did use either pool during our stay. With such a beautiful beach, using the pool never crossed our minds. Activities: The resort provided beach volleyball, snorkelling, kayak tours, yoga, and other activities you find at similar resorts, but no one ever pressured you into participating. You can be as active or as lazy as you want. With the exception of a couple of beachwear fashion shows, there wasn\u2019t any annoying \u201coot-oot\u201d club music blasting by the pool or beach. The marina next door was VERY convenient if you wanted to take a water related excursion like snorkelling, wave runners, fishing, scuba, parasailing, etc. There's nothing like waking up, having breakfast, and walking a couple of minutes to begin your excursion. And when your excursion is over, it\u2019s even better to walk a few minutes and be back at your resort. There's a small, air-conditioned gym which had a few pieces of cardio equipment and free weights. Of the five times I used it, there was never more than one other person in there. The resort provided a complimentary shuttle to Playa del Carmen twice a week (reservations required). If you wanted to go any other time, it was only a short $25 (each way) cab ride. Nightlife: The entertainment was held in Rick's Bar and featured the typical resort style shows. We took in Karaoke on Tuesday (super fun), the live band on Thursday (a wonderful Cuban trio), and the Michael Jackson show on Friday (also excellent). The majority of the shows ended by 11pm after which most of the audience adjourned to their rooms even though the bar was open till 2am. Even though Rick's Bar is located right in the middle of the resort, we never found it noisy on nights we opted to stay in our room. The Spa: Although pricey compared to what you would be charged in Playa del Carmen, the masseuses were fantastic and provided as much or as little pressure as you wanted (thanks Jasmine and Daniel). Our only suggestion is that the spa supply you slippers with your bath robe during your treatment. Special thanks & kudos go to: Carmina (our concierge) \u2013 Knowledgeable and made us feel at home. Any minor issues we experienced were resolved efficiently and to our satisfaction. Luis (Lomas Travel Rep) - great service and suggestions on excursions and tours Diego (Beach Butler) - Made sure our electric lemonades were always topped up and brought us coco locos the moment they became available Chef Kim (Pepitos) - for making us a special going-away lunch on our last day before we caught the shuttle to the airport...even though the restaurant didn't open for another 1/2 hour! Kari (Activities) - Muchas gracias for the Latin dancing lessons! Gabby & Elias (Mio) for the excellent service Emilio (Rick's Bar) - great drinks, great service! Israel/Aurelio/Humberto (Pepitos) - great service! Enrique (Bellman) \u2013 Always willing to assist, not just with your luggage. Oh, and we can\u2019t forget the two servers at Kiyoko (sorry, we missed catching your names) that put on the impromptu Mayan coffee flamb\u00e9 show just for us on our last night. Our primary goal was rest and relaxation so we didn\u2019t take in everything the resort had to offer. But what we did experience, and have commented on, more than exceeded our expectations. And as with most things in Mexico, things aren't always perfect. However our experience left us with the feeling that the staff truly cared and always did their best to make us happy when things didn't go exactly according to plan. EDM may not be the biggest or grandest resort we have stayed at, but the high level of personalized service provided by staff made all the difference.

The beach is wonderfully soft, white powder that feels fabulous on your feet, and the water is gorgeous! Definitley one of the best beaches in Mexico. Maroma beach is also listed on the travel channel's top 10 beaches. El Dorado Maroma provided great service. We checked in around 2:00 and our room was ready. We had booked a swim up, which was great. However, I will say that although it is just a few steps from the beach it is blocked by all the palm trees, so the infinity pool rooms provide better views. Meals were great. We didn't like everything we tried, but could always find something we really liked. Room service was great and prompt. The food is definitely gourmet. One rainy evening we borrowed a movie for our room, and they brought us popcorn to our room. Beach service was fantastic, and we didn't tip. (we usually tip at the end of our stay because we dont' want to carry around money-the point of AI). We had a couples massage in the sky massage and it was fantastic! Listening to the ocean and the views while you're getting massaged is wonderful! I thought the prices were way too high, but we did it anyway. During our stay, they found us at one of the shows and told us they were upgrading us to the Presidential suite! It was the best place I have stayed in, and being a travel agent, i have stayed in a lot of places! You really couldn't ask for more. There were 4 patios, full kitchen, living area, bedroom and fully stocked bar, and my favorite, 4 types of Haagen Dazas ice cream. Yummy! It was really Unbelievable!

Now, it is a smaller boutique hotel without all the loud activities of many of the resorts, so know and understand what you are getting before booking this vacation.

We also brought 2 couples with us that had never been to this resort. This was our 4th stay in the Karisma family and have enjoyed them all. I read some of these reviews and wonder what the people are looking for. Some times things will not go off without a glitch or two, but you are not at the Ritz in New York, you are on the Riveria Maya where nothing happens in a hurry. We arrived by limo through Lomas Travel and they were on time as promised. We had a Navigator stretch for the 6 of us with beers ready and waiting. There was a little confusion on the reservation but this was corrected immediately. Upon arriving at the resort, Luis was quick to welcome us and make sure the return arrangements were set and accurate. The welcome from the Maroma team was quite personal and they told us Welcome Back right when we arrived. This is a small detail, but makes a Karisma traveler feel remembered. We were offered champagne and none of us drank it, so the bellman went to the bar and got us what we desired. Cerveza for the guys and fruities for the girls, it was perfect. I had been asking for the upper deck of the older section and they made it happen. All 3 rooms were side by side and on the upper level. This was perfect as we could still talk when at the room before dinner and after Ricks Bar. Again, another small detail, but proving they will go out of their way to make your stay rememberable. We were on the beach everyday at 7:30 am and the workers were ready for us. If you treat them with dignity and respect, you will have a trip that is perfect. If you don't, then you won't get the service desired. I feel this would be the same at any hotel, stateside or in Mexico. Cesar, Diego, Kary, Franklin, Bell, Teo, Antonio, Emilio, etc., you guys were all the best. We had a great time and because of you guys, the experience will give us something to talk about for quite some time. The restaurants were never crowded and the food was great. I see people wanting more choices for restaurants, but if you go to a resort that is small in nature like this one, 144 guests maximum, it may seem quite limited, but in reality, it is not. If you want more choices, find a larger resort. We prefer the boutique resort of Maroma for the service and the nice people that we get to meet. We met some nice people this time that we have a great chance and seeing again, maybe even at the Maroma. The only problem I had with this trip was the hotel booked a wedding party of 47 people and the resort was overtaken by them. 95% of them were very rude, left messes, were loud in the restaurants, and would not go to bed. They overused the room service and were not considerate of others at all. I made this complaint to the hotel that if a party is this big, then send them to a sister resort. This is my only complaint for the week. So that being said, Bully/Rushell, Sean/Sarah, Bob/Lanita, Dino/Daisy, Darrell/Carma, and we can't forget big Lee from Booger town, what do you think about the Maroma November 24-December 1, 2012?

Nearly everything in our room was broken when we arrived or during our stay, including the outdoor shower, in room DVD player, in room whirlpool bath, and outdoor infinity pool. Some of these issues were fixed while others were not. As the trip went on, we gave up asking for fixes. The sewage odor is overpowering at times and really ruins the atmosphere. The restaurants play cheesy elevator music that make you not want to eat there after hearing it for a few days in a row. There is a list of activities posted each day, with about 10% actually occurring. The service was inconsistent and was never top notch. The beach is man-made, which looks nice but feels artificial. If you walk down the beach towards other resorts, you get a chance to see the natural beach which is disgusting! There is trash everywhere. We didn't feel comfortable swimming in the ocean after seeing all that trash. The food overall was ok. The lunches at Sabores was our favorite. The Michael Jackson show is the best thing the resort offers. It's not advertised on the activity list, so remember to see it on Friday nights. We were really bummed about this resort given the rave reviews on TripAdvisor. If you are familiar with vacationing in Hawaii, this place will disappoint you for sure. We were also disappointed with Karisma. We had hoped to cut our vacation short, but they were not offer any kind of refund. Nor did they care why we were unhappy.

The beach was beautiful, the hotel was OK, and our room was depressing. Would I come back? Possibly, but it\u2019s not very high on my list. Please see specific notes listed below. BEACH: The beach at El Dorado Maroma is exquisite \u2013 top notch. I do not believe there are any beaches like this anywhere else in the area. The water is crystal clear and perfectly calm even on the windiest of days (this is extremely rare in Mexico). Small fish are easily visible as you wade in the water, or from shore. There are miles for walking, and within a very short walk (less than a half a mile) is a pier where a company offers a number of different activities (please refer to my activities section for more information). Additionally, there are beach beds spread out throughout the beach as well as a number of palapas. Although we generally went to the beach early (around 08:30AM) we never had a problem getting a bed or palapa dependent upon our choice each day. There are so few guests who stay at the hotel (as there are only 70 rooms) that the beach always seems deserted, which I found lovely and refreshing. POOLS: There are two small pools, with two swim up bars on the premises. Surrounding the pools are palapas and beds. There was very low attendance in the pools during our stay. HOTEL GROUNDS: The hotel grounds are small (very small in fact), but lovely. There are flowers everywhere, and during our stay in late November Christmas decorations in every direction. The lobby is quite small and simple, and features two computers for use at a nominal charge ($6 per half hour). Outside of the lobby is the tour director\u2019s office, as well as the concierge. Note: Avoid going to the concierge. It is impossible to ask a simple question without having a half hour discussion on their \u201cEl Dorado Maroma Club\u201d which you have to pay for, by the way. Additionally, there is Rick\u2019s bar and a small gym. HOTEL ROOM: We stayed in the Mi Hotelito Room and quite frankly for $400 a night found it quite disappointing. If you can\u2019t afford to upgrade do not have high expectations regarding your hotel room. It is old, there are cracks in the floor, the stairs going to the room have been warped from the constant humidity (elderly people would likely need to be on the ground floor for safety purposes), and worst of all the air conditioning vent is directly over the bed. As a result my husband and I coughed so much from the constant cold air on us that we had to turn off the air conditioner and sweat throughout the nights. Not a fun experience. The room was disappointing enough that I would not return here unless we could afford an upgrade. The room is in no way indicative of the amount of money you are spending each night. DINING: Breakfast: We had breakfast each morning in our room ordering off of the room service menu. There are five selections on the menu consisting of pancakes, French toast, omelets, etc. The food was great, but if you leave it on the deck the birds will attack and make a pretty big mess. Also, a bit more variety on the menu would have been nice. Lunch: Each day there are two options for lunch. One is the grill which has outdoor seating overlooking the beach and daily specials. You are limited to the special of the day, and a selection of chips and dips. Selections while we were there included tacos, bbq day, fresh fish, etc. The other option is a Mexican restaurant which has both indoor and outdoor seating and a larger menu with a number of appetizers, entr\u00e9es and desserts (try the fajitas and ceviche). It was a nice, but again, one would likely be bored on a long stay (we were at the hotel for five days and were bored of the food). Dinner: There are three dinner options as outlined below. Japanese \u2013 if you live in a city and eat sushi regularly I would not suggest eating sushi here. The atmosphere however is nice, and they did have nice sake Italian \u2013 the food was nice (although not authentic), and the atmosphere as well was nice Mexican \u2013 this is the same restaurant as is included during lunch however the menu is spruced up a bit at night. Additionally, once a week mariachis perform. There is also the opportunity to dine on the beach for between $200-$250, which we did not do as we noticed that if it was windy outside everyone gets lumped together where they give the sky massages, which in my opinion would greatly take away from the experience. BARS: There are two bars at this hotel, and these are the two swim up bars. If you are not in the pool and would like a drink you must hover over the pool to get one, or have someone get one for you. It would have been nice to have at least one bar not connected to a pool. SERVICE: Service was mostly good, but had a few glitches. We were greeted outside by Enrique (who is great for the record) and he offered my husband tequila as he does not drink champagne. Enrique gave us a tour of the grounds as well as helped us with our luggage on our way in as well as our way out. IMHO he provided the best service of the trip. Service on the beach was great some days, although we tipped for each drink. The last two days of our trip service on the beach was HORRIBLE (so much so that I complained to three people). Come to find out the person next to me who was receiving all the service was tipping in $5 instead of the $1 I was providing. While I can\u2019t blame the people working for wanting to make more money, as a guest of the hotel I should not have experienced this, especially as no tips should be expected. Finally, one of the bartenders was pretty rude overall (so much so that I avoided going to the bar he was working at). The waiters were all great, as was the reception. OTHER: There\u2019s no ATM at the hotel. The closest ATM is 15 minutes away. We split our stay between Excellence Playa Mujeres and El Dorado Maroma. While the hotel itself at Excellence (room, restaurants, entertainment, etc) absolutely killed El Dorado Maroma, El Dorado Maroma killed Excellence in terms of the beach. Had these two hotels been combined I doubt I\u2019d ever search anywhere again. Activities \u2013 do the ocean explorer tour at the Marina next door! You ride a jet ski to snorkeling areas and never have to get on a boat.

We were then introduced to Paola who helped us throughout our stay. Thanks Paola, you were great. You worked us hard and were kind even when we declined. Good job, it was nice chatting with you and thanks for the wonderful treats you brought us on the beach most days. The room was not ready so we had about an hour to explore. We had a bite at the bbq lunch and took a stroll through the grounds. The staff found us when the room was ready and we walked into a large, impressive room, with a spectacular view. More was not necessary for us. The deck was fantastic, we enjoyed the outdoor bed and table for cards. The bathroom was generous in size with a spacious indoor shower and a fabulous outdoor shower. We absolutely loved showering outside. Eladio cleaned our room each day and left us fabulous towel art. The collection at the end of the week was great. Thanks for a job well done Eladio, we truly appreciated it. We changed and ventured onto the bech for a bit and then got ready for supper. We are early risers so dinners for us were early and the restaurants were empty. We loved this as we were able to chat with all the wonderful staff who served us. From the first dinner to the last it was spectacular food and service. We tried dishes we might not have normally and enjoyed the combinations. We experienced beyond perfect service at all the restaurants but our favorite was enjoying Gaby's smile at the italian restaurant. Gaby's kind and caring and we enjoyed getting to know her. Thanks for the great service and smiles, Gaby. We met Luis on his sixth day of being the Japanese cook. Good luck Luis, you did great. He performed for only the two of us which was very kind of him. We do believe in tipping for service and it was fun being generous to these hard working people. They work very hard for their money and a small thanks for their service seemed the right thing to do. We found everyone bent over backwards to be pleasant and help us. We also didn't see them give less service for the many that did not tip. It was just an extra skip in their step and maybe a more genuine smile that was the difference and we knew it was the right thing to do. Each day we found a spot on the beach and enjoyed the 6am coffee and lots of walks. The shallow water does go on forever and is different. Agustin looked after us each day on the beach, we could not have asked for better service. We enjoyed getting to know you Agustin and wish you the best. It was great meeting new friends on the beach, we enjoyed chatting throughout the week. We would like to thank Daniel for working so diligently on Juan's shoulder. We enjoyed the sunrise massage over the water. It was a little rushed but wonderful none the less. Walks were nice and there is an interesting driftwood art area a ways up the beach. Not sure who made it but there is a sailboat anchored nearby. Breakfast at either restaurant was great. We pretty much stay with fruit and yogurt but the omlets did look good. Lunches were a new theme each day or the regular menu at the poolside restaurant. Both were great. The Marina beside the hotel was busy but not that noisy and is nice for any excursions you might take. Or walking the docks and sneaking a peek at someone's sailfish catch of the day. We truly enjoyed ourselves at this resort. We were looking for a very quiet, romantic, quality resort and the El Dorado Maroma exceeded our expectations.

PROS: (a) Great beach. The beach is very clean, and the workers rake it and the inlet numerous times each day for seaweed. The beach is very important to me, so this is a huge factor in my rating. (b) Beach amenities. There were always chairs, beach beds, and beach towels available. Again, because of the importance of the beach to me, this is a huge factor in my rating. (c) Waitstaff. Generally, the waitstaff were wonderful and attentive. Only on a few occasions did it take a long time to get a drink, and only on one occasion did the waiter entirely forget. (And yes, we did tip -- more on that below.) (d) Room service. The fact that you can get room service at any time of the day or night is a huge plus and great amenity. CONS: (a) Explorer Club. This is the Karisma group's version of a timeshare. We were convinced by our personal concierge to sit in on this presentation. We were told it was only 30 minutes. When we got to the presentation, we were told it was 1.5 hours. Granted, we are adults and should at that time said \"no thank you\" and left. However, we felt bad and stayed. Big mistake. First, in my opinion, there is very little benefit to this club and would take you years before you broke even. (I am happy to discuss specifics with anyone but do not want to take up space here, as this topic itself could be a post.) Second, the sales associate who gave us the presentation wouldn't directly answer any question. We had to repeat each question 3 or 4 times before he would give us a somewhat straight-forward answer. (b) Reservation Process. We reserved through the Karisma website rather than through a travel agent or travel website. We found that the best deal was through Karisma. While it was fairly easy to reserve and pay, it was not so easy to receive any type of meaningful confirmation or check-in information. See (c) below for comments concerning check-in, an ordeal that could have been avoided had we received any meaningful information. (c) Check-in. We arrived at the hotel after taking a red-eye around noon and were told that our room would not be ready until 3 pm. We have previously never had a problem checking into a hotel early. Perhaps this is something we should have confirmed beforehand, but did not think it would be a problem at a resort of this \"caliber\" and particularly when we were going in the slow-season. In fact, many rooms were empty during our stay. We ate lunch, took a nap on the beach, and then went back to reception at 3 pm. At that time, we were told that our room was still not ready and could we please wait another 15-20 minutes? That was quite annoying as we were very jet-lagged and ready to settle in. It would be helpful if check-in time was confirmed at the time of booking, or better yet if the information was available on the website. (d) Check-out. The check-out process was equally as annoying. First, as we were carrying our bags as we were leaving our room, an associate approached us and asked if we needed help. We politely but firmly told her no -- that we would prefer to take our own bags. I had to run back to the room and left my boyfriend alone for 2 minutes when the bell captain came and grabbed the bags. The sales associate had radioed him. Again, perhaps it is our fault for not being more insistent. However, I found it annoying that we would have to say this more than once. Perhaps the associate was trying to be helpful, but we prefer that our requests were honored instead. The check-out process itself took some time. We are used to either e-check-out (where you can do it from your room), or where you receive itemized charges the morning of, review it, and then check-out quickly at the front desk. Here, you do not receive an itemization until you check-out. Moreover, the itemization was in Spanish. I understand that we were in a Spanish-speaking country. However, with so many English-speaking guests, it would have been helpful to not only have the itemization before-hand but also in English. Also, it would have been helpful to have the itemization in dollars. Again, this would normally not be a complaint, but everything we purchased was provided to us in dollars -- the cost of the stay, the excursions, the spa. To suddenly present us the final bill in pesos was a bit disconcerting. (d) Repairs. The only issue we had while at the hotel was that our porch light would not come on. We called and spoke to reception on two separate occasions on two separate days. It was not fixed. It was not until the third complaint that this issue was resolved. (e) Wake-up calls. We asked for wake-up calls on each day we did an excursion. On each of these days the wake-up calls were 10-15 minutes late. We do not consider this to be on-time. (f) Internet. You are changed $70 for a week of internet. Again, for a resort of this caliber we were disappointed that the resort would charge at all for internet. NEUTRALS: (a) Food. I know people rave about the food here, but in my opinion it was only so-so. Certain dishes were fairly good. Others were not good at all, including dishes made of beef, which I thought was of lower quality. Remember though that this is a matter of personal preference. (b) Drinks. Like their food, some of the drinks were really good and others not good at all. I recommend their simple mixed drinks (rum+coke, bloody marys) but not their tropical drinks (pina colada, mojito), which I thought were way too sweet. Again, though this is a matter of personal preference. (c) Lomas Travel. FYI, Lomas Travel is owned by the same family that owns the Karisma hotels. We booked a couple of excursions through Lomas. The first excursion was great. The second excursion was only so-so to downright not good. Be aware though that Lomas does not run their own excursions (at least not those we went on). They act as a travel agent. I later found out that for at least one of our tours, had we booked it on our own, it would have cost less. I supposed you pay for the service and convenience of a travel agent; however, I would recommend to others that (i) you book your own excursions through the internet; or (ii) rent a car from the airport (which is cheaper than the cost of 2 roundtrip airport transfers) and do the excursions yourself. For instance, an excursion to Coba is over $100, even though a ticket is $5. If you want a guide, you can hire one there for around $25. (d) Room. We stayed in the basic room. The room was okay. The bed was generally comfortable. The mini-bar stocked each day. The room cleaned well. You don't spend very much time in the room, so I would not recommend the upgrade to an infinity or swim-up suite. When we arrived, I was a little disappointed that we hadn't gotten the swim-up suite (about $100 more per day). However, I soon realized that the pools and beach are so close that the swim-up suite is not worth it. What would make the room better is a flat screen tv and a chest of drawers. There were not drawers in our room. TIPS: This is supposedly an all-inclusive resort. However, you will soon learn that if you don't tip your food/drinks will come slower. You have to tip. We generally tipped $5 after each meal and $1 per drink. Just remember, if it were truly an all-inclusive resort, the staff would be directed not to accept ANY tips. There are resorts such as this. Overall, we would recommend this to a friend but with the review above. It is a nice resort, and we feel like we generally got our money's worth in comparison to other hotels we've stayed at.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIt doesn't get any better than this\u201d", "Author": "bandito10", "ReviewID": "UR87799993", "Content": "I recently stayed at El Dorado Maroma Resort for 11 nights.

The resort is located on the oceans edge at one end of Maroma Beach. The pure white sandy beach runs north to Puerto Morelas or appox. 5 KM long. The beach is rated in the top 10 of the world.

Maroma is a quiet paradise. My husband and I have been to Riviera Maya numerous times. This time all we wanted to do was relax by the beach with a good book and take it easy from the hustle of NYC living. We love staying in smaller boutique style hotels. We stayed in the Mi Hotleito section. We wanted to be closer to the beach. Room was great with a comfortable king bed. They are smaller than the other rooms at the hotel. We hardly stayed in it, but to sleep at night. So, in my opinion save your money for other things instead of upgrading room type. Here is why I only gave it 3 stars: The first room they put us in was on the first floor. The walk-out balcony was facing the pool bar. Hated that--no privacy. Everybody at the pool could see into your room. However this could be a bonus room feature for some who like to just walk out and get a drink from the pool bar. Take a look at karismahotels.com--go to the virtual tours and select Mi Hotelito Beachfront Suit--- that is the 1st room they tried to put us in. You can see the pool bar directly off the walk-out balcony. They were able to give us another room on the second floor of the Mi Hotelito section. We were told that a lot of people ask to be switched to another room after seeing it. I just dislike the process of them trying to put you in that room if so many people decide to switch out of it. Especially since the occupancy was so low. That process did take a couple of hours---not sure as to why they were only at 40% occupancy. Even Perla was surprised it took so long. Lomas travel guy was annoying. Nice guy, but when we arrived we mentioned to him that we have been to Riviera Maya numerous times and we already went on all the excursions that interested us. Well he kept coming up to us while we were relaxing by the beach and inviting us to talk to him for 20 min to book an excursion. Each time we told no. Finally by the 4th day he left us alone. You have to book all your activities with the concierge. This was fine. We knew we wanted to do the candlelight dinner at the beach (celebrating anniversary), mayan dinner ,Italian dinner and kayak tour (all which I recommend). This part is NOT o.k.-- After booking all the hotel activities they try to talk you into attending this lunch seminar for the Exotic Travel Club. Which is another stupid time share thing. Even after we said no several times she reserved a spot. Well we just never showed up we didn't care if she booked a spot. On the 2nd day the canopy over our bed fell off the ceiling. We were on the 2nd floor so the ceiling was high. We left it on the bed thinking housekeeping will be able to put it back up with a ladder. Well 2 days later the canopy was still not put back up. After housekeeping made the bed they just set the huge canopy on top of the bed . Finally, my husband, who is tall stood on top of a table and was able to hang it back up using the umbrella from our room for extra height. We eat dinner late usually 8 or 9 p.m. So, we were always getting ready when they came to do the turn-down service. We did get it once. But, we don't really care for that stuff. It is a beautiful quiet setting. Food and drinks were great and waitstaff was awesome. They would give you a fresh beer if they noticed yours was getting too warm. Perla did check on us throughout the week. But having stayed at similar adults only boutique hotels and comparing it to them El Dorado Maroma falls short in keeping with what the customers are looking for in their vacation. This goes beyond the food and service.

WOW. Almost all reviews on here are extremely positive and many explain this resort very well. I am extremely surprised at the last one star review that just showed up and it seems a bit suspicious. Had to \"hike\" to get a drink - there is no hiking in this resort since it is so small. The beach butlers were everywhere. Many of the other \"cons\" were hard to believe as well. Here's a summary of our expereience. This is a small boutique resort and a real gem. You should know before you go that this is a smaller resort and that is what the charm is all about.If you are looking for something lively go somewhere bigger or with a different vibe. We met some great couples here and also were able to easily find secluded spots all over the gorgeous property. Arrival - when we arrived we were provided champagne and given a tour of the resort. Our room was not yet ready so it scared us a bit from the start. We were taken to lunch and things were looking up. We had a flank steak quesadilla and spicy chicken skewars. Delicious and something we've tried to replicate after our trip. Room - we stayed in the infinity pool suite on the 3rd floor. We were at the end of the resort closest to the ocean. It was a huge room with spectacular views of the ocean and pool. The infinity pool was nice although we didn't use it all that much. I wouldn't stay in the swim ups because there isn't a lot of privacy and no view. Food - very good. Not incredible, but enjoyable. Some things were delicious and some things were good. I thought it was the best all inclusive food we have had. My wife equated it to some of the finer dining restaurants at a sandals. Everything is a la carte and will take some time to bring out. Every dish came out hot. I would recommend the risotto in the Italian restaurant and skewars in the asian restaurant for dinner. At lunch the beach restaurant has a great mix every day of food and a daily water. Eating at the beach restaurant for breakfast and lunch was awesome. Wine - they had a limited selection of wine as part of the all inclusive plan. You could certainly buy other bottles for a lot of $. The house wines were so-so and didn't have everything we liked. We typically like pinot grigio for a white but only had one chardonnay. The house wines were not high quality. Drinks - all other drinks were great. They had high quality liquors, and dos equis/tecate for beer. We have been to other all inclusives before and there is typically one a regular and light beer option of the local variety. Beach - we spent most of our time on the beach. The two pools were very nice but we loved the beach. Most people were on the beach and the pool was usually empty. The water was warm and clear most days depending upon the seas. Even though most people were at the beach it still seemed empty. We were able to get a palapa every day even though we usually eat breakfast late and get to the beach closer to noon. This is not a resort where any chair games are played and I loved that about it. This is a boutique luxury resort. Service - spectacular. We have never experienced this type of service. Every single person working there from the concierge to the beach butlers were there to make sure you were having a fabulous time. They remember what you like and pamper you throughout the stay. They do not require tips although single dollars go a long way in helping out the staff. A tip made a difference at Rick's bar at night too where the bartender would remember your drink and make sure your glass was never empty wherever you were sitting. I can't say enough good things about every single employee at the resort. I was 'wowed'. Other notes -do the jet ski snorkel tour. The reef there extends along the coast line and have a lot of different things to see. We saw fish, lobster, stingrays, turtles, starfish, coral, etc. It was a unique experience being able to jet ski around and then stop at 2 unique spots. The second spot was a cenote where an underground river was feeding into the ocean. It was basically a big cave with a different variety of fish. -we didn't get a towel animal our first day. After the first day I left a tip for the maid each day and we had towel animals. Not sure if this was a coincidence. I would've left a tip daily anyway just forgot the first day. -wifi was $15 a day. You end up getting about 30 kbps (dial up speed). The two computers they have as the business center you have to pay for too. Not sure how much that is. Only wanted to connect quickly for email so it was sufficient. We were happily unplugged. I did get good speeds one day to connect to directv and watch sunday NFL in our palapa. Not sure I've ever had a better NFL day than that. Spa - we had a sunrise massage out over the ocean one morning which was fantastic. We had some annoying people going out on the kayaks at the beginning (the kayak tour starts at 10 right next to the sky massage). Once they were gone we were at peace. Cons -wine -airport (not the resort's fault) - schedule transportation ahead of time and head straight outside to your transport making sure they have your name on a list. There will be a lot of people trying to fake different things. Most of them are timeshare salesmen. I heard a rumor that this will be ending in the next few months. Just be ready for it. Also watch the people that want to roll your bags 5 feet out the door and then ask for a tip. Don't let go of your bags. -didn't do anything special for our anniversary -don't leave food in your room - the ants will find their way in. -bugs at night - bring your bug spray (this should really be offered in the room). This may depend on how the breeze is blowing. The first few nights we didn't have any bugs on the balcony. The last two nights they were crazy.

However, I want to give people an informative review of what to expect when you stay there. As the saying goes, \"it depends on what you are looking for.\" On our way to the El dorado, we passed some fabulous entrances and resorts (as we had to drop people off through the shuttle). Then, we arrived at the El Dorado. I was initially devasated to be honest. The resort entrance and lobby area was to say the least \"understated.\" It did not have anything special about it and I thought \"wow, I have made a huge mistake!\" Okay, now the good part! This resort is not about the entrance or lobby. Its about the personalized service, attention. and boutique resort experience. Everyone who works at the resort is focused on making you happy and making sure your stay is enjoyable. You will see the same staff workers over and over because the resort is so small. Even better, they are all NICE and will feel like old friends after your stay. The resort is small and charming. The rooms are draped by sheers that wave in the wind and the room accommodations exceed most hotels that I have ever stayed including the Park Hyatt and Ritz Carlton. The mini-bar is stocked daily and the entire resort uses \"aromatherapy\" which provides an endless spa experience. I am still amazed by the wonderful smells throughout the entire resort. Its a big deal....trust me....You wil love it! The beach beds are always open and there is abundant beach butler service. It is absolutely true that the bar offers top-shelf liquor and they will do whatever it takes to make sure your drink is just as you would have it at home. I am a bit of a club soda and vodka snob so I was more than impressed by the club soda bubbles and high-end vodka. The restaurants are again \"under-stated\" and unimpressive from a visual perspective. However, the service was fabulous and the food was quite good. You will forget that the pools, restaurants and lobby area is umimpressive because the resort is so charming and you can't help but to fall in love with the staff. You can get glitz and oversized swim up bars in lots of resorts in Playa Del Carmen at many resorts but if you want a charming, personalized and romantic experience then El Dorado Maroma is for you! The ONLY negative comment I have is that a wedding group can totally change the experience for you. If there is a loud wedding group then it can change the vibe because the resort is so small. We had a few that were a tad annoying but nothing worth worrying too much over. We had a great time. Okay, my last comment is that the sky massages are great (many thanks to Danielwho is a huge asset to the Maroma!) but if you want an additional FABULOUS spa experience then book a Balinese massage at the Banyan Tree Mayakoba. It was amazing! The resort is also amazing but I don't regret staying at the El Dorado Maroma because of the charming experience and value for our money. The Banyan Tree is pricey and most of the rooms are very far from the beach which is another plus at the El Dorado Maroma. EVERYTHING is close to the beach. We had a honeymoon suite which was great for privacy and views. However, the ground floor Mi Holito suites are SOOOO convenient and again very charming and well equipped. The only reason I did not want to stay in the Mi Holito suite is that there is not bath tub and I love a good bath. The swim up suites are not private at all so I would go for the infinity pool suite over the swim up suites if I had a choice. We hope to visit the Azul beach resort with our kids soon. I am a Karisma lover ! If you want a genuine mexican vacation at charming small resort then El Dorado Maroma is for you!", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradenton", "Title": "\u201cBeyond amazing!\u201d", "Author": "runaway22", "ReviewID": "UR86371619", "Content": "Two years ago my husband surprised me with a birthday vacation to the Bahamas.

El Dorado Maroma was it! I had absolutely no idea what I was in store for but trusted the sage advice from our travel agent, Jennifer Doncsez at VIP Vacations, who happened to be the sole reference my hubby used 2 years ago. She didn't let us down this time either. We booked a swim up suite and when we arrivede it was over the top the entire time. The room is high end, the resort was the perfect size and by day 2 everyone there knew our names! Jennifer gave us a certificate for a beachfront candlelight dinner for 2 and a bunch of servers sang happy birthday (in Spanish) to my hubby. The food was the best all inclusive food I have had! The drinks were not watered down and the bartender even taught me how to make a SOMBRERO! My favorite drink--since it has coffee liquer in it, I have insisted it is OK to drink in the morning too! We met so many couples who also enjoyed this resort and it was pleasant knowing everyone was having the time of their lives. The beach is just gorgeous and we would walk down to the marina daily.

Indeed, the occasion was special, but the staff at EDM make it extraordinary. I simply can't say enough good things about the staff there. Thank you to everyone - those we worked closely with directly and those who worked behind the scenes - for making our dreams come true in so many ways. We traveled with a party of 19 total, ranging in ages from 17 (my stepdaughter) to mid-60s (our parents). We had both couples and singles with us, well-traveled and novices, with varying degrees of culinary sophistication. Everyone - to the person - loved EDM and enjoyed their time there. Whether they are globe-trotting foodies or first-time-international traveler teenagers, our family found their own extraordinary experiences here. For brides looking for a destination wedding location, look no further - EDM is IT. The location - and the team - will make your moment perfect. Another tip for brides looking to do a destination wedding - our All About Honeymoons & Destination weddings travel agent, Tina Hearn, will do a SPECTACULAR job for your group re: planning, travel, etc. She's well-connected at EDM, and works with their teams seamlessly. Tina, Valeria Martinez (with Lomas Weddings), and Jackie (at EDM), made it absolutely spectacular. Can't go wrong with this team, ladies. One of the highest compliments comes from one of our guests: One of our groomsmen and his wife are very well-traveled, having been to many different kinds of resorts all over the world. They said that EDM was the only resort they'd been to that was special enough to warrant a return trip. We know that virtually all our guests are indeed planning return trips in the coming year, including us. This place is indeed a gem. I'll go by category, for those interested in the details: The resort (rooms, etc.) EDM is relatively small -- only 72 rooms -- and even at high occupancy, you feel like you have the run of the place all by yourself. We NEVER had to wait in line for beach beds or chaises, drinks, food, anything. It felt like we were the only guests there - even though I know that they had at least one other wedding party on property while we were there. The rooms, at all levels (Mi Hotelito to Jacuzzi Infinity Pool suites), are spectacular and comfortable, clean and well appointed. I'd highly recommend the Jucuzzi Infinity Pool Suites - we stayed in 322, which has to have the BEST view in the whole place. The indoor/outdoor shower was a huge hit with my fiance-turned-husband, and the jucuzzi tub was beautifully and romantically decorated by the staff when we returned from our wedding. A lovely wedding night touch. The food Forget your assumptions about all-inclusive food. Seriously. No buffets here - all a la carte all the way. The food here is scrumptious at all levels, from comfort food (pizza and guac) to high-end gourmet. It compares to fine dining pretty much anywhere - I'd put it against many of the fine dining restaurants we frequent in the states - and my hubby and I are foodies. Fresh, seasonal, lovingly prepared - be sure to order room service (wonderful and 24 hours!), and check out Papitos' special lunch menus each day. Our rehearsal dinner and reception dinner menus were specialty gourmet menus, and our guests (even those who are pretty conservative eaters) oooh'ed and aaaaahhhh'ed over the food and cleaned their plates. Drinks Top shelf, all the way. Bartenders know their stuff, and love making special concoctions for those looking to be a bit adventurous. Even the house wines, which we didn't really have high expectations for, were good. If you're a tequila drinker, you'll be happy - my hubby is a discerning tequila drinker, and they had a wide selection of fine tequilas (some he was familiar with, some new) that kept him sipping happily. Again, the staff make the difference. The beach Oh my goodness. Seriously - you are not prepared for how incredibly gorgeous the beach is. Because many of our family members were enjoying extended stays at EDM, my hubby and I went to a different (very high-end) resort for our honeymoon, and while it was indeed gloriously beautiful, it couldn't hold a candle to Maroma beach. Sand like flour, pristine water you can swim happily in, the marina right next door (with lots of activities - snorkeling, boats, etc.)... all perfect. Plus, enough beach beds (yes, they're what they sound like and they're divine) to go around - we were constantly waiting for them at the other resort, but NEVER waited at Maroma. There's always one available for you. Plus, the beach service is impeccible, like all service at EDM, making lounging on the beach pretty much perfect. Plus, since the resort is the only one around for about 2 miles, romantic walks on the beach are a MUST. Glorious. The Spa The spa is relatively small, but lovely. It lacks some of the bells and whistles that some other, larger spas have, but it was still a wonderful place to go. All my girls spent all day Sunday (our wedding day) getting pampered in the salon, and everyone took SUCH good care of us. The manicures/pedicures were lovely, and my hair/makeup turned out beautiful. We also thoroughly enjoyed a couples massage at the Sky massage Palapas over the water - a MUST DO while you're there. Fantastic experience. The staff The people make EDM absolutely, without-a-doubt unique. We certainly enjoyed the staff at the other resort (for our honeymoon), but the staff at EDM made us feel like family - cherished, respected, well-loved (and well-fed!) family. From the moment you arrive, you're greeted graciously. They're friendly and down-to-earth. Personable. They lovingly endured - and helped with! - our clumsy attempts to practice our spanish, and treated every single member of our party like family. They take copious notes - so if you have a special request, preference, food allergy, etc. - you'll only have to mention it once. For the rest of the trip, they'll take care of it for you. It's amazing. Sometimes I think they're psychic. :) Our love and gratitiude to everyone. We'll be back very soon to see our new family there! :) Additionally, they have a WONDERFUL on-stie travel service there: Lomas Travel is wonderful. They handled all our wedding planning (thank you, Valeria Martinez) through their weddings division, and also took care of our guest excursions and trips while on property (thanks, Luis!!). We were able to book a private catamaran trip with snorkeling for our entire group - very affordably - that was a highlight of the trip. They anticipated every need, made wonderful recommendations, and took good care of us. So be sure to use Lomas for excursions/trips while you're there! I could go on and on - more than I already have - but I'll wrap by saying that EDM is one of those places that's so special and its people so wonderful that it'll help you get through those days at work when you're at your wits' end: just imagine yourself on Maroma beach, and you've found your new happy place. Go there, and you may never want to come back. Much love to everyone at EDM.

We have never had to wait for a drink. There are always multiple resort attendents in view at any time that are willing to help with any request. Food I've seen some bad reviews on the food here saying that it is not gourmet. Trust me, if you are looking for fresh food prepared well then this is the place.

We originally booked the sister resort Azul Beach but when we arrived we were told that they did not have a room for us. They said due to the heavy rains they had received a lot of their rooms were damaged and therefore they would did not have room availability for us. We instantly were not happy campers. He proceeded to tell us not to fret because they were going to send us to their sister resort, The El Dorado Royale, which they said would be an upgrade from the Azul. We had done tons and tons of research on TripAdvisor for all of our options in the Riviera Maya. We had chosen the Azul for its small size and high 90% TA review rating. The second half of our trip was going to be at \u201cThe Royal Playa del Carmen\u201d, a much larger resort, so we really wanted our first week to be small, quiet and romantic. We quickly signed on to Trip Advisor on my husband\u2019s blackberry to look up the reviews etc for the El Dorado Royale. We saw that it was also a large resort and a little bit lower % reviews and this was not what we had wanted for our first week of honeymoon. I quickly realized that their sister resort that truly would have been comparable to size and rating was the El Dorado Maroma. My husband told them, \u201cthe only way we are leaving this resort is if you send us to the Maroma\u201d. We also dropped a line to them that \u201cWe are big Trip Advisor people and we will be writing a review based on our experience\u201d. This seemed to perk them up a bit. They told us they would get on the phone and check availability at the Maroma. Within a few minutes they said they had us a honeymoon suite at the El Dorado Maroma waiting on us. We were happy at this point. We were still worried and skeptical about the whole thing since it\u2019s not what we signed up for. They had us sign a waiver that we were \u201cvoluntarily\u201d leaving The Azul for El Dorado Maroma. They paid for us a taxi to the new resort. From the moment we arrived at the El Dorado Maroma we were in pure heaven. The room, the resort, the service etc were all top top notch. Arrival: They served us a sparkling beverage while Patty quickly checked us in. She was great and made me feel better already. We were told that our room wasn\u2019t quite ready so they would hold our luggage. We were given a grande tour of the property which ended at the outdoor lunch palapa. The lunch theme for that day was Mexican which was perfect for our arrival to Mexico. We had a nice enjoyable lunch overlooking the beach and then went and ordered a frozen drink at the pool bar and sat in on Kari giving a Spanish lesson. A little later we were told our room was ready. Room: We were escorted to the top floor. We were thinking \u201coh no, this is a lot of stair climbing for our trip and no elevators\u201d BUT when we walked in our room and could see the ocean view from the door we quickly forgot about the stairs. The room was gorgeous and spacious. There was a living are and a bedroom area, large bathroom with 2 sinks, tiled shower (which we never used), a private outdoor shower, which we looooved and used for every single shower. Our balcony had a bed and an amazing view of the water beach and pool. What we learned about the rooms is the first floor rooms have swim up rooms with the entrance into the pool/lazy river from the porch, the middle level rooms which have their own private pool on their patio, and then the third level room which has the awesome view and larger balcony. If we were to go back and chose a room we would chose the third floor. We didn\u2019t think we would enjoy the pool access or private pool as much as the awesome view. The stairs allowed for us some great exercise for all for all of the calories we were consuming anyway. Beach: Our favorite place was the beach. We spent 90% of time in one of the beach beds. You could pretty much get a beach bed at any time of day. If you wanted a particular one you could wake up and go reserve one around 8 or 9 but it really wasn\u2019t necessary. The beach was gorgeous. The sand was nice and white and the staff kept it very clean. At all hours of the day they had a seaweed crew raking up and hauling off the seaweed. The resort planted a sand wall out off the coast to protect their beach from strong waves etc. At first I was leery about the wall but I\u2019m really glad they had it. The water area was very calm and clear and very shallow. You could walk very far out and still only be waist deep. Right next to the walls is great snorkeling. There are 2 layers of walls and if you go past the first one and snorkel in between, there is some great sea life. I even saw an extremely LARGE stingray one day. The resort didn\u2019t really have enough snorkel equipment for requests. If you like to snorkel I would recommend bringing your own. Some people would use the equipment and then keep it at their chairs/beds even when they weren\u2019t using them, which was annoying. The beach and water were very quiet and very private. There are so few people at the resort that you really can end up with the beach or ocean to yourselves sometimes. The beach beds were very comfortable and the drink service was great. Annabelle at the beach was our favorite. She was so sweet and so attentive. They work very hard to make sure you are always happy. Every now and then on the beach or in the water we would smell a foul sewer smell. I read a card in our room that explained that the smell was coming from the Mangrove forest next door. It was really only once in a blue moon and didn\u2019t bother us at all. Plus, with the forest next door it really created a private and quiet beach location. There was no walking traffic along the beach. The only people on the Maroama beach were those staying at the resort. Next door there is a marina. We walked over a couple of times to check things out. It looks like tour buses take people to the marina and they can go out on jet ski or sailboat tours. It stayed fairly busy but never could hear or see the people from our resort\u2019s beach. You would see and hear the jet ski\u2019s leaving but other than that it was very quiet. A few mornings we took a run down the beach past the marina. There is nothing on the other side of the marina. Just quiet private beach that stretches for miles. It was really a great great location. Drinks: My favorite drink was the Coco Loco which was a creamy coconut frozen concoction in a fresh coconut. Even after they would run out of fresh coconuts I would request a coco loco in a cup as my drink of choice. They don\u2019t have drink menus so I would recommend printing a generic drink and frozen drink menu and taking it with you before you go. You will get tired of the basics and want something new and different but not know what to ask for. They do have some specialties like the Riviera Maya which was pretty tasty. Tecate is their beer for this resort so you can order a Tecate or Tecate light. They aren\u2019t the coldest but that doesn\u2019t bother me. My husband would order them in a glass with ice. Meals: The food was hit and miss but overall good. The food all seemed to look better presentation wise than it actually tasted. A lot of their desserts included jello. Even their tiramisu had a layer of coffee flavored jello that we didn\u2019t care for. Our favorite for breakfast was the room service. I would get the scrambled eggs with fresh tomatoes every morning. My husband tried all of the different options and liked them all. We ate one morning at Sabores for breakfast but just really preferred to eat in the privacy of our room. For lunch we liked sabores fajitas and guacamole appetizer. There is a themed lunch every day in the lunch palapa. We are a couple times in there and it was ok. We tried all the options for dinner. The first night we had the Japanese and we loved the sushi and our entr\u00e9es. We tried the Italian. It was hit or miss. Some of the appetizers like bruchetta and a caprice salad (which was fresh tomatoes and mozzarella) were very good. I ordered a tortellini entre and the noodles were way way overcooked so it was a big bowl of mush and inedible. Husbands order was good though. We did the Mayan, Italian and Mexican themed meals at sabores. All were good but nothing to rave about. Looking back I really preferred just the non-themed dinner restaurants and their menus. Activities/Entertainment: We did the Yoga one morning which was just ok. Kari and Ariel of the entertainment staff were great. Ariel took us kayaking one day out to a cenote which was just a hole in the ocean floor just off the coast. We were able to get off the kayak and snorkel and see the fish that inhabited the hole and then kayak back. We really enjoyed it. The whole trip took about 45 minutes and we were back in our beach bed. Every so often Daniel from the spa would come by offering a free 5 minute massage right there on the beach in your beach bed. I got one the first day, husband got one the second day and then later in the trip we both got one at the same time from 2 of the spa girls. The whole purpose of their free massage is to try and get you into signing up for a longer massage. We contemplated but just never did. They never applied too much pressure into signing up. We said not right now and they would move on. We would always tip them well for their time. It was worth it to us for 5 minutes of heaven on the beach! We did water aerobics with Kari one day which was fun, husband played bocce ball with Kari on the beach one day. One day Kari was supposed to be teaching a Spanish lesson but she said everyone was asleep on the beach. She asked if we wanted a private lesson right there on our beach bed. We said yes and enjoyed talking with her and learning some Spanish along the way. She is a real sweetheart and her dream is to go to Disneyworld one day. If I had the money, I would have booked her a plane ticket right then and there. We never left the resort since our second stay would be located in the heart of playa del Carmen. We used this week\u2019s stay to just kick back and relax and that we did. The shows at night were fun. The best was the Michael Jackson show. He did a REALLY good impersonation. Very entertaining. Overall this was a very low key quiet romantic relaxed place. I would highly recommend it for honeymooners or couples looking for a quiet getaway. We will probably make a trip back someday after exploring some other areas first. The food was better at The Royal Playa Del Carmen but overall the other features of this hotel made up for it big time. The perfect resort would be The El Dorado Maroma with the Royal\u2019s food.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNot disappointed with our choice....\u201d", "Author": "Wannabatraveldiva", "ReviewID": "UR81418234", "Content": "My husband and I were in desparate need of disconnect from the real world. With our 5th anniversary coming up I started researching places in the Caribbean that would give us everything we both wanted. Well, that was bit overwhelming. A family member recommended Cruise Holidays of Kansas City and Andrea Redding. Initially I just called her to get some ideas, but the more I spoke with her I began to build more confidence in her professional opinions. She had visited several of the Karisma properties personally. I am glad I got this travel agent. She worked to make sure we were well informed and taken care of before, during and after the trip. Choosing El Dorado Maroma was perfect. All inclusive gourmet at a good price. It will not be for everyone's taste or budget, but definitely worked for us as a splurge meeting all our needs. I wanted a plunge pool and whirlpool with some privacy, but did not want to come home to a ton of bills after it all was said and done. We arrived about 1:30pm August 25th and departed on the 29th. My biggest regret that we did not stay an entire week. Absolutely a great vacation. I am a bit bias favoring the Caribbean for a beach vacation, but Mexico was not at the top of my list. How wrong I was. This was our first visit to Mexico and to a botique hotel. It was perfect in terms of not spending time lost in the shuffle long of check-ins and touring the property, We were done with everything, changed our clothes and little after 3:00pm we were eating lunch. Check in was not without a few issues:1) A 2nd floor room with a view of building under construction 2) An anniversary package that was not available as confirmed in writing by Funjet. Ok sounds like we were not off to a good start, but I am flexible. Anna contacted Andrea back in KC and by the next day we were moved to room 341 with a fantastic ocean view and our Anniversary package in tact. I appreciated the work of both ladies to ensure we were taken care of as promised. Job well done The next room was fantastic. We had the infinity pool suite. The pool is a nice size for one but not a lot of room for two to really splash around. Look out below :) So if you do get this room just plan to kind of lounge or float a bit. The outdoor shower excellent. I used it constantly after the beach for sand removal. The food....well my husband was worried about the European portions. Let's just say this he gained 5 pounds. I refused to get on the scale. No need to spoil my vacation. We really enjoyed the selections and the service. Good thing we were on the 4th floor, we needed the extra steps. Cindy the host was always accomodating and bubbly. Jonas and Rafael were a couple of our favorites from the wait staff, but absolutely everyone strove to please. The staff.....Gabby our concierge was sweet and we really enjoyed Cindy. We tipped everyone we could even though it was not necessary by the hotels standards, we just appreciate good service. We also liked Nicholas our Lomas contact on site and on ride to the airport as we headed home Eduardo (Ed) kept us in stitches. Excursions....The tour 1/2 day tour to Tulum was all we needed for the cultural side since our stay was short. Hubby loves history so this fulfilled that desire. The Maroma Marina excursions were a bit pricey, but hey we were like okay how often do we do this. Like never...We jet skied for the first time, with our Ocean Safari snorkel adventure. Later the same day we parasailed for the first time. We definitely appreciated walking next door and not having to be shuttled around for ocean excursions. You can waste a lot of precious time with the shuttling, so avoid when you can the shared rides. Good introduction for our adventure and culture experiences in Mexico. Romance....The beach dinner for our anniversary was very nice. The beach beds all over the beach for lounging , napping and cuddling were always available. The bed and lounge chairs on our patio were used for the same. Very conducive to reconnecting. Spa...We did a midnight massage over the water....It was nice, the ambience you can not buy... really very romantic. I think if we had asked for specific therapists it may have been a bit better. The ladies that worked on us were ok, but I would have liked more intensity. The guy that was doing the chair massages was excellent. We should have asked for him. The beach and water...The sand was as descibed and the softest I have experienced. The water was bathtub warm and the sandbags some complained about kept the waves pretty docile. For those who don't swim, this is the beach resort for you. You can walk out about 50ft or more and the water is waist high. Snorkeling wasn't that great though unless you got past that point. Nightlife...We did not attend any shows so I can't comment on the lack of nightlife as others have being good or bad. We were there to unwind and experience new things together, so we did not keep a schedule except our excursion times. Hopefully I have touched on everything and this helps someone else. It's long but I appreciated those reviews that gave detail to give me a heads up on where we would be staying.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cWOW - the El Dorado Maroma continues to get better and better\u201d", "Author": "akandal", "ReviewID": "UR81353882", "Content": "Well, I have finally had a moment to write down some quick thoughts about our 4th visit to the EDM - September 2-11. We were very warmly greeted by Catarina, Alfredo, Chef Efraim, and many others - WELCOME HOME! I am not sure how to write this review so I will just jump in...our first night there I fell (completely my fault) and hurt my foot (have since found out that it is broken) so I limped around the entire visit. Another very very sad event took place on our second full day. Our very much loved and cherished pup (in my av) had to be put down due to a bad fall that he had where he severly broke his hip. He was almost 13 and had been having other medical issues so we thought that was the best for him...we miss him terribly. The reason I am sharing that is because of the care, concern and love we received from the wonderful staff at the EDM while going through this horrible situation. Catarina, Paola, Cesar, Gaby, Susan, Alfredo (the list goes on and on) were right there for us and were incredibly caring and compassionate. Though I could say that they went out of their way for us, that is not entirely true - they are just all wondeful caring people who love what they do and care deeply about their guests/family. I really can't say enough about how caring everyone was because they knew how much our beloved Riley meant to us... It was wonderful catching up with friends that we first met at the EDM and meeting new friends that we hope to catch up with for many years to come at the EDM! The service was exceptional of course. One night we met up with new friends at Kiyoko and the chef prepared a very special sushi dinner for us (we were the only ones at the restaurant as everyone else was at the special Italian night which we had done earlier in our visit) - WOW, absolutely amazing and more food than we could even imagine! We stayed in a Mi Hotelito room on the first floor (206) and loved it. (came in quite handy with the foot issue). Once we opened the curtains we had a wonderful view of the ocean from our bed! We have stayed in these rooms twice now and a swim up twice. Would we stay in an MH room again - absolutely! Kind of an odd review I know! Will we back again - of course, we are already planning our 5th visit in the April/May time frame. I really missed the Huitlacoche soup this time (just wasn't foremost in my mind due to the other events) and will be sure to request it for our next visit!

Paola our concierge was wonderful, so was Luis from Lomas travel, and Ariel who took care of the nighttime shows and kayaking offered by the hotel.

The airport is very secure, every excursion was very safe and timely, even Playa del carmen has police everywhere. This was our first time in Cancun, and we will be returning next year.

Service was divine, attention to detail was obvious, plenty of staff on hand to take care of your every need or request, very luxurious, great food....this was an investment trip for us and it did not disappoint.. Somethings to know: The moonlight massage was over priced and not very good (as far as massages go). I think this depends on the person giving the massage. I think my spa technician just wasn't very good; however, the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing and the bottle of sparkling wine they sent up to our room was a really nice touch. We tipped most staffers but not all just because we are comfortable with that and we saw others doing that too. I didn't feel like anyone expected it nor did I feel like we were treated any differently if we did or didn't tip. Ordering wine off the wine list is super expensive. $155 for Veuve Clicquot is ridiculous. When you arrive you are told to meet with the Lomas travel rep and your personal concierge. We didn't meet with Lomas but did meet with our concierge. She handled all of our reservations and special requests, setting our schedule for the week. It was wonerful.

The staff went out of their way to help us during our entire stay. We considered upgrading to the honeymoon suite (we had a room with infinity pool) but they let us look at a honeymoon suite and it was the same as a room with the pool, just higher floor and no pool. We decided on the pool! While we were looking at the rooms, it started raining. We were soaked but a staff member chased us down to give us towels! The rooms are so nice. The outdoor shower was really neat as was the infinity pool and outdoor bed. I didn't know what to expect with the pool but it was really nice to get in after being at the beach to cool off. Everything was very plush and clean! The food was amazing! Every meal was so good and the staff again went out of their way to make sure it was to our liking. We were only there for 3 nights so we only went on 1 excursion and that was Tulum Extreme. We toured Tulum then went to another location to go zip lining, rappeling and swimming in an underground cave. It was alot of fun and we met some really nice people. There was a marina next door where you could snorkel, dive, parasail, fish...just about anything. We sat through the \"rewards\" program they have. The guy was really nice and we got to see the Royal Suite and Presidential Suite. They were unbelievable! We would have loved to join, but we have a little one at home and probably only take 1 trip a year so decided against it for now. But for our time, we could choose dinner on the beach or a sky massage. We chose the dinner which was very romantic. I scheduled a sky massage anyway and so glad I did. It was very relaxing and a great way to end our trip. Because of the reviews on TripAdvisor, I knew we couldn't miss the Michael Jackson show. I had to see what the fuss was about. I'm soooo glad we did! It was incredible! We videoed part of it and when we got home, our friends and family couldn't believe how good it was. The surprise at the end was awesome!! We are already talking about going back! I know they have the resorts for kids too, but it was a nice getaway for my husband and I.

When we made our reservations for dinner one night, they asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion. We said no, we were just on vacation.

It was absolutely wonderful! The service was top notch...everyone went out of their way to make you happy. The grounds, pool, room...even the beach were all spotless! We went back and forth on what room to get, but ended up deciding to stay in a honeymoon suite and we were extremely happy with this decision. We stayed in building 5 and the room was located on the 3rd floor so we had excellent view of the ocean. We could see the water while laying in our bed! If you stay in the swim up suites on the first floor or the infinity pool suites on the 2nd floor, you will not have such a good view of the ocean due to the palm trees. The rooms are very spacious and the bath includes a jacuzzi tub, and indoor and an outdoor shower. The patio was wonderful with a daybed to relax on. There are two pools, both with swim up bars, lounge chairs and daybeds. The resort was about half full when we were there, so it was never crowded and chairs were always available. The beach also offered chairs with umbrellas or daybeds plus butler service. There are no resorts for miles in either of direction of this resort, so you can walk along the beach without going by other resorts or crowds. There is an activity center right next to the resort where people come for excursions. While other people have to take taxis/buses to get to the activity center, you can schedule and excursion from the resort and just walk next door along the beach to the center. My husband and I received a sunrise massage in the cabanna over the water. So amazing that we ended up scheduling a second one for the morning of the day we left. Angie is the best...wish I could have brought her home with me! Daniel would walk around the beach and pool offering free 5 minute massages every day!

I apologize in advance for the length of this review. In planing our vacation, we had a lot of questions so I figured it best to give as many details as possible. Flight The flight on Air Canada was uneventful. Flight was on-time and service and cabin were top-notch. Arrival in Cancun We arrived in Cancun and got through Customs and Immigration fairly quickly. After making it through the gauntlet of time-share salesmen, we found our transportation waiting outside as expected. We had to wait approximately 45 minutes for the rest of our party to arrive to join our shuttle to 2 other resorts. If we had known this, we probably would have booked a private transfer to the resort. Arrival at the Resort Upon arriving at the resort, we were greeted in the small but very luxurious lobby by a check-in agent who offered us a moist wash cloth as well as a glass of sparkling wine. Within a few minutes, we were greeted by many of the staff who came to the lobby to meet us and welcome us to the EDM. Katarina, one of the butlers gave us a tour of the resort and introduced us to many of the staff. They were all courteous and gracious. We were then led to our room so we could freshen up and head to lunch. We also took some time to meet with our concierge in order to plan for the theme dinners for the week. We attended the Mayan, the Italian, the Mexican and the Dinner around the World. She also made arrangements for our honeymoon package including a massage lesson and candlelight dinner on the beach. Carmina also offered to help us out with any excursions we might like to do. She also tried to schedule us for a sales-pitch meeting for the resorts Exotic Club but we were not interested. Our room We were in room 302 which was a swim-up jacuzzi suite. This room was located 2nd from the edge of the building. There was a path in front where staff and guests were always walking by. Since most of our time was spent on the beach, this traffic did not bother us. When we were out there, we just waved, smiled and hollered \u201chola\u201d to everyone who walked by. The room is mere steps from the beach and was located at the most central part of this small resort. Our room had a King size bed, a living room area with a pull-out couch. A well appointed bathroom with jacuzzi, double sinks and a shower. Inside the shower was a door leading out to the Aguas del amor, the outdoor shower, which was really cool. A safe, free to use, was in the closet by the front entrance. A small refrigerator was located in the TV stand and it was refilled daily with sodas, beer, water and snacks. Thanks to Laime and Margarita who cleaned and turned down our room daily. The Beach This is probably the most beautiful beach we have ever seen. The southern part of the beach is rough.. stumps in the ground, etc. But walk north and you have miles of pristine white sand beaches. Right next door to the resort is Maroma Marina which is a starting off point for a lot of the activities. Above the beach is a large 3 tier palapas where the sky massages are given. Some people are put off by the sandbanks about 400 feet from shore. There are probably about 20 sand bags which protect the beach from motorized traffic and act as a break wall. To be perfectly honest, they did not bother us in the least. When I took some time to snorkel, the sandbags provided a refuge for many fish and created a man-made reef. Snorkeling equipment was available to be borrowed from the animation team. The beach was wonderful for wading and cooling off although it was quite warm. It never got very deep so it\u2019s perfect for those who do not like deep water. The pools There are two pools. The smaller pool is in the Mihotelito section. There is a swim-up bar (Bar 24). Emilio and Estrella kept us entertained with their funny stories and witty banter. This pool was usually the quieter one. The main pool is next to Sabore\u2019s restaurant. This is where we usually ended up at the end of the day enjoying cocktails or tequila shots provided by Carlos or Cesar. Both pools were cleaned daily by the pool staff. The pool staff worked all day long cleaning out the swim-up section leading to the main pool and also emptying and refilling the infinity plunge pools on the 2nd to 4th floors. Water temperature was very warm in the pools. Animation Staff Kary, Ariel and Diego from the animation staff try very hard to get people involved in activities. Bingo, bocce, horseshoes, volleyball are all available activities. However, most guests are content to simply sit on the beach and relax. We were very pleased one day to have Ariel and Kary spend some extra time at our beach bed for a private spanish lesson. The Food There are no buffets at the EDM. Sabores restaurant is located by the pool on the south side of the resort. Breakfast and lunch are served here as well as most of the theme dinners. Papito\u2019s is the palapa restaurant by the beach. It was nice to have lunch on the patio, mere steps from the ocean. A different lunch theme was served every day. Myo and Kiyoko were the italian and oriental restaurant. We ate at both and enjoyed them. The quality of the food was excellent and was very well prepared. The theme nights allowed us to try some different things that we normally would not have necessarily ordered. The entertainment during these theme nights was a great touch. Service by the waiters was excellent. Special thanks to Cindy, the hostess who always found us an excellent table and to Gabby, Alejandro and Rodmiro, some of the waiters, among many who served us during our stay. Our last night ended was supposed to be a candlelight dinner on the beach. Thanks to the staff who set Andrea and I up for dinner on the platform above the water where the sky massages are held. It was very romantic and something we will never forget. Special thanks to Walter, manager of restaurant services for running such a good operation. We really like the dinner that Chef Paco prepared on Thursday night. Chef Kim and the Chef at the Oriental restaurant (I forgot his name) also left a very favorable impression on us. The bars Bar service was excellent. Top shelf liquor here but you do have to ask for them. Bartenders will usually remember what you like to drink and how you like it prepared. Each bartender seems to have his own special drink. Order them all.. they are all good. Excursion You can book excursions with the concierge or with Luis, the Lomas Travel Rep who is on-site. We did the wave-runners and truly enjoyed it. Staff The staff at this resort are outstanding. Every request within reason is granted. When you ask for something, the typical response is \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure\u201d. I\u2019ve named a few who left a particularly positive impression on us. However, we did not meet any bad apples or anyone who did not seem to want to be there. The thing that amazed me about the staff was their ability to remember people\u2019s names. They asked for your name once and they remembered. We were starting to think we were wearing name-tags!! This is such a nice personal touch. One thing we found particularly interesting occurred on Saturday. Apparently, Saturday is cleaning day at EDM. All the managers and office staff step back from their regular duties and start cleaning all parts of the resort. It was neat to see Alfredo, the GM, raking grass, and Walter, the restaurant manager, cleaning in the restaurants. I think this is a neat initiative. Nightlife We did not partake in the nightlife. We stayed up to watch the Michael Jackson tribute night on Friday and we highly recommend it. Departure Check out was smooth, but we did not want to leave. It was nice of Alfredo, the General Manager to come and see us off. We really appreciated your hospitality. This resort really has changed my philosophy about what a resort should be about. Customer service is not to be taken for granted. El Dorado Maroma brings that to a whole new level. The size of the resort creates an intimate atmosphere ideal for a romantic and relaxing vacation. We cannot wait to go back! Gracias por todo!! I have attached some pictures but there are many others on the Facebook group called \u201cEl Dorado Maroma Magic\u201d.

It was a very good decision. Although it was warm, the breezes from the sea kept the temperature very comfortable. There were a few rain showers to clear the humidity, which was really nice. We love the MiHotelito rooms and used the bed and table on the porch to rest and keep things for our beach activities. This time (our 3rd visit), we spent more time in the water at the resort and found some pretty nice snorkeling around the man-made reefs. These big sand bags were placed there for safety from marina activities and they are beginning to grow some plants. We swam in between the two rows of reef-bags and found alot of fish, several kinds we hadn't seen on our excursions. Also, the fish out there swam with us and didn't seem to mind company. Food as usual was great. My very picky eater husband finally got with the program and stopped struggling with the menu - something would look good but would have one ingredient he didnt like. So he started ordering just what he wanted - like one type of pasta with sauce from another. He was pretty happy. So was I. We did some walking on the beach and swimming on the far side of the marina and took 2 snorkeling excursions. The on-site arranger did a great job of finding us snorkel trips that weren't in parks and were in more natural settings. Also tried some spa massages. The staff took a seated massage chair around the beach and pools, giving 5 minute treatments that were really great. All the therapists are good, but I especially liked Daniel and had a Sky Massage out on the ocean deck. Highly recommend this.

It was our first vacation away from our two young children and will absolutely not be waiting another 10 years to do it again. We were in Mi Hotelito Rm 104 and it was perfect. It had easy access to everything, ample size and a very comfortable bed. We did not spend time in our room other than to sleep and change. We saw almost no one in their swim-up room pools so they may not be worth the extra money. When we return to EDM we will stay in Mi Hotelito again. The food was great. We ate breakfast, lunch and dinner each day. My husband usually complains that he doesn' get enough food at dinner but this was not the case at EDM. The courses were presented artfully and the portions left you satisfied but not stuffed. We tried each of the dinner restaurants one time and chose to eat at Kiyoko twice. Mio Cuccina was excellent Italian food. We did not care for the dinner menu at Sabores but the food was prepared well. The breakfast and lunch there were excellent. We reviewed the menus for the theme nights and chose to eat the regular dinner options instead. We mosty ate lunch at the outdoor papito. Be sure not to miss the frozen fruit bars located in the freezer cooler on your way out. Whether we were at the beach or in the pool, it seemed like there were very few people around. We spent more time in the Mi Hotelito pool than the other larger pool. I loved the bartender, Antonio, at the 24 Bar. We played ping-pong everyday by the pool. The beach is beautiful. The white sand is always cool and the water turquise and warm. We didn't mind the sandbags at all. We did go to Rick's Bar most nights and enjoyed the entertainment. I went to the morning yoga class conducted in the palapa over the water and my husband used the fitness center. We enjoyed a couple's massage over the water as well. I booked our trip though funjet.com and received $100 voucher to apply towards the massage. It was a nice part of our stay there. We brought our computer thinking we might Skype with our children back home but made a daily phone call instead. WiFi is available for $15/day or 3 days for $40. This was the only area of improvement we could identify at EDM. We were hoping that WiFi would be available free of charge. We activated global calling on our Verizon cell phones before leaving the States. We chose not to participate in any of the excursions since we we're only there for 4 nights/5days. We also did not sit through the Karisma sales pitch offer. We did however walk up the beach and found Capt. Mimo, a local man who takes couples out on his sailboat for a 3 hour trip. You spend 1.5 hours sailing and 1.5 hours snorkeling. He only takes 1-2 couples out at a time. It cost $50 per person. He goes out at 10 and 2. We highly recommend this personalized snorkeling trip. Mimo takes you out to the reef and snorkels with you to make sure you don't miss anything. It was great to be the only three people snorkeling in the area. You do need to walk out to his boat in the water carrying your bag over your head. Be sure to bring sunscreen, water and a towel. Mimo supplies the snorkel gear. The service was great across the board from the moment we arrived until we left. We brought many $1 and $5 bills to provide tips for service during our stay. The tips did not seem expected and were appreciated. When you arrive at the Cancun airport pick up your baggage, get through customs and go directly outside. Do not stop for anyone inside the airport. They are there for time-share sales. The pre-arranged transportation companies are outside. We used Lomas Travel which partners with Funjet.

Every visit seems to get better and better. Maroma is the smallest of the El Dorado properties with less than 80 rooms and suites. Our experiences here make us feel like the property is our home away from home. I have traveled across the world for both business and pleasure and never before have I found a resort where its employees are so genuine in their desire to please its visitors. This entirely Mexican staff is actually HAPPY and you can feel that happiness and sincere desire to please at every facet of the resort. El Dorado Maroma is NOT a resort for you singles looking to hook up with others, nor is it a resort for children. Its niche is the couples market including all ages along with the honeymoon and wedding business. If you are looking for pure relaxation, wonderful cuisine, large comfortable romantic rooms and a crystal clear beach, this is the place to be on the Riviera Maya. Our favorite without a doubt is the remarkable Asian restaurant. The chef, Fernando, is always willing to make special meals that aren\u2019t on the already remarkable menu. The sushi is fantastic as is the service. We especially liked Carlos (Charlie) who went out of his way to make sure every culinary request was fulfilled\u2026even if it meant bringing my wife a scrumptious Italian dish while I ate my favorite Asian dish. In a nutshell, this resort is about romance, relaxing and exceptional customer service. Our swim up pool room was immaculate and included a comfy king bed, a whirlpool bathtub and showers both inside and outside. The staff made sure that sensual incenses were always burning in our bathroom and we never saw an insect or mosquito which is unusual for this part of Mexico in August. This is a place where even when occupancy is at 100%, you never feel crowded. Here there is no need to reserve a beach chair at either of the two pools or at the beach which is ranked among the world\u2019s top ten beaches. We justified our three meals a day by walking the beach in the morning and making good use of resort\u2019s fitness gym which includes several treadmills and other updated equipment. I highly recommend tipping the wait and bar staff although it certainly is NOT expected. These employees work for much lower wages than in the USA or UK, yet they always seem happy and eager to please.

For example, the man who worked for Lomas Travel on site was very helpful. Even thought we never booked anything with him, he was friendly and helpful every time he saw us out walking around. He offered to run and get me an umbrella when it started to rain, reminded us to wear sunscreen, etc. Gourmet meals, well prepared cocktails and a beautiful beach contributed to a wonderful holiday. We had the privilege of being invited to the \"Dinner around the World\" special dinner. It was a night to remember. I would highly recommend the Eldorado Maroma.

That summs up EDM (El Dorado Maroma) in a sentence. This is a place to go when you want relaxation, service and intimace with your choosen partner. The fact that you never have to reserve anything is first on the list. Beach cairs, beach beds, lounges, unbrellas, towels, restaurant tables, show seats, nothing needs reservations. Walk into any restaurant and you sit right down. Never a need to wait even for a few minutes. The food and drink were great. Top shelf liquor, house wine very acceptable, food prepared in a gourmet fashion just like you would expect it. Don't go here for Steak House or dinner food. They tell you it is gourmet style dinning and it is. All meats are prepared with sauces and in unique gourmet manner. If you want hamburgers, steaks and french fries or baked potatoe, don't go here. It's not that they wouldn't try to accomidate your request, it's just that they are all about gourmet preperation of food. You have to be willing to experience a food world outside of your normal eating habits. That being said, everything we tried was great. The head chef will meet with you personally should you need a special diet (ie: gluten free, etc). Where else do you hear of such a thing. I did not finish my soup one time (not that it was bad, it just wasn't my favorite.) We could see the soup serving area, and the chef came right out and started tasing the soup. Our waiter came over and asked what I thought was wrong with it? The chef wanted to know so he could correct it. He was personally concerned that the soup did not satisfy my taste. I had to explain to him that it tasted fine, but it just wasn't MY favorite. Most chefs would have considered dumping the soup in my lap, rather than ever ask what I thought it might need. This is just an example of the level of service this resort will give. If you find that a certain dish just isn't to your personal liking, ask to order something else. They will gladley get you anything else you might request. The food service staff are friendly, fun, and funny or quiet and reserved, as dictated by your lead. You make the rules, and they follow to the absolute best of their ability. If you can't find the kind of service you want at EDM, I will suggest you just don't know how to ask for it. The housekeeping staff always had a smile on their face. I'm sure they couldn't have always been happy, but you would think they were meeting their favorite celebrity each time they interacted with you (well, maybe that is a bit of an exageration). The bartenders, Antonio, Ceasar and others would ask \"Where are you going?\" if you tried to leave the swim up bars. I went out for some coffe service in the morning one day (near the 24 Bar and pool) and the bartender was just setting up the bar for the day, and he smiled and asked \"Tequilla?\". Heck, it was 7:45 in the morning. I couldn't help but laugh (by the way I turned it down, a bit early for me). We would walk down the beach and the Beach Server would ask if we wanted a drink. I did say yes one time, and gave her my order and was then going to tell her where we were sitting, and she said I know where you are. And by golly, the drink was sitting by my beach chair when I returned. The service staff, from housekeeping to bartenders, to wait staff to our personal concierge knew who we were. (Or they never let you know that they did not know who you were, and were trained well enough to find out before they delivered your request.) To me, that says a great deal about the Karisma management style. Their attention to detail is exceptional. The beach was great, clean, soft white sand with calm chest high water all the way out to the marked swimming area (about 150 Yards out). No need for beach shoes when you got into the clear, warm Carribean water. Just soft sand beneath your feet. The pools were clean and refreshing (no clorine bleach smell). The public restroons were always clean and stocked. We had towell art every night on our bed (and we were there for 10 days!) Would have expected it maybe once or twice at most. Met the resort manager, and he was just as friendly and concerned for our satisfaction as anyone (we never needed to call on him to acomplish a request, the staff made sure we were always satisfied). In summary, just remember that EDM is for relaxing, not X-treme games, flashy night life or constant activities. The staff will do almost anything to ensure you have a pleasant experience. Don't expect meat and potaoes, hamburgers and hotdogs, pizza etc. but unique gourmet type food that (if you are like us) you would not likely fix at home or get at your local Steak House or Dinner. We found the food wonderfull and excitingly different. Our sincerest compliments to the Management and staff for what we could only describe as a fabulous experience while at EDM!!!", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano Marittima, Italy", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place with outstanding service\u201d", "Author": "tftjr", "ReviewID": "UR73326226", "Content": "My wife and I wanted a romantic mini-vacation in the Caribbean. We looked all over the internet and checked out numerous islands. After reading some favorable reviews on tripadvisor we settled on El Dorado Maroma (EDM). It had the some key elements that we enjoy while traveling. 1-Modern decor, 2-Gourmet food, 3-Beatiful location, 4-Good service, 5-Positive reviews. EDM meet all of these requirements and we packed our bags for a peaceful 6 days away from the craziness. Upon arrival we were greeted at the front desk by Paola and Gabo. They took great care of us and gave us the tour. We arrived on the first day of the World Cup and my wife and I are soccer fans so we were happy to place set up for viewing the games. I know, it's the last thing that I should've been worried about but it's the freakin' World Cup. We got to our room and it was amazing. We reserved an Infinity Pool suite on an upper floor so we could have a nice view of the sea. I highly recommend the infinity pool suites. The honeymoon suites are more expensive and don't even have the pool. The swim up suites are cool but we wanted privacy and they are not that private since people are swimming and walking past your room all day. The room has an amazing bed, comfy sitting area, huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi, indoor shower and outdoor shower. I love outdoor showers so that\u2019s all that I used. The deck had the aforementioned infinity pool which was very comfy and bigger than I thought. It also 2 deck chairs and full sized outdoor bed (nice bonus). Our view from the 4th floor was unbelievable. We sat out there most afternoons after hitting the beach and just looked at the sea from our personal little pool. We were there for my wife's birthday and Gaby, our personal concierge, helped me to arrange an amazing night with my lovely lady. I purchased a candle-light lobster dinner on the beach and a couple\u2019s twilight massage on the overwater palapas. (by the way, these are extra fees) Gaby was so cool that she arranged for us to have the dinner on overwater palapa as opposed to doing it on the beach. We had the whole place to ourselves with the waves from the sea serenading us. The food was insane, I think we had 6 courses, all of them were perfect. My wife even had the chance to speak with the chef before the dinner to make sure that it was prepared to her liking and they were very accommodating. They even sang a little birthday song at the end which was cute. I can't say enough about this dinner, it was just awesome. Everything was prepared well with creative plating and appropriate portion sizes. Other thoughts on the food. First let me say that my wife was born and raised in Italy so she is extremely picky about food, so for her to say something is good means that it's amazing. She was happy about every meal that we ate. We did lunch every day at Papitos, the new beachside restaurant. They have a different style of meal every day; it's tasty and made to order at the massive grill. Then we also did the Kiyoko and Sabores. We didn't eat at Mio Cuccina because my wife is always disappointed with Italian food outside of Italy. Every meal was perfect with wonderful plating and incredible flavors. Be sure to do the theme nights if you can. We did the 'Around the World' dinner on Friday which was very cool and also went to Mexican night on Saturday (get the Chicken Mole!). Here's a tip about breakfast, just get room service. It's relaxing, prompt and delicious. Here's another big tip, get the 'Green Juice'. I don't know what's in it but it's awesome and can help with staying hydrated in the crazy Mexican heat. We discovered it in the spa area and ordered it 3 times a day, every day after we tried it. The grounds are well manicured with a real attention to detail. You feel like you're in a jungle with exotic animals. There are 2 pools; one is bigger than the other. We spent some time at the small pool because it was quieter and we liked the bartender Emilio. He was entertaining and a good guy to talk to. We spent the vast majority of our time on the beach and in the sea. The sand is like powdered sugar and it never gets hot because of the offshore coral reef that has mixed the sand over time. The water is perfectly turquoise and quite refreshing even in June. The beach butlers are attentive and quick with a drink. There are plenty of beds and chairs for all of the guests because they only have 72 rooms which makes the place very intimate. Finally, the staff. They couldn't be any nicer. Everyone says hello and within a day or two they remember your name and your preferences. You don't have to tip but if someone went above and beyond then we hooked them up with a few bucks, it's up to you. We got to know some of the servers, cooks, bartenders and all of the concierge ladies. If you want to go somewhere quiet and romantic, then this is the spot. No kids, no stress, no complications. It is truly relaxation at its finest. If you want some crazy party scene then I'd suggest somewhere else. They have some activities at night but overall it's very tame. I highly recommend EDM without any reservations. *Tip - Do the time share pitch, you can get a free massage or free a candle-light dinner out of it ($150 value) and it only takes about an hour and half.

We took her 2 daughters, ages 18 and 21. This place is truly outstanding, with excellent service, amazing staff, and they cater to every guest, with an incredible attention to details. Its NOT a party place, and its not really a place where the 2 daughters would classify as a hot spot. That being said, everyone had a great time, and it is a super relaxing atmosphere. There are mostly couples here, but not all couples. On most days, the 4 of us would be the only people at the big pool, having Ceasar the bartender, all to ourselves. It was strange, in that, literally, no one else was at the pool on a saturday, at 2:00 pm, and this happened quite often, so dont be surprised by the incredible relaxing quietness. The beach was nice, and there are plenty of beach chairs, and there are plenty of pool chairs... no need to reserve any. The pool chairs are very comfortable with a nice pad, and cotton lined towel wrapped around each chair. Needless to say, no towel cards at the El Dorado, and no wrist bands. They know your name the minute you get there, and they make you feel at home the entire time. With only 74 rooms, this was, by far, the smallest resort we have ever stayed at, and I was just fine with the low-key approach to everything. We stayed in the Mi Hotelito, and it was just fine. We were on the 2nd floor, overlooking the small pool, and we were literally on the beach within 50 steps out of our room. Top Shelf liquor, and good sized drink cups, so, no need to bring an insulated mug, unless you drink a lot of beer, because the beer tends to get warm quickly when its 95 degrees out! The food was above average to me, but, everyone has different tastes/preferences with regards to food. We had to wait a little longer for our meal one night, and that evening, when we returned to our room, there were 6 chocolate covered strawberries, with an apology note. They simply dont overlook anything. The beach service (as well as the poolside service) was outstanding as well. I cant find anything to complain about. Would I return to El Dorado Maroma?

When we began looking for a place to stay in Riviera Maya, we wanted something small, relaxing, and luxurious. Viola, the El Dorado Maroma delivered on all levels, and exceeded our expectations in every arena. Upon arrival, you wind through a lush mangrove forest which hides the resort from the local highway. In fact, the entryway is so unassuming compared to the other \u201cmega-resorts\u201d that you may feel a bit under whelmed when you arrive; luckily, we had the recommendation of a friend and I had read all of the recent reviews, so we knew that a weeklong treat awaited us! When we walked into the reception area we were handed cool towels scented with lavender water to freshen up, as well as glasses of champagne. After a tour of the resort we were shown to our room, where our baggage already awaited us. We chose a honeymoon suite in order to take advantage of the jacuzzi tub and outdoor shower (heaven!) in addition to having the fabulous upper-floor balcony in which to sit and watch the ocean. But, when we go to the Maroma again, I think we\u2019ll stick to the Mi Hotelito side of the resort, it\u2019s cheaper, and from what we heard from other guests, the rooms were just as lovely. Customer service is what sets this resort apart; the staff is truly special. Every person we encountered was simply lovely and gracious. Anabel, Gaby, Kary, Ariel, Ana, Enrique, and Cesar were wonderful, and all waved goodbye to us as we left (Kary even gave us huge hugs! Where do you find that at a resort?!). The food at the Maroma is amazing\u2026I was a bit hesitant about the Italian restaurant after reading reviews, but can honestly say it was perfect! Think cream of spinach soup topped with black truffle oil and ashed goat cheese, tenderloin in red wine reduction, chicken stuffed with cheese, and on and on. The sushi at the Japanese restaurant was also amazing, and we headed there on more than one occasion for that treat! Like other reviewers said, definitely order room service for breakfast! The brioche French toast with raspberry sauce, and apple pancakes with banana mousse is to die for! Overall, the atmosphere at Maroma is romantic, luxurious, quiet, and friendly! Since returning, we have been telling everyone we know to go there for vacation, you truly can\u2019t go wrong! Hint: pack sneakers. We didn\u2019t and because we didn\u2019t have proper shoes, we couldn\u2019t take the day trip to Coba (Mayan ruins). It costs extra, but sounded amazing!

After a great deal of research we selected this facility because it met virtually all of our criteria...all-inclusive, gormet food, adults only, tropical setting and limited space. Not only were our expectations met but they were exceeded in every way we could have asked for. The only reason I waited this long to write was I wanted to see if I felt the same after some time had passed. Well not only do I feel the same but my fondness for it has grown. The trip from the airport was crowded in the van - it made several stops on the way to EDM to drop off other vacationers at other resorts - but as we drove through the mangrove trees we knew this would be perfect. Isolated and perfect. Check in was handled quickly and smoothly with champagne and a cool towel offered since the heat in Mexico in July is intense. Our room, on the ocean side, was beautiful with each and every amenity just as it was described in the information I had read. Our first day there we were given a quick tour to make sure we knew where everything was and from that point we were on our own. Our first dinner was at the Japanese restaurant and it did not disappoint! We actually thought we would eat every meal there we enjoyed it so much but we found every restaurant to have it's own personality and flavor with one common thread - gormet style quality food with beautiful presentation. Whether it was breakfast or one of the specialty dinners every meal was prepared perfectly. That is not say that every food was to our liking but it had nothing to do with quality or presentation, just personal preference. There is very little night life here or for that matter much in the way of organized activities - which is just what we wanted. After all of the demands of a wedding the last thing we wanted was hundreds of people all trying to out-do one another. There were some things scheduled that you could take advantage of but we wanted to make our own schedule as much or as little as we wanted with the option everyday to be spontaneous (like para-sailing from the marina next door - a GREAT experience) or make our trips to the restaurants, pools or beach the most strenuous thing we did all day. The staff was very attentive but also respected our desire not to be inundated with service. Everyone was very friendly and seemed to genuinely appreciate what their responsibilites were in maintaining a first-class facility. Even the grounds crew, on very, very hot days, stopped what they were doing to look you in the eye, smile and offer a cheery \"Hola\" whenever you walked by. The only slight negative was having to endure a presentation from the company that runs the vacation booking part of the hotel. The gentleman who welcomed us when we agreed to sit throught this was very pleasant but then passed us off to the heavy who did apply some pressure for us to sign on. Actually he made some very tempting offers but we were honest from the beginning about not being in a place to make a commitment and after not too long a time they relented and we were done. The upgrade to a lobster dinner for our beach dinner made it worthwhile and it in no way detracted from our experience - rather it has been good for a laugh each time we talk about it. I, too, have read the negative comments posted on this site and I could not more strongly disagree with those assessments. Whatever we wanted, all we had to do was ask. Nothing was denied us and if it was a little unusual or not something they normally did, they found a way. In summary, if you are looking for a quiet, gormet, pampered vacation than you could not make a better decision than EDM. This would not be the best place for 20-something newlyweds who are geared toward late night partying and the bar or club scene. But if relaxation is your goal with amazing food, attentive hosts and a beautiful surrounding the El Dorado Maroma is for you.

We booked the trip through FunJet and tried the \u201cEl Dorado Fun for Less\u201d deal. We found out we were going to the Maroma about 5 days before our trip. We would have paid a lot more money booking the Maroma specifically, so it was great that it worked out that way. Definitely checkout Funjet.com (and the \u201cFun for Less\u201d and \u201cFun for Less El Dorado\u201d deals) if you\u2019re interested in a good bargain. Like all of the other reviews stated, check-in was a breeze (and champagne makes everything better). We got two rooms (202 and 204), which were very close to the quiet (\u201c24\u201d) pool. The location was nice considering we didn\u2019t pay for the nicer rooms (swim-up room, honeymoon suites, etc.). The bed was amazing. I\u2019ve slept like crud the past 4 nights since we\u2019ve been back, and I want the Maroma bed. The rooms were fine, except one of our rooms (202) had a horrible sewage smell in the bathroom. We should have called about it though, so that was partly our fault. The customer service at this resort is absolutely amazing. We joked about how we never heard the word \u201cno.\u201d For example, we wanted some cheese and crackers around cocktail hour (which was pretty much every hour, but I\u2019m referring to the 4-6 pm timeframe), and they delivered a plate to our patio. Also, we wanted sushi at night, and they brought that to our room as well. The drink service is wonderful too. The premium alcohol is a treat (compared to most resorts), but you have to ask for it. The mixed drinks are good too, and the Coco Loco (served in a coconut with a fruity face) was fun. The pools and the beach are top-notch. My husband and I took a long walk (about 50 minutes) and the beach got even more beautiful as we went further out. It was amazing. Definitely take advantage of the beach. The resort has an area roped off to swim in. It's pretty shallow. We bought $2.50 rafts from Walmart before we left and packed those in our suitcase. Those came in handy to lay on. Both pools are very nice, beautiful, and well maintained. The pools had great drink service. The beach was a bit slower, but you can walk up to the pool bar if you need a drink urgently. My one complaint about the resort was the food. I love food, and I\u2019ll eat pretty much anything. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we had some amazing meals. But I was disappointed in how rich everything was. My husband and I stayed at the Royale in January, and I did backflips over the food. But I think that has to do with the size of the resorts (the Royale is much larger, so there are more options). I just would have liked to see some lighter things on the menu, like more salad. After 5 days, we were ready to go back home and eat healthy (and we were craving Subway). We ate at the Japanese restaurant the first night, and we loved that. The sushi was good (even the 18 year-old liked it, and normally he is not a sushi fan), my veggie/tofu dish was mighty tasty, we got hot sake, etc. I haven\u2019t heard rave reviews about the Japanese restaurant on here, but that was my favorite. We did the Italian dinner at Sabores (with the soprano singer) the second night, the Italian restaurant the third night, and the Mexican dinner (with the mariachi band) at Sabores the last night. The menu for the Italian and Mexican dinners at Sabores was different than we were expecting, but maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re used to Americanized Italian and Mexican food. We liked the Italian food at the regular Italian restaurant a bit better. The service at all of the restaurants was absolutely extraordinary. We tipped a dollar for each round of drinks at the bar and about $2-4 at each meal. I liked the shrimp tacos (taco lunch day), the pizzas, and the spinach soup the best. The fresh fruit in the morning was tasty, and the egg white omelette was good as well. Oh and we ate plenty of chips and guacamole. We took advantage of the endless supply of guac. We also ordered a whole grouper (eyeball and everything), and that was fun to try. The shrimp was amazing. I've never seen one that big (that's what she said) before. We went to Rick\u2019s bar every night after dinner. The Michael Jackson show was awesome, and the casino night (blackjack, Texas Hold \u2018Em, and roulette) was fun. The bar wasn\u2019t very \u201choppin\u2019\u201d but it was still a good time. When we were the only ones left on our last night, the bartender played Jenga with us. We didn\u2019t do any excursions, but my husband and I have done the lobster cruise which leaves right off that dock, and that was AMAZING. So if you go to the Maroma, I highly recommend that. The resort is a couple miles off the highway, so you have to take a cab (versus a bus) to leave the resort. That is great for safety purposes, but I do like the $1.00 bus ride into down (can\u2019t beat that). My husband and I used the gym once. There were two treadmills (one was broken), an ellitical machine with arm things, a stair stepper (which didn't offer me enough resistance), a stationary bike, free weights, a fly pull (chest) machine, and an overhead shoulder press. I recommend ditching the gym cardio and walking or running on the beach.

The food is not that great and the choice of liquors usually is poor. However, this place is different. We used Best Day Travel for transportation, and it was fine, no complaints from me. We arrived and sat down with the hotel receptionist to fill out some information. They brought us a couple of glasses of champagne and took our bags for us. The check-in process took 5 minutes and we were then escorted around the hotel to see where everything is. I loved the layout of the hotel. Not too big where it takes 20 minutes to walk somewhere, and it is very close to the beach. We did stay in the swim-up suites, and I would highly recommend it! We stayed in Room 502. I would request either 301, 302, 401, or 402. These rooms have a better view of the beach. Also room 502 has the door near the bed, so that when people walk by at 7:00 in the morning, you hear it. They do not have liquor in the room, just a small refrigerator with Tecate that was not very cold. This was the only issue I had, but they did assure me that whatever beer we wanted could be placed in the refrigerator. The service at this place is UNREAL!!! Since it only has around 70 rooms, you get to know the staff very quickly. The main pool has Oscar and Cesar that help run things, and they are great!!! The Drinks can be made with premium liquor (Grey Goose, Crown Royal, Don Julio Tequila) but you need to let them know that's what you want. The beach is very close to the hotel and the service is fair. They only staff a couple of people for the service so it can be slow from time to time. Also there is no food on the beach, may not be a bad thing so you're not stepping in nachos. They do serve you a pretzel mix on request beachside. We did the couples massage over the water in the Bungalow area and it was great. My masseuse was a little rough, but I did have some knots that needed working out. One thing I wish I had done, was to leave the 100 dollar bills at home. Take 1's, 5's, 10's, and 20's. I had to make change quite a bit. I like to tip around a dollar or two each time they come up with a drink. This worked really well at the beach. But when we went to the main pool, I would tip a 20 right off the bat and not worry about it the rest of the day. Service was amazing when I did that, but when I tried it at the beach, they seemed to be slower. The food was really good for an all-inclusive. Most stuff is off the menu instead of buffet style. I recommend the cream of spinach soup (I never eat this stuff, but it was great here). Also the shrimp were great. Some of the biggest I've seen. The Italian food was not that great, and the japanese was OK. Nachos were great!! Get the beef and chicken nachos from Sabores, sit on the couch next to the bar, and have a great time. I hope this helps.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cBlew our socks off!\u201d", "Author": "wendywwBrighton", "ReviewID": "UR69702010", "Content": "We just returned from another trip to the Riviera Maya, BUT \"unfortunately\" did NOT stay at the El Dorado Maroma this time. Our recent trip to another \"exceptional luxury\" boutique resort left us longing for the El Dorado Maroma and wishing that we had shared our experience on Trip Advisor when we returned from there last June! We always research Trip Advisor thorougly before booking a trip AND watch the reviews for the place we are planning to stay up to the time we leave for our trip. Although we haven't looked at the recent reviews for El Dorado Maroma, we can tell you that our stay there last June/July (2009) was nothing short of exceptional. It's possible that the resort we just stayed at wouldn't have paled so much in comparison, if we hadn't already stayed at the Maroma and therefore had a standard against which to measure our stay. For example, you might \"assume\" that good air conditioning is a given in this type of climate. At the El Dorado Maroma that's true, but not the exceptional luxury resort where we just stayed. My husband had to threaten to leave before they came up with an interim solution. When you arrive at the El Dorado Maroma,, however, instead of entering through a massive, walled gate it's more akin to sneaking through a secret door into a private garden. As they hand you your glass of champagne, you begin your brief walking tour of the intimate 72 room resort, which ends in your own suite where they do a private check-in. In fact, for those of you who haven't experienced it yet, the \"no-waiting,\" in-room check-in is one of our favorite features of a boutique resort. We had taken an early morning direct flight from Detroit, which got us to the resort mid morning, just in time to have breakfast delivered to the patio of our \"swim-up\" suite, which overlooked the beach (the water was \"maybe\" 50 feet away). We were introduced to the concept of the \"swim-up suite\" at their sister resort the El Dorado Seaside Suites\" when we honeymooned there in 2007. The only reason that we abandoned the Seaside Suites, which we also loved, is because the Maroma is a more intimate setting (72 suites instead of 250 suites) AND its only 25-30 minutes from the airport. The rooms are very large, including a bathroom with double-sinks, large indoor shower, outdoor rainforest shower with a palapa roof, and a jacuzzi tub for two that shares a glass wall with the headboard of the 4-poster, king-sized bed. A half wall seperates the bedroom area from the living room area. Our favorite feature, of course, is the patio adjacent to the living room area. The large patio offers a dining table and two chairs, as well as a beach bed for two, but the best part is that you step off your patio directly into the lazy river, which forms a private plunge pool area in front of your room, but also provides access all the way down to the main pool and swim-up bar. Our first day there, the Concierge (Carmina) informed us that she had taken the liberty of signing us up for the special \"Dinner Around the World\" that evening. My only concern was that I am allergic to shellfish. I generally have no issues avoiding shellfish when ordering off an ala carte menu, but when it is a fixed menu, there are of course, issues. She promised to obtain a copy of that evening's menu for me. Twenty minutes later, I was lounging in the swim-up pool when two gentleman walked up and introduced themselves as the head chef and the food and beverage manager. They had heard about my food allergies and not only wanted to find out what I couldn't eat that evening, but also what I preferred! When we went to dnnner, they replaced the 2 or 3 courses that included shellfish with substitutes that had been prepared for me only. In fact, when they offered another fixed menu dinner later in the week (Italian night with an incredible opera singer and keyboardist for entertainment) they again served me a different dish in place of those containing shellfish without any additional communication! That however, was only the beginning of the incredible service that we received. I had also asked Carmina if I could get a Coke Zero anywhere at the resort (I don't drink coffee). She asked if I preferred Coke Zero to Coke Light (Diet Coke). When I told her that I did, she had someone go out and purchase Coke Zero and had all of the Coke Light replaced with Coke Zero in our mini fridge or the remainder of our visit. When I called to order breakfast on day 2, the indvidual who answered the phone said, \"Happy Anniversary Mrs. W...\" and asked if we wanted the breakfast order we had placed the day before, or something different. When the Activities Director, \"Bery Nice\" Bernice, walked by and asked if I wanted to join her in the main pool for a water aerobics class, I declined. However, she came back 10 minutes later looking disappointed because no one had shown up for her class. I invited her to join me in our swim-up pool for a private class, which she happily obliged. Another day, she took my husband out to the coral reef for a private snorkel tour when he was the only one who showed up for the activity. As he was paddling back in that morning, the Head Beach Butler, Katerina, walked by and struck up a conversation with me as she did every mornig. She asked if we had already had our breakfast on the patio. When I told her that I had been waiting for my husband's return, she pointed out that they were on their way back in and offered to place the order for us. She then proceeded to place our preferred breakfast order into her walkie-talkie, without asking me for it, and despite never having taken our order directly before. How do they do it?! We could provide example after example of these types of experiences (the cooking class in which my husband prepared his own ceviche, the tequila tasting, casino night, the hot stone massage at the on-site spa, etc., etc.) The El Dorado Maroma is not just all-inclusive, they are all SERVICES inclusive. If I had to come up with any drawbacks, they would only be that: 1) the El Dorado Maroma doesn't provide any airport transportation unless you join their vacation club, which leads me to my next point... 2) turn down the offer for the free spa credit in exchange for seeing a 1-hour presentation. The presentation is never only an hour -- I've dragged my husband to it 3 times now and they always last at least 2-3 hours -- and instead of offering a \"frequent stayer type program,\" they are selling RCI vacation club memberships, which incudes up to 40% off the El Dorado/Azul/Karisma property rack rates AND transportation to and from the airport. However, other than those relatively minor points, we've never enjoyed a more relaxing vacation, nor have we ever been so thorough blown away by the standard of service that they provide at the El Dorado Marom.

We arrived early in the morning , gave us champagne and wet towels, then they gave us a tour of the property (which is small) and said they'd have our rooms ready in about 30 minutes, which they did. We were in the Mi Hotelito building, overlooking the smaller pool, nice view. We thought we were going to be in the swimup suites but I guess they cost for an upgrade however after looking at our room, we loved it, more rustic, very nice! The bed was the most comfortable bed we've ever had, huge bath, and a bed and table on the patio. The a/c worked fabulous too I might add!!! We changed into swimsuits and went to the pool. We wondered where all the people were - no more than 6-8 people were ever in the pool at one time......nor the beach! It's like we had the resort to ourselves the whole time. The drinks were all top shelf and excellent - it was the first place that we didn't have to wait in line for a drink at either pool and they were always smiling to wait on you. It reminded me of a cheers bar - where everyone knows your name. It's such an intimate small resort and you just feel special the entire trip. We had our own concierge Gaby and she was exceptional. I could mention all the staff but the previous reviews did and we got to put faces to names, all so personable! The food is excellent!!!! We ate at Sabores, beach restaurant, Italian twice and Japanese, everything was SO tasty - I can't believe anyone would not think this food was excellent. Daniel walks around the resort giving 5 minute back massages (my husband said what a job!ha) and so I booked a 30 min massage with him the palapa over the water........ahhhhhhh it was heaven, my first massage in Mexico. We were near the marina and walked down to see everything.....never once did we hear boats that kept us awake or anything that people complained about........ While there we were asked if we'd like to save money on future trips so we said yes and made an appt. We traveled with another couple so she and I went to the appt. They said they could not talk to us until the husband was there. I explained I would relay any information.......but they insisted they be there, so we left. They apologized for days but I believe it's a \"timeshare\" sort of thing after talking to others. Not interested. The beach was the most beautiful I've ever seen. Reminded me of St. John! Always had chairs and beds available. They have a bar that is open at nite - Ricks Bar - cute place but we just went for awhile - hardly anyone in there when we were there but heard it got going later. Would I go back?

That was pretty annoying. I mean, there is a whole kitchen. I am sure some chips and guac wouldn't have been too difficult. Overall, we had a wonderful time. The lunches in the sand were amazing.

We arrived to the most beautifully located suite on the fourth floor, with private balcony and sea view. We thoroughly enjoyed the day bed (!) watching pelicans fly by, as well as the rain storms that blew through in the evenings. The rooms were spotless and the towel art was amazing! The staff were wonderful and attentive to every need, with smiles letting us know we were most welcome. We would love to especially thank Henry (Enrique) the Head Bell man and Monica our concierge contact. The Lomas travel tours operator was most helpful and we had the most exciting day-trip to the Coba ruins (including rappeling down the sink-hole ('cenotes') and the zip-trip!). The long walks on the beach were a great way to exercise after all the great food. One can go 3-4 km one-way north from the resort along azure waters and white sand. The only thing that we didn't like was the noise from the power boats and sea-doos from the marina next door. Alas there were no sailing boats, but that was a minor thing. We also want to thank the executive chef Efrain for his talented chef staff/waiters and the provision of gluten-free foods for my wife. He went over and above our expectations and delivered outstanding food at all times of the day! The sushi was very good as well. Muchas gracias, senores!

We had stayed at the Azul Beach Hotel, a sister to this hotel and had a wonderfull time. Prefering smaller all inclusives like Azul or Secrets Capri, picking the El Dorado Maroma was just right. We are beach people, you can find a pool anywhere, but a beautiful beach with great water and a sandy bottom is really our ideal. Maroma Beach is one of the best in this part of Mexico. We stayed in room 102 in the original Mi Hotelito section and the beach was right outside our door, perfect. The room was also close to the small pool which had fresh coffee at 7AM, about 20 yards down the walk. There is also a swim up bar which is open around that time and they have tables, bloody Mary's anyone? We ordered room service breakfast every morning. Eating on our patio, the food was top notch and plentyful. For dinner the Italian restaurant had a tasty carbonara, and the Japanese restaurant's tempura was great. The staff at El Dorado Maroma was superb, Anna at the front desk, Paola, Diana and Gaby, all concierges, Anabel, our beach waitress (superb) and Tiago, the activities guy. always full of infomation on what's happening . You read the reviews and almost every one mentions the fine staff, they are right on the mark. Without their care this vacation would have been average at best. I know I forgot to name a few employees, my apologies. When researching for this vacation, we thought they had food service on the beach, they do not. The other Karisma resorts have that service. Too Bad . The beach drink service is stll super, thanks again Anabel. Palapas would be nice, the umbrellas are O K but that sun still can get through.them.

Here are a few of the shortcomings that we observed at this \u201cso-called\u201d resort: \u2022 Sewage odors from the nearby sewage plant were prevalent on many of the days. \u2022 Mosquitoes invade the resort at dusk. My husband and I returned covered with mosquito bites on our arms, legs, and torso. I can\u2019t even tell you how bad the bites are. I am talking hundreds! \u2022 Many service staff asked if we needed anything and then did not follow through. Some of the service staff were rude and asked us to sit down and wait. This is not top rated service. \u2022 A top-rated all-inclusive resort would include more than 2 cans of Tecate for in-room alcohol. \u2022 A top-rated resort would provide shuttles to the City more frequently than twice per week. Due to our Sunday arrival and departure we were only able to travel to Playa del Carmen on one day, Wednesday. Also, when all 8 riders in the shuttle requested to return to the resort at 4 pm rather than the scheduled 6 pm we were told to take a taxi. That is not top-rated service. \u2022 The resort facilities are not equal to the same level of current top-rated accommodations. \u2022 The food was of moderate quality, with limited menus. Yes, they state they have 24 hour room service. There are 4 items on the menu which include a hamburger and a hotdog. \u2022 We did not receive an ocean view; rather we had a view of dead bugs. \u2022 The rooms were smelly, moldy, had no dead bolts. \u2022 Construction on one side of the hotel was very loud. \u2022 The pools looked dirty. I could go on and on and on and on, but I think that you get the point. My husband and I have been to Mexico a handful of times and have never been mislead or disappointed.

Upon entering the resort we were a little skeptical because the lobby is NOT grand. We have stayed at El Dorado Royal a few years ago and our 1st experience there was fantastic. However, with that said, our check-in was flawless, as was our quick tour around the resort. Our room, 511, overlooked the main pool and ocean and had a infinity pool. Again, beautiful. Walking the resort you sometimes feel like you have the resort to yourself. Very peaceful, not crowded, no rushing for beach or pool chairs. The most beautiful beach around with great butler service. Very intimate resort with everything within walking distant (restaurants, pools, bars, spa). The service was great. Casear and Oscar, bartenders at the swim up bar at the main pool, were the best as well as Alessandro at Rick's bar. We will miss them. They were awesome! We liked that if you wanted to eat in the restaurants you didn't have to make reservations so we never felt rushed to go to dinner. The theme nights in one of the restaurants was interesting. With that said, I only rate this resort 4 stars because while the food for breakfast and lunch were by far some of the best meals we've had, dinner was a huge disappointment. The service was beyond our expectations but the food lacked luster. We ate at both restaurants, Mio and Kiyoko, and were very disappointed. We went to the theme nights- Mayan, Mexican- not good. They made a great effort but nowhere close to the lunch meals. Lunch- BBQ theme, Mexican day, Paella- all extremely good. Lunch at Sabora was so good we wondered why they didn't extend it for dinner. We would have been much happier. Our only other complaint was the concergie at our arrival. She was very pushy with us. When we explained that we were just here to relax and wanted no activities planned she became a little obnoxious and surprised.

There is a small marina located at the resort which is owned by the Karisma Group I beleive and out of their operates para-sailing, fishing and sunset cruises. It adds a little something to watch and do during the day. All in all - from the rooms, food and surroundings - this a terrific resort. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing or romantic holiday - this is the place. However - I have saved the best for last. The management and staff at the Maroma truly understand the holiday experience and go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect. I believe this starts with their General Manager - Alfredo - who introduced himself and gave us a guided tour of the new restaurant. Throughout our week Alfredo always stopped to see how things were going. We were invited to a special \"dinner of the worlds\" put on by the resort - and it was intimate and fun. We were introduced to the chef and staff by name and each dish was described prior to serving. It was a wonderful night. There were many staff who seem to make it their personal misson to make our holiday just right. It started with our Beach Butler Perla who took us immediately to the beach, arranged for drinks and food and took care of us all week. Everyday Perla would check on everyone to see if they needed anything. I can't say enough about Perla except thanks!! She is really a gem for this resort. Our concierge was Monyka - and she was also amazing. She made sure all our reservations were made for the week, took care of any small issues - and even arranged with the kitchen for a special a la carte meal in our room the last night. The other person we have to thank would be Noe. I'm not sure what Noe's title was - he seemed to be everywhere from the office to the sunset cruise. At the time we were selling our house back home and had to receive an offer and reply during that week. Both Monyka and Noe went above and beyond to help us recieve, print, scan and e-mail the offer. This meant so much to us and we wanted to say again thanks. To be honest - this is the first review I have ever written. We have made a habit of staying at Karisma properties the past number of years and they have all been great. But when we left Maroma - we really felt we were leaving friends. I think this is part the Karisma culture and part Alfredo's management style which is evident within all his staff. We have already booked our stay for next year and are taking another couple this time so they could experience it.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington D.C.", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort, Amazing service. Simply beautiful.\u201d", "Author": "TravelTimeGuy", "ReviewID": "UR65030814", "Content": "I apologize for the late review---stayed for a week in April 2009--but wanted to give my props to this wonderful resort. I've stayed at a few pretty upscale all-inclusives in Mexico and the Caribbean; but the El Dorado Maroma is probably the best. It's a smaller (70-some rooms), quiet, boutique resort; but because of the this--the staff gives you amazing service and attention. Most of the full-time staff (concierge, front desk, etc) knew you by name after a couple days because you'd bump into them in the small resort. The food was amazing. A little limited, I suppose, with only three restaurants--but they were all very good. Room service was always prompt and hot. It was the type of all-inclusve where you could ask for something off the menu (room service or at one of the restaurants) and they usually can get it for you. They did for me the couple times I asked, anyway. To give an example of their unbelievable service, I asked them the possibility of stocking the fridge daily with sugar free Red Bull instead of Coke. The girl (I wish I could remember her name!) said they usually don't but that she'd run to the store and get them for me. I tried to pay her cash for it and she refused! She also wouldn't let me carry it from her car and offered to have them stock 2 or 3 in each day, as opposed to having me get them all at once. It was THAT type of great service! It definitely isn't the loud, party type resort and is totally geared toward romance and couples. As a matter of fact, at night at the only bar open--we were the only ones there or there with one or two other couples. The pool and pool bar were beautiful and the servers came by as often as you needed with drinks. The quality of the drinks (top shelf: I requested and received Grey Goose when ever requested) were exceptional. Some favorite mixed cocktails were the traditional Miami Vice and the Pink Panther (something with Vodka that was delicious). If you ever felt like a drink wasn't strong enough--all you'd have to do was ask to put more liquor in it or make it a double. The beach was beautiful. I'm not sure if it's truly deserving of being one of the top 5 or 10 beaches in the world--but definitely was outstanding. There were a good number of areas with patches of seaweed, I guess to have that lofty of a grade. Don't get me wrong: it was very beautiful, very swimmable, etc--but I've seen beaches that were prettier. The great thing about the resort was that you could walk for a long ways (a mile or so) without another resort--at least a year ago. It would have felt like the stereotypical \"deserted island\", if it wasn't for the occasional couple walking in the other direction. It made it great to run on the beach, though--which I did almost every day. The fitness center was also nice. Not huge or anything but definitely adequate with newer treadmills. The location is great for a trip into Playa Del Carmen. A $20 cab ride and you're there. I stayed in an Infinity Pool Suite. It had the standard jacuzzi in the room (very nice). Also, a normal shower/tub; but the additional outdoor shower. I loved being able to shower outside--so refreshing with the fresh air! It is also covered enough, so no one else can see you. The \"infinity pool\" is on the balcony. It was maybe 12 feet long by a couple feet wide. It was not heated and a little cold for our taste, but it was nice to soak your feet in there. If it was really hot and you wanted to cool off, it could definitely be refreshing. The balcony/pool was pretty private; but if you and the neighboring Infinity Pool Suite people were out on their balconies/in their pool--you could definitely hear each other. You couldn't see them, as the balconies were divided by a wall. I probably wouldn't have paid the full price for the Infinity Pool room, but they had a 50% off (pay one for the price of two people per night) promotion through my Exotic Resorts time share (El Dorado Royale, El Dorado Seaside, Azul, etc). Instead of being $720 USD r so a night--it was $360. As for the time share presentation itself: I would recommend sitting through it. It is pretty painless (not too high pressure). You get to eat some finger foods, drink some champagne or wine, etc. And you get resort dollars (I think it was $150 or $200). The resort dollars also used to be able to be used at some select restaurants in Playa Del Carmen (a couple years ago, at least)--but not sure if that's still the case. You can do whatever you feel is right; but I always tip the waiters, bartenders and housekeeping. Although, tips are \"included\"--they really don't make much and work VERY hard in hot weather. I feel they deserve a couple US Dollars here and there. I don't know if it helps the service or not, but I feel a lot better doing it. Especially, since I worked in the service industry growing up and know how important tips used to be! If you want a romantic vacation with your loved one--I'd highly recommend it. The Marina is next door and never took away from the ambience at all. Plus, you could do all of the extra excursions right there if you wanted: jet skis, parasailing, catermaran, scuba/snorkeling excusions,etc. The only improvement that I hope they've done since last year was to add an ATM machine at the resort. They didn't have one.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Vacation - AGAIN!\u201d", "Author": "akandal", "ReviewID": "UR64404229", "Content": "On May 13 we arrived home from our third stay at the wonderful El Dorado Maroma.

Not this time. When our last day in paradise came upon us, my husband and I were both a little depressed at the prospect of having to leave. We have both stayed at some very nice all-inclusives, and there have been some that are more opulent, some that have had more restaurants, some that have offered more activities, some that have claimed first-class service, but El Dorado Maroma beat them all, hands-down. I will not repeat what everyone else has said. It is all true, and then some. I will only address some concerns we had before going, hopefully putting any of the same questions you had to rest. Before going, I was a little concerned that from the pictures of this place, it may not be as lavish as some of those mega-resorts with the huge marble open-air lobbies and ultra modern furnishings; however, when you get here, the understated rustic quality of the place helps reinforce the feeling you are on your own desert island. The flowers and vegetation are so lush and beautiful, further promoting the idea you are in a tropical paradise. They were 70% booked when we were there in early May, but it was so quiet and peaceful. I promise there were more employees than guests! I was concerned that we would get tired of only 3 restaurants (with a 4th--the new \"lunch palapa\"--only open at lunch). This was not the case at all. The first day you arrive, your personal concierge sits down with you and helps you plan your week. Throughout the week, they have special 6 course meals, and if you want to participate in these, she will write the times on an itenerary for you so you don't forget. We went to an Italian night featuring a very talented Opera singer and also a special \"Around the World\" dinner with each course from a different country. That was my favorite. One evening, after a day-long excursion to Chichen Itza that our concierge, Carmina, planned for us, we came back and had a room service dinner. When all was said and done, we really never ended up having dinner from the same menu twice. One thing I will mention, I would not really call this gourmet dining like we would expect back home, but the food is nicely presented and beats other all-inclusive resorts offerings, hands down! Before the trip, I was concerned that I would get bored with all this luxury and pampering. With the help of your personal concierge, you can make this trip as relaxing or as active as you desire. We customized our stay so that we would have something special to do most days. One day we took a free kayaking trip to a sink hole to snorkel with Thiago, their activities coordinator. One day, we took a free shuttle to Playa del Carmen for some shopping and sightseeing. (If you do this, just a word of warning, take $25 for cab fare as you will most likely want to come back early. We set out at noon with about 6 other couples. When the shuttle came for us at 5:45, there were only 2 couples who hadn't taken a taxi back early.) One day we booked a tour to Chichen Itza. With all the personalized service, there was never a dull moment. Being in our forties, another concern we had was that we'd be either the oldest people there, or the youngest. Not so at all! It was a nice blend of all age groups, from newlyweds to retirees. Usually all the party people congregated at the pool bar in the newer area, so when they started getting a little raucous, we'd go to the older, quieter pool where Emilio, the bartender, would entertain us with his wit and charm. We were here for relaxation and romance, so we pretty much kept to ourselves and quite enjoyed the solitude of our private infinity pool. Of the four couples close to our age that we spoke to, all of them had been there before, often multiple times. You can't get a better recommendation than that! I couldn't decide whether I would prefer this resort or the Casitas at El Dorado Royale. After speaking with them (one couple had stayed in many of the Karisma resorts), the Casitas would be their second recommendation, but with the intimate size of El Dorado Maroma, this place couldn't be beat. Oh--NEWS FLASH!--They are planning to build some bures (over the water suites) here like they have in Fiji. As if it weren't perfect enough, this would be the icing on the cake! In summary, take it from me, and all of their repeat customers, if you want truly unparalleled service in a lush, romantic tropical setting, you will find no better resort than this.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "De Pere, WI", "Title": "\u201cwe'll be back!!\u201d", "Author": "chesterhouse3", "ReviewID": "UR64154362", "Content": "after an awful travel day, we arrived here to be greeted by Patti & five other wonderful staff making our daytime travel miseries a quick forgotten memory.

The beach is truly one of the most beautiful we have seen, and we have been to many, many tropical beaches. We were able to walk the beach every morning and feel as though we had it to ourselves! There was never a problem finding a beach chair or bed... no getting up at the crack of dawn to \"save\" a chair. We truly looked forward to the morning drinks and snacks on the beach. Our room was spectacular - we had one of the private plunge pool rooms and it couldn't have been much better, although the second floor did not provide the view we had hoped for. The bed was so comfortable and the resort was delightfully quiet. The room was always cleaned in the morning while we were on the beach, and we always looked forward to the towel creatures! Carmina was our concierge and she took great care of us. We loved the wait staff...everyone was warm and friendly. The food was amazing. The new beachfront restaurant (open for lunch only) had just opened and we loved it! Breakfast was outside at Sabores every morning, and in no time, they knew us and our likes and dislikes. Don't let the sales presentation scare you away - it is very low key.... and a good deal! We had a great time on the cruise. We met no one we did not like at the resort. Our fellow travelers were interesting, and as mellow as we could wish for! Again, I have to stress how wonderful the service was. We truly felt like members of the family after the first day.

Please note the resort has no ocean front suites. Most suites have an ocean view but not all. The suites in the newer section are all the same size and have the same amenities. What differentiate them are the terrace and the location. The honeymoon suites have a large terrace and are mostly on the 4TH floor with magnificent views of the ocean above the palm trees. The infinity pool suites are located on the second, third and some on the 4th floor. The room assigned to us was an infinity pool suite on the second floor in section three of the resort with a beautiful ocean view. The swim-up suites are on the first floor. All suites have a double Jacuzzi in the bathroom, double sinks, with indoor and outdoor showers. Unless you are on the 4th floor your outdoor shower will have a \u201cPalapa\u201d roof. The outdoor shower is called \u201cAguas del Amor\u201d. Additional amenities in the suites include WiFi (for a fee) and Ipod docks. The older \u201cMy Hotelito\u201d section has two floors with standard rooms. The resort has no elevators. The food in all three restaurants is a la carte. Our favorite restaurant was the Italian \u201cMio Cuccina\u201d which is only open for dinner. They also have \u201cSabores\u201d a Mexican restaurant open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Kiyoko, a Japanese restaurant open for dinner and \u201cMy Kitchen\u201d a new restaurant (ocean front) not yet officially named, which is open for lunch with a weekly rotation of catch of the day, meat bbq\u2019s, sensational paellas and typical Mexican cuisine. They also provide some specials dining experiences at Sabores with an Italian night and a soprano opera singer, and a Mexican night with a Mariachi Band. There are two pools; one in the new section and one in the older \u2018My Hotelito\u201d section. Both have a swim-up bar. The barmen will mix anything your heart desires and if it does not exist they will improvise. The grounds are very beautiful and meticulously maintained. Some palm tree branches could be cut back to clear the walkways. The beach area is very clean and the water has a turquoise color which Maroma is famous for. Chairs and umbrellas are provided as well as the double beds for a relaxing siesta.

If you want lots of activities and party time atmosphere, then this resort is not for you. They do offer some activities throughout the day in a low key environment; canoe trips (weather permitting), film charades; name that tune, salsa dancing on the beach, cooking lessons, bocce ball, horse shoes, volleyball, etc. Rick\u2019s bar provides entertainment in the evening; live bands, pool table, casino night, games, etc and is open until 2 AM.

I thought I would give some insight into the comparison of the swim up rooms vs the infinity pool suite. We loved the swim up rooms at the El Dorado Seaside, but were intrigued by the infinity pool suites and therefore split our stay between the two. I don't think you could go wrong with either room-they are both laid out pretty much the same inside, very spacious and beautiful. The bathrooms both have the outdoor shower and indoor jacuzzi for two, something we weren't sure about before we went. Both patios DO have a bed on them, something else we couldn't confirm before going. Here are the pros and cons for each: SWIM UP: Pros: you are close to the bars, restuarants and anything else you might want to do. It is nice to be able to swim out from your room to the bar and back in just a couple of minutes. The patio area is HUGE! If you are going with friends, it would be nice to have rooms close to each other and to be able to hang out in the lazy river and on your patios together-we saw several groups doing this. Cons: Being on the ground floor takes away from your privacy. Everyone that walks by can see you on your patio. As mentioned above, several groups were hanging out in the lazy river right outside our patio and got quite loud and rowdy. INFINITY POOL: Pros: We loved the privacy and the views! We didn't think the water was too cold, and this was in January. We spent hours in our pool. The bed on the patio is much more hidden and private than in the swim up room. When we were relaxing on the patio at night we weren't interrupted by the pool cleaners like on the ground floor swim up rooms. Cons: The only con we could come up with is that you actually have to get your butt out of the infinity pool and go down to the bar to get a drink or food. Overall I would totally recommend either room, but the Infinity Suite wins my vote hands down for the best room. I sometimes felt like we were the only two people in the world when we were hanging out in our pool.

It had rained the day before our arrival so there was some sediment from the roof in our pool but they did send someone up to clean it and it was cleaned daily for the whole duration of our stay. The grounds are immaculate and I'm sure there isn't a blade of grass out of place. The public washrooms were the cleanest washrooms I have ever seen. The beach is beautiful but you do have to get up quite early to take advantage of the beach beds but there are still lots of loungers for the taking. The food and drinks are to die for!

There are so many good reviews on this resort so I guess we just had some bad luck during our stay. First of all I know this resort is known for giving guests the relaxed and away from everything type of vacation but there was like NEVER anything to do. Maybe because of the time of year that we went, but we would show up for their scheduled activities and there wouldn't be anyone there, even employees. But then when we did go on an excursion or try to rent out snorkel gear the other few 20 or 30 people staying there were doing the same thing so it took forever. We never even got to use the snorkeling gear bc it was always checked out and they never put our name on a list or anything to use it. The beach was pretty but not as pretty as other beaches we've been to such as Jamaica, Grand Cayman, or the Dominican Republic. I saved the worst part of our experience for last, we had bed bugs in our room and didn't realize it until we came back home and found one in our luggage. Every morning we would wake up with several small itchy bites on us but just figured it was mosquitos. Thankfully we debugged all of our luggage as soon as we realized what we had brought back with us from mexico so they didn't infest our home. We called the resort and explained that the room had bed bugs and the employee just giggled, I guess she had never heard of them and thought it was a joke. So, I asked to speak with the manager and she said they would have him call me back and took my phone number, but we never heard from anyone.

Once we got to the resort, I couldn't have been more pleased. Once you walk past the main entrance, you're instantly transported to 'vacation land.' We sat down with Carmina, the concierge, who was extremely helpful in helping us plan our week in Riviera Maya. She even kicked in some extra spa treatments, as my husband told her the story of how we met. We stayed in one of the infinity pool suites with the indoor and outdoor showers. The room was exquisite, but we only used the infinity pool once and never used the dining room/living room area, as we just were too busy. The food at every restaurant was fantastic, we even had a candlelight dinner on the beach one night, which was exquisite and probably one of the most romantic moments of our honeymoon. Another night, they had a 4 course italian meal complete with a opera singer; another honeymoon highlight. The service was phenomenal, across the board. We had a not-so-pleasant experience during our horseback riding excursion (I almost got thrown off my horse), and they refunded our money for that activity.

My husband and I were very impressed with Luis, you can tell he enjoys his job and goes out of his way to connect with you and provide the best service possible.

I'm sure some guests were annoyed and we tried not to disturb them but from responses from those around us I think the majority enjoyed our music including the staff.

What they failed to mention was the fact the hotel were building a new restaurant right next to the beach and pool which meant rather than being able to read our books in peace we were forced to listen to either the building work (while at the beach) or the music they put on to drown out the building work (while at the pool). They were also carrying out repair work (which the hotel desperately needs) which mainly consisted of banging (again not relaxing) and building a new block of rooms (which involved using a JCB on our last few days there. Unfortunately this was not our only complaint, others include: 2) Service in restaurants - served under cooked fish in Asian restaurant, often waiting 15mins before even got menu, drinks frequently didn't appear, ordered water without ice and fish, got water with ice and chicken! 3) Cleanliness of room - cigarette butt was missed on every clean, dead insects in canopy. 4) General state of repair on room - back door broken, rust in bathroom, aircon broke on 2nd day, bathroom scales not working, bedside light and light on balcony not working 5) Toiletries in bathroom were not re-stocked you had to ask each time you ran out of something. 6) My note of all things wrong with the hotel disappeared 7) Never received voice messages from holiday rep who was dealing with our complaints.

From the moment we passed through the mangrove jungle to our delightfully intimate resort we knew we were in paradise! We were greeted by a very friendly and accommodating staff. We sipped champagne in the main lobby while receiving information about the resort. The grounds are lush, tropical and just simply beautiful. El Dorado Maroma pays attention to every detail from taking immaculate care of the grounds to complete pampering of it's guests. Hors D'oeuvres and refreshing fruit drinks were brought to the beach every day to reinvigorate the guests. There are carts by the pools as well as by the beach containing sunscreen and magazines, just in case you has forgotten yours. There are 3 restaurants on the resort with delicious food (Mexican, Italian, Japanese) and great atmosphere. You can also order room service 24hrs a day - pretty much whatever you want! We wanted to do a couple of excursions while in Mexico and with the Marina right next door, it was simple! Lomas Travel has an office right in the resort with Luis arranging what we wanted for excursions. We did deep sea fishing as well as a catamaran/snorkeling adventure. Both were excellent choices! When we were planning on going snorkeling it was a particularly windy day (would not have been good for snorkeling). Luis let us change our excursion to the following day. Anything you want to do from snorkeling to visiting mayan ruins, Luis has something for you! The resort is very intimate and private with no other resorts around. Our room was clean, comfortable with an immaculate ocean view! The resort offers a shuttle to Playa del Carmen for shopping for no extra charge. This is a really great spot with tons of shopping as well as a public beach (for those who don't want to shop!) We really can't say enough good things about this resort. It was such a positive experience that we will definitely be reliving one day! The staff is one of the reasons the stay was so wonderful. Ceasar, Mitzy, Alfredo and Henry are just to name a few!

We certainly were not disappointed. The meals were excellent and beautifully presented. The service were amazing, and the staff would go out of their way to make sure we were happy and that we had everything we needed. The negatives were very few: the pool was too cool to swim in, which was a bit of a disappointment, considering we had a swim-up suite; construction of a new beach restaurant disturbed the otherwise peacefulness of this resort (construction should be limited to \"off season\"); and pressure from the consierge (Fernando) to attend a briefing to sell us on signing up for repeat visits to the resort.

From the moment we entered the lobby we were treated like royalty! The check-in was friendly, the champagne was a welcome refreshment after our 4 hour flight and the receptionist was cheery and helpful. Once we were checked-in, the bell boy, I believe his name was Enrique, gave us a short tour of the property in order to familiarize us with the grounds before taking our bags and us to our room. The initial impression of the Infinity Jacuzzi Suite that we had booked was sheer luxury. From the king sized bed romantically bordered with sheer curtains, to the bottle of champagne on ice, to the fresh fruit tray and amazing views from our third floor balcony, we thought we were in heaven. The well appointed bathroom with double vessel sinks, illuminated make-up mirror, two person jacuzzi, large indoor and outdoor shower were the icing on the cake. We immediately unpacked and dressed for dinner at the Italian Restaurant. No reservations were required except for the Italian and Mexican nights at Sabores. Gabby was our waitress the first evening we were there and she was attentive, professional and positively bubbly~ Our meals were artfully presented as culinary masterpieces. We went for breakfast the first morning at Sabores Restaurant and had a lovely meal and, again, the service was impeccable. This, however, would be our last breakfast outside our room. We took full advantage of room service for the remainder of our stay. The room service menu for breakfast was extensive enough and the service was, once again, above par. We ate the majority of our lunches under the Palapa and took advantage of the different themed menus. The fresh nacho chips and homemade salsa are to die for. My only complaint would be that there is little or no garlic in the guacamole. Our dinners at all three restaurants were amazing. Although the portions seemed slightly less generous to what we are accustomed to, by the end of the meal we were very satisfied without being uncomfortable. Again, only one complaint that we had about the restaurants is the choice of red wine. As lovers of red wine, we found that the house wine did not match the caliber of the food. The beach was absolutely amazing, from the gentle waves and clear turquoise water to the beach butler service (Thanks Mitzy, you are wonderful). The fresh fruit water smoothies were a welcome quench to our thirst after our long morning walks on the beach. There was never an issue finding a chair, daybed or umbrella. The beach was raked regularly and the sand was like icing sugar. The only complaints that we had, were that the air conditioner in our room was quite noisy. It was quite windy during our stay and the wind literally howled throughout the night on our balcony. Towards the end of our week we noticed that algae was forming in the water in our infinity pool. We contacted maintenance who immediately came and dropped some algaecide in the pool. The next day it was somewhat better, but I think that the pools should be more regularly scrubbed and treated. The other main pool and the quiet pool were both quite chilly and therefore we did not swim in them. On our departure, check-out was a breeze and we were greeted at the front door of the lobby by the General Manager, Alfredo Santamarla, who seemed genuinely interested in what our experience had been. He is very proud of the resort and his staff, as he rightfully should be. His personal attention to our concerns and comments were greatly appreciated. We hope to someday return to El Dorado Maroma and look forward to the same courteous, pleasant service we enjoyed throughout our stay.

I will caution up front that if you are seeking a place where there is non-stop partying and a raucous younger crowd, this is not likely your kind of place. We are in the 50+ age bracket,and for us this place was ideal. We were in the MiHotelito section, and the building was a bit older but impeccably clean. We were not satisfied with our initial room assignment (I'll tip you off -- Room 201, right on top of the poolside bar) but were quickly and easily moved to another room more to our liking. The room had a comfy king sized bed, TV and DVD player, and enough room to spread out for a long stay. The veranda had a lounging bed and a table and chairs. It was a great room -- our only complaint would be that smoking is allowed on verandas, and our neighbors were smokers -- so our veranda was not usable when they were outside, and we had to close the doors to the room to keep the no-longer-fresh air out at those times. I did make a suggestion that the hotel needs to designate one entire building as non-smoking so everyone could be happy. Who knows if this is even possible...! We cannot say enough about the service. Every staff member went out of his/her way to engage us in conversation, to learn of our likes and dislikes, and to be sure we had everything we could wish for. Food was excellent, especially the Asian restaurant. There are two \"theme nights\" each week -- Italian night with a soprano, and Mexican night with Mariachis. Both were fun but the Italian night was top notch. The soprano was gifted, engaging and entertaining. The General Manager was present and greeted each table personally, inquiring after our experiences and making sure we were satisfied.

We had just spent a week and a half vacationing with family and getting married in other parts of the Riviera Maya and were looking forward to a few days at a relaxing resort where we didn't have to think about anything. First, the good things: We received hot towels and glasses of champagne upon arrival. The beach was beautiful and had the softest, powder-fine white sand we saw all throughout the Riviera Maya. The food at the Asian restaurant was delicious, and the Italian place was okay. Lunch in the beach palapa was way better than lunch in the restaurant. Rick's bar was fun and had a pool table, dart table (magnetic) and other games along those lines. Room service for us was pretty quick service. The disappointing things: When we got there to check in, we were earlier than our check-in time, so we ate lunch and just hung out on the beds and chairs they have all over the place. At one point the concierge came by and said he just had to drop one thing off and would be right back to take us to our room because it was ready. More than an hour later he came back, and said \"oh yeah, your room wasn't actually ready before when I said it was.\" He gave us a tour of the room, and when he showed us the mini-fridge it was 1) not re-stocked, and 2) had a half drunk glass of something white and creamy in it. When he brought us our bags, they weren't our bags. When we told him that he got really defensive and said that it was the tag that matched the room. Which to me means either the bags were mis-tagged or we were in the wrong room... but he eventually believed us and went and brought us our bags. He also asked if we were interested in a free upgrade of our room, and when we said yes he then told us that there wasn't anything available, but maybe there would be in 2 or 3 days. In the bathroom, there was no water that came out of the faucet when we turned the hot water on. When we called the front desk, their response was \"sometimes you have to let it run for a little while before it will be really hot.\" Again, I felt like we had to negotiate with them a little more than necessary to get them to send someone to fix the water. Our room was right next to one of the pools, and we were assured that it wouldn't be noisy or keep us up at night since the bar there closed at 10 and then Rick's bar was open late, which was away from the rooms and not noisy. Well, Rick's bar was closed that first night, so they kept the pool bar open late and we could definitely hear people well after midnight still out there. The next morning we received a note from the concierge desk saying they expected us at a specific time so they could fully discuss all the amenities of the hotel. When we showed up, they had nothing to say to us and seemed more annoyed that we were there but didn't need anything specific. We asked about Rick's bar being closed the night before and their response was \"oh it wasn't closed.\" Again, we had to explain ourselves before she called and talked to someone, and found out that it was in fact closed the night before and would be closed again that night. We were there for New Year's Eve, and they put on a big party, but we asked specifically, and were assured numerous times, that all the restaurants would still be open if we wanted to eat there instead. It turns out they weren't. There was a daily schedule of events that were offered around the hotel, but I'm not sure if any of these actually happened. We were in the pool area where Towel Folding was supposed to take place, and I think it ended up starting an hour late because they had to find towels for the event. They also advertised a coffee and dessert sunset event, but when we showed up for that the guy told us he could only give us water because the kitchen was closed and didn't seem to know anything about the advertised event. The drinks were not very good. Tecate beer and sugary mixed drinks. The main restaurant was average at best. The room service menu was disappointing- hot dogs and hamburgers for lunch, chicken burritos for dinner. When we ordered room service breakfast, the jams that were delivered with our toast had already been opened and used. The beach setting is beautiful, but there is nothing else around within walking distance. Even though it was all-inclusive, we contemplated trying to go somewhere else for dinner one night, but decided it wasn't worth the hassle of getting a taxi to Playa del Carmen, and there was nothing close by that we could walk to. All in all, we just felt that a lot of little things were overlooked at this place, and for the amount of money we paid, there shouldn't be that many oversights or an automatic defensive response to an issue that guests bring up.

The restaurant is sectioned off into three seating areas where they serve each cuisine. Second: this chef tries to be \"fancy\" and ruins EVERYTHING.

We chose the Hotelito side just to see what the difference was compared to the Infinity suites. The Hotelito rooms are much smaller with no place to sit except the bed and no tub or jacuzzi. The Infinity suites are far superior. The great thing I liked about the older side is the huge balcony. It has a beach bed and a table with two folding chairs but no loungers. The balcony is screened off with the cotton netting so it was quite private on the secnd floor. We usually choose the upper floors so we can sleep with the windows open. Unfortunately this year there were a lot of mosquitos which bother my wife but not myself. I slept outside most nights. They fogged along the beach twice a day but a lot of folks were being bitten. It seems there was a lot of rain the previous weeks. This is a really great hotel with good food and very helpful staff with pretty good english. The only drawback is that the dinner menus are limited if you are there more than a week. The hotel was fully booked for the nine days we were there but there was no problem getting seated for dinner of finding cover on the beach. This is a quiet place with the only entertainment being in Rick's Bar every night. One night was bingo night which may be too much excitement for some. The nearest neighbor is over a mile away so the only noise is the marina next door. It wasn't very busy this year with the only really annoying thing being a new very noisy boat for the parasailers. The Captain Memo snorkel and sailing tour I read about online is about a fifeteen minute walk up the beach and sounds like it is worth the walk. In reading some of the other reviews I had to wonder if some people aren't confusing this hotel with the other El Dorado hotels. One reviewer complained the staff didn't know what an egg white omelet was but it is featured on the menu of the only place open for breakfast. One improvement this year is the the beach grill is open every day for lunch with a differt theme each day.. The breakfast and lunch service is improved this year while the dinner waiters are still very good. The threatened dress code is not enforced but nobody was too casual so I guess it works. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a quiet getaway wuth no buffets, armbands and lineups.

Both the staff and the guests are so friendly and it felt like our own little community even though we were only there a short amount of time. There are only 72 suites and you won't have a problem ever getting into one of the three restaurants (Italian, Japanese and Mexican/Caribbean) or finding a cozy spot by the pool or ocean. There are an abundance of canopy beds overlooking both the pools and the ocean. I can tell you there was a wide variety of ala carte options at all three restaurant areas for dinner and the Mexico/Caribbean area was open for both lunch and breakfast and offered great options as well. I can tell you that we definitely never went hungry. We ordered room service one morning and that was very nice and prompt. We had a honeymoon suite that was decorated very modern yet warm. The view was amazing and we overlooked both the ocean and the vast jungle/mangroves right from our balcony. The beds were super comfy as well. The beach was by far the best I\u2019ve seen so far and very well kept. We particularly liked that fact that we could walk 45 minutes down the beach until coming to another resort. I highly recommend the walk at around 8 in the morning. It\u2019s very calm and peaceful. It\u2019s also very convenient that the Maroma Marina is right next door.

As soon as you arrive after a long day of travel, you are greeted with a glass of champagne and the exhaling can begin. This property is a boutique resort located on a Maroma Beach just north of Playa del Carmen. If you are looking for an adults only place without a lot of nightlife on the property, this is the place. It is so tranquil and was just the place to alleviate stress. The beach was featured on the Discovery Channel as one of the top ten in the world. It is pretty incredible. It is shielded by a huge reef and the waves are very gentle. I recommend walking to the Marina area -- just a few feet away for a wider beach and better swimming area. The three restaurants on site were fabulous and they are all a la carte -- no buffets. You can also arrange to have dinner by candlelight on the beach which is incredibly romantic (don't forget mosquito repellant). The service was absolutely phenomenal. I travel at least a dozen times per year and have never experienced such fantastic customer service. The staff are professional, friendly, and eager to make your escape pleasurable. It really seems like the hotel chain treats their employees well and it is reflected in their overall service. It is an all-inclusive facility and tips are not required, but we did some tipping and observed others providing tips here and there. It was hard not to when the service was so great. Usually, a couple of dollars at a lunch/dinner meal and maybe a dollar or two after a few drinks. 20 pesos seemed to work well as we traveled around too (just under $2) -- it was good to have 20-peso and dollar bills handy. The server at dinner on the beach received a bit more. We had a great experience with Carlos, one of the waiters. They rotate around so you can meet him at one of the restaurants during the evenings. Our room was wonderful. We arrived and originally paid for an \"ocean-front\" room. However, we were behind one of the bars (had a peek of the ocean thru the trees, the bar, the pool) which we didn't like because we could hear all conversations going on at the bar and the pool from the balcony. This was probably the most difficult part of the trip -- getting settled into the room, but it all worked out just perfectly. We were able to upgrade to a Honeymoon Suite on the third floor with a spectacular view of the ocean and it was 2-3x the size of the other room. We did pay an extra $80 per night for this room, but it was totally worth it! There are so many activities in the area, it is difficult to choose. There is a travel desk on the property and Luis is available to help with tickets and advice.

Within 1-2 days the staff knew your name and remembered our preferences for drinks, breakfast foods, etc. Food is a big step up from other all inclusives where my wife and I have stayed.

Marina next door was very handy without interfering with the enjoyment of the resort. I was advised that the massages available at the Marina were less expensive than the resort itself. By the way, the Marina not only included the ususal water sports but also included ATV and other activities. The \"sand whales\" that are positioned 50-100 yards offshore have build up the sand to the point that you can literally walk to the \"sand whales\" but deep enough that you can swim to them as well. If you are interested in seeing fish without paying for a snorkelling tour take along swim goggles and just explore around the sand whales. Mosquitos are a problem near dawn and dusk but they do fog the area on many morning to keep them tamped down a bit,(you are on the edge of a mangrove swamp)!

Their English is terrific (which we are thankful for since over the past 9 years we still have not learned Spanish as many times as we promised ourselves we would), even the cleaning staff spoke very well. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are so comfortable, this is the first time in over 9 years I have actually slept a full night in Mexico because everywhere else I've stayed (including El Dorado Royale and Seaside) the beds have been too hard!

There is the Marina next door and although with all of the boats and motorcraft around you would think it would disturb everyone along the beach but I must say we hardly noticed them unless we walked down to that area. The food was good, won't say great but out of the three El Dorado's it's the best. However, do NOT order the 5 spice Duck in the Asian restaurant - it's scary or the Shrimp Tempura plate either unless you are looking to have a heart attack on deep fried EVERYTHING. Besides those two dishes the food was really nice - make sure you try your room service too! It's included in your stay and you can still go to a restaurant after if you're still hungry. The grounds are very nicely kept, keep in mind that typical Mexican smell is there just as it is at every resort in Mexico - some days worse than others but you get used to it.

Before arriving at the El Dorado Maroma, we spent 3 nights at the El Dorado Royale and I wrote a separate review on our stay there. We travelled with another couple who are good friends of ours. Our transfers through Lomas Travel picked us up promptly at noon and when we arrived at the El Dorado Maroma, which is 10 minutes south of the El Dorado Royale, we were greeted with chilled scented face cloths and a glass of sparkling wine. We had booked Swimup Jacuzzi Jr. Suites and were offered a complimentary upgrade to the Honeymoon Suite. They offered to show us both rooms and let us decide which room we wanted after seeing both. Although the Honeymoon Suite was beautiful with an incredible view of the resort and the ocean, we didn\u2019t want to have to walk up the flights of steps to get to our room and preferred the convenience of the Swimup Suites. Wow \u2013 the rooms were beautiful and large! There was plenty of closet space with a safe, but it would have been more convenient to have a combination lock on the safe rather than a key. There was a Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, a toilet in a separate room, a glass enclosed shower with a separate door leading out to the Aguas del Amour shower (private outdoor shower). The water pressure here was good and we used this shower during our entire stay. For some reason, the floor of the indoor shower would get wet every time we used the outdoor shower and we couldn\u2019t figure out how the water was getting into the indoor shower. There was also a double sink vanity in the bathroom but no drawers or cabinets to put our things in. I found that to be very inconvenient to have to keep my things in a suitcase on the floor because there was no place to put anything. Our room also had a small table and two chairs with a bowl of fresh fruit and there was a living room area with two small sofas. Our sliding glass door led to our terrace where there was a comfortable bed and pillows, and two chairs. The only thing missing was a ceiling fan which would have been wonderful to make it a little more comfortable to sit out there. The patio did get slippery when it was wet so we had to be careful. We always felt completely safe in keeping our back door open slightly when we went into the pool. If we closed it all the way it would lock automatically and we were told that everybody keeps them open a little. The water in the lazy river was very warm. We loved the convenience of being able to step into the water and swim to the main pool. The landscaping at this resort was so beautiful! The size of this resort made it the perfect place to get to know some of the other guests because we saw them every day, and we loved the atmosphere of this resort. While we loved staying at the El Dorado Royale, we felt that it was just too large to get around to the restaurants by having to take golf carts everywhere and the El Dorado Maroma really suited us. There are two pools at the El Dorado Maroma, the \u201cquiet pool\u201d and the main pool, and they both had swimup bars. The bartenders were excellent and would make you anything you wanted. Every day there was a new drink special. There was a table by the quiet pool where two local girls were selling beautiful hand-painted items and I brought a couple of pieces home with me. There was a small gift shop at the resort but I didn\u2019t buy anything there. Maroma beach was beautiful. We swam in the water for awhile but I can\u2019t comment on the beach butler service because we didn\u2019t stay on the beach for long. We did see the beach butlers walking around constantly bringing people drinks, etc. One of my favorite things about the El Dorado Maroma was the daily lunches they prepared on the beach. Every day was a different theme \u2013 Mexican, fish market, bbq, paella, etc. The day after we arrived, a wedding group came and some of the people were being really loud, even bringing a radio with them and playing it by the pool. They announced that they were there for a wedding and even apologized in advance for their behavior because they planned to be loud. The hotel management was really good about talking to them and asking them to respect the other guests. My husband and I had scheduled a sky massage in one of the over water bungalows. It turned out to be a big disappointment. There was hammering and sawing noise that could be heard from the nearby marina, noise from waiters that were setting up tables and dinnerware for the candlelight dinner on the beach, and some of the people from the wedding group were being really loud in the quiet pool which is a couple of yards away from where the massages were being done. I think the massage would have been wonderful were it not for all the noise distractions. Since it was our 20th anniversary, my husband and I also had scheduled a candlelight dinner on the beach. We specifically requested two separate tables at the same time for us and our friends, but when we got there, they had a table for 4 set up. We told them that we requested two separate tables, so my husband and I were brought to another table for two on the beach. It was really windy on the beach and we would have preferred to be seated at one of the tables that had some of the shades that provide shelter from the wind. There is really not much in the way of nightlife at the El Dorado Maroma. We went to Rick\u2019s Bar one night but it was pretty quiet. They had a pool table, a bar and a couple of seating areas. They played a game show called \u201cBonk\u201d and my husband and girlfriend participated. My friend won a bottle of wine. We really enjoyed meeting the people that work at the El Dorado Maroma, especially Katarina and Gaby. Everyone that worked here was so friendly, and no matter who you walked by (gardeners, maids, waiters), they always said \u201chola\u201d. We had read about a local guy, Captain Memo (memmo), from other people who posted reviews about him on Trip Advisor. He takes people out on his sailboat for a private snorkeling tour and it sounded like a good deal so we tried to find him. We walked for about a mile down the beach and saw what we thought was his sailboat in the water but he was nowhere to be found. It didn\u2019t look like we would be able to find him so we started to head back to our hotel. While walking back down the beach, we passed a guy carrying a water bottle on his shoulder so we asked him if he knew where we could find Captain Memo \u2013 it turned out to be him! We spoke to him for a few minutes and arranged for him to take us sailing the next day. We were so glad we did. What a nice guy he is! I\u2019m really not that good at snorkeling and as soon as Captain Memo sensed that I was having trouble, he quickly came over to me, took me by the hand and had me snorkel alongside him until I felt comfortable. He explained how it\u2019s much better to snorkel in a smaller group rather than going out on the boats that take 60-80 people because it scares all the fish away and you get a much better experience in a smaller group. He was so knowledgeable about the area and we really enjoyed listening to his stories and spending our time with him. He charged $35 per person and it was well worth it! He has snorkeling equipment on his boat for guests to use. I posted pictures of him and his sailboat. We had an incredible time on this trip! I would highly recommend the El Dorado Maroma if you\u2019re looking for a romantic, low-key experience in a beautiful environment with top notch service and food. This is definitely someplace I hope to be able to return to again one day!", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McKinney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIt felt as if we were the only people there...the beach is a corona commercial.\u201d", "Author": "luv2travel23", "ReviewID": "UR48004062", "Content": "Staff is amazing, after one week we knew they by name, great beach, great snorkeling & at the marina next to the resort, they offer fishing, sailing, diving, etc, our group dove & went on the atv's in the combo w/ jet skis deal which was a good value.

The resort, the people, the food, was all incredible. The first day we were there we started with lunch and a dip in the pool while waiting for our room (and it was worth the wait). The room had an outdoor shower, and infinity pool on the deck, a jacuzzi, and an awesome view of the ocean. It was a short walk to the pool and the beach. The resort overall is small and cozy, with both pools within a 2 minute walk from your room, and the entire resort being about a 5 minute walk. There is also a marina next door, but we didn't use any of the services there... heard the spa services there were much cheaper. We got couples massages twice while we were there, once on the sky massage over the ocean, which was so relaxing and romantic. The other time we got foot reflexology massages in the spa and it was also very nice. The accommodations at the spa were nice, the people were friendly, and the treatments were very nice (I've had better, but I've had much worse too. Maybe a 4 on a scale of 1 to 5). Alma ran the spa... we did a little chatting and got some good deals on our treatments. The first night we were there was a feast in celebration of Mexican Independence day. The dinner was fabulous, as was the Mariachi band. Robyn, the head of the restaurant, took very good care of us, knew us by name by the second night, and took care of any issues we had, excelente! The food was very good at that meal, and was a 4 or 5 course dinner. The breakfasts we had each morning, either at the restaurant or in our room, had plenty of food, were delicious, and the fresh-squeezed pineapple juice mixed with cranberry hit the spot. \"Super\" Mario took care of us at breakfast with help from others, and knew us by name and spoke to us in passing at the resort. The lunches on the beach were a nice variety, the paella was excellent, and the taco bar was great as well. We unfortunately missed the BBQ on the beach, as we were snorkeling at the time. Each night dinner was an affair of several courses, with extra food being brought out that we didn't order, and Carlos and Ferdnando taking care of us in the main restaurants. Twice there were special dinners in the Sabores, the restaurant that is typically for breakfast and lunch. On the beach, Xavier took good care of us, spending quite a bit of time with me helping me brush up on my rusty spanish speaking. Our room was nicely cared for, cleaned each morning when we were out at the pool, then again freshened up with candles and turn down service while we were at dinner. The Yoga on the sky deck was nice, although we only tried it once. Every person on staff there got to know us by name, spoke to me in english and/or spanish (as I know a little spanish), and made us feel special. The beach was beautiful, the resort is very quiet (don't come here if you are looking for a party 24/7). Only complaint is there should be a little more selection for dinner. Even with the three restaurants it felt like by the end of the week that I wanted something different. Also, the mosquitos were bad some nights, and we didn't realize until the last night that if you tell the staff they will spray on your patio to make sure you can sit out at night after dinner. We tipped each meal (just 20 to 40 pesos) and I could tell the service got even better as the week went along. I believe the staff took good care of everyone, but I could tell that they were appreciative of the small tips we gave. Another tip. Visit Memo to go snorkeling. He is about 2 miles up the beach (go left when facing the ocean) and has a sailboat tied up. He isn't normally there during the day but if you go in the morning before 9 or after about 5:30 he should be there. His sailboat is the \"8 Dwarfs\" or something like that. It is a single mast boat, and he only takes 1 or 2 couples (3 max) out for snorkeling and a sail. He has been in the area for like 30 years. He is cheap, about $35 per person for a 3 hour sail. His attitude is indicative of the entire resort area, laid back, relaxed, not worried, not in a hurry, and friendly. We sailed with him and two ladies who were just walking down the beach and he showed up incredible sights in the coral reef. He even helped my wife who had a leaky mask and some other equipment problems, swimming back to the boat and bringing her new gear. He has all the gear you may need, or you can bring your own. We actually spent two days with him, the second being sight seeing, and it was incredible. He made our trip even better. http://www.captainmemosadventures.info/ is a site I've set up just to help you find out where he is and collect comments about his snorkeling trips. I just did it because it was simple and Memo gave us an incredible day of fun. I hope it helps. On our last day, a few of the waiters and other staff came by to say bye to us, and Mauricio took a picture of us with his IPhone and sent it to me.

I am a travel agent who has gone on site inspections of the Maroma many times and actually stayed there in May with my family. That trip was centered around work and I went this time strictly for pleasure. I can tell you that is what we recieved. I had the anticipation of a wonderful and relaxing trip and I recieved that three fold. We were greeted by Paty and a glass of champagne, a welcome home greeting, a nice orientation of what to expect and escorted to our rooms by Jackie ( a doll of a lady). She is such a delight and each time you see her she is wearing a beautiufl smile, whether it be in the office or on the beach assisting people with whatever they need! We quickly looked at the incredible view we had, taking in the most gorgeous beach you can hope to see. Pristinely clean. They have gentlemen cleaning at least twice a day. We went down to start enjoying the resort and met up with Lopez for our first dinner. He is an excellent waiter and again is always wearing a smile We had our first incredible meal with our friends who were completely impressed with the service and the quality of food. I have to admit, one of the reasons I wanted them to go with us was to get someone else's opinion of my favorite resort. After dinner, we went back to our rooms, which were impeccably clean and sat on the balcony and enjoyed our champagne watching the sun set. The next morning I decided to order room service to check the quality, speed and temperature of the food. It was delivered precisely at 8:30 as requested and was incredible. I could go into the whole explanation of each of the foods, but you would get bored with my review:-) It was delivered in a wicker basket by wait staff, that even though he had to cart it up 4 floors, was friendly and smiling. Our breakfast was lovely while looking at the turquoise of the Caribbean. Fresh orange juice, eggs cooked to perfection, a plate of wonderful fruit and freshly baked rolls. We all went down to the beach and Jackie met us with fresh juice, clean towels and asked if we would need anything else. What more could you want while laying in the lap of luxury? We observed several guests recieving a sky massage and the green eyed envy of jealousy took over. I signed up for the full body exfoliation. 50 minute massage and a moisturizing facial. They were having a great sale on the package, so it was an incredible deal. I can honestly say the spa is impeccable and Daniel was excellent. I had the exfoliation and then went out to the sky massage for my massage. I felt like a princess already and then went back to the spa for my facial. The day was set! I could not have been more relaxed. We went out to the Palapa where they were serving bar-b-que. It was excellent. Afterwards we ran into Gaby, the Sales Manager and Catarina! They are forever checking with everyone to make sure that all is good. Both ladies go the extra mile to make sure that you are getting the best of your experience at the resort. Cesar is wonderful at the bar and will will create whatever you have in mind and Xavier a great waiter. All of the restaurants are overseen by Robin. I can't say enough about the extent he will go to. I mentioned my friends would love an all seafood dinner and although the night was going to be a fiesta, he presented us with the most incredible \"made for us\" seafood dinner. I have come to believe their motto is \"nothing is impossible\"! Gabriella, our waitress from May was thrilled to see us and it felt great to again, be remembered. One night they had a Soprano sing and I have to admit her voice brought tears to many while enjoying dinner. She is incredible. Another night they had a Mariachi band and they were equally as good in a completely different way. So to wrap this up before writing a novel, I will say. It is the perfect resort for a get-a-way for friends and family. It is romance personified for those on a honeymoon. Weddings...ahhhhh, this is the place! I spoke to many guests and did not recieve one negative comment. You ask, you recieve. I give Karisma 5 Stars for their efforts to make sure that all of their properties, El Dorado Royale, El Dorado Casitas, El Dorado Seasides, El Dorado Maroma, Azul Beach and Azul Sensatori are truly 5 Star resorts!

We took a Lomas shuttle from the airport, about 45 mins to the resort. Upon arrival, we were greeted with the cool towels and sparkling wine while they told us about the resort. Our room (infiniti/jacuzzi suite) wasn't quite ready so we had some drinks and snacks down at the pool. They asked if there was an occasion for our visit and we mentioned it was for our anniversary. The infiniti pool suites are very large, with new modern furniture. Everything was in perfect working order and well maintained. On your private balcony there are chairs and a bed for lounging and your own small private pool(!). Water temp was perfect - we used it a lot. We were on the second floor where the ocean view was mostly blocked by palm trees, next time we'd probably aim for 3rd or 4th floor. In the morning we'd go out and lounge on the beach - there were always plenty of lounge chairs available, even though some mornings we didn't get out there until 11am. Drink service on the beach was very attentive. They have a lunch area right off the beach that we ate at most days -- just watch out for the habanero sauce at the salad bar that looks like ranch dressing! The beach was soft and clean. You walk out into the water, and it slowly slopes off to some artificial breakers a hundred yards off the beach. We often would take our drinks out and just relax in the calm water. For a long beach walk, just head north past the small marina and there is huge stretch of empty beach. The three restaurants all have very good food & wine, and we also had a beachfront candlelit dinner on one night which was terrific. Be warned tho - bring bug spray because at night they do have mosquitos. They have a great little spa, and my wife talked me into a couples massage they do at a little hut down over the water , and while that is not really my thing, it was very relaxing. The service was a perfect blend of attentive but not obtrusive -- with the waitstaff being friendly, helpful, and funny. A couple times when we came back to our room at night, they had put together towel sculptures for us, and sprinkled flower petals on our bed. On our last night there, after dinner we came back to the room and found a bubble bath waiting for us in the jacuzzi, with a flower arrangement done in the foam!

The pools were great, the drinks continued to flow, food was good, entertainment at night was adequate with some excellent talent emerging and a really fun casino night. Daytime events were slim. I would recommend the catamaran day trip tour out of Cancun for a day of sailing, snorkeling, shopping and dining for a very nice time to break up your stay at the resort.

I'm very critical and I was pleasantly surprised by the El Dorado. Beautiful, quiet resort and the service was AMAZING. If you want to be waited on go here. The resort was only about 30% full and I think the staff outnumbered the guests at least 2 to 1. We had a basic room and it was beautiful. The swim up rooms were even nicer but we saw no need to upgrade. The purpose of our trip was so we could \"relax\". My husband just wanted to chill out and read and be waited on. I need a little more interaction. It was too quiet for me at first but I got used to it and fell into sync. If you are looking for a constant party this may not be the place for you but if you are looking to meet some great people, eat great food, be waited on in paradise then this is your place. The Food: I thought the food was fantastic for an all inclusive but it you are staying longer than a week , I can see how it could get a little old BUT they will make what ever you want off the menu if you just ask for it. The lunches on the beach were incredibly good. The Beach: It was very nice, white sand. not very wide but was extremly quiet. There was no problem getting lounge chairs or even cabanas with beds overlooking the beach. There are barriers out to protect the beach and I assume it's to try to get some beach back after the hurricane (was it Gustav?). I like to be active on the beach and this was the only drawback. You can't really windsurf or play in the waves but that being said.... I would still go back to this hotel/beach. I had a great time snorkeling right at the resort. There were stingrays, barracudas, conch and the best place to view all this was at the hotel's beach. We took the snorkel gear up the beach and snorkeled (towards Secrets) and there was a lot more to see at our hotel over the seaweed where the wildlife likes to hide. The spa: My husband and I both got massages. It was really expensive and I've had massages all over the world. My husband liked his. Mine was not worth the money so unless it's part of your package skip the massage. You might try next door at the marina since their massages are about 1/3 the cost and it's literally a 1 minute walk on the beach from the resort.

After six nights at El Dorado Maroma we found our new private paradise! We stayed in the dead of summer following the totally silly Swine Flu scare, so occupancy was only about 50%. It felt like everywhere we turned, someone from the staff was waiting with a smile to see how they could help. No buffets here, thank goodness, only fine dining in your choice of Italian, Mexican and Asian restaurants. We especially enjoyed the ASIAN restaurant where we ended up spending four of our six evenings. Absolutely wonderful! If you go, make sure you book a newer room. They obviously have been designed for romance, which can be said for the entire resort. With less than 80 rooms, La Maroma delivers a quaint hotel experience with service very close to a Ritz Carlton without the outrageous prices. Try the swim-up rooms or the Honeymoon Suites. They include candles, oil burners, flat screen TVs and extraordinary views. We especially enjoyed the beach staff which was always there with a cool towel, a cold drink of PREMIUM alcohol and incredibly attentive service. Mess up your towel on your beach chair? Not to worry. Within minutes, someone will shake off the sand and straighten the towel. The beach beds, featuring canopies of gently moving palm fronds, set the stage for total relaxation. A beautiful beach with soft white sand where hardly a soul could be found on long walks, makes this resort even more special. And the fact that no children are allowed makes the experience extra remarkable! Let me clarify that we are in our mid-fifties and were not looking for exciting evenings. We would go to diner in casual attire, feast until about 9:30, then take in some TV in our room and play for a bit, and then gently pass out in very comfy beds. This is NOT a resort for night owls looking to party. It IS very much a resort to bring out the romance in the lives of newlyweds and those married for many years like us. We loved our first experience at La Maroma so much; we have reservations for October of this year. Twice in three months\u2026..that says it all! Caution: Some of the Honeymoon Suites are on the 4th floor and there are no elevators. If you don\u2019t want to walk off your gourmet meals up the steps each night, ask for a lower level room. Don\u2019t bother: Renting a car. No need. We never left the resort and there was nothing nearby that warranted a car rental. Don\u2019t: Get taken by greedy taxi drivers. Call ahead to the travel desk on the property and ask them to order you a private taxi.

Excellent place to go.\u201d", "Author": "nancyrlbrown", "ReviewID": "UR37270373", "Content": "I just want to say that this hotel is wonderful in every situation. I have traveled to the Cancun/Riviera Maya area many times and this hotel is by far my favorite. I have never wrote a review on trip advisor, but felt like it was my duty after hearing some other guest say they were going to post negative comments after a specific situation. When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and a cold towel........ how refreshing! We then checked in and then entered 2 doors to paradise. The hotel embraced us from the moment we arrived, with beautiful gardens everywhere and butterflies flying around us I knew we had made a great choice. We booked a Mi Hotelito suite and when my agent told me that it was beachfront she didn't lie, you are literally footsteps from the ocean and pretty much everything else at the hotel. Every employee and guest we passed would smile and say \"Hola\", everybody made us feel like they had known us for years. The staff, guest, beach, spa and restaurants were above my expectations. If you have a chance, go to the Mexican night dinner- THE BEST MEAL EVER, I could of had this dinner everynight. I could go on and on, but I don't want to sound like a broken record. Unlike elljaytraveller's review I would still reccommend this hotel for travel. Yes when we arrived we thought it was strange that the hotel had black plactic up in certain areas of the hotel, but just assumed they were working on something and didn't let it ruin our well deserved vacation. We did get caught off guard with the hurricane drill on Wendesday, but in my opinion thought the hotel handled it pretty good. We gathered our stuff and was taken to the El Dorado Royale about 10 minutes north. When we arrived to the Royale we were given a suite and was able to enjoy all the facilities there. After dinner we returned to the lobby to go back to the hotel, but was told it would be a bit longer, no problem because we went to the martini bar and had a couple of martinis. Around 9:30 we returned to our little paradise where we were all greeted by the hotel staff and singing mariachis. Some of the guest were a little upset and were saying that this whole situation ruined their vacation, I personally don't understand how they could make such a claim considering we had full access to the other hotel. Yes it was an inconveniece, but saying it ruined your whole vacation is going to far. The hotel staff went out of their way to make the best out of the situation, they even brought someone the next day to talk with us. On our way back to the room I noticed that all the black plastic was down and it read \"Clausurado\". I don't believe this means the hotel is closed even though it might seem like it because on my way to the hotel that we are at now in Cancun we stopped at a 7eleven that had the same signs posted, but they were open. If it means closed then wouldn't the 7eleven be closed?! From my understanding it has something to do with an environmental issue. I don't think the hotel is trying to hide anything, I think they are just trying to hide an eye sore and they tried to accommodate us the best way possible. I have to say \"Muchas Gracias\" to everyone at the hotel for their attention to details and their professionalism because of this I will be returning very soon. Overall I can't wait to return, we even thought about leaving here to go back to our little found paradise. The El Dorado Maroma truely is a first class hotel in all.

However, there are another 2 restaurants and 24/7 room service so there were other options made available. I would recommend this hotel for a wedding. The only complaint I had was against mother nature. The mosquitos descended upon the hotel at sunset and they were ravenous. The dead mosquitos did accumulate pretty quickly but the hotel worked furiously to get them cleaned up through out the day and night. But as quickly as they arrive, they either die or leave so it was not too much of a problem. I would try to avoid going at this time of year to avoid the mosquitos. Other than that... it was perfect.

We have been to Royale twice before, and other hotels in the area, as well. We were looking for something all-inclusive, adults-only, and small. We found it and more at Maroma. I cannot imagine a more romantic place to spend a honeymoon, anniversary, or romantic get-away. We will definitely go back. We LOVED the peacefulness and laid-back atmosphere. I know that most of Mexico is laid-back, but because we didn't have to make reservations at the restaurants, we didn't feel the need to hurry from one activity (appointment) to the next. So, if we were enjoying the pool or beach, we could just stay there as long as we wanted. The beach is wonderful--very soft sand and is swept about 4 times a day. It is quite shallow and there is nothing much to see in the water directly in front of the resort. We saw a stingray and several barracudas swimming around. I was disappointed that there were not any shells to be found. My husband and I walked along the beach in both directions. We found one really nice shell. I wasn't going looking for shells, but I do like to bring home just a few \"treasures.\" If you are into snorkeling, the activity person will take you out in a kayak to the reef (no extra charge). We missed the time we were supposed to meet her because we were just too lazy to leave the room (having room service on the terrace overlooking the ocean). We have never ordered room service before and we ordered it each morning that we were at Maroma. We actually ordered the same breakfast meal each morning, as well. The food, overall, is outstanding. If you are a wine drinker (my husband and I are not), this is definitely the place for you. We stayed in the Infinity Suite and it was the best room that we have ever had. It was spacious and lovely. We could adjust the temperature in the room to meet our needs. The tub was extra big and the outdoor shower was amazing. I never took an indoor shower. There was something about hearing the birds and feeling the warm Carribean air that was very soothing. My husband and I had the most romantic anniversary dinner over the beach by ourselves in their sky hut palapa. It was amazing. We felt as if we were the only people at the resort. It was beautifully orchestrated. Upon arriving back at the room, there were rose petals spread all over the floor and bed and a bubble bath had been drawn for us with rose petals placed in the shape of a heart. It was amazing. We were pleased to receive a very early check in (for no additional charge) and a very late check out (for $20.00 per hour). We were happy to pay it for the use of the room for just awhile longer. We thought that the spa rates were very high and only took advantage of one couple's massage on the beach. We would have had the experience again if the prices had been a little lower. The phrase that all staff used was \"My Pleasure.\" We heard this from the beach butler to the manager. We felt completely taken care of and pampered. What an experience.

We've been to many resorts in various locations and have never had the service that was provided here. From the moment we walked in, the staff made sure everything was to our liking, asked what we needed, and made sure we were comfortable. What is unique about this resort compared to others is they all take the time to introduce themselves and get to know you. They also take the time to pay attention to details, by the 3rd morning, they knew how I liked my coffee and just brought me what I needed. They knew what drinks we liked. The staff at EDM works harder than any staff I've seen. Everyone has a smile on their face and really seems to enjoy being there. The food, oh my, I'm not sure I've ever eaten so much in one week. We NEVER went hungry. They brought snacks out to the beach for you to sample different foods. There were times my husband and I weren't even hungry but we ate anyway because we didn't want to miss anything. Definitely go to the beach lunches, it's their specialty and was excellent food. The restaurants were all outstanding. It was fun trying different things each night. The resort was well kept, the sidewalks always being swept, the beach clean, and the vegetation beautiful and every part of the resort was very clean! We went kayaking out to the reef and snorkeled - highly recommended. We stayed in an infinity pool suite, ocean front view. It was chilly but fun to sit in it and just stare at the ocean. We did several activities offered by the resort; cooking class, cocktail class, salsa dancing, casino night, all of these were a blast and very relaxing. There isn't pressure to participate, but it's nice that they offer these - we enjoyed them. The beach is beautiful. They do have large \"sand bags\" out a ways to help build up the beach. Honestly, these didn't bother us at all. They were very far out and plus, we enjoyed laying out on the various sand bars soaking up the sun and enjoying a drink. The water is so calm you are not fighting the waves. There are plenty of places to sit outside and enjoy the sun or not. We never had a difficult time finding a beach chair or a beach bed. There were always towels, nice big soft ones, and even magazines, sun screen, aloe lotion, and books to chose from each morning in a basket by the beach. Seriously, I've never seen that! Massages on the beach by moonlight - heaven! We wanted a romantic, relaxing, not a care in the world vacation. That is exactly what we got for a week. We met other couples and it was fun chatting with all of them, but we also had time for just us. My husband and I usually like to go different places when we travel to see various parts of the world, but we would go back to EMD in a heartbeat!

If you are really worried, than call your MD and get a script for Tamilflu and take it with you for peace of mind. In fact, we were so reluctant to go home we almost wished that we would get the flu so we could be blissfully quarantined in Paradise, and recuperate while lounging on the beach. That said...our trip to ED Maroma was fabulous. The resort itself is lovely with coconut trees, tropical flowers, and lush greenery. The beach is pristine and peaceful with water calm enough to swim in every day and soft sand that is kind to your feet. As other posters have mentioned, the beach just past the Marina is even softer with blue water and no sandbags. We enjoyed the Marina, and watching the activities there. For the most part it was not distracting or too noisy, though one day a boat repeatedly pulled into and out of the dock and we could smell the fumes. The rooms were sufficiently luxurious for our tastes, loved the large bed with the curtains, the daily towel creatures, the outdoor shower, and the jacuzzi tub. (We were surprised with 2 flower petal, candlelight bubble baths, thank you ladies!!) The thatched roofs throughout the resort gave it a more quaint, Gilligan's Island touch that we enjoyed, especially the outdoor lunch \"Hut\" and the shady beach beds.

Having stayed at all the sister hotels: El Dorado Royale, El Dorado Seaside and Azul Beach Hotel, I was prepared for a high-quality experience, and I'm happy to report it exceeded my expectations. Rooms are GORGEOUS. If you are a honeymooner, be sure to get one of the new honeymoon suites or the infinity pool suites.

It happened to be my birthday, and the hotel prepared this amazing cake with a full decoration with my name, and personal touches. The pools were freezing, but that is a given at almost ALL hotels in Mexico as NO ONE heats their pools. The sea was perfect, though, and I did take some nice swims. This resort is NOT for everyone. If you need wild activities during the day, drinking contests, limbo, screaming 'activity' directors, and a wild disco, do NOT go to this resort. If, however, you are seeking peace, simplicity, SPACE (no hotels nearby and a vast beach), ROMANCE, and a perfect little wedding chapel for a wedding, then you have found your paradise! HOT points: Go to their 'disco' and enjoy some very intimate entertainment. DO NOT be surprised by dirt and debris in your infinity pools. This is not a contained environment, and winds blow, birds fly over, and nature happens...and sometimes it happens in your little pool. Just call to have it cleaned and they will accommodate this.

We were in a swim-out suite--quick access to the swim up bar!! The room was clean, spacious with an excellent view of the ocean. The outdoor bed was very relaxing. The ocean was very warm at this time of the year ( first part of April). We took a kayak/snorkel tour out to the coral reef with Bernice. It was quite an adventure!?!?, well worth it ( and free). The Marina next door had all kinds of activities from sea-doo/snorkel tours to parasailing, to horseback riding. The beach area was always well maintained & groomed regularly. There were always lots of available beach beds. We met 3 great couples (from Minnesota, Chicago & Denver). The resort provided a great atmosphere for both romance & / or socializing if you are so inclined. The sky massage was great,. Food was very good ( I would avoid the seafood pasta dish in the Italian restaurant), as it was a bit rubbery. We did have a bit of a septic/sewer smell in/outside our front door--understandable given the property. It was only in certain areas though. Not a big problem. The lunch at the outdoor barbecue area was always very good (especially the red snapper and the paella). The resort was very well kept, clean with beautiful grounds.

The beach is even softer sand at this resort, with the best wading beach we've ever seen. We stayed in the newer section room 301. It is the first room on the floor nearest the sidewalk. So we got served drinks right to our soom overlooking the lazy river. That was great for getting some shade in the afternoon just chillin.

We found an ebayer named chuck last year while searching for deals. You can save 30%,40%, and even 50% off what the resort advertises if you use his service. I was hesitant at first because you pay him a nominal fee (less than $200) and you use his privalages of being an Exotic Travel Member. That also gets you envited to special dinners like the around the world in six courses, and the gala where mariachi plays for you while you eat appetizers and sip cocktails, then you are fed a special 5 course meal with a violin player!

The food comments are correct so we won't comment on that..read other reviews. The room compares favorably to almost any other hotel...the service too though there were nights for some reason with no turndown. In the new complex the buildings start with the 300 buidling (which we were in) and as you go from 300 to the 800 building to get further away from the ocean view. If you are on the first or second floor probably you will only overlook the pool or trees and pool so you need to be on the third floor...probably 331 or 332 is best rather than to walk up one more floor.

Ruth found the doctor, arranged for a cab and got a SUNDAY appointment...she saved two days of the vacation. All that aside golf.....we played Iberostar and at Mayakoba. They are both extremely expensive...Mayakoba has two holes on the water, there are NO rangers so if you get a group in front that is truly playing outside of customarily rules (at mayakoba we had a fivesome in front) that we had to skip a hole to play with any rhythm. But the hotel was fine, small, quiet. Be careful of which month you come down...March is known for \"windy\" and I would say there was a constant 35MPH wind which is unpleasant sitting on the beach and creates a lot of wind noise in the rooms themselves. The gym which I used every day is MINIMAL..one bike, two treadmills, two or three machines but sadly no one there seemed to care about working out so I had the gym to myself every morning at 8 am or earlier.

After visiting Jamaica for many years, this was our first in Mexico and we would definitely return. Only about a 40 minute drive from airport, the resort is on a section of Maroma beach where there is not another resort within view. Service from upon arrival thru our departure was excellent all around. When we were shown to our room on the second floor, it had a lovely view of the ocean, however, was directly over the bar area. We were really looking for privacy, and Jackie graciously showed us to another room at the end near the Chapel. It may have been slightly smaller with no ocean view, but was exactly what we wanted. The bed was big and comfy, and we loved the daybed out on the balcony. With regard to the restaurants, the food was always fresh, well-prepared and tasty. Some previous reviews thought the proportions were small, but we did not feel that to be the case. I found the impeccable wait staff (in particular Alfonso and Pedro) to be extremely gracious and willing to feed you as much or as little as you wanted. Same for the bartenders. If you wanted more tequila in your Margarita, all you had to do was ask. The beach was beautiful, but as other reviewers have mentioned, not a \"swimming\" beach. If you want waves and bodysurfing, you have to walk past the marina quite a ways to where the reef does not offer as much protection. And Maroma is a great walking beach! You can walk for miles along white powdery sand. One of my favorite things are the daybeds scattered along the beach and pool areas! I am not someone who can sit in the sun all day, but I love the beach. Those fabulous covered daybeds gave me great protection from the sun when I desired, but allowed me to enjoy being on the beach all day. Plus, Caterina and Jackie were great about delivering food, magazines, or whatever else you needed. If you are looking to unwind, relax and stay in a beautiful, small all-inclusive with a fantastic staff, this is the place.

Again, I was not expecting MASA or anything but the summer rolls were not edible and sushi was barely OK. The Italian dinner at Sabores did have a lovely opera singer but the pasta was mushy and overcooked.

I had the most wonderful relaxing time in this beautiful hotel and experienced all inclusive gourmet food for the first time. Have to say, well done to the excellent General Manager, Alfredo Santamaria, who is very personable and knows how to deliver a top class service. The staff are so friendly and work very hard to please guests. All of the staff appeared to really enjoy working at EDM and that is a good indication and reflection of the excellent managerial skills of the top man, Alfredo Santamaria. Having been fortunate to stay for three weeks at the hotel, I can honestly say that the quality of food, housekeeping, restaurant service and friendliness of the staff remained a high standard throughout my whole stay. Being a solo traveller, I was made to feel most welcome and treated with the utmost courtesy. My Room. I stayed in the new section, Room 302 which is a swim-up jacuzzi room. It is truly amazing and one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in and I have travelled widely across the world. So clean and spacious with a fantastic comfy bed. Slept like a baby! The room is very close to the beach and has clear views of the ocean beyond the landscaped areas. Isabelle kindly helped to secure me this room which was my personal preference. The bathroom has inside and outside showers, numerous thick soft white bath towels, and decorated to a high specification. Plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. Lovely large veranda with a double bed, chairs and sunloungers. The room is very clean, spacious and neutral colours to add to the relaxing ambience. Restaurants EDM has a choice of three restaurants, Japanese, Italian (Milo) and Mexican/world (Sabores). Breakfast was always delightful in Sabores restaurant. Maurice and Flor always greeted me with their friendly faces. The menu offers a good selection of choices and after a few days the waiters and waitresses got to know what my usual choices were. Everyone was so pleasant. Maurice who is in charge of Sabores is very professional and competent. He speaks very good English and told me about Holbox island where there are nice sea shells. On my last day he kindly gave me some of the shells he had collected on his last visit to the island with his family. What a lovely kind person! I loved to eat in the Italian restaurant, Milo, at night because Italian food is my favourite but I also tried the Japanese and Sabores at night too. The lady concierge was very polite and helpful (her name escapes me). My special evenings were the Italian night on a Thursday when a lady opera singer entertained the guests in Sabores. She had the sweetest voice and so powerful. Excellent! I was lucky enough to hear her sing 3 times! My only disappointment was on my last evening when a small group of rude drunken guests (who had just arrived at the hotel) spoilt the Italian evening by swearing and talking too loud during the operas singer's performance. It was most annoying and regrettable that adults in their late 30's/early 40's had no respect for other guests in the restaurant who were trying to enjoy the performance. I also experienced the Moonlit Sky meal. A 5 course lobster meal with champagne, candles, the stars and the sound of the sea lapping beneath. A truly memorable night! Beach BBQ's Great for lunch and sarongs allowed. My favourite was the Mexican BBQ. Freshly prepared food on the beach, strong drinks and Mexican music playing. The food was excellent as always. The Guacomole scruptious. Beach The beach is amazing but there are no sea shells! I missed collecting sea shells as a momento. Lots of places to relax and enjoy watching the pelicans diving for fish. Unfortunately, a number of guests reserved beds with towels early in the morning but then never used them. Slightly irritating especially if guests have no intention of using the beds during the day. Why earmark them? I enjoyed long walks on the beach for miles with the sea breeze in my face. Jackeline, Catarina, Patricia and Monica These young 'Girls' are always busy and working hard to make sure the guests are happy. Jackeline and Catarina are the happiest of people. I was so pleased when Nachos returned home and Catarina could stop crying after thinking he was lost forever. Excursions The hotel is so peaceful and relaxing that it can be extremely difficult to prise yourself away for sightseeing. I went to Tulum (very interesting) and Xcaret (wonderful experience). Also took the shuttle bus to Playa Del Carmen a couple of times to do some shopping. Found an amazing 'real Mexican amber' shop that also had other precious Mexican stones for sale. The amber was truly fascinating and the owner very knowledgable about amber. Final note Do your research before choosing the EDM. It is a top class, peaceful, relaxing and extremely well run hotel for discerning travellers who like to eat gourmet food. If you like 'fast food', oversized portions, noisy music, getting drunk and having no respect for fellow guests, I suggest you find another hotel on this planet. EDM is for people who appreciate the finer things in life and enjoy top quality. If you want to recharge your batteries in a superb hotel with exceptional friendly staff that will make your stay memorable then EDM is the place to stay. I will definitely be returning in the New Year and hope Alfredo Santamaria is still there managing this excellent small hotel which is a hidden gem on the Riviera Maya.

The staff is very accomodating but not smothering you. We were upgraded to an Infinity Suite Room and was very pleased with the view that we were given. The rooms are huge! Best part was the balcony - just sitting out there in the mornings and evenings were very peaceful. The other \"best\" was the outdoor shower! I could have stayed out there for hours. My wife did not agree - and as the week went on and talking with others it seemed to be a \"man\" thing - most of the husbands really enjoy the outdoor shower. The grounds are beautiful and always being worked on. The reason we chose EDM was for the reason that it was quiet and secluded but also was located in an area that would allow us to do other things off site if we wanted without too much driving time. We ended up only doing a few things off site because we found the beach and resort so relaxing and that is what we did - I usually get buggy and have to be always moving but boy did this place but me in a differnt state of mind. Totaly away from the rest of the world. It took me 4 days to read 1 magazine. Between doozing off and watching the pellicans dive in the ocean to catch fish - the days were spent just relaxing. Most people were couples, some 2 generation family groups, most between 35 and 60. Not a party place at all. Very relaxed! If you enjoy walking hand in hand with the one you love on the beach this is the place. You can walk for miles along the beach to the north. How romantic does that get? The food was very good. We tried all of the restaurants but enjoyed the Japanese one the most. Towards the end of the week my wife just wanted some (as she put it) \"normal\" food. So we stayed in and ordered bacon cheese burgers and fries from room service. That is what is great about the food at this resort. They have wonderful restaurants but also a great room service - 24hours - and as we learned you don't have to follow the menu. Anything that we wanted they would prepare it for us. We are not huge party people but found the bar staff very nice. We enjoyed going to the \"Old\" pool side for a drink before dinner. Antonio was super!!! The feel between the old and new sides are so different. Both very good but just very different.

We decided that there was no way we could allow this to happen to us. The resort refused to provide any concessions for our inconvenience stating that the resort was completely booked. Apparently, the people allowed to book the wedding and have kids on the \"adults only\" resort took precedent over all other previous reservations.

They are still finishing up changing room 216 to a wellness suite, but we only heard a bit of hammering for a few minutes one day. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. We had a choice of 5 different kinds of pillows and aromatherapies. There was fresh fruit and soft drinks and beer in the mini-bar. Fantastic view of the sunrise from the beach bed on the balcony. The beach is beautiful, with white sands and aqua blue water like you see on all of the postcards for paradise. We never had any problem getting a chair or a beach bed at any time of day. The water is shallow at the resort, but you can walk north for deeper water and some waves. The staff came around frequently to bring drinks. They even brought around snacks on trays during the day (quesadillas, ice cream). On one day when it was chilly and we were all wrapped up in beach towels, they came around with cappuccinos! The marina next door has a great beach. I occasionally heard a jet ski or a party boat, but rarely was even aware of any activity there. They are almost finished building the first presidential suite. There was no noise at all, as the exterior is done. We got Caterina to bring us through the suite for a look, and it is going to be beautiful. It is a 2-story \u201chouse\u201d, with private pool, 2 balconies, Jacuzzi. Will have a butler and a chef. They are planning to build a few more of the presidential suites. We also asked to tour a room in the new section, and one of the new wellness rooms (will be done in a couple of weeks).

We\u2019d never done yoga before, but the teacher was great, and the surroundings were so beautiful. We went to the gym the first 2 days. It was very small, but equipment was in good conditions (2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 bike, 2 upper body machines, some free weights). Hardly anyone used the gym, and after 2 days, we gave in to vacation mode and did not return! They have some kayaks and snorkels/masks that guests can use. The staff can help you arrange for tours/activities outside of the resort. The spa was small and a bit pricey. We decided one day to try a facial and massage, and were able to schedule it with only 30 minutes advance notice. It was very nice. They have a steam room and sauna that you can use at no extra charge, but you have to let them know 30 minutes in advance so they can warm it up. We enjoyed the evenings at Ricks. They had a Super Bowl party there. There was a very good duet (singer and guitar player) 3 nights, and a small band 2 nights. There was a limited selection of music before the live music -- will bring my Ipod next time. It was never crowded, and we got up and danced every night. We even got the bartender, Cesar, out on the dance floor. Ricks was never crowded -- most folks seem to turn in early. Have read about mosquitos on other postings. We never saw any. I had 2 small bug bites during the week, never used any insect repellent. It was rather cool and windy the week we were there, which may have kept the bugs away. We also did not have a problem with seaweed, which has been mentioned on previous posts. Overall, we had a wonderful vacation, could have easily spent another week there.

We were checked in by personal concierge Edder, who had us on our way to our room in just a few minutes after a brief tour of the hotel property. When we entered our room we were immediately relaxed by the aromatherepy and great infinity pool room. After unpacking we went down to the beach where they were having a cookout featuring tacos and other mexican goodies. The cookouts on the beach everyday featured really fantastic foods from barbeque to tacos to seafood. Everything they grilled was fantastic. The pools were very well kept and the swim up bars were staffed by some of the best bartenders we have ever met. They were always cheerful and would make any drink we requested. We had a very enjoyable night when they had Italian food at Sabores. It was a very enjoyable evening with really great food. We were there with friends celebrating our 30th anniversary and we were treated to dinner on the beach on our last night. Our waiter Robin made our night very enjoyable. Being in Mexico we thought we wouldn't see the Super Bowl but they put on a great Super Bowl party at Rick's Bar. There was more than enough chairs and cabanas to relax in by and on the beach. The staff at the resort from the construction workers to the management were pleasant and helpful and always had a smile on their faces. Some of the most helpful were personal concierges Carmina and Ruth who were very helpful when we ran into just a little glitch, and personal butlers, Jackeline and Catalina who were always there to talk or get anything you needed.

To give some background we have two small children, been married for seven years and never taken a honeymoon or romantic getaway. Also neither of us has been anywhere tropical. I had been searching the internet for months looking for the perfect resort that would met our requirements. We wanted a small resort (I didn't want to take a golf cart to get around the resort), adults only, great beach (really helped to see that maroma beach was rated on Forbes top 10 beaches of the world), good food (no buffets), quiet (just wanted to relax), all inclusive, nice rooms close to the beach and romantic. And this is exacetly what we got! If this is what your looking for you've found it! As mentioned in previous reviews the grounds are immuclate, the staff is always busy and very friendly (caterina is fantastic), the room was great (comfy bed, and yes the floor can be a little slippery, but I just wore my sandals or the slippers they provide you with), the beach beds are amazing (I usually woke up around 6:30 and put a towel and a magazine on our favorite one), you really don't have to do this but we wanted a specific bed, the sand was powder soft and the ocean was beautiful (it's not that deep in front of the hotel and there is some sea weeds (more like grass), but all you have to do is walk north past the marina, about 20 min till you get to the big cement block and there is the most gorgeous area of beach and water,the sand was like icing sugar, no sea grass, and deep enough to swim, ahhh heaven, drinks were plentiful and good (caeser in rick's bar was great, all you had to do was scratch you nose and you had a fresh drink), they didn't have a cocktail list, so if you are like us and wanted to take the opportunity to try every type of drink I recommend bringing a list of drink names, the marina is next door, we never found it to be noisy or found any gas in the water, room service was good, no problems with mixed up food or being too slow, no issues with housekeeping other than towel art was spotty, some days we had it others we didn't (tipping didn't make a difference), turn down service was always done (I think they do it while you have dinner, and we always went for dinner ealy). They are there to make your stay better and they do try, we booked a swim up suite and they first put us in 801, down across from Sabores, my issue was the waterfall which was right outside our patio and ran from 7 am till 11 pm, for me it was too loud, I wanted to sit on my patio and have silence or at least quiet, I phoned the front desk and they moved us as soon as another room came available (which was in two days). Moved to room 301. This room was great, only 20 steps to the beach and much quieter. The food would have to be our only disappointment. Yes they do serve gourmet portions, but we just ordered an appetizer, soup, main course and then desert (never were hungry), and really you could order room service later anyway. I thought there would be more seafood (the only seafood they had was shrimp and fish). They do have lobster but its only for the moonlight dinner in the sky hut (way too expensive). The lunch menu had the most variety and \"normal\" type food. But towards the end we just started to modify our food (ie. they had a quesadilla on the menu but I didn't like all the stuff they had in it, so I just asked for one with chicken and cheese, no problem). We ate in the Japanese resturant most, as it was the best. As mentioned the concerige does try to present a time share, I tried to be as polite and drop hints but I think they saw the hints as undecided. But as soon as I said \"no I'm not interested\" they dropped it. We did find a little discrepancy between service levels. For example, we never had a tub drawn in our room, never had a desert tray left on the bed, never had management continously ask how things were, etc. I think the difference maybe those people may belong to the time share (?). Few tips: Coming through the airport, just keep going till you get outside, your travel company is outside (they are not allowed in the airport) and although there are guys dressed in a uniform style shirt saying your airline/tour company, they are porters, all they do is wheel your luggage outside to your tour company and then want a tip. The marina is closed on sunday, so don't plan on doing an activity that day. We did do the deep sea fishing, which was a blast. And the sea-do/snorkel tour (little scary, fast, big waves, deep water, snorkel was great). But our last day we found out Ivan (activities coordinator) takes people out in kayaks from the resort to the reef (hello, free!!), we would have done this instead. Heard great things about Memo (from other couple staying at the resort), walked down twice but he wasn't there. We brought a portable ipod speaker system, as there is no cd player or ipod dock in the room. Look at booking your activities soon, as I found out that Alex (lomas travel agent, at the resort) puts together a smaller tour to certain places on certain days, which is in a van (less stops compared to the bigger buses used) and was 20$ per person cheaper. If you want a little more romance in your room bring your own tea light candles, but I would put them away before housekeeping gets there in case they think they are the resorts. They don't have conditioner for your hair, just shampoo, so look at bringing your own if you use it. I also brought my own small air mattress to relax on the water, as the resort does not have any, then just left it there. We usually went for dinner around 6:30, 7 pm (italian or japanese) . Not that busy at all, but by 8pm it was very busy, and we did hear of people who had to wait. Just keep it in mind. Sabores never busy. Like I mentioned above, if your looking for a small, adults only, all inclusive, quiet, realaxing, romantic, great beach resort this is it.

We had been to Cancun and wanted something a bit more on the quiet side. That is exactly what we got at the El Dorado Maroma. Our drive from the airport in Cancun was about 45 minutes, on a flat, straight highway. (Lomas travel offers private transfers with very nice drivers in luxury SUVs, which I highly recommend.) The gate to the hotel looks like a gate to someone's home. It is very small and understated and one would never imagine a resort could lie just down the short, winding road, but it does. We were greeted by name by the staff upon reaching the lobby, where we were also offered champagne. Catarina then showed us around the property, which is simple, but very beautiful. The hotel is open-air, (I saw no elevators), lushly landscaped with small fountains throughout. There are two pools, which were a bit chilly, (it is winter, even in Mexico, and we did have nights where the temperatures were in the 50's)but who goes to the Mexican Riviera to sit at the pool when a very beautiful beach is a few steps further? The white sand beach with crystal clear water was perfect. There are no waves or seashells, or even seaweed to contend with while getting into the water. There is bar service on the beach, so we did not even need to leave our chaise lounges! Occasionally, Catarina would walk the beach offering quesadillas, fresh fruit juices, bottled water or cold washcloths as refreshments, which was wonderful and decadent. Our only complaint was too few beach chairs. We watched some other guests come down early in the morning to reserve chairs with books and baseball hats, then also reserving beach beds. They would then not be seen again until lunchtime. This was annoying and really, due to the small size of the hotel, unnecessary. There is a marina next door, which offers fishing, parasailing and other activities. It also has a bar and restaraunt, but is not connected to the hotel. Their guests may walk the beach (a few do), but they may not use the beach chairs or any other hotel amenities. I've read a few reviews of complaints about the marina, but it did not bother us at all. A presidential suite is being constructed near the main pool, so there was a bit of hammering, but the workers were very respectful of the guests and the noise was not bad. I believe it will be completed in February, so the construction noise should be done soon. In any case, it was no problem for us. This was our first stay at a gourmet all-inclusive hotel. The breakfasts were great (no powdered eggs in sight) and lunches of fresh fish and delicious Mexican food were fabulous. Dinners were either at the Mexican, Japanese or Italian restaraunts, or a candlelight dinner in a Palapa (tiki hut) on the water (beautiful!). One may also choose to have room service. We tried it all and it was all quite good. We live in NYC, so it's unfair to compare the quality or authenticity of Japanese and Italian food, but it was fresh and delicious. We were not disappointed. There are day trips available and Lomas travel has an on-site agent to help arrange your activities. We hired a private driver to tour the ruins in Tulum, about an hour's drive South. We also took a fishing trip (sadly, we caught nothing) and a quick shopping trip to Playa del Carmen, which is beautiful and has the typical tourist traps (bargain with every vendor!). The service from the friendly staff was exceptional. Catarina is the shining star of El Dorado Maroma, though every staff member was very helpful and friendly. The numerous personal touches that they offer every day is what makes El Dorado Maroma stand out.

So I thought I'd share our recent times at El Dorado Maroma. My husband and I traveled there for a 5 day escape after the holidays and had a great time! We were looking for peace, quiet and relaxing--and that is exactly what we got! Sure there were some issues, but nothing that ruined our time, and if your standards are the Ritz and the Four Seasons, both of which my husband and I frequent, then you may be slightly disappointed, but if you want the Ritz or Four Seasons, go pay those prices and ditch the all inclusive aspect!!! When we first checked in at 2:45 our room wasn't ready....which when check in is at 3:00 is a bit surprising, but they showed us to lunch and we had a late lunch and they came and got us when our room was ready. Seriously just keep remembering...I'm on vacation...relax. They upgraded us to a infinity pool room, which was very nice, but I just had ankle reconstruction so climbing 5 flights of stairs wasn't top on my list of things to do, and there was no actual infinity pool, it was boarded over, but the views were fantastic!!!! When asked if we could move to another room they informed us they were booked solid.....soooo my ankle was going to have to suffer! It could recoup on the beach ;-). Oh well it was vacation. The rooms were beautiful, the views stunning, the only little issue was the plumbing smelled a bit of sewage, but light the aromatherapy they give you and you are none the wiser. The bed was like a little slice of heaven--don't forget that you can order whatever kind of pillows you like! The beds on the balcony are awesome and great for a nap and the jacuzzi tubs are heaven sent. One morning our phone didn't work, so we just ran down stairs to let them know and it was fixed by the afternoon. The beach is fantastic and sooo private and the water is so gentle. I also loved the marina next door....it's really nice to see the boats leave and it sort of lends a bit of ambiance to your trip!! Plus you have options of things to do if you want to rent jet skis, go diving etc. Let me state that the entire resort is soooo peaceful and quiet. It was sold out when we were there, but you could hear a pin drop. We would lounge on our beach beds, read, take walks on the gorgeous deserted beach and feel like we were the only people in the world. The beach/pool waitresses were perfectly timed in asking if they could get you anything and loved the little touches like bringing around appetizers to your beds/loungers. The pool was a bit chilly....that's a fair statement!! The food....we were not disappointed by the food at all and we're sort of snobs (totally honestly). It's not 4/5 star restaurant food, but ladies and gentleman we are at an all inclusive resort!!! It was solid good food and not once were we disappointed! Much better than any other all inclusive! They are smaller portions yes, but my husband and I found that to be fun so we could order more variety at different courses without feeling like we were going to split our pants open! And if you loved something just order more of it! We found the waiters at the restaurants impeccible serving at dinner (Breakfast and lunch was a bit of a different story) they seemed a little slower then. As for small shrimp etc., you really just need to know what to order...we ordered jumbo shrimp at the japanese restaurant and the shrimp were HUGE! True they aren't on the menu, but we just asked. Just ask...whats the worst they can say---we don't have that??? Alcohol, we were actually pleasently surprised at the level of alcohol they had!! Sky vodka, top shelf tequila, Black label Johnny Walker etc. etc. Again just ask for it and hey guess what you get it! A couple of things we were really disappointed in were the spa services....holy cow were they expensive, so we skipped our $250 massage! I think they'd get more takers if they lowered their prices a bit. Also, the maid service was a little inconsistent. We ran out of shampoos etc they weren't replenished so we had to call down to get them replenished....turn down service was spotty etc. etc. We also had an odd experience when someone walked into our room at 10:00 p.m. we don't know who it was to this day, but when they heard us they left. Also the high pressure hit to even go to their \"el dorado\" speech left me with a bad taste in my mouth. We were really uncomfortable with our \"private concierge\" when she wouldn't stop the hard core press. Almost felt like you didn't want to go ask for anything for fear of more pressure! Is this a Ritz, Four Seasons, Peter Island etc. No of course it isn't...it's a luxury ALL INCLUSIVE in Mexico and it's gorgeous. You can't spend $2900 for flights, all inclusive etc and expect the Ritz/ peter island etc, but all in all it was a fanstastic luxury experience for the price we paid. We were sooo pleasently surprised and relaxed and in heaven. We didn't want to leave, and by the time we did I had to rack my brain for what made me a little \"irritated\". Another bit of advice, seriously if you want lively go go go type of trip....go elsewhere this is all about being with your spouse or friends and relaxing. We are people that like going out etc and we were in bed every night by 11 and up by 7. Just by the nature of the resort it oozes romance and relaxation....not party party party!

The property itself is pretty and so is the ocean view, but in no way is this a 5 star resort, and for the price (on par with a Ritz or Four Seasons) we expected alot better. We requested early check, both through our travel agent and directly from the hotel and when we arrived, we were told our room was not ready. We took a cab into Playa del Carmen to do some shopping and upon return our swim up suite was ready. Rooms: The rooms were fine. Bland with cheap prints on the wall. The furniture had water rings all over it. From the pictures it looks like expensive designer furniture but up close you will see that it really is just dark painted wood with defects everywhere. The bed was extremely comfortable. As stated before we had a swim up suite. The floor is polished marble and very slippery. There were no area rugs, mats, etc near the patio where the swim up area was. So our floor was littered with towels to keep from slipping. Maid service was inconsistent. Every morning at 7am we would put our sign on our door to have our room made up. It never occurred before 2pm and twice I had to call and ask to have the room made up. Also turn down service only occured once during our stay. The jacuzzi sprayed water everywhere soaking the bathroom and the shower door also leaked covering our bathroom with water. Sugar ants were everywhere in the bathroom. Living in Florida we are used to this, and we also know that it is an easy thing to remedy without using pesticides. FOOD: The food was by far the biggest disappointment of the the stay. Gourmet? Laughable. Tiny portions of pre-prepard/frozen food does not equal gourmet. The first evening we ate in the asian restaurant. This meal took two hours. There was a large group of travel agents who were clearly catered to while the regular guests were left waiting and waiting for their food. To wait 2 hours for worse than mediocre food is unacceptable. Every night we ate in any of the restaurants we ordered alot of food because of the minute portions and every time one or two plates of food were simply forgotten. This happened every evening. When travelling to Mexico, we have fresh seafood in mind. Dont expect that when ordering at the Italian restaurant. The shrimp dish were tiny frozen rock shrimp served with wallpaper paste (soft polenta). We waited 1 hour 45 minutes for that meal. Dont order the filet of beef either. I asked for salt and pepper and was told \"this is an italian restaurant, we dont have salt.\" And so went our dining experience at this resort. In order to get the fresh seafood we craved we left the resort on the third night and ate at a very upscale restaurant in Playa where we dined on all fresh ingredients from the sea. This was by far the best meal of the vacation. I did inform the concierge of the horrible food and service and the resort did try to make it better but there is no fixing what is broke unless there is a complete menu overhaul focusing on FRESH ingredients. We know great food and it was not to be found in this resort. In the end, we just ordered simple things we know couldnt be screwed up such as hamburgers, salsa, guacamole, fresh fruit. Dont be fooled into thinking that the resort serves top shelf liquor. Cuervo and Smirnoff are the best you are going to get here. To not even have Patron tequila or something on that level is shameful. We are good tippers so we received decent bar service but if you dont tip, you wont. That goes for any service at the resort. Maintenance occurred all day every day in this resort. To the point of nuisance. At 8 am one day they decided to change the drapes on my patio while was sitting there. Hello? I understand upkeep but there are ways to do this during times of the day when it isnt in front of the guests. I dont want to sit on my patio listening to lawn mowers, weed whackers, drills, etc. I dont want to see it. We requested late check out since we had a late flight both through the travel agent and again through reception. Reception told us that if there room was free we would be able to get a late check out. The night before we asked if our room was free if we decided to extend and they told us it was. So we had the knowledge that the room wasn't going to be prepared for the next guest immediately. When my husband requested the late check out of 2pm we were told we would be charged $10 per person per hour. We said no way, we were not informed of this by our travel agent or the resort and refused. They immediately acquiesced. We will not stay at this resort again. It simply was a giant rip off. If we pay those prices, we expect the service and food to match. Next time we will stay at a Ritz or Four Seasons, etc. ******NOTE******** I do want to point out that there was one employee at this resort who went out of her way to help us. Caterina.

The hotel boasts wonderful rooms, fantastic staff, beautiful beaches, and gourmet all-inclusive meals. The location is great because it's about half way between Cancun and Playa Del Carmen so a trip into town for shopping is very easy. The hotel offers complementary bus transfers to Playa Del Carmen on certain days of the week. Just check with the Lomas Travel Desk at the hotel for days and times. The rooms at El Dorado Maroma are large and spacious. I was quite surprised at the large living area, and bedroom section with a wonderful king bed surrounded by romantic wispy drapes, and the famous towel characters nightly wrapped in flower petals on the bed was lovely. The bath was oversized with great lighting, a huge jacuzzi tub, and a large shower that had a glass door at one end that opened outside to a rainforest shower. It was incredible! I cannot say enough about the staff. My favorite was Catarina who was buzzing around everywhere with a large smile, asking if everything was ok. All the guests warmed to her. She would also show up on the beach to offer all natural pineapple and papaya drinks to guests. Delicious! One evening, when she found out we preferred vegetarian meals, she contacted the Asian Restaurant and the staff had a wonderful dinner prepared for us, all vegetarian. Fresh and delicious. If you eat in the Italian Restaurant, you must have the dessert that looks like chocolate ravoli. I had it almost every night. Also, if you want something that's not on the menu, just ask the waitperson and most likely they will make it for you. Also the drinks are a higher quality than other all-inclusives, which only adds to the continued gourmet level at this hotel. This resort is very romantic with beach beds everywhere (no problem getting one like other resorts), a bed on the outside room deck and of course a king-sized very comfortable bed inside. Very romantic and special for couples wanting a great getaway. Also, the resort is right next door to Maroma Paradise which offers, snorkeling, catamaran rides with sails you can ride, fishing, horseback riding, and speedboats. So if you are tired of relaxing, and want a bit of adventure in the Caribbean, just walk next door! And during the day and in the evening, the beach stretches a long way, and it's great for a walk, or morning run. Overall, I cannot think of one thing I would want to change at this hotel.

This is your place if you like a well-managed luxury resort, with relaxation and seclusion, gourmet food, beautiful facilities, and the best service. The staff was absolutely outstanding, eager to help with anything, always smiling, always ready with a greeting. It is a short drive south of the Cancun airport, and then a mile or so through the dense jungle on the entrance road. Once you stay on the Riveria Maya, I doubt you will want Cancun proper again (well, maybe if you are a college student on break). This area has been recognized as one of the best beaches in the world, and I can see why - beautiful white sand, meticulously cared for. A reef protects the beach from rough surf too. All you have to do is relax. The Jacuzzi suite rooms are huge, very clean, well appointed, and include balconies that alone are the size of many hotel rooms!.

After 5 days of exploring Cozumel we were looking forward to relaxing at Maroma and this was a perfect place to do it! Check-in was very easy. We had arrived a few hours early so they held our bags and we went to grab some lunch and sit by the pool. They came and got us when everything was set to go. We stayed in Mi Hotelito room 106 which is the smaller and older section of the resort. The room was excellent. It wasn't a huge room but very adequate as we didn't spend much time in it. Our room was on the first floor and close to the middle of the area which meant our back patio opened up to the bar, very convenient :) All rooms in Mi Hotelito have a back patio area with a bed on it. Downstairs rooms allow you to exit the back door (towards the beach) upstairs rooms have a deck with a railing. The only thing that would make the room better would be a large tub or jacuzzi. I believe some of the rooms in this section do have it. The other room options are a swim-up or infinity pool room (top 3 floors of the new section are this style.) I think these would be nice if going in the hot summer months but the downside is a long walk around to the pool or to eat. In addition to being less expensive, we liked the convenience of the Mi Hotelito rooms and will stay in those again next year. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and well-kept. There are plenty of chairs and lounge beds by both the pool and beach. There are only 72 rooms in the hotel so you never have trouble finding a place to sit. There are two pools, both with swim-up bars. One by Mi Hotelito and a larger one by the new section. They aren't heated so in December they were a bit chilly. Felt great when the sun was out but if we wanted to swim in the evening the ocean was warmer. As others mentioned, drink service was occasionally slow but since it is a small property it was easy to walk to a bar to grab some drinks. There are 3 restaurants at the resort. An international (mostly Mexican food) restaurant open for all 3 meals. Also an Asian (mostly Japanese) and Italian restaurant open for dinner only. We ate at all 3 but the Asian was definitely our favorite. Service at all 3 was very good but not perfect. One night we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated at the Asian restaurant even though I could see 4 open tables (a practice I'd expect at a trendy restaurant, not an all-inclusive resort.) Overall the food was very good. Occasionally we found something that was just 'ok' but we liked most of it and we tried as much food off the menus as we could. The portions are pretty small which was nice as you could try quite a few things in one meal. The only other complaint about the restaurants was that only two types of house wine were available. It would nice to have something of a selection without having to pay extra for a bottle of something else. The activities were about as good as could be expected for such a small resort. Ivan and his partner (I forget how to spell her name) did a great job trying to keep the schedule full and Ivan was always walking around to see who wanted to play volleyball, boccie ball, etc. They also had kayaks, snorkeling, swimming, walks, trivia, etc. At night there is one place to go, Rick's bar. The bands they brought in were great and the service was excellent in there. Overall this resort was excellent. We are planning a return trip next year. There some minor issues with the service that made it \"very good\" instead of excellent but as this is a young resort we heard it is getting better all the time. I'm not sure this is the best place to go if you're going to be there longer than 10 days. Many people we talked to went to one of the other El Dorado resorts for part of their trip and Maroma for the rest but if you're looking to relax this is the place to be!", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coulterville, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAhh Maroma! A Blissful Experience - LOVED IT!!\u201d", "Author": "locked88", "ReviewID": "UR22552225", "Content": "We spent 12 glorious days at Maroma from 10/29 to 11/10/08. Mr. Alfredo Santamaria, General Manager, is doing a wonderful job here. He and his staff are always visible, available and wonderfully kind. To a person, they are dedicated to the utmost in personal service and one on one attention. We toured this resort last fall before the grand opening and knew immediately it was something special. And it is exactly that. My review is long so I apologize up front. This is our humble opinion, for what it\u2019s worth. This was our second stay at Maroma, the first being in April this year. The resort has overcome all the opening \u201cglitches\u201d and is quickly evolving into a \u201csuper star\u201d, one-of-a-kind resort. The moment you step into the lobby and receive that lovely scented damp towel and cold glass of champagne, you take your first deep breath and the place just oozes relaxation all around you. We requested a Mi Hotelito room on the top (second) floor in building 2, which is our preference. These rooms are older but they have a cozy, tropical feeling to them with spacious bathrooms, huge showers and large terraces with a table and chairs and queen size beds. We spent many an evening before dinner lounging on that balcony bed sipping champagne and watching ships sail in and out of Cozumel. The rooms on the newer side of the resort are beautifully furnished in more modern decor and all have fantastic views. They have Jacuzzis which are located in the bathroom area, flat screen TV\u2019s, outdoor showers and some have infinity/swim-up pools. Those that do not have pools have huge terraces with beds. Our only problem with the rooms on this side is the fact that they do not have screens on the patio doors so you are prevented from leaving your door open while you are in your room. If you want to enjoy the fresh air and hear the ocean like we do, this is a biggie. So we opt for the Mi Hotelito rooms without the Jacuzzi and outdoor shower. Again, it is personal preference. That being said, they did not have a second floor room available in building 2 the first night we were there so we spent one night in building 1. The next day we were shocked to find out they were putting us in Mi Hotelito Room 216 which is the owner\u2019s suite with 180 degree ocean views, a Jacuzzi, outdoor shower and wraparound wooden balcony. We were ecstatic. When we checked out on 11/10 they were destroying this room as soon as we walked out of it. They are making that one and the one below it into \u201cwellness suites\u201d. The beach is lovely with white, sugary sand. Headed north, you can walk past the marina as far as you want and it\u2019s gorgeous. The marina itself is right next to the resort and to my knowledge has no business connection to Karisma. You grow used to hearing the muted but audible music from the pirate cruise ship as it leaves and returns to the dock. Their choice of tunes: Theme from the Titanic! The wave runners are restricted to entering and exiting the marina from a particular spot and cannot be used directly in front of the resort. You hear their idling motor noise but it is normally not intrusive. The restaurants are very nice \u2013 lovely atmosphere and amazing, delicious food. I gained 6 pounds and my husband gained 9 \u2013 say no more. We always dressed up for dinner according to the resort dress code, for my husband it was long pants, a collared shirt and closed toe shoes. Men can also wear longer, dressy shorts with closed toe sandals. I have a hard time trying to figure out why so many people have a problem with the dress code and try to get around it. It\u2019s an elegant place, it\u2019s the rule and if you want to visit this resort, then you should have no problems abiding by it. It\u2019s a matter of respect. There, I\u2019m finished and getting off the soap box. Our favorite dishes for dinner were the sushi, shrimp tempura and the mahi-mahi at Kiyoko; the cream soup, tomato salad, melon with bacon salad, penne pasta, and the best dish of all - the spaghetti carbonara at Mio the Italian; at Sabores we really enjoyed the special Italian night on Thursday with the opera singer who had a voice like an angel. It was a lovely evening. Lunches were also terrific and we had many a pizza, fajita, quesadilla and Mexican bite in Sabores. You could sit indoors or outside under the palapa viewing the ocean for breakfast and lunch. There was a nice breakfast menu and also a small buffet where you could help yourself if you liked and/or order eggs, omelets, etc. Many mornings we did both \u2013 ordered fantastic french toast or waffles from the menu and got fruit, bacon and pastries from the buffet. There was always an endless supply of champagne, mimosas and bloody marys every morning. Breakfast was also great from room service; timely and hot with lots of food. For lunch, we often ordered pizza and other things that were on the Sabores lunch menu from room service even though none of it was on the room service menu. They will do anything possible to get you what you want or need. Desserts are scrumptious no matter where you get them. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday they set up tables under a palapa on the beach and have special outdoor lunches; BBQ one day, tacos one day and the other day is for fresh catch \u2013 they bring in the fresh catch from the morning and prepare your selection for you right there on the beach \u2013 best seafood you will ever eat. Drinks were plentiful, varied, and top shelf if you wished-most any brand you want, as strong and as many as you like. Bartenders were knowledgeable, fun and always willing to make something new and special for you to try. One of our Canadian friends asked for Crown Royal and they didn\u2019t have it. The next day they brought him a bottle of his own and kept it under the bar for him all week. Hello, Marco and Antonio \u2013 we miss you! Beach service was great most of the time but spotty once in awhile. It didn\u2019t really matter much because the place is so small that the bars are always nearby. Pools were clean and beautiful although a little bit cool climbing in. Once in, you were comfortable and we had a lot of laughs and good times with the folks we met there and the bar guys. We miss our Canadian friends, Ken and Eileen; Kate and Scott; and our St. Louis neighbors, Sherri and Steve. Memories abound. The spa was beautiful and very user friendly. The room was totally quiet and serene. I highly recommend Eduardo, he is wonderful. I had an exfoliating massage followed by a shower (it is right there in the room, no need to go any further than one step from the massage bed), then back on the bed for a relaxation massage. Heaven, absolute heaven. When I got back to our room, my husband had arranged with Carmina, our concierge, to have a bottle of champagne chilling, a cheese plate and chocolate covered strawberries; and the Jacuzzi filled with bubbles. Can you say DIVINE? Evening entertainment was in Rick\u2019s bar where they had pool tables and nightly music of one kind or another. One night it was a band and another night it was two girls. It was okay, but very loud and you really couldn\u2019t talk in there. They also had a big screen TV that covered sports and also the election returns. It\u2019s a beautiful lounge and great drinks but it would be nice to be outside near the ocean. The pool bar is now open until 10:00 PM but it would be nice to see something like they have at EDSS with the oceanside bar at night. We are huge fans of Seaside, too. There is a doctor available 24 hours a day should you need medical attention. Beach beds are plentiful and you can always find one. No one plays the bed game here. They are so comfy and relaxing. If you get up for some reason, you can bet that sweet Catarina was there to put fresh towels on it, straighten it out and make it all cozy for you upon your return. For days after we returned home, I listened for her \u201cgood morning, how are you?\u201d You can have as many towels as you need, as often as you want to swap them out. Ivan, the activities guy allows you to be as busy or as sedentary as you wish. They have volleyball, bocce ball, water aerobics, tequila tasting, cooking classes, snorkeling and kayaks. If you want to leave the resort, it is a fairly short taxi ride to get to Playa del Carmen for shopping, dinner or if you just get a hankering for WalMart. I am not going to elaborate on off-resort activities because honestly, we never leave. Therefore, I don\u2019t know too much about it, but Lomas has a representative on sight and can book any sort of tour you want. The marina next door also has activities, tours and a gift shop in addition to the gift shop outside the resort lobby. Movies and books are available if you need one. Just check the concierge hut and they are there for the taking. We have previously stayed at EDR 3 times and EDSS 5 times. Now we have fallen head over heals in love with Maroma. It is not perfect - nothing ever is \u2013 but it is doggone close. We were supposed to leave Maroma after 5 days for El Dorado Royale and stay in a casita. We did leave and stayed at Royale for 3 and a half hours then begged to come back to Maroma. We are so glad we did \u2013 they put us right back in the owner\u2019s suite with a note welcoming us back home and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries. Sadly, EDR has outgrown us. Incidentally, the casitas do not have screens on their patio doors, either. I find it amazing that no one has ever mentioned that on Trip Advisor that I can remember. Screened doors must not be an issue for anyone but us. Maybe it\u2019s a Midwest thing. If you are wondering if there were any negative moments in our stay, yes there was one. However, it was not anything the resort could help. It was mosquitoes, blasted boogers \u2013 and they love me. Before we got there, it rained for a solid month and the mosquitoes were vicious by the time we arrived. We have been going to Mexico for years and this was the absolute worst and the only time my husband has ever gotten bit. The resort did what it could via spraying the grounds and the rooms, etc. but it was an overwhelming task. I am talking thousands of them. It was unusual and unrelenting. Thank God I had packed a green aerosol can of Deep Woods Off (higher percentage of Deet). It works great for spraying your bedding at night if necessary and also for spraying your screen door and terrace bed. It isn\u2019t available in Mexico but the orange can with less Deet is. The Mexican Autan works well, too but is expensive in the gift shop, as is the orange can of Family Off, which was $12. Having the cream would be good to have for the beach and also to apply before going to bed. I also had Caladryl gel and Benedryl spray. They were a lifesaver. Let me emphasize this problem was present at ALL the resorts along the Maya, not just Maroma because we heard it discussed in the airport. It was not a normal situation and I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect it the next visit. I would be remiss if I failed to mention the rest of the outstanding staff. They go above and way beyond the call of duty to please you and make your stay enjoyable. In addition to the ones before mentioned: Edwin, the tireless bellman, George, Ana and Patricia at the front desk, you rock!, Ruth, beautiful Jacqueline, our old friend Mario and Gabrielle, David, Carlos, and Monica; Walter and Chef Efraim, your food is amazing!, and all the others behind the scene. Each and every one of you do an exceptional job and we thank you. We will see you again in 2009, God willing. If you are looking for a small, intimate, quiet, relaxing stay, then the El Dorado Maroma is your answer. If you want action and partying, this is not your place \u2013 you will be disappointed. And while it is definitely geared to adults, they do allow age 16 and up. You seldom see anyone there that age but we did see one young lady with her parents. I know I have missed something I should have addressed but if you have further questions, please feel free to contact me via private message.

The resort is so small that it doesn't matter where you stay or in what room, everything is there and convenient. After staying at one of the mega, family friendly resorts in the Dominican, we were blown away at El Dorado Maroma. The level of service was unparalleled and the food was tremendous - the japanese/oriental restaurant was the best for dinner by far. However, nothing we had was ever less than great. The breakfast is good, but the breakfast room service is even better - why leave your room when you can have better food brought to you?! Lunch was great too. All the food, tremendous. Drinks - margaritas were the best. The resort is very calm, relaxing and beautiful. We loved the adults only aspect. The beach is great, the pool is nice...plenty of lounge chairs and beach beds for everyone. nothing was ever crowded, which was nice. With only 72 suites, even if the resort if booked, that's not that many people. While we were there, it was roughly half full, so it was very nice and at times felt as though we had the resort to ourself.

Seaside was under some construction and we could not get the room we requested so we decided to stay - glad we did. We were in the old part of the resort (Mi Hotelito) and loved it. Our first room was #209 and it had a king sized bed with bed on the balcony as well as table and 2 chairs. The bathroom was huge with plenty of plush towels. Our view was the ocean (2nd floor) and a bit of the tops of the palms and the palapa of the pool bar. (see photos) The second half of our stay was in room 216 - this room was amazing.

LOVED IT.\u201d", "Author": "swooten", "ReviewID": "UR21878473", "Content": "This was our first visit to the Riviera Maya - and we loved it. We chose the Maroma because we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary, and we really needed some R&R. And we SO got it. The hotel is small and intimate - the wait staff knows your name, and you get to know other travelers because there are not many people there, even when it is full. The hotel was 98% full at one point during our stay, and you couldn't even tell. The beach has maybe 5-7 people on it, there is usually 1-2 people in the pool, there is never a wait for beach butler service or at the swim up bar, sometimes you wonder, \"Where are all the people?\" With so many wonderful nooks and crannies, the resort just absorbs people and oozes relaxation and quiet. Ahhhh..... We never had to wait for a table at breakfast or lunch and always ate outside under the palapas. We only waited one night for a seat in a restaurant, and that was because they were having a big birthday party there. Otherwise, we always just walked up (no reservation) and were seated immediately. It was AWESOME. There is no competition for beach beds or loungers. They are always available - there are one or two palapa beach beds in front of mi hotelito that are generally taken (you have to get up early for those because they are so sweet), but otherwise, the beds and loungers are available all day, as well as towels. The resort also has snorkels and kayaks available - it is a bit more difficult to get the snorkels - I had trouble a couple of days in getting one, but I voiced my complaint to the concierge, and they went and got one from the Marina, especially for me. No matter - the snorkeling off the beach is so-so, it is good for practice, but if you really want to snorkel - go with Memo or go to Akumal Bay (see my things to do reviews). I agree with the other reviewers, the marina next door is a bit irritating and loud (depends on the direction of the wind). The worst offenders are the jet skis and the mini speed boats, out all day with their noise pollution and scaring the wildlife away (before the marina, apparently, there used to be a lot more stingrays to see, now they are scared by the sound of the motor boats). Also - the excursions out of the marina are very overpriced - check it out for yourself - and snorkeling from the marina off the Tahuna catamaran is a cattle drive (i.e. going with 50 people to snorkel vs. 5 people on Memo's boat). Its not enough to discourage me from going back to the resort. The hotel is immaculate and beautiful, and small - only 72 rooms. I was impressed with how clean everything was and the beautiful landscaping. The pools are sparkling clean, the beach white sands and swept clean every morning, the beach beds and loungers clean and often topped with towel art. Our room was huge, very soft and comfortable bed, a HUGE jetted tub, sitting area with comfy couches, and a wonderful outdoor shower we used every day (there is also an indoor rain shower). We had an infinity suite on the second floor - we thought the pool was refreshing and clean, and the patio was great for lounging and having breakfast. We had a great view of the pools, tops of the palm trees and the ocean. A+++++ on the facilities. The service is a mixed bag, and I will tell you why. The people that work there work extremely hard and are so friendly, and nice and accomodating. We have no complaints on the concierge (Ruth and Patricia are wonderful!), the waiters (Emidgio, Herberth, and Leonardo - you guys rock), the chefs (Hugo is AMAZING), the bell service (give Edwin a raise!), the beach butlers (Eve), the bartenders (Christian and Francisco are excellent) or the housekeepers - our room was cleaned twice daily, and the turn down service was a delight. And again - everyone there is working sooooo hard and hustling like mad. The concierges were very accomodating and helpful - they arranged a rental car for us to be delivered to the resort. They even offered to pick up Corona's for us in Cancun. My complaint is about the room service, some food service and the entertainment service. For the room service, the complaint is not against those delivering (they were great) but that the food was usually cold, and mixed up with other rooms. We left early for excursions one day, and ordered room service, and it was a fiasco! Occassionally our orders at the restaurants would also be mixed up. Generally, I had no complaint about the length of the meals or how long it took to get food (it goes with the relaxed atomosphere - each meal is an event), but if you did need to get food in a timely manner - good luck. Then we had a really irritating experience with Ivan. We had booked a sailing/snorkeling excursion directly with Memo (a dude with a sailboat who ties up about a 15 minute walk south on the beach). Somehow, some of the staff at the hotel found out, and started encouraging us to take an excursion with some of Ivan's friends, that Memo was more expensive that we were quoted (he was not). We ignored that and went with the recommendations of people here on tripadvisor. Then, the morning of our excursion, we were having breakfast, enjoying ourselves and getting ready to go, when Ivan (activities director for the resort) came up and said, \"Memo has booked another two couples this morning, and there is too many people booked for this morning's sail, so do you mind going this afternoon?\" We were a little pissed, since we had booked the excursion 4 days earlier, that Memo would overbook the sailing. We told Ivan no thank you, that we would walk down the beach and see for ourselves what was going on. Well - we went - and it turns out there was no one else booked, and we were the only two couples going sailing that morning. So Ivan was either lying or misinformed, and it stressed us out needlessly that morning. I felt like complaining to the management, but then I decided to just include it in this review. Bottom line? Don't trust Ivan, go with your instincts and the reviews and information of other travelers on this site. But again - the service is generally amazing, and everyone there works extremely hard to make our vacation the best. I think with some organization and a better system they would solve the couple of mishaps we experienced with the food service. The food: A+++++++. Loved it! Our favorite was the Asian restaurant - the spicy tuna rolls, the chicken satay, the soup, the tempanyaki - all delicious. And it is fun to sit at the center table and talk with everyone. And they will make you things off the menu (i.e. we ordered grilled salmon and they would make it to order - absolutely delicious) or bring you things from the other restaurants (i.e. we went to the Italian restaurant and still ordered spicy tuna rolls). Again - you will not be disappointed with the food - just make sure to order appetizers and soup, entree and dessert (ginger cookies are good) and you will be full - they are gourmet portions. Lunch - the fish market on Thursday is incredible. They catch it (red snapper and grouper) and then fry it for you, and you eat on the beach. The BBQ on Friday is also delectable, and served on the beach. The fajitas off the regular lunch menu are so good, my mouth is watering. Also - the coffee was hit or miss - it was either amazing or tasted like a diner in southern Wyoming (i.e. yuck). We solved that problem by ordering cappucinoor double espresso instead of coffee - and those are GREAT. Beach attire is fine for breakfast and lunch, for dinner people look nice - sun dresses, khakis and button down shirts are the norm. Its very elegant. The drinks are great - if you think they are too weak, just as for a topper or a double. The bartender will make anything you ask for, my favorites were the Chi-chis, the chocolate martini (only order from Ricks bar or the Italian/Asian restaurants, otherwise it is not right), dos equis beer with lime, mango colada, and, of course, tequila tradicional. The house wines are ok, better after a shot of tequila. :) The entertainment: chill and relaxed. Don't come here for a nightlife, because it is NOT happening. However, you get to know people and that is fun in itself. It is not uncommon for everybody in the restaurant (especially the Asian) to be talking together as old friends. During the day - boci ball is fun, pottery painting is available on occasion, and ofcourse - water sports. We had a blast at the tequila tasting and the mixed drink making - lots of laughter. And walks on the beach or laying on your beach bed all day, snoozing and reading and staring at the water. Nightlife is Ricks bar, I agree, it would be fun to have an outdoor bar. There was some nice acoustic guitar music a couple of nights, and a very loud band another night, also pool, chess and darts are available. We did not try the spa or next door marina. Personal misc. side notes - go down to the beach at night - its alive. We saw tons of stingrays and skates in the shallows, and ofcourse crabs. Also, we went and sang in the chapel - the acoustics are amazing and it is always unlocked. I felt very safe at the resort - the security is tight. Bring bug spray - if the wind is out of the jungle, there are LOTS of mosquitos and biting bugs, and they come out early! By the end of our stay, we would order lunch, then go take a dip in the pool, and come back in time for it to be served. I laughed when I read the review about the restaurant music. Ok - so the acoustic music for breakfast and lunch is nice, but there is only about 6 tracks that last about 35 minutes and then it repeats, and they play it all day, everyday, until the six tracks are drummed into your brain and you dream about them (I am still thinking about them). I LIKE the music - they just need a little more variety, a longer CD, or something. I agree - the cheesy 80s and 90s music in the restaurants has got to go (I never want to hear Richard Marx AGAIN - lol). I suggest classical symphonic music for the Italian and Mexican, traditional Japanese music for the Asian. Having said all that - I would most DEFINITELY come to this resort again. It seems like they are working out all the kinks (it is a new resort) and are getting better all the time. I felt like royalty and was completely pampered and relaxed my whole visit, and I LOVED it.

Worth every penny. The service was amazing. The food was delicious. The atmosphere completely relaxed. We had asked for a room on the 4th floor, when we arrived there was not one that was available. Ana did her best and after two days we got a room on the 4th floor. Thank you Ana. I would reccommend a room on the 4th floor, worth the walk up 4 flights. There is a big outdoor shower, we had the ifinity pool on our balcony. The nice thing about the rooms on the 4th floor you are away from everyone, we had a view of he beach. The rooms are huge. The bed was soo comfortable, you just sink into them. We had a hard getting out of it every morning, only to walk down to the beach beds and lounge. The room service menu is delicious. I could really go for some of their pancakes right now. Every morning they brought our food up 4 flights of stairs and set it out for us. You could not ask for anything more. Even if it is not on the menu, they will go out of their way to make it for you. One night I was feeling under the weather and they brought up some chicken broth and toast, made me feel a lot better. Please keep in mind that all the service people work for very little, yby no means do you have to tip, but they really appreciate it. We tipped a couple dollar here and there, and we found our glasses to never be empty. Once again you absolutely do not have to, but everyone takes such good care of you it is hard not to. We thought we would be bored after a couple days of relaxing. However, we never ran out of things to do, we swam, took naps on the beach beds, went for walks. You can find big beautiful seashells if you walk 10-15 minutes south of the resot. If you walk north of the resort you will find loney beaches witout all the seaweed, worth the walk. There is a band that comes in a couple times a week, they are worth catching at Rick Bar. We had a blast, they could play everything from the Eagles to Juanes. The resort really tries to come up with some nightlife. If you are looking for a rowdy night long party, you are not going to find it. Everyone there is on vacation total relax mode. The resort is all inclusive. There are some items that are not included, like special bottles of wine. But they have so much available that we never felt the need to oder from the wine menu. We did not do the candle light dinner on the beach. It was a bit pricey, but it may be worth it. We got a couples massage. I would definitely recommend this. Especially is you are on vacation with your significant other. It is really relaxing. This is a perfect honeymoon place.

I am pickey and like nice CLEAN things............. it met my expectations. checkin: very personable, fast, could not do enough for us. rooms: stayed in swimup 504. Very very large room with a couch, desk and a King pillow top xtra nice bed. Not the hard beds mexico resorts usually have. Very clean. Outside shower plus a inside shower. Nice large patio w/ sun bed. Double sinks in bathroom, jazz.bathtub, robs, slippers....we could have not had a nice roomer. My kids had a beach front room, had a few ants but the problem was addressed and taken care of. pools: 2 pools, clean, plenty of lounge chairs, plenty beds , towels are at your pool side...take as many as you need. Beach: beautiful, raked severeal times through out the day. food: anything you want. I am kinda pickey, and the cook would cook me whatever I wanted. One night in the Jap. restaurant they served my kids mexican food because they did not like what was on their menue. I was laying on the beach one day and a butler came and brought me a brownie fresh out of the oven w/ vanilla ice cream. WOW thats service !!!! You can find something here to eat regardless of how pickey you are. Staff: by the second day you are getting recognized by your first name. Staff very nice and they work hard. Make sure you leave them a tip....they do not expect it, but very appreciative. Nightlife: not much going on..Ricks bar upstairs has a little something each night but dont expect to much. I would like to see more activities at night. We really liked this resort because it is very small.....not alot of people. I will say there is alot of \"LOVE\" in the atmosphere around here. Honeymoon, Anniversary couples etc..... The marina next door did family portraits of us on the beach. Turned out ok....not as professional as our photographer here in Texas, but they were OK. Got the disk and having pictures developed at a studio. We used a travel agent whom got us a Great Deal so we are planning on going back next month!!!

My wife and I stayed the last week in July for our anniversary and had an amazing time at EDM. Let me start my review with this though......DON'T pay attention to any negativity you read in any other review. Some of what I read is pretty absurd and there are some people in life that just can't be pleased no matter what. Before I get into details, much love to Christian, Alfredo, and Diego. We'll never forget you guys and they truly make EDM a great place. You can tell they love what they do which is hard to find. Is EDM perfect? No, they aren't. But they work their tails off to make sure you have the most pleasant experience. For example, one night our air conditioner went out around 11pm. We call the front desk and they had someone up in literally 5 mins. They indicated they couldn't fix it that night so they moved us to another room for the night so we could sleep. The next day we had an excursion but we were back by 2pm and everything was fixed. As soon as we arrived, the front desk was in touch to make sure everything was ok and make sure we were happy. To top that, they sent up a plate of fresh cheeses and a bottle of wine on the house. Can't really beat that. Food We were very pleased with the food. Sabores has amazing breakfast and lunches. We would order room service almost every morning and the amount of food they give you is crazy. Lunch at Sabores at the main pool is just great. Get the fajitas!!! Really, really good. If they don't have something on the menu, ASK FOR IT!!!! They will do whatever you want. Our last day there, we arrived around 10:45 and told them we were craving the fajitas. Lunch didn't start until 11:30 yet they still made us each a plate of fajitas. Again, anything you ask for you pretty much get. Italian was good and so was the Asian. The Asian was actually our favorite for dinner which is ironic given you are in Mexico. Yes, they give you gourmet portions and if you cry about that then cry me a river. Again, just ask for another plate. It's not that hard. I wanted two plates of sushi and that's what they gave me. In addition, we ate in the Mexican restaurant one night and I had one of my sushi cravings so I asked for some and they brought me a plate along with my Mexican food. Also, if you have a chance to do a private beach dinner definitely do it!! It's so worth the money. We did the lobster menu and it was very tasty. Our table was set up over the water in the massage hut and was very, very romantic. They even sent a bottle of champagne up to the room afterwards. Room We had one of the older rooms, 111. It was perfect for us and had a really nice rustic feel to it. Our balcony overlooked the older part of the pool and was very relaxing. Never got to see one of the newer rooms but from what we heard, they were nice. Here's a tip though......the rooms with the plunge pools really aren't worth it. We heard that time and time again as the water was so cold, you couldn't use them. We had a similar experience at another resort we stayed at so that's why we didn't go with that type of a room. Beach/Pool The beach was amazing. Soft white sand for miles and miles. Take a hike about 20 mins to the left of the resort and it's like you are on a deserted island all by yourself. The views were truly amazing and the water was crystal clear. Both pools were nice although we spent the majority of our time in the bigger/newer pool. The beach beds were great, however, watch out for the ants. I got chewed up by them but the funny thing is my wife was fine. So, just be careful. If you get bit up, just have another shot or two. :) Drinks Speaking of shots and drinks, I read how the drinks were weak. Yes, some of them were but I asked for a floater of whatever I wanted on the top and I got it. A couple of times as I watched them make my drink I asked them to add more liquor and they were fine with it. Again, just ask and you shall receive. Also, be sure to get a dirty margarita from Christian!!! Also, if you are a newlywed, be sure and ask him to sing you his little song he has for all newlyweds. Pretty hilarious. I'm not sure what else to say other than please be sure to thank the staff and tip them. They really do work their tails off and do it for very little money. All they want to do is please you and sometimes it's pretty sad to see how some people treat them. They work because they want and need to but they all have a true desire to make it the best experience for you. Thanks again to the EDM staff. Can't wait to go back and have Christian make me by 10:30 bloody mary's!", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa", "Title": "\u201cYou'll want to go back!\u201d", "Author": "caribnlvr", "ReviewID": "UR18943082", "Content": "The hotel was beautiful.

The \"amenities\" (towel animals and aroma therapy and fruit in the room) were not always consistent but that's ok. The landscaping to include flowers, fountains and driftwood were beautiful and the gourmet food displays were not only beautiful, but delicious as well, the rolled towels, lunches on the beach, everything was beautiful.

We had a great time and absolutely loved the EDM. Overall, I would highly recommend the EDM for a couple that is looking for complete relaxation and unwinding. I do not recommend the EDM for a couple that is looking for a lot of activity and a lot of night life. Below I break down the review into different categories. TRIP ARRIVAL First let me provide a tip for anyone arriving to the Yucatan Peninsula via the Cancun International Airport. Once clear of immigration and customs, and you are ready to find your transportation, do not stop in the airport, go straight through the lobby and go all the way outside where the transportation companies are waiting. Inside the lobby are all kinds of timeshares/travel companies etc. that will offer free transportation or want to get you to sign up for excursions. They will do their best to side track you and tie up your time as long as they can. We made the mistake because some of the people presented badges and went under the guise that they were government related tourism agents that are there to help you navigate your way to your transportation or provide useful tourist information. After about five minutes I figured out the agent that stopped us really wasn\u2019t trying to help us and we ended up walking away (we did not get suckered into buying anything). Arriving at the EDM, other posted reviews are accurate in that the access road is long, and narrow with a lot of sharp turns through the middle of jungle/brush. Don\u2019t let this scare you, as you eventually arrive at the resort, which is very beautiful. Check in was very easy with a glass of champagne (each of us actually had two glasses) and a cool wash cloth offered upon arrival. Our room was ready when we arrived, which was around 2:30, so they did allow an early check in (check in is usually 3:00). Be aware that when you check in, the staff will ask for your credit card up front and they preliminarily charge 5,000 pesos (approximately $500) to your credit card. This is not a big deal because you settle any charges at check out time. At check out, I settled with travelers checks and cash, and the 5,000 peso charge was removed from my card. One of the few complaints I had was that they did not take our luggage to the room right away. After waiting in our room 30 minutes or so, I checked back at the front desk and the luggage was still sitting in the same spot. Once I informed the staff, they immediately delivered our luggage to our room. I think another reviewer mentioned their luggage getting stolen at check in, so upon checking in, you will want to make sure that they deliver your luggage to your room right away. RESORT GROUNDS/BEACH Our arrival day was the same day that tropical storm Dolly arrived. We beat the storm by a couple of hours. When we arrived, the grounds crew was taking preparations (removing outside furniture, boarding windows, etc.) for the storm. Let me say that the grounds crew did an excellent job not only in preparing for the storm, but also getting the EDM back to normal as quickly as possible after Dolly exited. The grounds crew worked very hard to clean the beach (washed up seaweed) and restore all of the outside furniture after the storm and got the resort back to normal quickly. Granted, Dolly was not a big storm when it hit and there really was no damage done by the storm, but the grounds crew still did an excellent job. Overall the grounds and the beach are beautiful and very well kept. It does seem as though the grounds crew are continuously maintaining the resort. I don\u2019t think that is a bad thing, as the grounds are kept up nicely. The fact that they continuously maintain the grounds was not an inconvenience or a burden to us when we were relaxing. The beach is a white sandy beach, with a few small pebbles here and there in the sand, nothing that hurt the feet. Other than that, the sand is mostly very soft to the feet. The water is very warm and some good sand bars to swim out to. There is quite a bit of seaweed in the water, but the seaweed is avoidable and there are plenty of areas to swim in. There are plenty of beach beds and beach chairs on the beach and by the pools. Obtaining a beach bed or beach chair is not a problem as there are more than enough. EDM was less than 50% capacity during our stay, so it was very easy to find isolated spots on the resort if we wanted peace and quiet. Having the resort less than 50% capacity also helped claiming beach beds, but I must say that even if the EDM was near or at capacity, it seems as though there are plenty of beach beds. There are two swimming pools in which both pools the water is very warm. Both pools have swim up bars for drinks through out the day. Other reviewers complained that there is no other bar open during the day except the pool bars. This is true but it does not matter as you do not have to be in the pool to get drinks. You can walk up adjacent to the pool bars and order drinks and there are plenty tables adjacent to the pool bars to sit with your drinks. Next to EDM, there is a marina, which is owned by the same management group. Other posters have noted that the presence of the marina did not give the EDM the total seclusion that they advertise. This is somewhat true. While you are on the EDM resort, you will definitely notice excursions coming and going from the marina next door, but there really is no impact to while you are on the resort, and quite frankly, the marina activity did not bother us. The activity at the marina was not overly obnoxious. If you take a walk by the marina (off the resort), you definitely notice more of the activity. Plus, activity at the marina starts around 9 am, but the activities wind down around 5 pm, so from late afternoon on through the evening and dinner, there is minimal to no activity at the marina. The marina actually has some shops over there, which were nice to have, because if you don\u2019t feel like leaving the resort, you can still go purchase some souvenirs for family or kids at the marina. ROOMS We stayed in a swim up suite, room number 802. This suite is all they way at the end of the newer section of the hotel away from the beach. This suite was nice in the respect that we felt we were secluded from many other guests. However, where this room is situated, while sitting on the patio (the swim up area), it is adjacent to where there is a lot of foot traffic from hotel staff (grounds crew, breakfast/lunch staff at the Sabores restaurant). It is also next to the ATV and horse trails that the marina utilizes for excursions. All of this extra activity really did not bother us, but just be aware if this is where your room is located. The room itself was very nice and spacious. There is a Jacuzzi tub large enough for two people. There is also an outside shower in which obtaining the right water pressure can be a little tricky, but once the right water pressure is obtained, the outside shower is very nice; we both liked it better than the indoor shower. Take note that when exiting the room to go to the patio, the sliding glass door automatically locks when it is shut. You can easily lock yourself out of your room (we did the first day!). One other complaint we had was relative to the turn down service of our room. We never, not once had towel art. Even though we saw plenty of pictures on trip advisor of towel art, and we knew of other people at the resort that got towel art, and, after we specifically asked the concierge three different times if we could get towel art at least once, we still never got any towel art. Overall, this was not a big deal at all, but you\u2019d think that after we asked three times, you\u2019d think we would have gotten towel art at least once. We still don\u2019t understand why we didn\u2019t get towel art. Furthermore, the turn down service/house keeping service for our room was not consistent with replenishing our bathroom supplies such as shampoos and soaps. This is one aspect in which we were disappointed with (still, it really was not a big deal and obviously did not diminish our vacation). FOOD/RESTAURANTS I need to say up front that I am a very picky eater (picky in that I don\u2019t like a lot of foods \u2013 I am happy with pizza or macaroni and cheese, etc.). So I was a little worried about having to eat gourmet foods and not liking anything. With that said, there was not one meal that I was not satisfied with. I thought the food was outstanding. Of the three restaurants (Mia \u2013 Italian, Sabores \u2013 Mexican, Kiyoko \u2013 Japanese), the Japanese was our favorite. The menu\u2019s aren\u2019t huge, but there is plenty enough of variety where the choices do not get old. Also, the portions are the right size, not too small and not too big. If a portion is too small, order another entr\u00e9e. You can order as much as you want. If there is something you want that is not on the menu, ask, and they will bring it or do their best to accommodate you. Trust me, it worked for me several times (I wanted a chocolate milkshake with lunch one day. It wasn\u2019t on the menu, but they made one). There is a dress code for dinner time. For males you are supposed to wear slacks, shirt (polo or button down) and shoes (no sandals or tennis shoes). However, they really are not strict with this policy as I saw plenty of guys wearing t-shirts, shorts and sandals. I would recommend bringing at least one pair of pants and dress shoes. Room service was also very good. The menu for room service is scaled down with not as much variety as the restaurants, but they were always on time or even earlier than what they said with respect to delivery time. I did find that the alcohol at times seemed watered down, but not always. This was not a big deal to us as we weren\u2019t there to get drunk every day. However, this falls back in the category of ask for what you want. If an alcoholic beverage seems watered down, ask for more alcohol on the next beverage, I am sure they will accommodate you TIPPING Tipping is not required. I did tip when I felt it was warranted (I did not tip every time). Not in large amounts, just a dollar or two here and there. Any time you tip, the staff is very appreciative. I have to say I did NOT notice a difference in the level service whether I tipped or I didn\u2019t tip. EXCURSIONS Lomas travel has an office on site in which they offer plenty of options for excursions off of the resort. One day we took an excursion to Xel-Ha. We did have a little trouble in the morning in that our transportation did not arrive. It seemed to be an isolated case that doesn\u2019t happen all the time. They corrected the situation and paid for a taxi to take us to Xel-Ha. I have to say taking the taxi was much better than riding the bus back to the resort at the end of the day. The bus transportation transports several people from several resorts, so be ready to make several stops on the way to the excursion or returning to the resort. A taxi is much more efficient time wise, but if it is paid out of your pocket, a taxi will be more expensive than the travel group. NIGHTLIFE Not much to say about the night life, other than there is not much of a nightlife at EDM. There is Rick\u2019s bar which does host live entertainment and bands (the bands were sometimes loud though). But the bar was always far from packed. Rick\u2019s does also have a pool table, darts, and board games. It was a nice option though for a nightcap if desired. SPA The spa was wonderful. We both got a massage at the sky hut over the water at 10 pm at night with the sound of the water and breeze and the sky hut lit with candles. It was heavenly. One negative is that one of the spa brochures lists a thermal mud massage, which my wife was interested in, but it apparently is not offered anymore as the spa staff seemed confused why we were asking about that spa treatment and said that it did not exist. SERVICE OF STAFF Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful. The wait staff for meals was excellent. The turn down service/maid service was a little spotty (as mentioned above). The front desk was very helpful. The concierge was friendly, but seemed to just be a liaison to the vacation club presentation that we sat through. We did sit through a Vacation Club presentation, which was not high pressure. It lasted for about an hour, but it was worth it as we got $150 off of our final checkout fee. CHECKOUT Checkout was very easy. There were no problems with the conversion rate, getting overcharged, or any hidden fees/charges. Like I said before, I settled with cash, so the 5,000 peso charge to my credit card was removed. SUMMARY Other than the minor problems listed above, our stay at the EDM was wonderful. If not for those minor problems, I would have rated it a five out of five. Again, I highly recommend the EDM for any couple that is looking for total peace and relaxation.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Hill, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cIt sucks...\u201d", "Author": "CTinSO", "ReviewID": "UR18135364", "Content": "\u2026that the other two of Karisma\u2019s resorts we\u2019ve visited (The one\u2019s at Playa Kantenah) don\u2019t have this fantastic beach, WOW! With a short period of time left in the \u2018Roo, we decided to add visit to El Dorado Maroma and visit our friend Ana on July 6th. This sweet 72 room resort is nothing short of the standards set by Karisma. The facilities are divided into two, yet blended well, sections. On the north side you have the charm of the older \u201cMexican style\u201d renovated units, with 2 restaurants, upstairs bar & swim-up bar. On the southern side there\u2019s the state of the art newer section with 4 story units, swim-ups & infinity pools, main restaurant, activities/infinity pool & bar. Some additions soon to come include pizza ovens (Like those at EDSS) and a more permanent nightly activities & entertainment area. The staff is all (including housekeeping, groundskeepers, bar/restaurant , and concierge services) at the same high standards expected by management. We ate in the newer main restaurant, which is open for all 3 meals. For lunch, buffet style snacks are available while you wait for your order, and the food is up to par with that of the other Karisma resorts we\u2019ve been to. Most of the guests we met were very open and relaxed. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone not being so while there. Ages ranged generally from mid 20s to mid 60s and although it\u2019s listed as \u201cadults only\u201d, there were 2 sixteen year olds staying there at the time, both very well behaved. We did encounter 2 women in the front lobby, rather loudly, indignantly and rudely stating that they were travel agents and since they were being comp\u2019d at another Karisma resort, they were entitled to the same at Maroma as well. The manger handled it courteously with diplomacy and of course I walked out at that time to avoid giving the 2 women my take on how to deal with \u201cissues\u201d at any resort no matter who you think you are! One suggestion to the management\u2026 Get a sign or something out on Hwy. 307! Very hard to find unless you\u2019ve been given explicit directions.

I read a lot of the trip advisor reviews before we left. Most all of them were positive, and there were a few negative comments about the service, food and drinks. I have to say we had zero complaints about the service, food or drinks. Whoever wrote those reviews must be hard to please. Here is more information about our stay: Hotel Rooms: There are only 72 rooms which makes this hotel great\u2026no crowds, no fighting for beach chairs or beach beds, etc. There is an old section and a new section. The old section has been updated. The old section is referred to as \u201cMi Hotelito\u201d. We stayed in the old section, room 201. We had an ocean view and were right in front of a swim up bar and pool and steps away from the beach. We actually preferred the old section. We had a cute patio with a table and an outdoor bed. The room had a lot of charm. The nightly turn down service was a nice added touch. Service: We could go on and on about the fabulous service we received. The staff was exceptional. Due to the small size of the resort you get to know the staff very well. Some of the staff members who made our stay so great were Mario, Diego, Ivan, Edwin and Roger. Although tipping is not expected because it is an all-inclusive resort, we took a lot of dollar bills so we could tip the staff. They work very hard and deserved the tips we gave them. Food and Drinks: I wasn\u2019t expecting much as far as food is concerned. The food has always been just \u201cok\u201d at all the other resorts I\u2019ve stayed. However, the food at Maroma was an exception. You eat at the same place for breakfast and lunch. At night, the Oriental, Mexican and Italian restaurants are all in the same building, and you don\u2019t have to make reservations. There was a lot of variety. You could go the whole week and not eat the same thing. There are not buffets like you typically see at larger resorts. All eating is sit-down restaurant style. The Mexican restaurant is \u201cGourmet Mexican\u201d not Tex-Mex which most Americans are used to, but it is still good. Portion sizes are just right. If you are hungry, order more. Make sure you have dessert because it\u2019s great. We personally loved the Apple Strudel and the Flan. You could also have your food delivered to you outside. We ate lunch on one of the outdoor beach beds. Room service is available 24/7. Someone commented about the drinks not having enough alcohol. We had plenty of strong drinks. Our favorites were the Strawberry Daiquiri, Pina Colada, Miami Vice and Mango Margarita. Beach: The beach area was gorgeous. The sand was white and powdery. There weren\u2019t really any waves so it made it nice to hang out in the ocean. We brought inflatable rafts and laid on them in the ocean. You could walk out far and still touch the bottom which was great. They have a kayak you can use and snorkeling equipment. You might want to ask for the snorkeling equipment early because they have a low number and it was checked out the whole time we were there. There were plenty of chairs and wonderful beach beds. These were great for shade and afternoon naps. Excursions: There is a Marina next door. There you can rent jet skis, parasail and snorkel. This stuff is not included. However, for snorkeling I recommend Captain Memo. Captain Memo: I read about him on Trip Advisor. To find him, you walk out to the beach and go left for approximately 20 to 25 minutes. You will pass the marina and then a large house that is in the process of being built. You won\u2019t pass any other hotels just unoccupied land. You will see the signs he has made on the beach. There is a structure made out of wood and he has old plastic bottles hanging from it. His boat should be sitting right directly across from his signs out in the ocean. The sail boat is old, but don\u2019t let this scare you. He is a very nice man. He only charges $35 per person for up to 6 people. He takes you sailing for about 2 hours and then snorkeling for an hour. He schedules the trips at 10 AM and 2 PM. It is best to catch him around 9:45, 1:30 or 5:15. We found him and booked our trip a couple of days later. You do have to walk out into the water to get to his boat. You can take a beach bag and just hold it over your head as you walk to his boat. The water only gets about neck high. Overall, we had a great time and will definitely go back.

Everything from the food, drinks, service, atmosphere and entertainment was excellent. We loved the small, quite feel of the place. We had seclusion when we wanted it, we had group therapy time when we needed it (Swim up bar). For those who have complained about drinks not being strong enough, I am just glad no one saw me adding water to my margarita's. We opened up the room service menu our first morning and got as far as the Mars and Maya. Spinach and mushroom/Ham and cheese omelettes. This was accompanied with fresh fruit, pico and guacamole, toast, tomato juice, and a pot of coffee. \"it will be in your room in 35 minutes\"... Usually within 15-20 minutes it was delivered and set up on the table on the patio. We had the same thing every morning it was so good, I wish I had it this morning. We missed most of the theme lunches under the picnic palapa, except for the 4th of July Barbeque, which was outstanding. The ribs/steak was awesome, like eating in someones backyard, including more pico and guacamole. (Both the pico and Guac are some of the best we have ever had). Our favorite Restaurant was the Italian, with the best tuna carpaccio ever, and the best waiter ever (Carlos). The nightly entertainment at Rick's Bar was so laid back and enjoyable. Two nights, there were a band of four guys, playing rock, and two nights there were two girls that were amazing. My boyfriend went fishing one morning with a couple of guys from our hotel (Sean and Mark), right from the marina next door, and I enjoyed a massage/facial, which I would highly recommend. That evening the fresh catch of the morning was prepared for six of us at the Italian restaurant. One of the little things that was such a nice touch, was the aromatherapy in the room. Our room was #211, overlooking the smaller pool, where you could still see the ocean. The room was cleaned when we left every morning, and in the evening, they came in for turndown service, and it always smelled so good. In reading some of these reports prior to our trip, we could not believe for a moment that anyone could find negative things to say about this resort.

Our review of the first half of the week can be found under the Azul reviews. EDM used to be called Mi Hotelito before it was bought by Karisma hotels. The old side of the hotel is still referred to as Mi Hotelito. This side is romantic with Mexican charm and flavor. Every room has an outside bed on a balcony or patio and is tastefully if a bit sparsely decorated. The roofs of the old side buildings are all thatched and give the appearance of two story palapas. The new side has better rooms but has none of the charm of the older side. It could be a block of hotel rooms anywhere. Each room in the new side does have a jacuzzi tub and some are swim-up. The first room we were put in was 201. The moment we walked in we were overwhelmed by some strange smell. Not such a great start. My fiancee spent the next 45 minutes trying to figure out what it was and where on earth it was coming from. Well it turns out that smell was raw sewage and it was coming from the malfunctioning toilet. Now things happen and they are newly opened so fine. But clearly they knew there was an issue as a large amount of incense had been place in the room (most of it in the bathroom) in an attempt to mask the smell. We called the front desk and were immediately moved to an upstairs room 111. Keep in mind that if you have knee problems or any type of mobility issue there are no elevators and you will need a room on the first floor. The second room was gorgeous and smelled fine. Now this wasn't such a big deal to us but I would not have been happy had they done this to our wedding guests. Later in the week we passed the old room to see a work crew jack hammering up the bathroom floor. They told us the problem was known and the room was scheduled to be fixed. Oye. My only complaint with the older side rooms besides the potential for a sewage issue was that the shower fixtures were old and creaky and the shower had no real curtain. This meant you had to be really careful about the spray of the water or it ended up all over the floor. Not a big deal but annoying. If you are going to stay in the older section I would request a second floor room if you don't mind the stairs. The beach is expansive and the only other thing you see when walking for miles is a house being built to the right of the hotel. The beach is good but if you have tender feet water shoes would be best. There is a lot of coral and little rocks. Now this may be close to Maroma beach but Maroma beach it ain't. You can walk to Maroma beach from here but if this is not sugary soft white sand. The water was nice and shallow for a good ways out and clear as a bell. There were lots of little fish if you were up for a little snorkeling. A five minute boat ride gets you the reef and some excellent snorkeling. The beach beds were heaven absolute heaven. We had no problem getting a beach bed. Now the beach butler could use a little work as she was hard to find most of the time. The beach butler at Azul beach was so fantastic that perhaps we were expecting the same. But nonetheless she would bring you whatever you fancied. We had a simple lunch of sandwhiches brought to our bed and for a beach bum this is heaven. I've attached a photo. Just behind the last few beach beds is a beautiful white stone chapel. It's just lovely and when you open the doors you are looking at the caribbean. Oh and it's air conditioned! It can seat 65 people. The wedding coordinators here are Gilberto and Rafaela. They both were great but Gilberto won my trust right away. He was very sweet, clearly cares about his work and was very honest. I'd recommend him in a heart beat. The food was good at all 3 restaurants but really I think Azul wins in this category. The Italian was better than I expected and the fresh fish was superb. The Asian was just okay. The sushi was supermarket sushi not nice restaurant sushi. I admit, I love sushi and have eaten at the best of the best. Overall in the food category Azul is better. From decor to service to quality of food they have EDM beat. While the service was fine overall they definately have some new hotel kinks to work through and I imagine the service will get better with time. The servers tried their best but several times we got things we didn't order and more than once two separate servers brought our meal twice. Whoops. Good thing my honey can eat. There is a marina next door that didn't bother me a bit. Yes they have jet skiis but I didn't find them annoying and for a wedding it will be nice for guests to walk next door for activities. So with hopes that the service will only improve and kinks worked out we are going to book our wedding here. The beach beds, the beach itself and chapel won me over. Not to mention I truly trust Gilberto to do a fabulous job. One last note. If you are up for it they also offer a blessing for weddings performed by a Mayan shaman that seems quite authentic and unique.

We were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary so we were looking for a resort that was very peaceful, relaxing, and romantic and this resort definitely met all of our expectations. When arriving, I would recommend you plan for your transfer in advance, we reserved a personal car for transfer with Entertainment Plus. I highly recommend them and would use them again. Even though our plane was late, and our luggage lost, which added an extra 1 hr 1/2 to our arrival time, as soon as we walked outside we saw our name on a card, still waiting for us. They quickly put us in our car and we were on our way. Plus they were right on time for our departure. Even though our arrival was a little upsetting without any luggage, the staff did everything to make us feel comfortable, and even brought us a special dessert that night to surprise us in our room that said \"Happy Anniversary\". The food was excellent. I've read on previous reviews how the portions were small, but we were always satisfied. Plus you can order as much as you want. The Italian restaurant was our favorite. Our vacation was everything that we hoped for. The only negatives that we found was that the resort is still doing some renovations to some of the suites. So for several days you would overhear saws being used to cut tile and in our suite, we heard banging coming from upstairs. This was a little annoying, but we rarely stayed in our room during the day, so wasn't too big of a deal. Also, the marina is right next door, which is good in that you don't have to walk far to go on an excursion, but it would have been nicer if jetskis and boats weren't constantly coming in out of the marina all day. Overall, I was completely satisfied with our stay. It definitely is a little piece of heaven and is a hidden jewel. Also, please take cash so you can tip.

This did not go on all day, but at least a good 3 - 4 hours each day. It is annoying when you are trying to nap or relax and there is a constant pounding on tile. I know repairs must be made, but really, this section of the resort is only 6 months old! This resort is what everyone says - calm, quiet, and relaxing. I have been to 6 other AI's in the Playa/Cancun area and the rooms at EDM are the most spacious and beautiful I have been in. Our room was a swim up suite rm 602. We had a nice view of the pool and ocean. The patio area w/ bed, 2 chairs and a table was huge! The food was very good for an AI in Mexico. Room service was exceptionally fast and delicious. The waiters and waitresses were very nice and attentive. This is my first time to stay in a boutique resort, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. While \"quiet, and relaxing\" sounded great to me, I ended up feeling bored. Probably, much of this had to do with the weather (it rained/overcast EVERYDAY - not the resort's fault). There really isn't much at all to do here - especially at night. One night at Rick's there was a 4 member band and 4 people in the entire place! I had to stay on the activities director to do anything other than volleyball - finally, after me bugging him repeatedly, they set up a cocktail class and a cooking class poolside. These were VERY FUN!!! My husband and I had a \"sunrise couples massage\" on the sky deck above the water. It was WONDERFUL!!! for 160.00 we each had a 50 minute massage followed w/ a glass of mimosa. In hindsight, we wished we would have booked their special - 80 minutes for 105.00 each. You can also have that special in the sky deck. By far, the most fun we had was sailing/snorkeling with Captain Memo. When you leave the resort, take a left and walk for 25-30 minutes. You will see some netting decorated w/ driftwood and old buoys and a small sign. He takes small groups (2 - 4 - 6 at most) out at 10 and 2 for 2 hrs of sailing and 1 hr snorkeling. Memo was friendly, amazing, and the BEST value for 35.00 per person. We had never sailed before and were surprised by how relaxing and calm it was. I HIGHLY recommend finding Captain Memo. Thank you to the previous trip advisor reviewers that mentioned him. We met some really fun people from Colorado (Hi Bicky, Edwin, Mike and Wanda Woman), and had a lot of fun with them. I won't return to EDM just as a matter of personal preferance - I enjoy a larger resort with more to do - - If you booked this resort for a quiet, relaxing trip, hopefully by then repairs will be complete and you will have a blast.

We asked if there was a 2nd floor room available and they had another room ready within an hour or so. We were very pleased with the view and cleanliness of the room.

We looked at some the \"eco-friendly\" resorts down in Tulum, as we wanted that sort of remote, off the beaten path feel. But we decided that air conditioning and electricity were on the high on the list of priorities. Our friends stay at some of these and really like them, but it wasn't for us. We have a coffee table book that has \"The Tides\" hotel in it, and listed it as one the top places to stay in the world. So I went on the best travel website in the world, Tripadvisor.com, to check out the reviews on The Tides. Reviews looked great but the El Dorado Maroma (EDM) kind of jumped out at me for the value. Booked through Orbitz, as they had the best combined deal with airfare. About $600.00 less then all the other travel sites. We flew on Alaska Airlines and they are by far the best way to get to Mexico. We rented a car (which I would not do again) as we thought we would want to explore the area. But once we plunked down on the awesome beach we didn't want to leave. Warning to anyone driving themselves, The hotel is difficult to find and the only sign says \"Mi Hotelito\" not EDM. We drove past this place at least 4 times before we pulled in. You may have read in other reviews that the narrow road to the hotel is not the best. But it is now paved, but it is real narrow. I kind of liked the road, through the mangroves. It made me feel we were heading off the beaten path to our own little slice of paradise. We get the hotel and Diego greeted us with such warmth that I felt we were family. He walked us into the very nice, but very small lobby where we were handed a refreshing cold towel and a glass of champagne. Check in was a breeze, Diego took us on a small tour of the hotel and then took us to our room. We were in room 341 which most of the staff felt was the best room in the hotel. It is on the 4th floor , on the end. The ocean view from this room was incredible. It had a infinity pool on the deck (which we never used) and the room was spacious and clean. WARNING: The hotel does not have any elevators, we had to climb up 4 flights of stairs and back down multiple times a day. We loved that and felt it was part of our daily work out. But someone not in the greatest shape or knee/leg problems might want to ask for a ground floor room. ROOM: The room was spacious clean and the bed was really, really comfortable. The mini bar was included in the all inclusive (AI) and had a selection of Mexican beers and sodas and some OJ. The outdoor shower was beyond belief incredible, if you are on the top floor the shower is open to the sky, on the lower floors it has a thatched roof for privacy. But taking a shower with the hot sun overhead was something not to be missed, even at night under the stars was a treat. If you can make the climb to the 4th floor, do it just for the open roof shower. I took 2 to 3 showers everyday, it was that great. Room also has a nice jacuzzi tub for two. Robes and slippers were provided, along with a blow dryer, iron and room safe. FOOD: For a A.I. the food was outstanding. Sometimes I felt they were trying to hard to be gourmet, but really the food was excellent. You have a choice of 3 different restaurants, Italian, Mexican and Japanese. All there were good. We always had the house wine with dinner (red or white) and both were good Chilean wines. They have a wine list you can choose from but that is extra, and I thought the house wines were good. Portion sizes are small (compared to the massive portions served in American restaurants) more like spa cuisine portions. We liked the portion sizes though and never felt stuffed. And we didn't feel guilty about ordering desserts. We had room service (breakfast) delivered twice to our room, took about 20 minutes and was real good. Couple of days for lunch the had some extra fun stuff for us. One day the fishing boats came up on the beach, you got to pick out the fish you wanted and the chef would grill it or fry it whole. Another day was taco day, then a bbq day. It was nice. BEACH: Was great, yes it is not very wide, but it was excellent. Water was crystal clear and warm. Sand was white and soft. We always had a queen size covered beach bed and lounge chairs for our use. Snorkeling off the shore is pretty much non-existent. But a 5 - 10 minutes boat ride out to the reef and the snorkeling is much better. Next door is a small marina if you want to rent jet skis, go scuba or snorkeling, go on a booze cruise catamaran, parasail, etc. Everyday I thought about doing these things, but was so relaxed chilling on the beach I could never find the strength. The marina was quiet and did not bother us at all The best thing about this hotel is the remoteness. Every morning my wife and myself would walk down the beach approx. 3 to 4 miles away from the hotel. The whole way not a single other hotel (just one huge house being built) it really felt like you were away from it all. The walks were the best part of the trip. The beach was awesome for the whole 3 to 4 miles. SERVICE: Everyone that works at the hotel is so friendly! They told me that is a great place to work and it really shows in their attitude and smiles. EVERYONE WAS EXTRA KIND AND SERVICE EXCELLED. One morning I mentioned to our waiter Mario that I was they had some hotter salsa for my eggs. He went into the kitchen and made me two different kinds of habenero salsa (his mother recipes he said) that were incredible. We always heard \"it was a pleasure to serve you\", and had many interesting conversations with the wait staff. Very gracious people. My only complaint is the wait staff was pretty scarce when we were on the beach. DRINKS: The drinks are included in the A.I. but the mixed drinks had little to no alcohol in them. We didn't do it, but agreed on our next trip to order a mixed drink with a shot backer . I only pretty much drank the beer and wine so this wasn't much of a problem for me. SPA: We had 3 massages while we were there, and 1 facial. All were amazing, and top notch! High marks for the spa ENTERTAINMENT: Warning! If you are looking for a hotel with lot's of exciting nightlife this is your worst choice! There really is nothing to do at night! Yes they have the one bar open, Ricks bar. They had a really good band (playing classic rock) on 3 nights from 9:30 to 11:00 pm but that is it! This is not a party hotel! But that is exactly why we loved it here. Most nights were in bed by 10:00 pm and up at 5:30 am for our morning walks! That is my idea of a raging party! WOO HOOO! PROS: Ideal remote location on a powderdy white beach with warm crystal clear water. Great food, awesome wait staff , great room, awesome spa CONS: Better service on the beach, and better mixed drinks. By the way, as in every hotel in Mexico they hit you up to go through a timeshare presentation. We did to get our $150.00 off, but it wasn't the real high pressure sales pitch I have experienced in other hotels. We are heading back in October, and we both agree this will be the only place we stay anytime we go back to the Mayan Rivera. We did go and tour The Tides hotel, which is about double the price of the EDM and not A.I. It was super exclusive and nice, but we liked the EMD better and the greater value.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas city", "Title": "\u201cThey tried so hard, and everyone was very nice\u201d", "Author": "rayaKansasCity", "ReviewID": "UR16833346", "Content": "We arrived on a Saturday. After familiarizing ourselves with the resort, we realized that there was not much to do. So, we upgraded our room to a unit with a private pool, jacuzzi, and outdoor shower. The room was very nice. Dinner was at the Italian restaurant. Portions are very small, but tasty. On day 2 we started to meet a few people as we laid around the pools, and walked on the beach. That night we wound up in a group of about 20 people and dined at the Japanese Restaurant. It was pretty good. That evening we heard that a few people at the resort were sick. In fact some friends we met from Texas were in their rooms extremely ill. That night we got to our room and my wife was very sick all night long. That pretty much sums up our vacation because we both spent the next 3 days sick . The room service was good and they tried so hard to make us comfortable. They sent up a dozen bottles of Gatorade and made us some chicken soup from scratch one night . We heard there were between 40 and 50 people sick in the hotel. I guess it was going on in several hotels. The Hotel was nice for a couple days getaway. Seven nights was definately too long there. We're not gourmet food people. If that is your thing you might like the food. Breakfast was the best meal of the day. There was a little entertainment on the beach the first night and after that nothing for a week. I guess several late nighters would go to Ricks Bar and dance. The best part of the trip was walking north on the beach to Maroma Beach which was absolutely beautiful. The white sands and the turquoise water were definately something to experience. There were areas around the hotel which had a strong septic tank odor.

We were upgraded to an infinity pool suite. I had been looking forward to the swim up suite, but when we saw the view from our room (Building 3) I immedietly fell in love with it. We only used our plunge pool a couple times, because we spent more time on the beach. We also enjoyed the jet tub and the bed was very comfortable. I was very impressed with the food at all the restaurants. I am a bigger guy who definitely doesn't lack an appetite and I never felt disatisfied with the amount of food I had. We ordered room service a couple times and only had one time that it took a while to get to us. The only thing I would say they could improve about the room service is increasing the selection. However, when we asked for something that wasn't on the menu, they did their best to accomodate and we usually got it. The beach is fabulous. We used the snorkeling equipment a couple times and saw a couple colored fish and a large school of silver fish, all right in front of the resort. The beach service is great and I we never lacked a drink. In some of the other reveiws I've read people complained about the strength of the drinks and the speed of service. We always had plenty of alchol in our drinks and the service was quick, so no complaints. The staff was great and ready to help with any request. Although there are some things that need to be worked out, they seem to be working hard to make their guests as happy as possible. There's so much more I could say about our trip and how great the resort was, but most of it is covered in the other positive reviews. I'll end by saying that I read almost all the reviews about EDM on tripadvisor before and after deciding on it. The bad reviews I've read seem to be either extreme rare circumstances or from people who have expectations of a resort that can only be met at places like the Four Seasons, Hilton, Etc. The EDM met all our expectations.

The setting: We were there on our honeymoon. We got married at the Moon Palace (wish we would have stayed) and then headed over to the Maroma for a week. We are 25 years old from the South, just to give you a demographic. (I find that in reviews a lot of people around the same age, from the same area, have similar tastes/expectations.) The Beach: The beach right in front of the hotel is tiny. Literally it is maybe 10-12 feet from where you sit to the water and just as wide as the hotel. Laying out in front of the hotel, If you look to your right, you'll what was once a pier, and beyond that underdeveloped beach that has logs/wood all over it. In other words, you can't walk down for any seclusion. To the left, you will see how the Marina sits right on top of the resort and has travel buses coming in all day long. The beach widens beautifully beyond the marina, and we tried to escape down there to get away from the main resort. It didn't take us long to move however, because this is where all the tour buses come in for the marina. They use it for atvs, horseback rides, etc. Personally I think this should be reserved for the people who are paying a lot of money to stay there. The Water: The water was not bad. It was comparable to the Moon Palace water. The Maroma does have large barriers about 100 yards out in the water to keep the beach from washing away (not much left to wash away though.) It's not very attractive, but not a huge deal to me really. The Rooms/Hotel: Inside, the rooms were really nice. The beds were comfortable. We had a 2nd floor w/ infinity pool balcony. We never even got in the pool. BEWARE that there are only a few rooms that overlook the ocean. Ours overlooked the restaurant, and the sun never even hit the pool. The grounds to the hotel are too small. If the Marina was not there, it would help this place sooooo much. Even though there are not many rooms, which is one of the biggest reasons I chose the Maroma, it still feels packed because there is just nowhere to go. This still place needs a lot of work. The Food: This was my first trip to Mexico and originally I did not use the quality of food to determine where I stayed; I did not think it would be a big deal. After spending a week with the Maroma's \"gourmet cuisine,\" I learned my lesson. Overall, the food is not good. The Japanese place was not bad, the Italian place was terrible, and the Mexican place was ok. Never did I have a meal and say \"wow, that was really good.\" And I am not a picky eater in any way, shape or form. The room service wasn't bad, and that is what we ended up eating the entire time. The only problem is there are only a handful of options, so it gets old if you stay very long. The Service: Well, this is Mexico. The chance of getting good service is a crap shoot. I couldn't get my bags carried up to my room, so I did it myself. We couldn't get ice. We couldn't get more drinks. Sometimes they would not even answer the phone down in the lobby. They made us change rooms because they screwed up the reservation. We left our champagne in the other room and later that day, once we realized it, we asked for another one. They wouldn't budge even though it was our honeymoon. We had MUCHO room reservation problems. They got them resolved, but it took about 2 days worth of us being on their *** about it. We really got a heavy run-around there. However there was one lady, Jaqueline, who worked very hard for us and we appreciated her. The Drinks/Bars: If you lay out on the beach, the lady will come by about once every 20 minutes. I kept having to get up and go to the bars. Sure, it is not a big inconvenience, but still it is irritating. Sometimes she would disappear for a couple of hours. Also, be advised that there is no bar in the whole place other than the pool bars. That is a big deal when you want to just go somewhere and sit and have some drinks. You basically have to sit in the pool to do this. You cannot even order drinks to the room, and there is no stocked bar. So where do you go to comfortably sit and have drinks??? Well, they do have a little patio with about 5 tables, but it was always full. Not nearly big enough for a hotel with 70+ rooms. We will add photos later.

Clearly they are still working the kinks out of this particular resort. The service and the people are very good. They were helpful and tried to satisfy your requests. We stayed in the new section and had a third floor suite with infinity pool etc. and we enjoyed a great view of the water. They need to work on their room decor as it was a little stark but it was very comfortable. We got to know the room very well as it rained four of the eight days we were there but that's not their fault. The food we found was very good particularly for an all-inclusive. It was well presented and was not the the excessive portions that you find so often in restaurants these days. If you are looking for the never ending buffet then go to one of the resorts down the coast that has 600 rooms and hundreds of people. We liked all three menus but they did not change it during the time we were there. If it is not on the menu ask for it they will try and prepare it for you. They did a fish market on the beach for lunch one day that was very good with grilled fish which was caught that morning but was not repeated. It was a great alternative to the restaurant. This is something that added to the experience so you didn't have to \" get dressed \" for lunch. Half way through our stay they closed one restaurant and bar and you had to go to the other building for all the evening meals. This created a problem as there was no bar open after 5:00 and Rick's didn't open until 6:00. This is a great place to have a drink on the beach or around the pool before going to dinner yet there was none available. Something they will need to work on if this is going to be a first class resort is continious bar service on the beach / at the pool. The marina next to the resort is good news/ bad news. Lomas runs the marina so your excursions are just next door. Very short walk to many of the activities that have to do with water. We took a snorkle tour with about 30 people which worked out okay. the down side to this is the noise,fumes etc. that periodicaly come at you while you are on the beach. While the beach itself is small it is very pleasent and the water is great. The beach service was good for drinks and if you wanted lunch they would bring you lunch on the beach. We took walks on the beach every day and indeed the beach to the north of the resort is much better particularly as you get closer to Punta Maroma. Now that's a beach!!! We used the Spa twice for massage and facials. One experience was excellent compared to others we have had. The second one was very poor. We attribute this to the personel who actually performed the service. Inexperienced vs experienced. Oh yes, be prepared for the \"pitch\" about a vacation club. You can skip it if you feel your time could be better spent. We ejoyed the service , the food, the small number of people, the room, and parts of the beach.

Room service never, never showed up and never answered the telephone at night. The booze was watered down deluxe. You could drink all day and night and only get a sugar rush. They have no ice makers and you have to order ice. The food sucked and was always the same! I quit eating. I like Mexican regional cuisine that features the local seafood and you will not find it here. You could not order drinks to your room. All the activities there consisted of follow the leader. I hate watching people jet ski, etc., in single file. For R&R, it was okay; pretty beach. But definitely, it was not the experience I seek in Mexico or the Caribbean.

Pros: Room was wonderful, good ocean view, patio with bed, chairs and table, spotless, comfortable bed, nice TV and stocked mini fridge. Stayed in 621 and can not see what all the hoopla is about for the swim-up and plunge pool rooms! Our view was great. Food was really good, enjoyed every meal especially the Asparagus Soup at Mio, portions were sufficient, we even skipped meals because we were not hungry. Fruit smoothies were \"fabulous!\" Please have a \"few\" for me. The staff was wonderful, service for us was exceptional, if we wanted anything all we had to do was ask. For example, popcorn, already popped and ready to eat showed up at our door Sunday afternoon while we were chillin' and watching a movie. That was the highlight of my stay! Cons: Outdoor shower did not have a uniform spray, it went everywhere except on me. There is no where to hang wet clothes. You are asked not to hang them on your patio, so a good alternative would be to put some hooks in the outdoor shower so bathing suites, etc could dry. The floor in our indoor shower was not sloped enough so the water did not drain completely. I almost slipped down twice because of the water left in the shower. We went for a walk on the beach the first day we were there so our flipflops were wet after rinsing our feet. We left them outside our door so they could dry while we were at dinner, but when we returned, no shoes. Can't imagine where they went without us. I found items at the Marina and EDM too expensive to purchase. Check out the cost of flipflops! My biggest disappointment was the beach. The sand is wonderful, but the beach is not. We had to go down the beach, (way down the beach) to find suitable water that I would even consider putting my feet in. Water at the Marina has a film over it from all the gas in the boats and wave runners. Not going to get in that either!!!!!!!! We would have loved to go with Capt. Memo, but we ran out of time.

The resort is beautiful and made for a wonderful vacation. There have been so many good reviews already I'm not sure I have much to add that hasn't already been said, but I'll recap the highlights of our trip and viewpoint on the resort. Rooms - I'm not sure you could pick a wrong room at the resort although depending on your preference some are better than others. We (along with the other couple that traveled with us) stayed in a swim up suite in the new section which we loved. The room was large and very nice. We weren't sure how much we would use the \"swim up\" part, but we actually used it allot. We hung out in the \"river\" outside our rooms most afternoons and then swam to the pool and bar when we wanted. It was pretty cool. The room was very clean and the housekeeping service was great. We were never lacking for towels, etc. There is an indoor and outdoor shower along with a large jacuzzi tub. All three were great. There is a small refrigerator that is restocked daily with sodas, juice, and beer. The only thing I would have been disappointed in was if we would have gotten one of the rooms that didn't have a view of the ocean. Some of the swim up suites look at the back of the Mexican food restaurant. Try to request rooms 101, 102, 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, 402, 501, 502, 601, 602 if you can. These all have nice views. The view is blocked starting w/ room 701. We asked the hotel to tour a room in the older section just in case we came back as we might want to stay there for the price. The rooms were also very nice - just allot smaller than the swim up suite rooms in the new section. The older section did have more of a tropical feel to it. We also met a couple while we were there who showed us their room in the older section and it was much larger and nicer than the other room we saw. IT was a corner room so I guess that's why. It had an amazing view of the ocean (much better than our room did). It was room#216 and I highly recommend requesting it if you can. Also, I know there were several posts about people not getting the swim up suite they had reserved when they checked in. I was worried about this especially after several flight delays and getting to the hotel much later than planned, but we (nor the other couple we were traveling with) had any problems getting the room we reserved when we checked in late that night. Hopefully they have resolved any overbooking issues they had. Food - We thought the food was very, very good. Maybe not the best you will ever eat, but it is very good especially for an all inclusive resort. I know there were some posts about being hungry the whole time and not ever having enough food, but we found just the opposite. We were stuffed the whole time. Depending on what you order, you may need to order a few dishes, but they are more than happy to bring you as much food as you would like. There is also 24 hour room service so there is really no reason to be hungry unless you want to. The Japanese was our favorite, but all three were good. Beach/Pool - The beach was beautiful and so were the pools. You can walk what seems like forever on the very pretty sandy beach. The pools are also both nice and kept very clean. We actually preferred the smaller pool in the older section as it had more shade for those who wanted it and just had a more tropical feel. There are plenty of chairs and beds on the beach and both pools. We never had an issue of finding a place to hang out at and never had to reserve anything although we saw some people that did that, but it wasn't necessary. Captain Memo - So this was our favorite part of our whole trip. This is a must do if you have any interest at all in sailing or snorkeling. We read about him from other posts on trip advisor and were so glad that we had. You walk about a mile down the beach (to the left if you're facing the ocean). You'll pass a large palace/house that's being built and shortly past that you'll see a sign that says Captain Memo & 10am & 2pm. We went the day before and told him that we wanted to go out the next day. He takes you out (about 2-6 people) sailing for about an hour and then you snorkel an hour and sail back for about another hour. The sailing was awesome as was the snorkeling. It's $35/person and is much cheaper than the large snorkeling trips at the marina. It was truly a great experience. Spa - We had two massages while we were there and they were both great. Both times we had them on the massage/sky hut which was really nice. I saw other posts on the noise, but we didn't find it to be noisy at all and we just made sure we didn't schedule them when the yoga class was going on. Service - Okay, so I saved this for last because it is the only slightly negative comment we have. Before I comment I would like to say that it was only slightly poor service at times and it didn't take away from the great trip or our desire to return to the resort. Okay - so we were warned that the service was a little slow at times which we didn't mind at all. The thing we did have an issue with was when we booked our special dinner on the beach. When we showed up they said they thought it had been for the night before and they were booked that night and couldn't help us. We knew we had booked it for the correct night, but they didn't seem to care and didn't seem very interested in getting it reschedule. After talking to a few people we did get it rescheduled finally and it was very nice. We just didn't appreciate the attitude we received during this issue. Room service can be spotty. Most of the time it was very quick and accurate. There was a morning though that we waited over an hour for breakfast and when we finally called they apparently had lost/forgotten our order. The service at the restaurants is good but there are times you can ask for a coke or something 3-4 times and still never get it. Everyone seems very friendly and they seem to be trying very hard - they just seem to have a few kinks to work out. These were very few times though during our stay - the rest of the service was wonderful. Please let me know if you have any questions. You will love your stay if you decide to go to EDM!! PS - The pictures are all from 5/24-5/31 - we just had the date on our camera wrong for part of the trip until we realized it. :)", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Staff, Rooms--Loved our vacations, but some recommendations!\u201d", "Author": "LegoJoe", "ReviewID": "UR16562778", "Content": "*I will break this down per section, so if you are just looking for one main item...you can find it. BOOKING: We booked our stay through a travel agent and she recommended this hotel for a smaller option and another couple much bigger hotels. We opted for the 72-room, El Dorado Maroma and stayed here from May 25-May 31. TRANSFER: Before arriving in Cancun, we booked the private limo transfer from Cancun Airport to El Dorado Maroma through Lomas Travel. The cost was $100/each way so $200 total. We also added Mexican Beers (Corona) onto our ride and they were $4.50/each. We weren't sure what to expect for a \"limo transfer\" but when we arrived at Lomas Travel a Lincoln Navigator stretch limo was waiting! It was perfect--included ceiling lights, beer as I stated, video screen and upbeat music. (As a side note, I spoke with many other couples at the resort that paid almost the same price to ride in a hot tour van--I can highly recommend booking early for the private transfer. Your trip will be much more enjoyable) The ride from Cancun Airport to El Dorado Maroma is approx. 35-40 minutes. Other travelers are correct when they say that you arrive at a private road that isn't too pretty (although there is a security guard at all times). It takes about 5 minutes to drive down this road to the hotel. CHECK-IN: When we arrived to the front of the hotel, Diego (our fantastic concierge) was waiting right in front for us. He took our luggage and escorted us into the main lobby. As soon as we stepped into the lobby, we are offered cold hand towels and champagne. It was 12:00 and our room was ready, so Diego gave us the hotel tour and our hotel keys and walked us to our rooms. What a perfect check-in! It was seamless and we were impressed. (Note: check-in is 3 P.M.) ROOMS: We were in room 801 which is a swim-up jacuzzi suite. The lazy river connects to the room. We also traveled with 2 friends and they had the swim-up next door to us. I would highly recommend this room type--it is in the newer section of the hotel. The room comes complete with jacuzzi, canopy bed, flat screen TV, outdoor shower. Our outdoor shower had a thatched roof--our friend's did not have a roof. The maids come into the rooms 2 times per day, once to clean and once for the nightly turn-down with chocolates. The patio has a bed on it that 2 chairs/table. We spent many afternoons listening to music from our patio. RESTAURANTS: For breakfast, Sabores has a buffett with omelets or scrambled eggs or you can order from the menu. For lunch, Sabores is the only option. You can order from the menu or there is a small buffet. (Note: menu does not change) For dinner, your options are Italian, Japanese & Mexican restaurant for dinner. The portions are gourmet inclusive, so very small, but the food was very good. Japanese was our favorite; however, I am a big fan of spaghetti & meat sauce (simple) and they made it special for me once I asked at the Italian Restaurant. If you are a wine fan, they also have an upgraded wine list where you can purchase other wines besides the house wine. Also, room service is always an option; however, another couple told us they will not deliver it when it's raining. FISH FRY: El Dorado has a fish fry during the week. They set up the tables and chairs on the beach and fry the fish...complete with drinks and chips, etc. Great to change up the lunch menu during the week. SPECIAL ACTIVITIES: The hotel doesn't \"advertise\" the activities very well in my opinion...but we did do some fun things. We took part in the wine tasting (Carlos is the wine master and he's fantastic). Also: drink mixing class, guacamole making class, swim aerobics, beach volleyball, boche ball. BEACH: The beach is not a beach with with waves. They have inserted barriers so it is a flat beach. It's also not very deep. We walked about 2 miles down the beach towards the other resorts and my husband liked their beaches better. They were more swimmable. It is; however, very beautiful. The hotel cleans up the seaweed every day and the sand is white and great to walk on. They play spa music on the beach. The beach also has beach beds and lounge chairs. The beds are great--not hard to reserve! MARINA: Is right next door with options such as a party boat, jet-skis, small 2 person boats, sailing, etc. Also the shore excursions from the cruise boats come next door so they have horseback riding and ATV rentals. SPA: The spa is fantastic. I had the facial and massage (80 minutes total) and it was one of the best I have had. I preferred the indoor room; however, they have an outdoor above the water option. Try the cucumber water afterward...it's very refreshing! PROBLEMS: We had the infinity pool above us leaking onto our patio. We told Diego and it was fixed within 10 minutes. We were impressed with the amount of time if took to have the issue fixed to our satisfaction. TIP 1: If you have the jacuzzi swim up, we tipped the bartenders and they would serve us from our back patio from the lazy river--as long as we wanted!! It was great and made our stay even more enjoyable! Say hi to Jesus and Christian, the bartenders...they are the best!

For a comparative review of EDSS please see my review of that resort. After a fantastic stay at EDSS we had high expectations for El Dorado Maroma. Our travel agent had previously visited EDM several months prior and absolutely raved about the property and especially the beach, a \"top ten beach of the world\". Also every staff member at EDSS that we spoke to about EDM raved about it. So with great expectations we took off in a private limo transfer from EDSS to EDM for our honeymoon. The limo driver accidentally took us to El Dorado Royale thanks to a glitch courtesy of Lomas Travel (my sentiments leave much to be desired regarding Lomas). Oh well, two bottles of champagne and 20 more minutes and we arrived at EDM! As you approach the \"driveway\" to EDM it looks like a run down area with a gatekeeper holding a chain-linked rope to let you in. As you may have read elsewhere, the driveway to the resort is long (at least a mile), narrow (not big enough for 2 cars, although it happens), and curvy!! It is like a roller coaster, so make sure to dose up on dramamine when your plane lands if you get motion/car sick. As you pull up to the left is Marina Maroma and on the right is EDM. The lobby is a small room, nearly identical to EDSS only smaller scale, very nicely decorated. You get the welcome champagne, the usual free stuff. Check in was quick and painless for us, as our room was ready. The bell man gave us a quick walking tour of the place as it is very small (72 rooms!!) and showed us to our room. Service and staff are superb at EDM as well as EDSS. Our room was 612, an infinity pool suite overlooking the main pool. It was in the newer part of the resort, as the older part used to be known as \"Mi Hotelito\". You will still see this name on many of the hotel items such as robes and signs. It hasnt streamlined entirely it seems. The room was absolutely amazing, we preferred it over our swimup junior jacuzzi suite at EDSS. Very modern, huge, impeccably clean, and the infinity pool and deck were great. Outdoor shower was interesting but be careful, if you are in it for more than 5 minutes it fills up and when you open the door to go back into the bathroom water floods in!!!! Still fun. The beach...our biggest let down. Everyone raves about the \"top ten in the world\" maroma beach... well not so much in our opinion. We thought it would be a positive thing to be so close to a marina with all the activities....our opinion is changed now. The sand itself was amazing, powdered sugar in texture and nearly pure white....great! Do they have it flown in... who knows?! The water in front of the resort and marina is another story. While you may see crystal clear water in front of the resort in some pictures, dont be deceived because it actually looked black while we were there. Apparantly weather and tide carried in a large amount of seaweed, which unless you are a brave soul as many critters hide in seaweed, made it virtually un-swimmable. Water near and surrounding the marina had a brown-ish color to it from boat pollution, which we found disgusting. Even more disgusting were those swimming in that very same water! One day and on the beach by the marina were a dying seagull (there for hours until it died) and a sailfish carcass (there for our entire stay) ...an omen maybe? You must walk past the marina quite a ways to find the crystal clear water. There it is enjoyable. As previously mentioned, there is a fair amount of pollution and trash on the beach, mainly it seems from marina traffic and people. Marina Maroma seemed like a shack, and the \"expeditions\" seemed hokey. We would sit on the \"clean\" part of the beach and watch speed boat and wave runner tours go out into the ocean, usually about 10 vessels following a guide person on a boat/ski doo, and return in 10 minutes after making a large circle. Not impressive. Chose your \"expeditions\" wisely. Beach beds were usually available, no real issues attaining those throughout the day which was nice. There is no substantial, established vegetation on the new section of the resort such as palm trees etc... so it did not have quite the lush, tropical feel that we were so used to and in love with at EDSS. The food at EDM was good, but not as good or nearly the variety as EDSS. There are only Three restaraunts with unchanging menus, which gets redundant. Kiyoko (asian), Mio (italian), and Sabores (Mexican). The first two are only open after 5:30 pm for dinner, and Sabores is where you eat breakfast and lunch EVERY DAY. We found the best food to be the Fajitas plate 'to share\" for lunch. Overall though not entirely impressed with any meal, EDSS had much better food. Note dress code for dinner is no shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops, beachwear, etc. I did see several people wearing dress shorts, but i didnt attempt it. Room service menu was limited, but they tried to accomodate you if possible for items not on the menu. It is also 24 hours which is very nice. Typically a 30-40 minute wait. Get the french toast or omellete for breakfast, club sandwhich for lunch, and waffle fries are great any time! Keep an eye out for Miguel, a very good staff member who works hard and always seems to be popping up! Staff do not expect tips here, but seriously for what they probably get paid and the level of service they provide, in most instances during our stay we tipped for provided services. Bar service was mediocre at EDM. After being at EDSS for a week we had high expectations. Christian at the pool bar was good, but that is it. They didnt seem to know how to make many drinks. In one instance we had to tell them bottle by bottle what liqours to add, how much, etc. for a fairly common drink! The next time the bartender handed us the bottles and let us make our own drink......maybe he was a substitute bartender for the day??? We didnt make it to Rick's bar during our stay, heard it was fun. We did our romantic honeymoon dinner on the beach at EDM, and wished we had done it at EDSS like many who came for our wedding. The put us on a raised platform with curtained sides and thatch roof, with a tree directly in front of us and a large sign pointing to the sky massage. Romantic? You do not get to pick your dinner, and it is so dark (one tiny candle providing light) you can't see what you're eating. My wife nearly puked once from one of the courses and she mainly stuck with the bread and butter after that. We did enjoy the cheap wine and champagne (the same ol' free stuff they always give you), which after enough made the food go down a little easier. Why would anyone pay $250 to 1) not be able to pick your food for dinner; 2) not be able to see what you're eating; 3) get parked behind a \"sky massage\" sign; and 4) ultimately eat bread and butter the whole meal? Thankfully ours was free. At EDSS dessert for the dinner of the beach was flaming baked Alaska. At EDM it was the same 4 dessert options you could get any other night at the 3 restaraunts. Unless you like large boats parked in a marina in the background of your pictures, do not plan a beach wedding here as the beach wedding structure is right next to the marina. So glad we did ours at EDSS! Cab rides to Playa del Carmen are $25 each way. As far as demographics for what it matters there are mostly honeymooners and people celebrating anniversaries there. Mostly americans. I liked the mix of people from UK and elsewhere at EDSS, as you could share good stories and culture. It is funny to watch people. Guests at EDM seemed to get very \"clicky\". You will watch people start going to dinner together, always hanging out. We got tired of that dog and pony show business. I was there to spend time with my wife. Overall i hope this did not seem overwhelmingly negative, as we did have a good time. The staff was great. The rooms were spectacular! It is a great place to relax if you like doing nothing but spend time with the one you love.

My husband and I are extensive travelers. We've stayed at a lot of different hotels and this place takes the cake. The drive from the airport takes about 30-45 minutes. When you pull up the road leading to the hotel, it is anything but impressive. Luckily, we were warned about that. It\u2019s a long curvy road back to the resort and even pulling up in front of the lobby leaves you questioning your decision. But once you step inside the lobby you realized you've found paradise. Our room wasn't quiet ready when we arrived so they took our bags, gave us our champagne, a brief tour of the hotel and led us to the beach where they were grilling fresh fish. We literally sat 5 feet from the waves eating amazing grilled fish and drinking margaritas. This was all within the first 30 minutes of our arrival. Rooms- We had room 312 which was breathtaking. It was an infinity pool suite looking right out over the water. The infinity pool water was cold but after the first minute or so you got use to it. It was so nice lounging in our pool watching the water and enjoying a beverage. The room was impeccable. We had no problems whatsoever and we loved the outdoor shower. Great water pressure, which isn\u2019t common in Mexico. Food- We've been to all inclusives before including El Dorado Seaside Suites and I have to say the food at the Maroma is top notch. Can it get repetitive? Maybe, but only if you order the same thing everyday. For breakfast they had a buffet with fruit and omelets but they also had a good selection on the menu. They serve lunch Wed-Sat on the beach with different selections each day. The other days we were there we ate at Sabores for lunch and it was fabulous. Fajitas, nachos, chicken strips\u2026..they had a good menu. We ate dinner at all three restaurants. I would have to say that the Japanese was our favorite but they all were great. The portions are a bit small but they'll bring you pretty much anything you want, just ask. You want chips, pico and guacamole in your room at 10pm, just call room service. They really are there to serve you. I don't know how many times we heard \"it is my pleasure to serve you\". Yes, we did tip but not that much. Our service was unmatched so it was well worth it to so our appreciation. Drinks- Drink service on the beach was the best we've ever had. You never had to fetch your own drinks thanks to Gabi and Teo. They were wonderful!! Jesus was also great at the Sabores swim up bar. I would not consider my husband and I hard to please but when we travel to a beach destination we want to relax. This place really fit the bill for us.

This is a very small resort that is still adding some of the final touches to complete the resort. All the rests. are open and functional with no reservations needed and when we were there in early May there were no lines or waiting. The food is great and individually prepared. If you are looking for all you can eat buffets - don't go here. There are 72 rooms at the resort and when we were there we estimated 50% full. We never had a wait for a beach chair/bed and rarely a wait for a drink. We have been to several resorts in Mexico and found this to be the most relaxing and enjoyable. We stayed in the slightly older 2 story section of the resort. Each room in this building has a private balcony or patio with a bed, table, and chairs. There are privacy sheets hanging on each patio/balcony - nice touch. Oh, like others have mentioned the patio doors do lock automatically - we got locked out and so did our neighbors - the resort is used to this, they will free you, we found it funny. The bed was very comfortable. Shower water pressure was excellent - one of my pet pevees. There are no elevators in either building. The other building has swim up patios the look very nice. We spoke with some folks staying in a room with a plunge pool and they said it was a great room with a great view but the plunge pool water was like ice. Hard to go wrong with any of the rooms. Both pools are clean and have swim up bars; one has more sun than the other. The beach is awesome with fine white powder sand. There is snorkeling off the beach if you go out to the man-made breakers. Plenty of fish around them. On the far right as you look out to the ocean I encountered a barracuda of decent size. It was curious and shouldn't bother you as long as you don't bother it. You can walk for a couple of miles or more on the beach to the north before encountering any other resorts. And as mentioned in other reviews there is a local with a boat who offers tours along the reef - sail power only. He will stop to snorkel with you and show you some of the local sea life you don't normally see on a catamaran with 50 other folks. This guy takes cash only and you should bring all your own stuff including some water if you want. You will have to carry your stuff to the boat into chest deep water depending on how tall you are. Captain Memo is his name if you need his contact info please let me know. He usually does tours at 10 and 2. I am sure you could also arrange for a trip to Puerto Morales or Playa if you made some arrangements the day before. Captain Memo is a very interesting guy who is very friendly and nice - indicative of most of the Mexican people. Remember you are in Mexico a nearly 3rd world country - its not the states or Europe. Things move slower, local food is different - try it. Yes the food at the resort is not too spicy - they try to cater to everyone. However, when I asked for my meal to be more spicy - I got it. If you want something that is not on the menu - ask for it, they will do all they can to accommodate you. For example, we thought some guacamole and chips would be nice; but it wasn't on the menu. We asked and we received it freshly prepared and with a smile. Also practice some Spanish with the staff, they will help you and they relate to you trying to understand their language. The only thing we didn't like about this place was we didn't stay but 3 nights - we wanted to stay longer. It was the most relaxing place we ever stayed at. Oh, on Thursdays a local fisherman brings his fresh catch to the beach and the resort cooks prepare fresh fish right on the beach for lunch.

We got it at this resort. The food was overall very good. Everything was done in gourmet fashion, which was great, but there were many times that we just wanted to hit up a buffet, gorge ourselves, and then walk like walruses back down to the beach.....Can't do that at El Dorado Maroma. Almost every meal is a \"sit down and be waited on\" experience, unless you opt for room service, which is what we frequently did for breakfast. Keep this in mind, too.....order two entrees a piece or just order a LOT off the menu, because the portions typically come in pediatric sizes and once they're wolfed down, you sit and wait another 20 mins or so until the next dish is served. Not a bad way to eat, mind you, as you digest your food while waiting and not nearly as hungry, nor stuffed like a hog, as you would with large portions or buffet style. But enough about food..... We stayed in an infinity pool jacuzzi suite, which was really large and beautiful. View of the ocean was fantastic. The infinity pool was a nice touch, but rarely used, as it sat in the shade most of the day and was too cold to swim in. We switched back and forth between the two pools and met some of the friendliest people.....so a big shout out to: Myra & Bill, George & Jackie, Mike & Danielle, Kristen & Brady and the other Canadians!!! You guys all made the stay so much more enjoyable! Other than the ubiquitous beach volleyball, don't expect a full day's list of \"all included\" activities......if you've been to a Couples or Sandals resort, you know what I'm talking about.....Maroma doesn't have much. Snorkeling, scuba diving, Sea-Doos, catamaran rides, etc. are all done next door at the marina......all for a fee. ATV's and horse back riding are extra as well and are next to the resort. Beware of the Concierge staff wanting to \"meet with you and your spouse to see how everything's going\"......that's El Dorado's way of saying \"I've got some timeshare that you might be interested in.\" If you sit through the whole thing, I believe you get a $200 voucher to be used at the Spa.....but I wiggled my wife and I out of it by playing the pregnancy card, so they didn't bother giving us the schpiel. Another thing we ran into is the loose tipping rules. Now, we don't mind tipping, and we do so quite a bit.....but if you've been to the Couples resorts, it is almost strictly forbidden, as staff members can get in trouble accepting it. El Dorado Maroma allows tipping.....and even though there is no pressure, certain attitudes and services can change dramatically from tipping vs. no tipping.......I'll leave it at that and let you be the judge. Finally, a nice and relaxing sailboat ride is available way down the beach, maybe about a mile......by Captain Memo. He's a wealth of knowledge about the local area, super friendly, and stops near a reef to take you snorkeling about 1/2 hour. Overall, this trip lasts about 3 hours for $35 a person. Bring your sunscreen and some bottled water and enjoy a nice ride. His sailboat goes out every day at 10am and 2pm, so best to catch him early morning or after 5pm to hold your spot the following day. He only takes about 6-8 people out at a time.

We very much enjoyed the location. As has been said before, the beach is lovely soft white sand, and you can walk comfortably for miles. The water temperature was very pleasant, and you can swim out to sandbars. In front of the hotel there are beds of sea grass, which can be avoided.There is little to see snorkeling in front of the hotel, and because of the nearby reef, no shelling. The grounds have lovely landscaping. Our room in the newer part of the hotel was clean, well maintained, and as described previously. The outdoor shower sprayed everywhere but on you. Towels were abundant and thick. I did not care for the other bath products, but that may just be me. The TV in the room was clear and bright. We brought DVDs from home to enjoy after dinner. In general, service was excellent. The staff tried to always to be pleasant and respectful. There is a push by the concierge staff to have guests hear the 90 minute lecture about their vacation club. My husband and I were not interested, and that seemed to disappoint them. The one aspect of the El Dorado Maroma we definitely did not like was the food. Breakfasts could become repetitive. The local offerings were fine, but things like american fare, pancakes, etc. just were heavy, and not fresh tasting. Lunches were OK if you stick to the \"Mexican\" dishes.They are cooked so as not to offend, with barely any spice. If you don't like spice, you will be happy as a clam. We tried to get a bottle of hot sauce, but the best we could do, was a dish of finely chopped onions with a tiny bit of jalapeno. If you want a resort where they will be very careful about not offending guests with a gentle palate, then this is your spot. To us, dinners were the low point. Some things were just plain silly. They loved th add \"foam\" to dishes. Foam is simply beaten egg white. The cooks also were big into stuffing the main courses. In the case of fish, this was distracting and unecessary. Another rather annoying cooking technique was adding sweet sauces on top of the platter. It got to the point, where, every afternoon, we would talk with one of the concierges, and plan our dinner for the night, for example, plain sauteed white fish. One other aspect of meals to be aware of, is the english translation of the menu, does not necessarily correspond in any way to what you are served. In a lot of ways, I think you get what you pay for. We paid full tariff, but many guests who were there took advantage of a 50% off through the vacation club. We have been to some of the more expensive resorts on the Riviera Maya, and some things have been better, like food, and some worse, like the rooms. I think an advantage of the pricier places is that you get a more low key refined atmosphere.

We got into Cancun last Saturday around 3pm, I know all of you travel wizzards out there know this, but customs at 3pm on a Saturday, there were about a thousand people waiting, took us over an hour to get through....live and learn, come in at a less popular time. Lomas travel was there to pick us up after waiting around 15 minutes, it wasn't what we expected, a private car, more like a van with a cooler and a couple of beers, and at that point the beers looked pretty good. So....we made good time to EDM, the entry road is now paved, narrow, very narrow, but we got there. The lobby is lovely and cool (like not hot) with a lovely scent, we had our glass of sparkeling wine and were shown to our room. The pictures on the site do credit to the rooms, ours was very clean, and we quickly knew that 205 was a good room, very close to the pool, seriously maybe 20 steps, and around 75 to the beach. There is a bed on the patio as well as in the room. There is privacy and an intimacy with the waves, you can listen to it all night. We ordered room service, which was prompt, the food hot and quite good.

Every morning the employees bring coffee and tea to the small pool around 6:30, cream, milk and the the Miami Herald Cancun version, you can sit at any of the tables around the pool, get a sea bed or just go back to your room, That is how the mornings started, breakfast in your room or the Mexican restaurant, mole and scrambled eggs, very nice.

We chose this place because of it's size and adults only and i researched for months before actually booking. We had previously stayed at Excellence Riviera Cancun and admit we based alot of this trip compared to that resort, which totally spoiled us. I'll start with check-in. We did arrive early and i knew check-in was 3pm, but with 50% occupancy a 4 hr. wait to get to the room was very aggravating. And we were not the only people unhappy with the long check-ins. Also, we requested a ground floor which we didn't get. So, first impressions, not so good. Food was our biggest disappointment, and again that's very subjective, but we honestly were hungry all week. Breakfast was our best meal of the day and we pigged out every morning because we knew it was downhill for the rest of the day. We thought the dinners were terrible. Not much to choose from and a major lack of seafood which we enjoy on vacation. No lobster, no shrimp cocktails etc. They did serve a few dishes that we thought were ok, but most were unedible because of the taste and we actually walked out and ordered room service, which is extremely limited. Think sandwiches, no meals or appetizers, and no cocktails delivered to the room. We didn't feel that this was a gourmet resort at all but that's just our opinion. We met people that thought the food was great. No snacks or appetizers to grab for late afternoon, and they don't serve any food around the pool areas. The only outside dining was at the Mexican restaurant for breakfast and lunch. It would have been nice to have that for dinner. The Big Disappointment!! My husband has skin cancer and can't spend much time outside in the sun. We always take a small collapsable cooler with us and fill it with a 6pk of beer and he takes it to the room and sit's on the balcony and reads while i'm at the pool. Keep in mind, the beer in the mini bar was usually drank the night before. The first couple of days the bartender at the pool bar would fill it and he was generously tipped all day long. On day 4, he told my husband he couldn't do that anymore.(Unlimited All-Inclusive?) We found out that he was just too lazy to restock his coolers after giving my husband a 6pk. And to make matters worse we saw him give others 6pks for coolers. When the tips stopped his attitude changed, but too late. And we saw very few people tipping. Evening entertainment was a joke. No place outside for people to meet up and have cocktails. The only bar open in the evenings was Rick's Bar and it was in an enclosed upstairs area that wasn't very inviting and no-smoking and lots of stairs to climb. An outside bar for evenings would be great. Many of us would meet up in the evenings and just sit at the pool and talk. (Hi Kelly and Scott) I would like to thank Francisco, Super Mario and Luis, 3 of best staff they have. You went above and beyond and helped make this stay more tolerable. The weather was perfect, no towel games at the pool, the rooms were clean and nice comfy beds. but i don't think we would return to this resort.

A great place to go if you want to be alone with your special someone.", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cShhhh...Don't tell anyone\u201d", "Author": "jstrickland2", "ReviewID": "UR15474901", "Content": "We loved this resort. We had a fourth floor infinity suite and it was lovely. Clean, giant, plenty of storage, great view. We decided that any room would be great, including the Mi Hotelita side. We were on the beach everyday, all day. It is a great set up because even when you are at the beach-you are still right by the pool. The ocean is clear, calm and easy to walk out in. We did not snorkle but the people that did said the excursion is great and just off the beach is great. We thought the drinks were good and loved the Mango daquiris. We ate every breakfast and lunch sitting outside by the pool at the Mexican restaurant and loved it. For dinner we just went back and forth between the Italian and Japanese. Some people complained that they were slow but the timing to me seemed upscale and of course, most other countries enjoy meals at a slower pace than Americans. The food at both restaurants was very good and we always found something that was really really good. We walked the beach on most days and it is so nice that you can go so far. The people working at resort were very friendly and happy. We did not get room service but requests for ice or housekeeping were met very fast. We were at a family reunion at the Iberostar in November and the people working there were seemed very unhappy. It was the best vacation of our life and we think the location is absolutely perfect. We will be back. The hotel was at about 50% occupancy so chairs and beach beds were easy to get and we loved that towels are not policed or kept count-so many resorts have towel huts and you can not get fresh towels until a certain time but here they were abundant, available and soft.

The Room The room was nice with a large soft bed, nice bathroom with jacuzzi tub, indoor shower and an outdoor shower which my husband used daily. We also had a flat screen tv, and a small table as well as a couch. The terrace was ,lovely with a lazy river leading to the large pool, a beach bed and a couple of chairs. Our view was magnificent with a soft breeze at all times. My husband actually slept outside the first night. The pools There are tow pools, an older more intimate one in front of the Mi Hotelito rooms with a swim up bar and plenty of charis and beach beds. The other larger pool had a swim up bar and a lazy river leading to our rooms. We spent most of our time at the larger pool due to it being easier access to our room. The restaurants Sabores is mexican and open all day with great breakfasts...the chilequiles are a favorite of mine. The lunch and dinner were also really good and the guacamole, salsa and something called ixnpec(sp?) was super good and fresh. Mio is the Italian and also very good, the other is japanese with sushi and stir fry and it is good too. They have great spring rools. The beach The beach is soft and smooth and the water is shallow with little or no waves which I adored.You can walk and walk and see the most lovely beaches around. The nightlife Pretty non-existent except for Rick's Bar which opened at 9ish but not much happened therre...at least for us. Perhaps we are getting old or were just tired from our days at the beach. The spa I had a manicure and my hubby and I had a couples massage over the water at the massage hut which was really good and I am a massage gal. The massage is about $25 less at the Marina MAroma next door. $90 at the resort, $65 at the marina. Ibelieve that they use the same over the water huts though. Excursions We did not do any excursions. This place is so relaxing, we could not muster the energy to get our happy bootys motivated to go anywhere. I would suggest this resort to anyone wanting rest and relaxation. If you are a loud party person, it is not for you. The resort was only at about 30% capacity so the beach chair towel game was not really an issue. However, there was one couple who would put their towels on a bali bed, charis at the beach and charis at the pool for the entire day. I do not know why that annoys me so much, but it does. One day, someone was going to move his stuff and he ran over from the pool and told them it was his bed after not being there for 2 hours or more. Ugh. Same guy who freaked when at 4:30 pm one evening, Ivan (the pool fun resort guy)let us put on some differrent music at the beach...not loud just different. Would I go back, YES. but I may split my time between EDM and Royale or Excellence or somewhere a little more happening. If you go, have a mango margarita for us!", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cEl Dorado Maroma has 76 rooms!!!\u201d", "Author": "Nashna", "ReviewID": "UR15144291", "Content": "First off...Trip Advisor still shows this resort as just having 24 rooms. The resort has consisted of 76 rooms since last November. The new Cancun Airport is fantastic....until we came to the greedy Grey Line! The Mexican government has given Grey Line exclusive rights to the taxi concession at the Airport. The cost for my husband and I to go to the El Dorado Maroma was $82.00 USD. The return trip was $40.00! Making this process more unbearable was when after we paid, a lovely lady escorted us to one of 50 tall tables so that we could receive our taxi \"number\". We were then subjected to a time share pitch. When I kept saying that we were not interested in a time share, the gentleman then offered to reimburse my $82.00 taxi ride, if I just went to listen to the pitch. When I refused that, he offered two excursions! When I demanded my taxi number, his co-worker came and tried to give me the same pitch. I am amazed that the Mexican government is encouraging this behavior. Next time, I will arrange for my own pick up by one of the many good tour operators. Our stay was only for two nights, as we were called away from the resort by a death in the family. We had chosen this resort because we wanted a quiet, adults only all inclusive resort. We were not disappointed! We stayed in room 215 in the Mi Holito on the second floor. This room had fantastic views of the pool and beach and we loved lying on the outdoor bed on the balcony and watching the ocean. The bed was comfortable and and the furnishings fit the tropical atmosphire. Our room was quite private. However, the first floor rooms were very much open to view from the pool area. Of the two pools, we really enjoyed the smaller pool in the older section. The pool had shaded areas at different parts of the day and we ended up spending one afternoon lounging by the pool bar and discussing world politics. Great people, facinating discussions and amazing clear blue calm skies. While we were there it was sunny with low humidity - 82 to 85 degrees. April is a lovely time to go to the Maya. Rick's bar was surprisingly happening for such as small resort. All the drinks at the resort were great. When our bartender was asked to make a special Jamaican flamming drink, he tried to duplicate it with great gusto. One of the earlier Trip Advisor reports gave this resort a very poor mark because their luggage had been stolen from outside the lobby. Management has solved this issue, by having all incoming and outgoing luggage stored inside the lobby, in plain view. Another negative report mentioned the loud music, I can tell you that the music in the older pool was delightful, very quiet background type music. My own negative was the loud weed-wackers. Not only were they loud, but they also sprayed grass clippings in the pool. When the manager saw what was happening he ran over to the worker and made him stop immediately. I also felt that the ATV riders that operatored just outside the resort were quite loud. But, it is easy to move your spot at the pool to avoid their noise. Everyone has commented on the friendly staff. I must agree. We had just one issue when we waited for over 1 1/2 hours for our breakfast to be delivered. They had lost the order. We should have called to check on it after 30 minutes had passed. When breakfast came, it was lovely. The fruit was delicious and sliced and presented with great care from a charming huge basket. The food was excellent. The buffet was displayed on rather small dishes which meant that they were never sitting out too long.

I won't go into too much detail about restaurants and such because most has already been discussed but I will tell you about the things we really liked. Our Room - We had an infinity-pool suite on the 4th floor of the new side of the resort, room 441. I believe the first 2 towers are the only ones to have the pools on the 3rd and 4th floors. The rest of the towers just have large balconies. We LOVED the room because of the ocean view, the privacy and the 4th floor rooms are the only rooms to have the outdoor showers that actually open up to the sky. The rest have a thatch roof because you can look down on them from the higher floors. The only downside to these rooms is that they are on the 4th floor and\u2026..no elevators. You're walking up and down 4 flights of stairs a LOT so keep that in mind if you're thinking about one of these rooms. Food \u2013 We\u2019ve stayed at a number of all-inclusives before (some small, some large) and this was by far the best food we\u2019ve had at any resort. I can\u2019t say that everything we ate was the best but I\u2019d say 90% of it was very, very good. We were thinking there wouldn\u2019t be much of a selection but there is a LOT on the menus and nice combo of both meat and fish. My girlfriend does not eat meat and was in heaven with the seafood selection at each of the restaurants. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant the best because we both love sushi and it was good there. It\u2019s not like your favorite sushi place at home but we thought it was great for a small all-inclusive\u2026.in Mexico. We also really enjoyed the room service for breakfast. It\u2019s mainly omelets on the menu but they came with a nice selection of fresh fruit, bread, muffins, juice and coffee. Pools \u2013 We spent our first \u00bd day at the newer pool and it\u2019s beautiful and larger than the other one but we found that there wasn\u2019t much of a tropical vibe over there. They were working on the new outdoor grill area, which should be complete in about a week or so, and that didn\u2019t bother us but there was no music playing other than when they brought a speaker over for the water aerobics and then it was way too loud. We then tried the older/smaller pool, loved it and spent the rest of our days at that one. There was definitely a tropical vibe going on with all the palm trees, palapas, quieter background music and it had a much more tropical feel. It also may have been the people we met on that side who were all very friendly and a lot of fun, which I\u2019ll talk about later. Staff/Service \u2013 The majority of staff we encountered were extremely friendly and the majority of service we received was excellent. From the baggage guys and front desk to the maids and restaurant workers, just about everything we received was completely first class. Sure there were a few here and there who weren\u2019t the quickest and there was a language barrier with some but the majority did everything they could to make sure you enjoyed your stay. The resort as a whole really seems to put service as a priority and tries to instill that in all of the employees. I know some of the previous reviews stated they needed to work on service but they seemed to doing a pretty good job in our opinion. Off-site Activities \u2013 We went to Playa one evening and did a little shopping, ate/drank and mainly people watched and it was fun for a touristy destination. It was a nice change of pace from doing nothing around the pool all day but we took another trip that we really enjoyed. We heard from another couple about a retired windsurfer who has a small sailboat a little ways up the beach and takes people out on private tours. After watching the big catamarans take off from the marina with 50-60 on board, this seemed a lot more interesting to us. We walked up about 1 mile to the left of the resort where you will see a little handmade sign and a sailboat named \u201cEight Dwarfs\u201d. \u2018Captain Memo\u2019 told us his normal tour consists of sailing (no motor) south for an hour to a nice reef, snorkeling for an hour and then sail back to the original spot. This is $30 per head and he can take up to 6 people, though that may be a little tight. We weren\u2019t too interested in the snorkeling so he said we could take a sail up to Puerto Morelos (about 2 \u00bd hours north or 10 miles) get out, have lunch/drinks, see the small town and then sail back. This is $50 per head and a heck of a deal considering what the big charters charge. Plus it\u2019s more intimate and much more personal considering it\u2019s just you and Memo (May-mo). We set it up for a couple days later, did it with another couple and had a great time. You can\u2019t set it up though the concierge, you just have to walk down the beach and see if he is there and tell him when you want to go. I would highly recommend this trip as Memo is a very interesting person, knows everything about the area and towns and treats you with the utmost respect. A couple things to consider though if you do decide to do this 1) his boat is moored about 30-50 yards off shore so you have to swim out to it, carry whatever baggage you have and climb up the back of the boat. He helps as best he can but it takes some physical ability. You then have to do this to and from the shore in Puerto Morelos. 2) You have to bring whatever beverages you want from the resort and this takes some working and planning. If you have any more questions on this, email me. The People \u2013 I think the best part of the vacation were the people/couples we met. I know a lot of it may have to do with timing but we met some really nice/fun/interesting people from all over and spent the majority of our time hanging out with them. The resort was great but meeting these people and socializing with them really made our trip special. I have to say hello to the Kings, Adam/Kristin, Ian/Claire and the Oma family \u2013 thanks, you really made our trip great!!! Summary (sorry to be so long winded), we really enjoyed everything about the resort \u2013 room, food, staff, service, people and the only complaint I would have is that they didn\u2019t have an outdoor bar to have drinks at after dinner. The only real option is Rick\u2019s and that\u2019s ok for a night or two but the weather was so nice, it would have been great to sit outside, hear the ocean and some light background music and socialize with the people we met. I did bring this up to management and they are aware of it and looking into options. Hopefully they find one. The only other comment I have is \u2013 it\u2019s a VERY, VERY quiet resort. If you\u2019re looking for a smaller version of Sandals with a party environment (we met a few couples who were), this is NOT it. Sure, you can do tequila shots with people around the pool bars and get a little loud in the afternoons but in general, it\u2019s a very quiet place. Just know this before you book there. That\u2019s it. Hope you enjoy as much as we did if you go.

It seemed like guests either loved it or hated it. I am happily one of the guests who really enjoyed my stay there. I hope what I write helps anyone seeking advice on this resort. My trip was from Feb 18th-25th, 2008 Cab ride to El Dorado was about 25 minutes from the Cancun Airport. Just before you exit the airport there is an area to the left with small tables and several agents wanting to help you. Order a cab there and you can book your return as well. Price was discounted on the return. It\u2019s worth it. When we first arrived to the El Dorado Resort we were greeted with a glass of champagne and welcomed by a concerige. First thing I asked about was the restaurant reservations since I read on several sites that it was a huge problem that guests could not make reservations or if they did it was late like 8:00 or 9:00pm. I guess the hotel listened to gues\u2019s compliants and restaurants had been converted to \"First Come First Served\" basis. The Castias were able to make reservations since their rooms cost more which made sense. We had a Jr. suite, Ocean front room....good enough for us. We were escorted to a golf cart/shuttle to take us and our bags to our room. Golf carts/Shuttles ....they share the walkways with the guests.. the carts have no headlights and are very quite. It was great to get a ride but sometimes we never came across one that was going our way. Even though there are shuttle stops with covered benches stating \"pick ups every 15-20 minutes\". It was faster to walk then wait. They drive fast at times and we were surprised that no one had been \"taken out\". Suites: The picture of the suite is exactly as it looks on the website. Nice....big bed, two person Jacuzzi, balcony.. two chairs....hammock. Nice sized bathroom...big shower for two people with a bench inside. Plenty of counter space.. one thing is the counter is higher then a normal sink level. Plenty of towels..four bath towels, two large beach towels. Plenty of hotel shampoo, soap, shaving kits, sewing kit, hair dryer. We asked for a ocean front room and we had a very nice view of the pool and the beach and the ocean. The air conditioner is next to the bed but up high so if you turn it on it blasts right at the bed.. just turn down the flaps and close one side of the curtains on the bed and you'll be good to go. Small refrigerator in the room was not cold.. I think it just kept the sodas, beer and water \"not warm\" There also was a bottle of champagne on ice with two glasses waiting for us....that was nice! We could not find an ice machine anywhere but you can just go to one of the bars off of the pools for ice. They are happy to give it to you. Restaurants: We learned that the portions are small.. some being a bite or two at some places. Some places had alittle bigger portions. Order something from each section of the menu. Each dish will come out of the kitchen very nicely designed on the plate. Sauces swirled on plates...nice presentations. I would not advice going to the restaurant hungry....most places will have a wait and it can be a short time or an hour... they give you a pager once you put your name on the list...and they always will ask for your room number. Most restaurants had a bar near by to hang out at while you wait except Fondue.. you have to walk to the Oriental restaurant (Kampai) and go past it to the bar next to the beach.. Gaviotas Seashore Bar...it's a walk..trust me.....the bar there will fill up quick around 7:00pm...luckily two bartenders show up around then. There are plenty of stools and tables to hang out at. Dining Experiences: Las Fuentes-didn't wait long, good food, we had slow service. For breakfast no wait but cold bacon and sausages.. no warming areas. D'Italia-good food and service but we could not sit four at a table..something to do with not enough chairs but there were two tops tables available around us. 2+2=4 right? Fondue-big disappointment, long wait, no air conditioning, menu was not matching what we were served. Fondues tasted the same. Chocolate fondue was the best. Kampai-by far the best restaurant there....lunch and dinner. They have breakfast there too but we never got there in time. Order the duck, the spring rolls, the sushi, and order all of the deserts. We ate dinner here three times. Our waiter was Eurmundo...5 star service El Cocotal-great breakfast buffet (warming areas for bacon & sausage) and dinner....we did not have to wait here for either Room service-ext 1000 was quick and hot. Plenty of food, nicely arranged. Order the breakfast and sleep in. They serve until 11:30 am while alot of the restaurants stop at 10:30am. Room service is 24 hours Pizza & Burger- good food & beer\u2026if you want a cocktail you need to bring it yourself from one of the bars. This place had a dress code of shirts and shoes for lunch\u2026kinda disappointed with that since mainly we were in swimsuits and no shoes.. we planned ahead for lunch here cause the burgers & pizza hit the spot. Housekeeping: We slept in every day and between the time we would leave our room....eat...lounge in the sun.. we always came back to our room cleaned. We never hat to wait. They were really on it.We tipped a dollar or two a day for our maid.. she will be the same one you have all week. Very friendly and nice\u2026 everyday decorated our bed with a different towel arrangement with flowers. Oh and fresh small flowers on the desk. Small refrigerator is stocked by another person who comes by after housekeeping. We had plenty of bottled waters, sodas and beer. TimeShare: No one approached us for a presentation. We were never bothered on this. I think once we received something slid under our door if we were interested but no calls not sales people hounding us anywhere. When you check in you are given a folder with the hotel info and info on their sister resorts. There was an option to been shown a Castias room if you wanted. Pools: Lots of pools to choose from. One thing I noticed was if you wanted to make sure you had a lounge chair to sit on that day guests would put their towel on it to \"reserve it\". Funny thing is alot of the good lounge beds or chairs had towels on them by 7:30 am or earlier. One time I saw towels out at 2:00am for the next day. The main pool was like that. And some guests would put their towels out there and never show up. Since we all have the same green stripped towel who is to really know if you remember which chair your reserved unless you put some personal items down too. Drinks: Order off of the menu. We tried to get a Lemondrop which made it difficult. They have plenty of drinks to order from. Most times you'll need to ask for \"alittle extra booze\" but everyone was doing that. House wine from Chilli was good. By the glass is included..if you wanted a special bottle to yourself you will be paying big bucks for it. Mango Daiquiris .. not on the menu\u2026.order it \u2026.it\u2019s great! Tipping: Tipping in Mexico was customary but not advertised at the resort. Which was nice. There were no \"tip jars\". Tips was taken with a smile and appreciated. We found out that the staff had a hard time converting paper money if it was ripped or damaged so we always tried to give them the nicer bills or switched out with them. Other guests: There was a very good mix of age groups when we were there. 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's etc. There were five weddings that week so it brought it fun loving people to mix with vacationing people. Gym: Never went but it looked like it had plenty of equipment for guests. Bars: Bar Las Guacamayas- this bar stays open late and most people end up here. They have these big swings for two people that line the outter edge of the circular bar. Every night that had entertainment and it lead into a live band then dj music for dancing. We spend most nights here. Healthy Bar- fruit smoothies\u2026.really good Martini Bar or Lobby Bar\u2026..nice atmosphere\u2026good drinks.. *There were lots of them....we didn't hit them all but it was nice that there were so many. Beach: Nice white sand beaches... enough shells closer to the water that you knda wished you brought you flip flops but you just pay attention. The water was clear....blue and had some fish swiming around. People were snorkeling. The water was warmer then at the pool. We had a great time. I would definably go back and if I could stay longer than a week.
