In that time I have stayed in 11 properties from one end of Waikiki to the other. Hands down The Cabana is where I prefer to stay. It is steps from the beach, good restaurants and a great gay bar. The gay beach is a short walk into Queen Kapiolani Park with plenty of eye candy along the way. I find the rooms spacious (by Hawaiian standards) and love the fact that when the sliding door is open along with the widows on the oposite end of the room the trade winds will blow through.

I am a regular during the Christmas/New Year's holidays and have stayed at Cabana from its earliest days. Also been there for Lei Day. I have developed a good rapport with the manager and staff because I believe you only get as much out of a vacation experience as you put into it. A smile and a cheery greeting goes a long way to ensure you'll be treated the same way. I have seen a number of dour guests over the years and wondered if they would ever be happy anywhere! ([-]) Friends who stay here and I have a great time at the thrice weekly cocktail hours hosted by the staff. We pick up a variety of treats (some flown in from Japan) and make up our own pupu platters, and we share with all others staying here who want to socialize with other guests. The public space is small and cozy, adjacent to a hot tub that some guys enjoy both after the beach and before bed. We have even invited other friends to drop by and have a drink with us, and the staff couldn't be more accommodating or happier. The structure itself is reminiscent of what one might call a motel of an earlier era. Over the years the rooms have been redecorated, and, in fact, that's taking place right now. There are 15 two-room mini-suites, with a small lanai for the smokers among us. No, there's no fab view of the beach because you're not paying beachfront prices, but are located just a few minutes walk from the surf and one of Honolulu's busiest bars. Each mini-suite has a TV, VCR (hear these are being replaced this year with DVDs and it's about time) and CD player. Plus there's a small kitchen area in each with mini-fridge, blender, microwave and dishes and utensils, just in case you want to eat in. These rooms are ideal for a couple, and more than ample space for a single. You could even put a third on the couch, but three people in one bathroom...well, need I say more? The housekeeping staff keeps the facility clean as a whistle and will accommodate requests for extra this or that...requested with a smile and a mahalo. There's washers and dryers in case you need to do laundry. And one staffer is quite knowledgeable about tours and rentals and is more than happy to help you book everything from snorkeling to barefoot cruises. Waikiki is noisy early in the morning because of all the hotels... service trucks and garbage trucks begin their rounds well before 8. If you need quiet, then sleep with the doors and windows closed (anathema in Hawaii), and crank up the air conditioning! So if you need total quiet and prefer to be by yourself (i.e., not interested in socializing with others), then I'd recommend a cottage on the Windward side of the island, maybe even a tent on the North Shore. (Don't stay here...it's too friendly.) But if you want a fun experience in a comfortable setting close to all the action (dining, shopping, beach, bars), then Cabana at Waikiki is a best bet. Oh, is it a bargain? No, but then I haven't found any bargains in Waikiki in years. Prices fluctuate at various times of the year, just like the airline ticket prices do from month to month. So, ask the manager, Jim, if he's got a rate special coming up at any time of the year and book a room then. And we all hope the owners won't jack up the price when the remodeling project is completed. But, ya know, if they do, I think I'll still stay there. I'm hooked on the location and the friendly staff. You know, a smile and aloha goes a long way.

We highly recomend the Cabanna for a gay vacation. We carefully researched the Cabanna on-line and made several phone calls to ask questions about features that were important to us. We were looking for a gay hotel where we didnt have to deal with straight couples googling over the gay couple.  We wanted to stay at a gay hotel that was not a form of a bathhouse. We wanted a large room. We wanted a reasonable price. We wanted to be close to the beach and a pool or lack of a pool didnt matter to us. In fact by not having a pool we were convinced that this would not be cruise central. We wanted a friendly staff who would be helpful but also know when to leave us alone. We found all that at the Cabanna. The staff was friendly and helpful without being in your face. We were located on a back street just yards from the beach, nightlife, world class shopping and dining. Our room rate was considerably less than staying at the Hilton and we got everything we paid for- a large, clean, updated room. I have read some of the reviews that paint the Cabanna and its staff not in the best light. I do not agree with those reviews - We did our reseach and found what we were looking for.

A real friendly place that scores highly on my list.", "Date": "Feb 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR973542736", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great room, but that's about it Having a great room is, of course, pretty important. The rooms at the Cabana are stylish mini-suites with a living area with sofa and TV, and a Hawaiian-style bed with a log wood base. There's a little kitchen in the corner of the living area. The maid service was excellent; extra towels were offered without asking on the last day so we could shower before checking out. But beyond the room, there's nothing much else. The hot tub is small and stuck in the corner of the tiny patio; they call it clothing optional but there's hardly space to move, and what there is is not fully shielded from neighboring buildings. Breakfast was basic - cereal, bread, peanut butter and calorie-laden pre-wrapped pastries; nothing fresh. Healthy choices were limited to pieces of fruit (whole, not salad) and yogurt. And while breakfast was included, everything else, from parking to video rental, was extra: this on a room which cost more than $150 a night. The location is good, close to the beach, restaurants and nightlife. Go there for a relaxed atmosphere and a nice room, but don't expect anything more.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR898878159", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Scot_Wha's_Away"}, {"Content": "A great place to stay close to everything !!! I spent the last two weekend staying at the Cabana on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights each week whilst visitng the Hawaiian Islands from England.The best things about the Cabana are the lovely friendly staff who are very chatty and fun and the location.. it is just a couple of minutes walk from Hulas which is the best gay bar in Honolulu and from the gay beach.. I spent far too much time in Hulas each night... hic !!! The accomodation is reasonably comfortable and very clean.. There is a lounge with sofa and television and kitchenette and a bedroom area whcih can be spearate from the living room. There is a hot tub outdoors and they serve free cocktails several times a week. There is also a free breakfast between 9 and 11 each morning which gives you another chance to chat to fellow guests. The only gripe I have is that I don't like their policy of taking a deposit of about $100 for your room key and phone... Whilst they don't take the money for themselves it is pre-authorised and so goes out of your bank account till you leave. This seems unnecessary and having travelled far and wide all over the world this is the first time anywhere this has happened.I can't wait to go back to Honolulu and can't imagine staying anywhere else other than the Cabana.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR532766331", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lee_bear"}, {"Content": "Great location, nice rooms I usually shy away from specifically gay places but decided to give this one a try on my first trip to Hawaii.I really loved the place. My room was a really great size - much more than I expected. Also the spa is great.

It wasn't a deliberate move but, rather, we had to due to limited room availabilities at our original hotel over the Christmas holiday. We were quite pleased with our new accomodations. The room was spacious (seperated bedroom), clean and decorated in a tropical motif. The bathrooms and carpeting appear to be recently renovated. Three nights a week they have a free happy hour with tropical drinks - a good start before heading over to Hulas which is just a short block away. The drawbacks include no pool (though there is a jacuzzi), no view to speak of, potentially limited parking if you have a car and being located next to an international hostel created noise issues. We will certainly consider staying here again next trip to Waikiki. Tip: try the noodle shop next to the ABC Store around the corner for a cheap dinner - nothing fancy but pretty good and the staff is quite entertaining.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR580655022", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MZR"}, {"Content": "Thumbs up! The Cabana at Waikiki is convenient to the gay beach and Hula's, the pre-eminent Honolulu gay bar. The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated, and comfortable.
