The \"canal\" view is from the breakfast room on the ground floor, our room looked at a stucco wall only feet away. And small. There was hardly space for our luggage and us. The door did not open fully as it hit the bed at 90 degrees, and the other side of the bed was up against the wall and wardrobe. A two foot space at the foot of the bed allowed one-at-a-time navigation to the window next to the wardrobe to check out the view of the air shaft and adjacent stucco wall. The bed was pretty soft and the room overall quaint but threadbare, but the worst was that there was no elevator to the third (what we in the US would call fourth) floor. Just worn and somewhat slippery marble stairs that left us lugging our luggage up and down again. Works if you are living out of a backpack, but we were at the end of a week long cruise with two larger-than-carryon rolling bags. Location is good, but it more than the minute from Piazza San Marco that some have suggested, (at least not by any route we discovered), but is fairly close, and closer yet to the Rialto Bridge and the vaporetto and water taxi stops. While the location was good, there were plenty of options nearby, and I would not stay there again.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cDecent Venice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kfitz1742", "ReviewID": "UR127236875", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed five nights at this hotel. It certainly served its purpose for a stay in Venice. Breakfast was adequate, the coffee was quite good. Biscuits, croissants, cheese, ham etc. A few cereals to choose from. The rooms were decent sized. Some posts complained about small rooms but we had no problem there-- plenty of room for one large suit case, one carry on and a back pack. Bathroom clean, water pressure good. Nice windows that opened wide. We didnt have a view from room 201 but we did get to see into a little alley way that lead to some residents homes. The room was cleaned once per day and we were given fresh towels daily. My only complaint is that the beds were HORRIBLE. They were like sleeping on the floor. Two twins pushed together so one of us was always falling in the crack. You may want to bring a foam liner as you really will want a nice night's sleep after walking around all day. I believe the hotel advertises free wifi but it is really 3euro for one hour. The reception desk was helpful and would make reservations and recommendations if requested.

I liked the stairway because it was done in marble and had nice lighting. Although it is kind of narrow and steep. I liked the breakfast room because it had perfectly done marble tiles and tables and the bar. And you can look at the canal while eating breakfast. it was great to have a breakfast in the price of the room of EUR 50.

Self service : fruit juice (ot 100%) cheese, ham, salami, bread buns, croissant, 2 other sweet things, 3 sorts of cereal, canned fruit, butter, nutella, honey, marmelade. * I liked the least: the size of the room. the softness of the beds. I woke up all swallen in the morning and not rested at all. As if a truck ran me over. The room was too hot, although we turned of the air conditioning. it was supposably refurbished in 2009 but maybe not the bathroom which was also tiny . the part where the shower is attached was partly broken. and everything that used to look silver was worn out (tap etc). did not use the shower fully. I noticed some black spots in the edges of the shower (possibly mould) Sylicone should have been renewed. the wash basin was clogged instantly bidet tap also looked very used up and the part of the toilet you press to flush the water. As everything is covered in carpet and fabric you cannot really see whether it is dirty. What also bothered me was that the floor was uneven so one cabinet looke as if it will tip over.

The entrance hall and dining room are nicely decorated but unfortunately the room we were given was decorated in what I can only imagine is traditional Venetian style. The door would not open fully due to the wardrobe and a chair being placed in the entrance directly behind it as there was nowhere else to put them due to the room being so small. A double bed filled the majority of the room with very small bedside stands on either side. The Walls are covered in a gold and red fabric which unfortunately only made the room feel smaller. The air conditioning made a very irritating noise all the time, even when switched off and the main light in the room had four out of five lightbulbs missing and was held together by masking tape. The bathroom was so narrow we could barely move in it and the shower flooded the bathroom floor whenever it was used. The toilet was so close to the wall you could not sit straight on without your knees touching the wall and by our last day had begun to smell like a train toilet.

The bathroom was even smaller-couldn't sit on the loo without hitting your head on the window/wall opposite it. Mold in the corners of the shower. Paper-thin walls (luckily our neighbors were quiet). We killed 4 mosquitoes one night (the fifth one was elusive thus lived). We wouldn't stay here again.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cSmall But Beautiful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3440537", "Content": "The location was great, the staff were friendly and it was clean. Everything we need when the room is just for sleeping in!! The hotel was what we expected for a 2 star in Italy. Yes the room was small and we had to climb 2 flights of stairs to get to it. The room may have been small, but the bed was a large double and more importantly the sheets were clean. The bathroom was small (I could almost have a shower while on the toilet), but again it was clean AND we got new towels each day. The breakfast was an Italian basic - croissant,rolls and coffee. If you were still peckish there's plenty of cafes and bakeries nearby.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Alcyone Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d234378-Reviews-Alcyone_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$158 - $330*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">San Marco Calle Dei Fabbri 4712</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30124</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234378", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2e/dd/2edd01959d39eb73172a05f7266e95ea1large.jpg"}}
