The university has great grounds and most people took good advantage following the ceremony with picnics and walks.

The room is furnished ok and the bathroom is clean but is small. There is a nice lounge chair in every room which is great if you want to do some reading. And there's self-service laundry facilites.

The receptionist did not look very experienced or polished - not the professional image I was expecting. The room was surprsingly clean and modern and the location not too bad. Airconditioning very loud in room. Liked most the modern decor in room Liked least the fact the car park was so far from the foyer (no porter). Had to walk about 400m in the rain and dark to get back after parking. Receptionist said there was a short cut through event centre but was probably locked and if I didnt want to park in car park which was far away I could leave my car on the street.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ACT, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFull of surprises - Would stay again\u201d", "Author": "FiverACT", "ReviewID": "UR55913479", "Content": "An interesting place to stay that was full of surprises for our stay. We booked through wotif.com and there was really no indication that the hotel was part of or attached to the Macquarie School of Management, the only real clue would have been the MGSM in the name, but there was no explanation of the name, or it's proximity to the university. This was a surprise, but wasn't particularly a bad thing, we stayed on the weekend and the place was very quite - Did not run into any other guests or students. The room itself was very tasteful - better than we were expecting with fresh looking furnishing and appointments, checkin was friendly and checkout was trouble free. The location was quite good, and close to just about everything you may need. There were just two things we were not overly expecting and probably expected a bit more from. Firstly the room's air conditioner - Loud is an understantement, it sounded like a truck running along the road at full noise, this was apparent to us, perhaps largely related to the 40 degree weather during our stay, the aircon though was very very good, keeping us super cool despite the high outside temp. The gardens and surrounds were very nice too - although check-in and parking made it clear that you were at the university. The second downside was the onsite parking. It was not particularly close to the room, and required a fairly long walk, it was also not particularly secure. On reading this review it might sound a little negative, but that's not my intention. We were pleasantly surprised with the comfort of the room and really enjoyed our stay. We would stay again and recommend to others.", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NSW", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay if you do not appear 'upperclass'.....\u201d", "Author": "MacStudent2007", "ReviewID": "UR8740559", "Content": "Beautiful peaceful surroundings overlooking small lake in the sculpture park. Room pretty small and basic, with a 'ledge' off the side which is advertised as a balcony. Staff in the restaurant were not very competent - only about twenty other people in the restaurant, yet I had to wait over an hour for my food because they were 'too busy'. Front desk staff rude and not very helpful in all aspects of dealing with them. Most notably I asked to leave my bags there during the day after I had checked out - after much huffing and puffing, staff member eventually grunted 'ok'. Returned that afternoon to find my bags not locked in the luggage room as requested, but sitting out in the open in the bar area. Excuse was that I had not put them in the luggage room myself and they shouldn't be expected to do it. Not bad considering they'd made the effort to drag my bag (which contained my laptop) out into the bar, right past the luggage room....... Probably great for older people, but if you are young expect to get treated like a second-class citizen.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle Australia", "Title": "\u201cQuiet.
