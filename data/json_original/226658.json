Second, Wifi worked about 20 minutes out of the 4 days I was there. I asked to speak with the manager and was told she was in a meeting and would call me back, even took my cell number, did she call HELL NO. If she don't care, then I don't either. Hotel wasn't booked with motorcycle rallies in town so I guess this has happened before. I live in Arkansas and have many friends that go to Branson because of the distance and will NOT be giving this place any business by word of mouth. Stay away from this place!!! Pay a little more, it will be worth it. Oh yeah, Air conditioner didn't work the first night. Would cool off to about 70 and then shut down and not turn back on till it was about 85.

I would have liked to have had a hot tub. We enjoyed the close proximity to so many things along the strip. The restaurant is good, typical Branson buffet. The beds were a little too firm for us. (That is when the hot tub would have come in handy.) Our room was kind of noisy. We got a lot of vehicle noise from the small road right beside the hotel. (There was a gap between the door and the jam and we could see daylight through it. That may have been the reason for the noise coming in.)You could however see the fireworks every night from Celebration City. Everyone here is very nice and helpful.

Housekeeping needs a little help at the Plantaion Inn. After all the wonderful reviews I read on trip advisor, I decided to give Plantation Inn a shot. Small things that would be overlooked by most will get noticed by myself. Lets confirm the positive aspects of this hotel first. --Very friendly staff makes you feel at home --Well maintained grounds makes for a pleasant atmosphere to relax --No bugs --Great location accessible from the yellow route and the strip. --I was impressed with hotel because the pictures on the hotel website dont do it alot of justice. Its really nicer than it looks. I was however, unimpressed with the cleanliness of our room. Most importantly - Our Bathroom Was Clean - No hair in the tub, however the rest of our room need attention to detail. The carpets needed a good vacumming in the corners and all around the edges of the room. the little ledges on the furniture need a good dusting, and worst of all... I noticed how dirty the floor was behind the nightstand after having to pick up a toy that my child threw back there. I pulled the nightstand out so housekeeping could see it too. As we loaded up our family van and cleared the room out we let the housekeeper in the room to get started and she put that nightstand right back where it belonged without cleaning under it. Also, when we checked into our room - I was browsing through the drawer of the nightstand and found trash from a previous guest including an old calling card & the guests reservation confirmation with all of their personal info on it. Its probably still there cause I think I put it back. --The Plantation Inn Restaraunt was ok. The food was good except for the scrambled eggs which had a fishy taste to them - and the coffee was so weak you could see right through the pot. And, Our server who was very professional and gave great service, looked like a total slob. --Would I recommend it? Sure, if you feel 50 a night is a good deal, and you can refrain from nit picking every little thing. There are no refridgerators, microwaves, coffeemakers, or hair dryers in the room. There is no free continental breakfast. The rooms are almost clean enough to stay in and the grounds are in tip top shape. --Will I stay again? Probably not. The amenities do not meet my needs. And the carpets really turned me off. Most dust is made up of dead skin cells shed from the human body.", "Date": "July 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2225161", "Content": "In todays world, CUSTOMER SERVICE is mostly a thing of the past. BUT, at the Planation Inn Reservation service in Branson, OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE is an every day event. We saw the ad in the Branson Chamber book and checked out the Plantation Inn Branson's website, then we used their toll free phone number and called them. A young lady named Diane answered. We told her that we had never been to Branson. She proceeded to ask us a bunch of questions that allowed her to custom tailor a vacation package for us. When we arrived in Branson, at the Plantation Inn, we received all of our show tickets and dining coupons. EVERY SHOW that DIANE recommended was to our liking. The breakfasts, lunches & dinners at the Plantation Inn Resturant & the Dockers Resturant were excellent. The rooms in the Plantation Inn were spotless. The LOCATION of the Plantation Inn was just great. We had NO TROUBLE finding our shows with the CUSTOM MAP given to use by DIANE. We had a marvelous time.
