The most important issues are good: comfortable bed, clean linen, clean bathroom, reasonable sized room for NYC, good location (near Times Square), decent breakfast. My pet peeves include the following. 1 Lack of a fan in the bathroom so the mirror fogs up every time you shower and the place takes a while to air out after someone uses the facilities. 2 Difficult to regulate the temperature. We visited in early March when the temps outside were in the 40s, but we had to run the air-conditioning constantly to keep the room cool enough. 3 Breakfast was adequate but could use some variety beyond cold cereal, juice, coffee, toast and donuts. Yogurt would have been a nice addition. 4 Desk staff were very slow and it seemed to take forever to check in and check out. Meanwhile a good sized line was developing behind us. 5 Dreary view of a fire escape, but I guess that is par for the course in NYC. We didn't have the elevator problem reported by another reviewer. The elevators aren't terribly speedy, but we never waited more than 2 minutes for one to come. Another reviewer reported construction noise waking him/her each morning. The construction was still in full swing when we were there, but the noise never started until 7:30AM which is quite reasonable, in my mind.

Good Value for $$ and Great Hotel Staffs\u201d", "Author": "sbjohari", "ReviewID": "UR125489279", "Content": "I am a Singaporean who has been to New York 3 times (Apr 2008, Apr 2010 and Feb 2012) as a tourist with my wife. My wife and i simply love New York and the current hotel we recently stayed at. We had stayed: 1st trip, 2008, at Sheraton Newark Airport (1 night), went on a tour package before ending up at Comfort Inn JFK Airport (1 night) after our tour package ends and the next day we transferred and stayed at New York City: Comfort Inn Midtown West Convention Center (5 nights) for a self tour, shopping and touristy adventures. 2nd trip, 2010, at Best Western Convention Center Hotel (11 nights) self tour & shopping. 3rd trip, 2012, at The Hotel @ Times Square (15 nights) self tour, shopping and eating.(10th February 2012 to 25th Feb 2012) The current hotel (The Hotel @ Times Square) we had stayed in Feb 2012, full review below: The Hotel @ Times Square (3rd trip to NY) was chosen as it was the cheapest and competently positively reviewed hotel to stay at in NYC in 2012 Tripadvisor reviews, we made a decision in mid Jan 2012 for our trip and arrival to NYC on the 10th Feb 2012 (such confidence we had on our familiarity to that place). Comfort Inn and Best Western which were our previous hotels cost more now in 2012, more expensive than The Hotel @ Times Square currently. Upon arrival to JFK airport, we again took the bus (www.nycairporter.com/) from JFK to Port Authority and walk from there to the hotel. We arrived in Port Authority before noon and walk to our hotel with our two 28\" hard case luggage & one 14\" canvass luggage through the packed and busy streets of Manhattan. Initial reaction we had was that the walk was long and hard especially under cold and windy conditions through packed crowds but during our 15 nights stay there, we realised the distance wasn't that bad, just that we shouldn't walk in noon time with our two 28\" hard case luggage & one 14\" canvass luggage through a packed and busy streets of Manhattan with jetlag dragging on our heels after an almost 24hrs flight journey from Singapore to NY .... 8) During reservation, we requested for a higher floor, street facing room. Upon arrival to our hotel, we requested for an early checkin but the check-in lady clerk informed that our rooms were not ready for early check in but if we want to we could get another non-street facing room else, we need to wait till after 2pm. We opted to wait for our rooms and had our bags kept in hotel storage while we walk around the nearby areas. (For the record among all the staffs we encountered during our stay there, this 1st person we had contact with in the hotel is the only person we very much dislike talking to with as she just mumbled and shows disinterest during our conversations. She was not doing anything at that time except talking to us hence we can't excuse her attitude as being stressed or busy entertaining other customers. Her forced/uninterested replies was tersed and short which only results in 2 unhappy customers who had just walked through 5 blocks of busy Manhattan streets with jetlag on their heels. We made sure to have no contact with her during our stay there but the rest of the hotel staffs were wonderful to talk and banter with) Upon return after 2pm, we checked in and got a 14th floor (the highest) but the room (room 1401) faced the hotel rear. Not much of a view except for dirty roof of another building. This was not the room that we requested and waited for. If we had known, we would had just opted for early check in instead of waiting. This is the 2nd bad impression we have within the few hours of arrival in this hotel now. But we let that slide because the room we got was big and spacious, better than all the previous rooms we had in our previous stay's (except for the room at Sheraton Newark Airport). We got a big closet and bathroom but we did pay more for it as compared to the prices we paid in 2008 and 2010. But the big room makes all the irritation we had up to that point go away forgotten and forgiven. I simply love the room spaciousness. The housekeeping staff doing the room service was competent but they can be better. Once they forgot to replenish the toilet roll, once forgot to replenish the emptied tissue box, a few times didn't take away the used towels (but they always ensured we get new towels daily) and forgot twice to take the $2 tips we left for them. In fact one of the cleaning lady (so far i see only the same two cleaning ladies intervally doing our rooms) tells us that we tip too much. On the tips, i rather err on the side of caution. Overall i have no complaints about them, they were constantly busy cleaning so many rooms in a hotel that has a high turnover with so many guest checking in and out and they were cleaning even after 2pm (we once leave the room late after 2pm). No complaints about them at all for me. On the 1st night there, we couldn't turn on the telly but a guy (i guess he was the hotel night security) settled that for us immediately. The bed is King Size, high and comfortable for me but wife think it's too soft. Pillow is comfortable to rest our head. There is a radio/iPod/iPad docking station which is great. The WiFi signal is strong and works fine up on the 14th floor as well as in the lobby and breakfast room. If you do not have a wireless card installed you can always bring along your UTP cable as each room has a UTP port as well. Hotel aircon/heater could have been better, the heater was not that great running under AUTO, the temperature settings need to be adjusted accordingly to warm up the room at 80 F and when it's too warm, we need to lower it down to 75 F before sleeping but when morning comes the room becomes cold instead. I had no issues with the temperature but my wife does feel cold in the mornings. The blanket is a thin sheet, on top is a wool blanket and then the bed cover. The wool and bed cover is not change daily during turning down of the bed, so we only use the wool blanket but not the bed cover to keep us warm at night. Somehow being hygiene freaks we are, we don't think the bed cover and wool blanket is clean and changed as it could be a leftover from previous guest stay. The hotel should made an effort to communicate to their guest that the wool blanket and bed cover are changed whenever a guest checks out. Breakfast room was big, can seat more than 30 people and it has 3 telly's. Serves yogurts, donuts of many flavors, croissants, bagels, slice bread, butter & jam, apple or orange juice, coffee, tea, cuppuccino and has bread toasters and slicers for the bagels too and apples+pears+bananas and 3 kinds of cereals and boiled eggs. Opens at 6.30am and ends at 10pm. Do always go there as early as possible before the crowd comes in, on my last morning there, there was a queue coming out from the breakfast room at 9.30am, the hotel is that crowded sometimes. Hotel has a gym in the basement which i never use, it looks competent enough. There is also a water machine, ice machine, coffee/hot chocolate/hot water machine at the lobby, open 24/7. Lobby is big and spacious with many seats and sofas for guest to relax in front of 2 telly's and a fake fireplace. It has 2 working PC's plus printers for surfing the internet but it's frequently being hogged by guests. They have 3 elevators there, 2 elevators at the lobby and another 1 further inside the hotel. I am only familiar with the lobby elevators, out of the 2, only one serves from basement to the 14th floor (basement is where the breakfast room and gym are located) and the other serves from the lobby till the 12th floor (they don't have a 13th floor). Hotel is centrally located, 1 block away from Times Square and it's near and pleasent enough to walk from to the United Nations building too. We feel this hotel is located nicely in the middle to where all the actions are in Manhattan, we do like it very much. We feel safe as there is security in the hotel. The areas we walked at night are bustling with people (especially towards Times Square). For food and drinks, there is Starbucks across the street a block away, they have 4 permanent street carts along the streets in the evenings within a block and more of that in the mornings and afternoons. There is a deli a few units away for breakfast, lunch and dinner (i think it's open 24/7) and a pizza joint 2 Bros Pizza for $1 per slice. There are two 24hrs Duane & Reade's covenience stores within a block walk on other side of the avenues, a Border's Bookstore 1 block away. Walking to Grand Central is much more nearer as compared to walking to Port Authority. Bryant Park aka Public Library is a walking distance away too or a subway station ride distance. Rockfeller Ctr is like 2 streets away. Magnolia Bakery is at the Rockefeller building vicinity. The famous all night halal food supper for the peckish (53rdand6th.com/) is 7 streets away along 6th Ave, a short distance walk really. There is a 24/7 Macdonalds within the same block also. For transportation, the 47-50 St Rockefeller subway station is a short 1 street away and bus stops are available nearby on both sides of the avenues. Sauntering walking down slowly to the subway stations at 42 St Times Square and Port Authority is also recommended for some needed exercise and access to other subway lines. On our journey back to JFK airport, we procure the service through a counter available at the hotel, we paid $60 (all inclusive) for a private car ride and the driver was conveniently waiting outside the hotel for an immediate ride. We had to do that as we by now had two 20-23kgs per bag heavy, 28\" hard case luggage, one 20-23kgs heavy 28\" canvass luggage (bought in NYC) and one 20-23kgs heavy 14\" canvass luggage. Also we got 2 carryin backpacks fully loaded too. Overall this is the BEST hotel stay we had in our experience for New York and we will sure be going there again as long as the price doesn't jump much (fat hope!). We do recommend for others to stay there. Please come before word gets out on how great the hotel is as that can only mean one thing, HIGHER ROOM RATES!!!!! I am sorry for i did not make an effort to know the staffs names but the ones who were friendly and we like are all the watchmen serving in the morning till evening. (To the one coming to Singapore soon, we hope you enjoy your stay here) To the all counter staffs (except for the older lady working in the morning) who always smiles and greet customers walking through the lobby. Not forgetting the friendly old man who serves in the breakfast room and also to the 2 housekeeping ladies.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cStarted good, had potential, but last day went down the drain.\u201d", "Author": "LineNoise", "ReviewID": "UR125322333", "Content": "Stayed for business in December 2011. I was here during the tree lighting and the place was packed to the gills. The breakfast was a very good continental breakfast, the lobby was very nice. The room was a good size too for NYC. If you stay in the back of the hotel, there's 1 elevator that services about 14 floors if I remember correctly. Here's the problem; It's the slowest elevator in NYC. I worked walking high rises in the city and rode elevators for hours and this one was the most ridiculous POS ever. One morning I waited for 20 minutes while it skipped my floor and went back up (I think I was on 9) and by the time it came back down it was full. This went on over and over and over. I had a 90Lb equipment case with me so I couldn't exactly use the stairs. If you plan on staying here, plan on using the stairs! I went to concierge to get me a car to airport, when she called the car company they got into a verbal argument over the phone. After 5 minutes of bickering back and forth she finally got them to agree to send a car that would be there in \"10 minutes\". Well if anyone knows anything about NYC, NO car will arrive in 10 minutes. 25 minutes later the car arrives, the driver comes in and starts going at it with the concierge in spanish. With the the elevator that morning and now this BS I couldn't believe it. Turns out as the driver told me on the way to LGA is that the hotel takes awhile to cut them a check for the fee, so they want the customers to pay directly.

But unfortunately there was certain things that the hotel did that completely ruined our holiday. The way we had booked the hotel was so that when we arrive, we would be paying off the full balance then. I tried to pay with my card but for some reason the card was not going through, so I said no worries tomorrow I will be withdrawing the money cash and giving it to you. I paid the majority of the reservation by cash and the remainder with card. The new person at the desk must have not told the person that was there the night before that we had already paid the full balance of the reservation and so this particular person decided to help themselves to using my card. I was completely oblivious to this, it only came to my attention when I went shopping and came to buy something and found that I did not have enough money. It was extremely embaressing. I went back to our room and had a look at my online banking and saw that the hotel had decided to put through 4 TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE SPACE OF 4 MINUTES. The total amount was for $400 (which was the remaining amount of the hotel bill we decided to pay by card) I went downstairs and gave them a piece of my mind. To start with, the money which they had taken from us, we had already paid the day before. By the morning after the first night, we had paid off the whole bill in total how DARE they use my card and help themselves to money and what makes it worse is that it was FOUR TRANSACTIONS meaning they tried it the first time and saw it went through so continued to try and take some more out. on top of that. They had taken an extra $145 for absolutely no reason what so ever. Secondly, they had used my card WITHOUT CONSENT. These transactions had taken place 11:48pm I'm sure there is elements of legal issues that come into place, and as a hotel this is appalling behaviour. After a bit of a shouting match, they returned my money back to me in cash, but this completely ruined our holiday. To top things off we had a little friend visit us in our room which had nibbled a hole in my four year old daughter's coat to try and get to the hershey's kisses that was in there. They changed our room and upgraded us for free. It was a real shame because I couldn't enjoy it properly. It was our first time to the states and to be honest I could not wait to get back. One word of advise, MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT KEEP YOUR CARD DETAILS. Apart from that, the staff were quite nice apart from one lady who is the duty manager there. Her attitude absolutely stank.

The hotel does not charge for local calls and long distance is charged at a reasonable rate. Other hotels take note. One of the big advantages of the hotel is they supply a continental breakfast, which is very good. Nothing too fancy, but good coffee, a selection of cereals and fruit, doughnuts, bagels and toast. Ideal for starting the day. There is also a small bar on the second floor, that charges 3 dollars for a beer and 5 dollars for a glass of wine. The area around the hotel is known as Little Brazil and there are a good selection of Brazilian restaurants. If you are shopping for electronics in New York, Best Buy is at 44th and 5th Avenue and the service is good. Much better than trying to find what you want in the Apple Store at 59th and 5th, which was heaving when I was there. They also have wi fi for guests and two computers in the lobby for you to use.

The other couple was visiting us from Brazil and this was their first visit to the United States. Imagine our surprise when we discovered the street on which the hotel is located (46th) is nicknamed Little Brazil. The street had several Brazilian restaurants on it and many Brazilians stay in the hotel. Needless to say, we felt right at home. First off, the name is a misnomer. The hotel isn't at Times Square, which is two blocks away. They don't normally allow you to let check in before 3 p.m., but they already had several rooms cleaned and allowed us to check in at 1:30. Our room was on the top floor, which meant a long, slow elevator ride up. There are two elevators, but only one that goes all the way up. The room was very nice and really clean. It was a little small, but very comfortable. It had a huge walk-in closet with a programmable safe for our valuables. There was also an extra pillow. The TV was a flat screen that telescoped out from the wall. The bed was extremely comfortable. The climate controls on the air conditioner kept our room the perfect temperature. The bathroom was a little cramped, but clean and adequate. Only one person at a time can really use it to get ready, so plan accordingly if you're on a schedule. One really nice feature is that the maid service doesn't come banging on the door at 9 a.m. like most places. We never saw them on our floor, but our room was always cleaned and the towels replaced. They left more than enough towels each day, so that was never a concern. There were two cordless phones in the room, with clear instructions on which numbers to dial for specific services. Now, when we wanted to go out, we had to wait for the elevator to come up to the 14th floor from the lobby, which was very time-consuming, especially if you're in a hurry. You could take the stairs if you don't mind descending 14 flights of stairs. One nice little unexpected bonus was the second-floor bar. Dubbed \"the biggest little bar in NYC\" by the management, it stays open late and offers just about any libation you could desire. The sign out front promised $3 drafts, $3 shots and $5 cocktails. We went two different nights. The first night they were out of draft beer. The shots were the smallest I've ever seen, but what do you expect for $3? The bartender was a friendly young American girl who kept our glasses filled. The place is tiny, with only enough room for six two-seat tables and three chairs at the bar, but has all of the high-dollar liquors. The second night couldn't have been more different than the first. A different bartender, who sounded like she might have come from Eastern Europe, never did get the prices right. She tried to charge me $6 for a shot and had no idea what the actual prices were when I questioned the prices. She was playing this Euro techno-pop music very loudly, so much so that it made it difficult for my wife and I to talk. She also had her boyfriend sitting at the bar, and between drinking shots with him she went downstairs and out front with him to smoke, leaving the bar completely unattended and several people's glasses empty for an extended period of time. The next day, even though we'd checked out, the hotel alowed us to leave our bags there while we explored New York City some more. They locked the bags in a secure room until we returned to pick them up up. It was extremely cordial of them to do that even though they were under no obligation to do so.

It was not allowed to open the windows but you could open them. At night we used the air con which was quite noisy. We had the room directly beneath the next house which was under total construction. There was noise of heavy machinery all day starting in the early morning. In the evening demolition cars parked in the street and destroyed stuff which came out of the construction site. This noise was awful and definitely more than I expected even for a city like NYC. We couldn't change the room because the hotel was full and the only other room option faced the small courtyard with no light at all (that was what the lady at the reception told us). So we stayed at this room and suffered. Because of the incredible noise it was not worth the money (>300 USD). The breakfast room ist small and without windows.

That was the real bummer of the trip, but no fault of anyone, nature is nature. We had spent a few days on the Jersey shore before heading up to NY. Since there were evacuations happening in that area, we left NJ pretty early in the morning. We got to the hotel about 7 am, WAY too early for check in. They were nice enough to put our luggage in a storage room so we didn't have to carry it around while we explored the city for a few hours. Even though check in was at 3, they told us to come back at noon. And to my pleasant surprise, they actually had a room ready for us at noon. It was great, as we were quite tired by this time. Our room was in the back section of the hotel on the 9th floor. The elevator was on the slow side, and it was very rare you wouldn't have a stop along the way (sometimes for no reason at all).The room was comfortable, clean and stylish. It was enough space for the two of us. It was right next to a construction site unfortunately, with some VERY loud angry workers, but we preferred to spend our days out of the room. I loved the proximity of the hotel to some of the sites we wanted to see. We were able to walk to Times Square, Rockefeller plaza, Grand Central Station, and plenty of other places. It was also close to the theater where we planned on seeing a Broadway play (which was unfortunately canceled due to the Hurricane precautions). I also enjoyed that the hotel had a complimentary breakfast room. It wasn't anything gourmet or super luxurious, but it was really nice to have a simple breakfast at the start of any busy day. The room can get a bit crowded, but it wasn't ever a big deal. If there weren't any seats, we just took breakfast up to our room. Another great perk was the Upstairs Bar, located on the second floor kinda tucked away. The night the storm moved in, there were a lot of people hanging out in there since there wasn't really anywhere else to go. Plus the ladies working the bar each night were very friendly and were able to give us a few tips about the city. We had no problems with the staff at the front desk. They were never rude to us. Actually they were pretty accommodating. Which was admirable, as the staff that arrived Saturday had to stay until Monday working. The whole storm thing was pretty crazy since nobody knew what to expect. With the whole worries of the hurricane, they let us opt to \"reserve\" an extra night in case we had to stay due to travel issues. Luckily we didn't have to, so we weren't charged. The hotel also offers a reduced rate parking in the garage across the street. I wouldn't recommend bringing a car if you don't have to... it's not difficult to get a cab at all and the hotel is close to so much. Our trip was pretty derailed by the storm, so we felt a little robbed of our NY experience. I would want to go back and see the rest of our \"to do\" list, plus some of the things that had been recommended to us, and when that happens, I would definitely stay at the Hotel @ Times Square again. I would recommend this hotel to others as well. It was a very comfortable stay (which says a lot since we had to stay indoors more than we'd planned).

The last time we stayed in NYC we had a hotel room with an excellent view, and though we certainly appreciated it, we spent very little time actually _in_ our room. This time around, a view was less important than being closer to the sights, and also, I wanted to spend a little less. The Hotel at Times Square seemed to meet my list of expectations. We just returned home from our long weekend, and I am happy to say that this hotel left us both fully satisfied. It's not a very large hotel, so there is not much in the way of a view. In fact, we were on the 2nd floor, overlooking the entrance. That's really the only downside of the experience, although, as I previously stated, I wasn't terribly interested in a view anyway. The inside of the hotel is very clean and modern, in greens and reds. The room was adequately spacious by NY standards. In fact, some of our friends staying in a shall-not-be-named more expensive hotel just a few blocks away visited our room and were amazed at how much more space we had as compared to theirs. The room and bathroom were very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel offers a continental breakfast, which I really don't care for, but there is a McDonald's right around the corner. And speaking of right around the corner...Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, the subway...all are just a short walk away. You can't beat the location! Considering the time spent in our hotel room was sleeping and showering, it was perfect! I've seen comments about the hotel staff being rude, but we had nothing but positive experiences with the staff. They checked us in early, and they were very helpful in suggesting the best way to get us back to the airport for our departure...we saved money, in fact, thanks to their helpful suggestions.

The service at the front desk was friendly and the luggage storage prior to check in was simple, secure and very convenient. Parking just across the street, past the hotel, if you're driving in - most reasonable rate around with voucher from hotel upon check out ($30 per 24 hours - begins at the time you drive in, not per day, so that gives you a full 24 hours based on when you arrive). Thought it was going to be difficult driving in NY, but getting to the hotel was very easy and only took about 10 minutes once we drove through the main tunnel into the city. We saved big bucks not having to fly in. The rooms were very, very clean, as was the hotel itself. Breakfast included yogurt, bagels, toast, cereal, donuts, juice, coffee, tea, and boiled eggs. Perfect way to begin each day! We had 3 rooms within our group and all were given on the same floor. Beds were very comfy and the room (we had one with 2 doubles) were a good size, even if you had 4 people). When one room had an issue with its air conditioner, service was not only prompt and with a smile, it was continued until the problem was solved. The couple was not only offered a new room, but 3 different options to choose from (higher floor with two doubles, higher floor with a king, lower floor with 2 doubles). Obviously, this won't always be the case when the hotel is booked, however the front desk did everything they could to help ensure that our stay would be comfortable. Everyone from the cleaning staff (who readily gave us extra towels), to the maintainence crew to the luggage valet, to the front desk staff were wonderful. Lobby was clean and attractive and the decor was perfect for a boutique hotel. Just far enough away (only 2 blocks) from the crazy hustle and bustle of the heart of the city, but close enough to the best shopping, stores, bus tour and subway access that NY has to offer. Dollar store just up the street, if you forget umbrellas and free WiFi in the hotel was a bonus. There is some construction going on next door, but it was great that it didn't begin until after 7 each morning - and of course, there is construction going on ALL over New York, so this is, by no means, any fault of the hotel. Just be aware that, depending on which way your room faces, you may hear some clanging in the morning. To be honest, our kids slept in until 9 am, even with the noise. The AC does help to drown it out and, in all honesty, you don't go to NY to sleep the day away.

We continued to complain and were told they would adjust our room rate. When I went to check out I was told that the 5% rate reduction for AARP would not apply to me as I was not over 65. When I asked about the discount upon making the reservations, I was never told I had to be over 65. The woman checking me out was also there when the manager said she would reduce the rate but since the manager was off she would do nothing. I had to call the hotel on Monday despite leaving a message for the manager to call me only to find out we were to be given $30.00 off one night but a bug problem that we had to put up with all week. I explained that I took pictures of the bugs on the last night and would send the pictures to her. I also told her that not only were there bugs, when I moved the trash can there was dirt and hairs all over the floor as well. I said I didn't think the $30.00 was enough and told her about the 5% AARP rate. The manager said she would talk to her supervisor and call me back. Each time I had to call the manager but I was always the next person she was going to call. Bottom line is they gave the 5% and only $30.00. I have been trying to call the corporate office since last week and no one will call me back. I even left a message for Liz in Customer Service and she has not returned my call. I can't believe a corporation such as Apple Core would rather have the poor publicity than do what was promised to me. The manager said she also talked to housekeeping about the dirty bathroom as well. I was told that if I ever came back they would upgrade my room IF there was something available. No thanks to the upgrade ... more customer service would be much better.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Bar,Good Service, And Fabulous Time!\u201d", "Author": "Bhanderson", "ReviewID": "UR115031823", "Content": "I travelled here for my birthday this year and it was fabulous!!

I took a group of students to NYC so we booked a total of 8 rooms. I really liked the location of the hotel, it was close to Times Square and the Theatre District. I think the rooms were decent sized and the room I stayed in was clean. The stay here was not without problems. When we checked in, three of our rooms had refrigerators in them (at our request). I asked about paying for the refrigerators and was told that we would pay at the end of the week (we checked in on Sunday evening). On Tuesday, we returned to our rooms to find we had been locked out of all three rooms with refrigerators. No one attempted to contact us, they just locked us out of the rooms. We all had to go to the lobby and wait in line for a front desk employee, who was not pleasant (it was a male employee, not sure of his name). As a result of having to wait to clear this up, part of the group was late to a Mets baseball game and the others were late to a Broadway show. This was frustrating since not only did I inquire about the refrigerator payment at check in, the other advisor asked about them on Monday since hers was not working properly. I did file a complaint with the manager and she responded very quickly and offered us an upgrade during our next stay. We continued to have issues throughout the week with members of our group being locked out of their rooms because of the key cards not working. In addition, one member of the group on the 8th floor had an issue with bugs in the bathtub. The night staff was once again rude and not helpful. She called again in the morning and reached the manager who dealt with the problem right away. They did send a company in to spray the room for bugs, however, this left an unpleasant smell in the room for the remainder of her stay. Most of the problems were with the adult chaperone rooms, so at least our students had an enjoyable stay. My only other complaint is that there is a lot of construction in the area and a movie crew down the street which caused a lot of noise at night while trying to sleep (we were on the 2nd floor).", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWILL STAY HERE AGAIN\u201d", "Author": "RMS4366", "ReviewID": "UR114885182", "Content": "The Hotel@ Times Square was very convenient to every thing i planned to do and see while in New York.

The following evening, we had 3 rooms in which the security was breached and money was taken from one of the rooms. The front desk informed us that there was no Manager on site and that they could not reach the manager until Monday (this was Friday!!!). It took us 3 hours to check all of the rooms and move our students to safe rooms that had proper locking windows. All of the windows have a sign that instructs you not to open it and therfore, you are unaware that the window does not lock properly. We found it very interesting that the rooms with windows that did not lock were the ones that were entered and the hotel tried to tell us that it was the girls fault for leaving the windows open even when they did not touch them. When we opened the windows to check if they locked we discovered garbage and cigarette butts on the fire escapes. A nice hangout to wait for people to leave the room? Our students (mostly teenage girls) did not feel safe in this hotel after this episode. We called the police and made a report and it was only after this that the front desk was will to accomodate our requests without difficulty. The rooms were very musty and smelly. I woke up each morning with a migraine from the air quality in this hotel. You can smell smoke in the rooms (even in the non-smoking rooms) and there were people smoking marijuna on one of the floors each night. Two of our rooms had bugs in them. Disgusting!!!

My 72 yr old mother hadn't been there in many years and my 18 yr old daughter had never been. We chose this hotel on a recommendation from two others who had been there before. It was a good recommendation. The hotel is in a great location. We found that in the 5 days we stayed, we only needed to use public transportation a couple of times. We could walk to many, many areas of interest...Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, The United Nations, The MoMA, Grand Central Terminal, NYC Public Library, etc. The room we chose was a 2 room suite. For just a few dollars more, we had two nice sized bedrooms each with its own tv, king or queen sized bed, and comfy chair. We shared a closet, bathroom, and desk. It was so worth the extra money. I felt that the rooms were a nice size for NYC and the entire hotel is updated and pleasant. I did like the mattress, although the one we had had a definate indentation on the side closest to the bathroom. If there is a way to turn the mattress, that would be advised. We had one problem, but it was a non-issue because they management was so quick to respond. Our toilet started overflowing, but I turned off the water and called the front desk. There was a maintanance man there in a couple of minutes. He repaired the problem, cleaned up the mess and returned will new towels all within 15-20 minutes. As I said, what could have been a huge mess turned out to be a non-issue. I read some of the previous reviews for this hotel and I must comment on one of them. The person stated that their room was unclean and mentioned all sorts of horrific things that they found in the room. As I thought about that, I realized that it is a false review. If anyone opens a door to an uncleaned room, they don't go in looking at the mess. They close the door, go back downstairs and ask for a new room. I am surprised that Trip Advisor posted that review as it is clearly made up and false. We found the hotel to be reasonably priced, a great location, a decent breakfast (and we appreciated the savings) and the staff pleasant.

This was our 3rd or 4th stay - dating back to when it was the Super 8 Hotel. Relax, hotel has been remodled since then and is actually very nice. Location is good, few blocks down from Radio City and a few blocks over from madness of Times Square. Grand Central is a 5 minute walk - over a couple streets and down a few blocks. We made reservations on-line through applecorehotels.com. We were able to reserve a 2 room suite for less than what other similar hotels charged for 1 room. Upon check in we received a AAA discount of about $15 per night, so it was worth inquiring. Also, good thing is cancellation policy is hassle free up tp day before check-in. We actually cancelled first reservation and made another when we saw price on web site had dropped close to time for trip. The room and bathroom were very, very clean and seemed to have been recently redone. Furnishings were all clean and new. Breakfast was basic but good. We prefer to go grab a bagel out, but what the hotel offers- donuts, bagels, coffee, cereal - is not bad at all (and free). Little bar on 2nd floor was a new addition. It is tiny, but I did have a couple drinks there one night before heading out to a restaurant. Has to be only $3 beer in NYC! Was clean and waitress was friendly. Fine place to grab a quick drink while waiting for others in your party to get ready to go out. On day of check out, we stored bags in lobby while sight seeing until late afternoon- was a nice service by hotel. Only negatives are that (1) elevators do run slow, but we just took stais a couple times. Small inconvenience and waiting on the elevators would not have been a big deal. (2) catching a cab is a little difficult b/c 46th street is not that busy with cabs on the hotel's block and there is no cab stand in front of the hotel. Unless you are really good at hailing cabs, plan to take the subway or to get the concierge to arrange for a car service - or simply walk like we did most of the time. Read review below saying had bedbugs but we saw absolutely no trace and we were looking for them! Bed bug registry (google it) said hotel was not infested. Bottom line, this is actually a perfectly good (bordering on kinda nice) moderately priced hotel in a great location. I felt very safe and my wife and daughter were quite pleased - and they can be much more picky than me! You will be out and about all the time anyway, so why blow the budget on a four or five star place. I would give this a very solid 3.5 stars.

Sept. 18-10 until Fri. Sept. 25-10 after returning from a 7 day Canada New England cruise in & out of New York. We were given 2 rooms on the 4th floor with 2 double beds each. The room & the bathroom were very clean. This is my 4th visit to New York & the size of the room for a New York hotel was very spacious having 2 windows & a window in the bathroom. We were concerned when we looked out our bedroom window to discover a construction site next door. The front desk told us it was quiet & if there was a problem on Monday the hotel would deal with it. Due to the economy & recession the construction on the site has stopped so it was quiet the whole week we were there. The room we booked was a smoking room as it was $100.00 less a night compared to a non-smoking room. My girlfriend & I are not smokers and we could not smell smoke in our room. I remember reading some other reviews of the hotel & comments about the bathroom door having a frosted glass insert in it. Yes it's different but we didn't find it a problem & you can't really see anything. The rippled glass adds character to the room. The air condioner in the room worked great keeping us cool. The beds were most comfortable & clean. The housekeeping staff was most friendly & helpful. The free continental breakfast was great with fresh fruit, instant oatmeal, asstd. yogurts, bagels & cream cheese, toast & jams, asstd cereals, asstd. yogurts, orange & apple juice, coffee/tea, fresh doughnuts. We found it just enough to get your morning going & we agreed that we're sure it's a savings of $20.00 for breakfast. The elevators are slow but people this is an old New York building so you have to have patience & not expect speeding bullet elevators. If you can't wait & your in a hurry for the elevator - then take the steps & get some good added exercise. The internet is free with 2 monitors, keyboards & printers with a time allowance of 15 min. per person which was great. The Concierge was most helpful esp. connecting me with a resident Doctor in the area as I needed antibiotics. Ella & those at the frontdesk check-in were most helpful. Check out is at Noon which is also great. The hotel will hold your luggage if you have a later flight that day or evening. Lastly, location, location, location. The hotel is located 2 blocks from Times Square. There is a HSBC bank 1/2 block away as is a MacDonald's. Ladies for shopping the Dress Barn is located right next door to the hotel.

Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond her control, she had to cancel. She was travelling to New York on Greyhound and found out the night before her departure that there was a high possibility that Greyhound would lockout it's employees leaving her, her 2 children, and her mother stranded in New York City. I contacted Applecore Hotels at 8:00pm the night before her arrival to cancel and was told that because they have a 24 hour cancellation policy I would have to contact the hotel manager, that she was the only person who could cancel a reservation due to special circumstances, which I felt this was so I thought there would be no problem, I couldn't have been more wrong. I then left a message for the hotel manager indicating the situation and asked that she call me back to discuss. When I didn't hear from her the next morning, I left another message at 9:30am. Because the reservation was that evening, I was in a bit of a panic to make sure it was cancelled, so I contacted the front desk ,who spoke to the hotel manager and passed along a message indicating that the client would be billed for one night. I asked to speak directly to the hotel manager, but was put through to the reservation manager who couldn't do anything, but said he would if he could. I then tried talking to the reservation company again, but they couldn't do anything either. I understand the 24 hour cancellation policy, but I also know that exceptions are made every day for special circumstances. At 11:00am I called the front desk again and strongly requested that I be put through to the hotel manager. She was very rude and would not listen to anything I had to say. When I asked if she \"couldn't\" or \"wouldn't\" change the reservation, she said she \"wouldn't\"! She informed me again that she would be billing the client for one nights stay, but if the client visited the hotel in the next month she would refund this payment. I told her that wasn't possible as the trip was a gift for one of her travel companions who would be leaving the country. I have emailed the hotel manager and Apple Core's general manager multiple times and left voice messages. I also sent a message via the hotel's website, mostly I have had notreplies. I've sent in my credit card information to have the room rate applied to my card, rather than my clients, as I do not feel that my client should suffer because of this situation. They \"lost\" my credit card information. They will not contact me to tell me how this could have happened. They are now asking for me to send it again, which I refuse to do. I believe that the client is due a 100% refund from this hotel. I have been trying to contact the general manager but she will not respond. I have read other reviews where similar situations have occurred. Do not expect to receive any kind of understanding or help from the staff at this hotel.

Also no in room dining to speak off - they are happy to give you menus though of the restaurants around - like Pizza places etc- so maybe we should call it a motel.

The other great thing was the free long distance calls in the USA and free internet- but when it didn't work you had to call the internet provider.But to be fair that wasn't much of a hassle- but then why not call this a serviced apartment The free continental breakfast- was ok - and kept you going till you could step out and have a decent meal The staff are friendly - but not always helpful.

It's always a risk picking a hotel in such a big city but this one proved to be a good bet. Despite being called The Hotel @ Times Square it's not actually located on Times Square - this however was not a problem as it was only about two blocks from Broadway (it seems to be common practice to name things like this in NYC). The hotel was really easy to find when we got off the Subway and the walk from Broadway to the hotel felt safe (as far as possible in such a large city!) The hotel staff were helpful and check-in was quick and easy. The hotel were also able to store our luggage on check-out until we were due to go to the airport. Our room was on the 3rd floor which meant we had a lovely view of an outside stairwell and the side of the building next door which was a bit dispointing but to be honest we didn't spend enough time in the room for it be a problem. The room was a good size considering it was right in the heart of the city. It was nicely decorated and had a big flat screen TV and plenty of space for our luggage (a walk in wardrobe). The bathroom was a bit small (but not to the point of inconvenience) and the only strange thing was that the bathroom door was made of frosted glass! Not a problem if you're with your partner or very close firend but may be an issue for some people. The room came with breakfast which is unusual in NYC hotels (from what we found during booking) and so we weren't expecting much. We were therefore surprised to find a very generous spread of toast, a variety of bagels, cereals, doughnuts (god bless America!) and plenty of fruit juice, tea and coffee. The breakfast room was large and spacious and you could either watch the local news on TV or read a complimentary copy of USA Today. There is also a directory in the room that has plenty of suggestions for diners for breakfast if you want more of a typical American breakfast - we recomend the Red Flame Diner round the corner for pancakes! The reception area of the hotel was very well presented and there appeared to be computers availbale for guests to use however we did not make use of these facilities. There is also a fitness centre in the hotel which we didn't use either. My only negative comment about this hotel is that my GHD straighteners didn't work! I think this may be to do with the electricity supply in America in general and the hotel obviously has restrictions in place to stop fuses blowing etc. They did however provide a reasonably powerful hairdryer in the bathroom and other electrical apliances worked fine (ie phone/camera charger, own hairdryer).

Having read the reviews on tripadviser I chose this hotel as the reviews were generally good and the price we found on hotels.com was very good for New York. First impressions were very good, a nice lobby area and a fairly seemless check in process. I had previously contacted the hotel to request adjacent rooms and this was granted, we were located on the 12th floor. Both rooms were a good size and contained a nice big comfortable bed, plasma TV, Radio Alarm which you could dock an Ipod into and a clean bathroom, I could have no complaints about the bedrooms. My parents had a small problem with the bath plug which they reported to reception in the morning, the plug was replaced and fixed by the time they returned later in the day. The only negative point of the whole visit to the hotel at times square was the checkout process, as mentioned previously we booked via hotels.com at a nightly rate of $123, when we checked out the guy behind reception tried to charge us $135 and told us that this was the correct rate (this is despite showing him a copy of the confirmation from hotels.com). After about 20 mins of discussion and phone calls our bill was amended. Throughtout the whole process the guy (his name was Ashok) showed no commen sense or customer service and was quite frankly not interested in helping us, we appeared to be a problem rather than a guest at the hotel. I noticed a another guest earlier checking out who appeared to have a similar problem, I would incourage future guests to check the nightly tariff when you check in to avoid any problems when checking out.

It looked clean (which it was) and the free breakfast and wi-fi was a plus. But that's where it ended. The room was on the 10th floor right outside an elevator, and right next to a door in the corridor that separated the rooms and the staircase. This door was supposed to be on a spring but it obviously wasn't working so the door would slam LOUDLY every time someone entered or exited. As soon as i walked into the room it was boiling hot so i opened the 2 windows and turned the heat off (at about 6pm). It never got any cooler in the room, so at 5am we called reception to tell them about the problem. They said they would send someone up. Half an hour later we get a call with them telling us there's no one able to come up, so we ask if we can change to a different room and were told there were no more rooms. So after having a sleepless nights sleep we go downstairs at 10am and ask again for a different room. We are shown a room on the 12th floor and that was fine except we had somewhere to be that morning and couldn't move our luggage then, and told them we'd be back later to move our things. When we arrived back a few hours later they had given away the room and only had rooms in the smoking wing which smelt awful, and we refused. The only thing they could offer us is to pay $50 extra per night for a suite, which was ridiculous! Throughout this whole experience not one staff member apologized or tried to rectify the situation with any sort of caring or empathy. We stayed 1 more night in that room (which also had terrible street noise even 10 floors up!) and checked out after only 2 nights. DO NOT let them give you room 1007!!!! We moved a few blocks away to the brand new Distrikt Hotel on 40th and the service here is amazing! They even called about 5 minutes after arriving in the room to make sure everything was okay.

Our view was nothing special - just looking at other buildings, as you do in a big city - but it was more interesting to spy on people in their offices than stare at other tourists staring at you... ;-) Breakfast was very filling - three types of cereal + oatmeal, plain and fruit bagels, yoghurt, and donuts. Yum, donuts. I love donuts. I recommend not staying there at the same time as me or you might miss out on donuts because I love 'em! Actually, nobody ever missed out on donuts (that I saw) because when the tray of donuts was empty, the guy would just bring out a new tray of donuts! The business centre consists of two computers, each with a printer. They were free to use but quite popular and I often saw people waiting to use them. If you've got your own laptop and don't need to print, take it and use the free wifi in your room. There was only one issue we had with the room which was easily fixed - it was too hot. There's a heater in each room but we never turned ours on because the hot water pipes in the wall threw out enough heat anyway. It seemed to be related to whether the people above us were using their heater, we think. Sometimes the pipes were filled with hot water and it heated up our heater unit as a result. We just opened the window (which have stickers saying \"don't open the window\" but we didn't care. We didn't bother telling management about it but might have if we'd been in a room without a window to regulate the temperature. The hotel is less than 40 seconds walk to the subway station which has the B, D, F, and V lines running through it. We arrived from JFK and took the AirTrain to Howard Beach Station, then the subway to W 4th St and changed to an uptown D train and emerged from the subway station virtually at the hotel so it was quite easy to manage. The street has a number of restaurants of varying international flavour (Brazilian, Italian, Mexican, etc). The Italian restaurant beside the hotel (just on the other side of the construction zone) was reasonably priced with good food and worth a look. We were able to walk to anything easily - Times Square, Empire State Building, etc. Originally we were tossing up between this hotel and one in the United Nations building. The latter offered views of the city and that did sound appealing. In hindsight, we chose the better hotel because we were then *in* the city where the action was, rather than just looking at lights.

Well I can confirm the positive reviews. This hotel is all that you need for NYC. It's very well located being close to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre and the subway. The first room we had was at the back of the hotel and had no view but it was quiet. The room was small and it was difficult to open all our suitcases - wifey has a suitcase that is in two halves so it needs the floor space of an average billard table to be able to open it. If you stand the suitcase up it doubles as a walk-in-robe! The decor is very tastefully done as was pointed out by wifey who knows about these things. I just wanted to know how many cable channels there were. The tariff is very reasonable (for NYC) and is value for money. I knew I had done well when the rest of the the people staying there were modest tourist types like ourselves with not a business man to be seen - not even one trying to save on his travel allowance. Also not much English was being spoken and it sounded like some Eastern European languages which had me wondering how they got the word about this hotel. The breakfast is included and is well run. On return to NYC we stayed in the front of the hotel in a much larger room and it had a good view of the small park opposite. Make sure you ask for a non-smoking room as they have both. My only gripe. The lift (elevator) at the back makes a pinging noise on every floor and in the lift (elevator) you feel like you are in a German U-Boat being pinged by a Royal Navy destroyer.

My room on the 11th floor has been so nice and quiet, the beds are luxuriously comfortable (so comfortable in fact that I've missed each of the free breakfasts so far because I've slept in so late!), the rooms are perfectly cleaned up every day, and the free wi-fi is a real bonus. I had a small problem with my bathtub drain not working, and they were up within 10 minutes to fix it. Very efficient. The one downside (noted by a previous reviewer as well) is that they give you plastic and styrofoam cups in the room. I also read that the breakfasts are served all on disposable plates with plastic utensils as well. From andenvironmental standpoint, I think it's extremely wasteful and I hope management seriously looks into providing real cups, dishes, and cutlery as soon as possible. In addition, if they truly are trying to promote themselves as a boutique hotel, all the more reason to cut out the tacky and wasteful disposables.

The staff at the Ramada Eastside were more personable, whereas the ones at The Hotel are a little less interested in you as a guest. The breakfast room at this hotel is packed in the mornings...a lot more tourists stay here with their families...so you may have to wait to find a table or place to sit and eat.

We chose this particular hotel because my father has some health problems and cannot walk far distances. In NYC, this is problematic of course because it is a pedestrian city. I promise that this hotel was the very best hotel to stay at with my Dad on the trip because it was the closet hotel to everything (most tourist sights) that tourists have heard of and want to see. We were a mere couple of blocks from Father Duffy Square in Times Square, and we were right in the middle of the theatre district (mere blocks from all the shows we went to see). Upon arrival, yes we also had the fellow who could not speak a word of english, but he was friendly enough. We were also provided little \"welcome\" packages of the small things you might need or have forgotton (toothbrush, toothpaste, tylenol, etc). It was a nice touch. There is also complimentary continental breakfast served every morning. Fitness centre and high speed interent included as well as boutiques on the main floor. The rooms themselves are standard sized (we stayed in a 2 bedroom double bed room). they are not incredibly small, but not overly large. They are comfortable enough. Our only issue was our television did not work when we arrived and we required extra pillow, so we called down to the front desk for service. It took a very long time for them to rectify the problem and to get more pillows to be honest, so we were a bit put off by their service standards. Clean rooms and it was nice to see that they had extra soap, shampoo and conditioner (knowing we were a party of three). The consierge looked to be a summer student who did not really care too much about her job. I asked her where I could get tickets for Billy Elliot, and she told me \"the box office\". Duh. I know that, but they are sold out and usually consierge helps out with this sort of thing. She was very hopeless and definitely NOT helpful. The Hotel is right beside a Dress Barn too, so ladies, lots of dress shopping too! We were staying there when the Pride Parade was going on and it was simply a block up the street, so it was convienient. A negative comment (besides the horrible consierge) would be that one of their two elevators was out of service, so we had to wait a LONG time for an elevator. A few times we took the stairs (we were on the 6th floor). In general, we would stay again just based on the location itself. Awesome location! Again, the rates my boyfriend found a decent rate of $160 for the first 3 nights and then $180 for the last two nights. Not too bad for such a great location.

They have 2 elevators, but at almost every time we used them, one was out of service for some unknown reason. It varied and wasn't always the same one, so it clearly wasn't an \"out of order\" issue. Frequently had long waits for the elevator. 2. Bathroom window didn't lock, and it was accessible from the fire escape. 3. Breakfast lines were long and seating not available when we went each day. 4. Maid service questionable. They did not restock our coffee or cups on any day. We had to repeatedly call each day for coffee packets. 5. Trouble making calls to front desks - phones not working or busy, not sure. 6. We found a pair of flip flops in our room one day, presumably left by room service. We actually didn't figure this out until we were leaving, as I and my niece both thought they belonged to the other person. Didn't have time to complain at checkout, but it is bothersome in retrospect to have someone in our room and leaving things. Looked like a man's flip flops. 7. 2 computers in lobby always in use, though didn't have to wait long to use. 8. Beds were double beds, not queen beds, as I thought the website said. Now, the good things. 1. Great value for price. 2. Great tourist location - a couple blocks from Times Square and the Theatre district. Close to Rockefeller Center. Close to 5th Avenue shopping. Can walk to Empire State Bldg (about 1 mile) and south side of Central Park (about 1 mile). 3. Nice room decor, large rooms, clean. Recently remodeled. 4. Free wireless internet. 2 computers and printers in the lobby for printing out online tickets, etc. They could use more computers, as they were always in use though people seemed to get off quickly if you stood there and waited. 5. Breakfast had good variety for continental breakfast - O.J., apple juice, milk, several cold cereals, oatmeal packets, variety of doughnuts, variety of bagles, toasters (with line), yogurt, bananas, and apples. We went between 9:30 and 10 each day (it closes at 10), and they hadn't run out of anything. Not enough seating at breakfast. 6. Nice lobby.

We leisurely made it down to breakfast, a little later each morning, but always found plenty of fresh pastries and fruit, coffee, cereal and yogurt and a table. I was impressed with how clean the breakfast room was no matter how late we arrived. Never waited for elevators because the stairs were next to the elevators, open and well lighted (in other words safe and not hidden away) and easy to take as well as a good way to work off extra calories. I was happy that the hotel was not in the middle of Times Squares (even though Times Square is in the name of the hotel). I felt very safe and comfortable in our location for this mother /daughter trip. Only needed to take subway for our Central Park stroll, Ellis Island visit, Century 21 shopping trip, and Greenwich Village stroll. It was so convenient to walk everywhere else. It was hard to believe this is a budget hotel. If pressed for concerns: There was one large high school group who were a bit loud the few times we ran into them (where were the chaperons?). I hope this lovely budget hotel does not become a haven for touring high school groups! Can't say that the concierge services were what I considered true concierge services, but didn't really care because we had a laptop in our room and with free wireless connections had trip advisor, hopstop.com, restaurant reviews etc. Everything we needed and no waiting. Overall the hotel was far better than what I expected for a budget hotel in NYC. I am sure the economy and time of year of our visit had a lot to do with the rates, but I did a lot of comparison shopping in preparation for this trip.

I was there for a business trip and therefore used the room for just basic accommodation, nothing more. Just one incident upon checkout that the management should work to address with the staff: I checked out at 8am plus and asked the front desk staff if she can help me call a taxi. She said that the concierge usually does it but the concierge staff had not arrived yet. Therefore, I had to flag the cab outside myself. Surely, the front desk staff there can dial for a cab using any phone line and not have to re-direct me to the absent concierge desk? I thought that this was very basic service, even for a budget hotel. Flagging a taxi is really no big deal for me but bear in mind that I am a foreigner who was hoping to get some help and it was also freezing cold outside.

You cant really complain because its free, but there was no place to sit, so we just took the food back upstairs to our room. A tip would be to use the tray in your room and take that downstairs to load, because its tricky carrying everything up.

The whole room had a really clean scent on it. Our bed was huge, and pretty soft. The room was equipped with a coffe maker, and all sorts of nice stuff. The street was silent, but on a great location, just a few blocks away from Times Square. I needed to print a car rent voucher, they didn't have a printer at the hotel, but I got directed to the comfort inn, just half a block away. There I got to print my paperwork.

So we really loved it, clean, silent and classy. No screaming youngsters in the corridor, or other distractions. There were two things we were a little bit confused about. The houskeeper, seemed to be a bit too enthusiastic about cleaning our room, she came into the room two times without knocking, and on the other time we had the \"do not disturb\"-sign hanging on our door. It was a bit annoying. The other thing concerned phone calls from the room. We are from Finland, and I tought I'll call the reception for prices. They told me, that the price would be around 70snt per minute. And I tought it much cheaper than with my cell, so I used the phone to call my family. After check-out I took a better look at the receipt, and noticed that we had been charged around 2usd per minute. I asked from the receptionist, but he had some bad excuse.

I even walked to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in about 35-40 minutes (I am a fast walker). The room was completely acceptable, and although small, it was well laid out. We unpacked, put our suitcases in the closet, and the room was not cluttered at all for the entire week. When I made the reservation, I told the clerk we would be staying a week and he said he would note that and try to give us a bigger room, but I don't know if that was actually the case. We arrived at the hotel before noon and were able to check in right away. I would say the room was recently renovated and given a facelift, and it looked very modern. It had wireless Internet access which we had no problems with, and was necessary as this was a business trip. The only problem we had was the window was a bit drafty, and I thought there were too many long black hairs on the towels. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine as I have a hair aversion, but I thought thick, coarse, black hairs were visible enough to be removed. The bathroom floor was heated, but we are not sure if that was by design or chance, in any case it was a nice touch. I think we stayed in room 604 (?) and the pipes were really noisy at times. It seemed like when the heat was on it was a bit less noticiable, but if you are a light sleeper it will definately wake you. I told the front desk about it and they offered to move us to another room, and had someone look at it (so maybe they fixed it). We chose not to move for our own convenience, and it was absolutely no reflection on the hotel staff, but it did seem less noticable for the last few days of the stay. The continental breakfast was a very nice touch, and had more than I needed for breakfast, yogurt, toast, cereal, doughnuts, all the usuals. It was clean and tidy and had an attendant at all times. We paid about $160 plus taxes for the room per night, which I thought was well worth it, especially for NYC. This is my third trip to NYC, and I would definately return to this hotel. If you are not looking for luxury, but a clean, standard hotel to base your days activities, this is it. The staff were extremely pleasant and we had no issues with the hotel at all. The bed was really comfortable, which is a big plus in my books!!!! Plus it has an ipod docking station which I thought was a really nice touch. It had some amenties of a higher end hotel at a budget hotel price. I am Canadian and usually stay at Delta hotels, I would put this more in the Comfort Inn line, but certainly at the higher end of this.
