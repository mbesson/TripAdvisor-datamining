My very first good impression was when I called the hotel to get information on their free shuttle, the staff was very polite and efficiently sent the shuttle my way to the airport, it was there in 5 minutes. The driver was super friendly and had great attitude, he offered me and other passengers some cold bottled water. Check-in was a breeze and the staff at the were very attentive, they even allowed me to have a late check out the next day. Like others had said, this place is brand new and everything is very modern. An excellent breakfast it's also included with your stay, coffee and tea are available 24 hours a day. All in all - this place, is a little gem and I for sure will be back. Thank you for such a great stay Element Miami!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice lobby and room, but has growing pains\u201d", "Author": "wvugrad2001", "ReviewID": "UR126445550", "Content": "Had a one bedroom guestroom with nice shower and kitchen. Room was spacious but the floors felt a little dirty and dusty. It is rather noisy here as the hotel is located directly under one of MIA's takeoff flightpaths. The biggest issue is the technology. Internet is extremely spotty and SLOW. There is only one router for the entire property. The staff knows this is a problem but doesn't bother to let the guests know. This is an extended stay hotel which means a lot of guests are here for work and need internet to conduct their business, but it doesn't work so we can't work. I understand the troubles of opening a new hotel and working out the kinks but internet should not be one of those problems. This is something that should have been vetted early on and remedied with the addition of more routers and stronger signals. Additionally, the food they serve for 'happy hour' was not good at all. It tasted like it had just come out of a microwave. I would give this place a rating of 'poor' if it wasn't for the staff doing everything they could to help try and mitigate the issues, minus failing to let guests know about the internet issues. Oh, one other thing. Mobile phone reception is pretty bad in the rooms.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cHad a few missing Elements, but overall, a good stay.\u201d", "Author": "Rastiloo", "ReviewID": "UR126397187", "Content": "Stayed here using a Starhot rate, so the value couldn't have been better. The hotel is close to the airport and provides a free shuttle. Omar, the shuttle driver is pleasant and helpful. They will also shuttle you to nearby locations for restaurants, shopping. We had a suite on the first floor. Great size room and the bed and pillows are awesome. Our sink had a leaky pipe, we noticed just before check out and notified them. They said they would fix it promptly; we were leaving so cannot confirm if it was fixed. The bad side of this hotel is the location. If you're on a layover, it's great. Close to the airport and hassle free. The problem is that there is literally nothing within walking distance. It's about a $35 (with tip) to get a cab to the South Beach area. We did take a cab to and from South Beach and that was fine, except because the hotel is so new and in an industrial area, no one knew where it was and our driver got lost - even with us giving him the address. Make sure you have the address with you, b/c the drivers won't know 'The Element'. The breakfast is great and the lobby is nice. The wifi is free and works great in the lobby. We couldn't get it to work in our room, so that wasn't so great. The rooms have very loud heating/cooling.

Airplane fly really really close at takeoff. If you like New Hotel and SPG reward points. This could be good for you. However, the hotel is situated far from Restaurant or public transportation. Either you drive a car, or have the shuttle takes you place nearby. The shuttle is quite good, they take you everywhere nearby. The shuttle bus is ready whenever the driver is there. However, they don't shuttle 24hours a day. They start at 5am until 11pm. But there is airport taxi that will run you 10$ for bringing you there to the hotel. The breakfast is free. But don't expect anything fancy, except for the Latte/Espresso/Cappuccino machine they have. It's running 24hr a day, free! There's a lot of room at this hotel. And the corridor is very very long. If they had booked you in rooms of small numbers, you will be end up 50meters/ or 30 second walk from the elevator. Make sure you ask for a \"Large number room #\" Like 239, 333, 440, not 201 or 302. The outside terrace is very nice indeed. They have a fireplace next to the pool. The pool was open at my 3rd / 6 days stay. Didn't try if they water is salted or not. But the pool opens 6am to dawn. There's no restaurant at this hotel. The parking was free at our stay. The car rental is NOT within walkable distance. Ask the shuttle driver to take you there for free. Noise wasn't an issue for me, if you close the window. But my wife complain about it at night. Probably i was very tired everynight. A nice plus, the standard room has Kitchen!! The kitchen is fully equipped. Cutlery, knifes, pots, toaster, microwave, fridge, can opener, tap water filter came standard at our room. The room entrance has engineering wood floor, which is pretty nice. Carpet at the bed side. However, I don't like that they don't give bottle soap or shampoo. The quality is bad. Also, at our first night, there was a opened soap on the dishes with a hair on it!!! DISGUSTING!!

We would have liked to have spent our last afternoon by the pool but it was not yet open. Rooms were of a decent size with comfortable beds. Our room was a studio - it had a kitchenette with a small refrigerator and stove. The bathroom had a full size shower but no tub. The hotel is on a quiet street in a mainly industrial area. The hotel does sit beneath the flight path for planes using the airport. I noticed a little bit of jet engine noise while in the room, but it was not distracting and I had no problems falling asleep.

The road it's on is in kind of a weird industrial area, but the hotel itself is very nice. Unfortunately the pool was not yet open and they don't have a liquor license yet, but it's great for its convenience to the airport. The lobby has a very minimalist, modern feel, and the hallways leading to the rooms were slightly creepy - painted a dark grey color, and no artwork on the walls or anything - but the rooms were nicely furnished and well-appointed. They have a complimentary breakfast that included eggs and sausage as well as bagels. It wasn't that great but I'm not going to complain about a free breakfast! The breakfast area was quite loud because there are no rugs or anything to dampen sound but it wasn't overwhelming. Since there isn't much around there, Orlando (an employee) offered to shuttle us anywhere we wanted to go. He also provided us with a card so we could call him when we wanted to be picked up.

We were the 12th guests at this brand new hotel on February 17th, opening day. Exceptionally pleasant staff with considerable sincerity as well. The lobby and breakfast area are immediately in view as you enter massed with floor to ceiling windows boasting a view of the large patio and pool area on the canal. Unfortunately the pool was not ready for use, but afterall, it was opening day. Our room could be described as contemporary and not huge but more than adequate. A functional kitchenette, flat screen TV, ample closet space and a great desk all fit nicely into the well thought out space. The bathroom is huge with a wonderful shower but no tub in our suite. Sunflower and European shower heads and enough room for three (if you so desired). Fluffy high end towels and delightful soaps and shampoo topped it off. The bed and linens were typical of Westin quality with oodles of pillows. We found the room noisy, not from the planes but from other guests in the hallway. The doors do not go full to the floor leaving a gap for hallway conversations to drift in. Shuttle service within a three mile radius is available including MIA pick up and drop off.

The hotel is located in a remote area that is very quiet. No businesses there, so if you don't have a car you're sort of isolated. I liked the fact that it was away from the hustle bustle of the airport. There is parking all around the gated property. I think they intend on charging $9 per night once they get their gate card system in order... for now it appears to be free. There seemed to be a lot of shuttles around, but heard the desk mention to another guest that it doesn't run 24 hours yet (which seemed odd), so the guest needed to arrange for a taxi for a very early check-in. The front desk staff is young, learning, but very friendly and eager to please. In fact, pretty much all the staff I met seemed to be on an \"opening high\"... all had a great attitude which was very nice. The place is brand spankin new... with the Element look, ie. very modern, stark, a lot of white. The pool, located just off the main lobby, appeared to be open. My room was upgraded (Platinum) to a room with a king bed and a small living room area with sofabed and 2nd tv, separated by a wall. Also had an efficiency kitchen with a full size fridge, microwave, toaster, plates, glasses, a few pots/pans, etc. and a view of the small pond/lake? in the back. The hotel appears to be in the flight path, after takeoff, as you see planes climbing as they approach the hotel. It was pretty loud but didn't really bother me as I had to get up early anyway. There was also a desk sort of separating the living room space and the kitchen. Breakfast in the morning, located in the lobby area, was simple and ok, nicely presented. There was scrambled eggs, breads, yogurts, cereals, juice. I liked their electric coffee machine for espresso. The hotel is fully functional but according to a desk person they haven't completed the rooms on the first 2 floors yet.

First though it took us 25 minutes to find a cab driver willing to even look for it as none of them had even heard of it. When we got a cab we arrived at the hotel in the middle of an industrial area with nothing around it. No restaurants, no stores, nothing. It was all fenced up with no cars in the lot but the sign was lit up. Keep in mind this hotel took our reservation and gave us no notification that it wasnt open. So I got out of the cab to find the place locked up. As im about to get back in the cab to find a hotel that will take us for the night a security guard comes out. After a few questions from me he produces a list of about 100 or so reservations and tells us our reservation has been transferred to the Hyatt. If we hadnt bumped into him how the hell were we supposed to know that. AND of course when we got to the Hyatt they had no reservation for us but luckily they had a room which we took. Can you believe this place/company would take reservations for a place that wasnt even open yet? To me that does it for the entire chain. I will go out of my way to tell people not to stay there after our experience. The worst part was we just needed sleep as it was only a layover and we had to leave at 4am the next morning.
