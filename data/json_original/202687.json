The hotel was very convenient for us, as we traveled to Venice by train and had quite a bit of luggage.

Taking the vaperetto to another hotel closer to St. Mark's would have been most annoying, and this hotel was conveniently located in relation to the people mover (monorail) that takes you to the cruise port. The hotel itself was comfortable, with a delicious breakfast (make sure you get it included in the rate when you book). We were put in room 905, which is the upstairs room with only skylights. I read a lot of reviews here in which people hated this room, but it was really great aside from having no windows. There were 2 really big bedrooms with queen sized beds with lots of closet space and a kitchenette with 2 stovetops and a fridge. The bathroom had a sloped ceiling, which made it a tad bit difficult when showering, but it was a pretty decent size. And yes, I agree with other reviews about there being no shower curtain: water gets everywhere. Take the hand-held shower head off the rack and use it manually; it will create much less mess. Around the hotel there are many places to eat and grab a drink. The vaperetto stop is just across the way and I highly recommend it. Buy a pass if you are going to be in the city for more than a day. It is well worth it. And, if you are under 29, you can get a discount pass. This hotel has a great location and good amenities given the price, and is away from the insane overcrowding of Piazza San Marco. Some tips are: buy a vaperetto pass if staying more than a day; and don't bother looking for eateries in San Marco, as they are overpriced tourist traps.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cCharming and perfect for pre/post cruises\u201d", "Author": "cheddyanne", "ReviewID": "UR117206180", "Content": "My husband and I and friends stayed for a night prior to our cruise.

I can't think of a more convenient for a traveller to Venice. The location is across a canal from Piazzale Roma the main transportation point entering Venice. A word of caution to elderly or travelers with issues handling luggage, the bridge over the canal requires going up and down stairs with your luggage. We were staying in Venice for a few days after disembarking from a cruise ship. If you are planning the same thing here are a few tips: If your destination is Piazzale Roma(the furthest motor vehicles can go) or any hotel near there, you do not need to purchase a 'transfer' from the cruise ship. There is a new 'people mover' tram from the Marittima cruise terminal to Piazzale Roma that costs 1 euro. The walk to the 'people mover' at the head of the pier is level and there is an elevator available. There are two different public bus lines available for transportation to the airport they cost 3.00 euro and start around 5:00 am.

The breakfast was better than expected (again, for a small 3 star hotel) it had quality rather than quantity. Plenty of cold cuts, pastries, bread, cereals offered in a bright pleasant room. Two things though that you might consider. There is no shower curtain in the bathroom, so you might need to be careful if you are the one to splash around and if you choose a canal view, you have to know that the motor boats will probably wake you up in the morning, but if you are to get up to see Venice anyways, it might just suit your needs.

Each day of our stay we would get back to our room after a day of sightseeing and sit for an hour or so reading and relaxing with the window open in the early evening, absorbing the atmosphere of being in Italy, before going out for dinner and in my case enjoying a nice Prosecco from the minibar. Breakfast (7am to 10:30am) was plentiful and we really enjoyed it - several rolls and a croissant each and you could help yourself to swiss cheese or brie, several types of ham, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, various cakes, cereals etc. No UK-style breakfast but I wouldn't really want or expect that in Italy. The breakfast staff served tea, coffee, cappuccino etc and were very friendly, remembering what we'd asked for the previous day. We liked the caffe latte best as you could add just the right amount of milk and coffee from separate jugs. The room did get quite full towards 9am on the Saturday morning and a couple had to wait for a table but we had no problem ourselves. We ate well in the Campo Santa Margarita and Dorsodouro - but after getting lost one evening we had a meal in a restaurant by the canal a few minutes along from the hotel and it wasn't good at all, although it was pricey just the same so probably best to give those restaurants a wide berth. On our last morning we strolled out of the hotel at 8:35am with ample time to catch our 8:55 bus for the airport. That was definitely one of my reasons for choosing the Arlecchino as I knew that, on a first visit, I would have spent our stay worrying about the journey home. Although I would like to stay in other parts of Venice in the future I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Arlecchino, especially with an early/late arrival or departure time.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice if transiting between cruise and/or airport\u201d", "Author": "lmg11", "ReviewID": "UR19789779", "Content": "I chose this hotel because we were only staying one night after a cruise.

The staff are ALL very friendly and are eager to share favorite spots and directions. One of the gentlemen spoke fluently in five different languages and they all spoke enough English to communicate. One concierge was kind enough to give us extra wake up calls after noticing we were late to catch our bus for the airport! A GREAT advantage of this hotel was the option for room service. For only 5 Euros, you can get the complimentary breakfast sent up to your room! You also have some heavy breakfast options, such as omelets, hard to find in Italy. We were on our honeymoon and it was a great surprise for a tight budget! Another plus, each room is equipped with international outlets meaning you do not need an adapter to use your appliances. The Arlecchino Hotel was in a perfect location! It was a five minutes walk to several Vaporetto stops and is literally steps away from the Piazzala Roma bus stop, perfect for the airport! There is a huge supermarket called COOP, which is close to the vaporetto spot. There you can get a Coca Cola for .50 E and a liter of water for .35 E, saving you over 3 Euros each anywhere else. Especially with the heat in May, this was a GREAT advantage! Also, there is a WONDERFUL restaurant down the side street of the hotel, on the water, the name included the word hostel. The food was the BEST we had in Italy and so was the service. They had a great tourist menu, which is more thant enough for two people. It is on the left hand side of the Gelato (Ice cream) shop that is next to the hotel. The only con of the ARLECCHINO was the smell in the lobby. It smelled like sewage, which could be from the water, however it only smelled like that in the lobby. The lobby is very small and so is the elevator, however these are little things that were uncomfortable. Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website, even though several room are rather large we did not have that luck. Our room was comfortable, however it was very small and there was no small couch (as in all the pictures)! The bathroom size was great and roomy.

All are agreed that this was an excellent choice! Everything was as promised and absolutely no problems to report. The hotel's location is it's biggest asset. We arrived late at night and weren't sure how easy it would be to find, but needn't have worried! I easily saw the hotel from the airport bus as it pulled into Piazzale Roma (ATVO Venezia Express service from Marco Polo Airport, Line 35, 3 Euros). An easy 2 minute walk and we were there. Throughout our stay we were constantly thankful we had chosen this hotel, as it's location made everything so easy. All the water bus (ACTV Vaparetto - 3 day pass was good value and saved a lot of hassle buying tickets) lines stop at P.Roma a few minutes walk from the hotel, and San Marco and Rialto were easily found on foot by following the obvious yellow signs which start just over the bridge from the hotel (visible from the breakfast room). Also, the setting is really pleasant considering the hotel is right next to the bus station - plenty of canals and bridges surround the hotel, and we really enjoyed being able to watch all the boats on the canals whilst having breakfast each morning. And finally, when we left early on our last morning, we were again grateful we had a very short walk with our bags to get the bus back to the airport. The rooms were perhaps a little worn in places, however, they were beautifully clean, with all towels and bed sheets changed every day. We stayed in a triple superior room on the first floor. This had a large double (made of two large single beds) and a large single sleigh-style bed. The breakfast was more than satisfactory, and better than most continental style breakfasts. The breakfast room staff were very friendly and efficient. The room itself was small, but we always managed to get a table, and the views outside were great. Reception staff were invariably friendly and welcoming. We found a good restaurant close to the hotel - Trattoria Rosa (not full name!) which I would happily recommend. Friendly staff and very tasty food. When you leave the hotel, turn right and walk to the footbridges. Ahead, over a canal, you will see the yellow sign directing to San Marco and Rialto. Walk in this direction for a few minutes at most, and you will see the restaurant on the left, over a canal bridge, situated on a street corner. Handy if you want to eat close to the hotel. Would definately recommend this hotel to friends and would stay again.

As many others have said previously, the best thing about this hotel is its location. Within 5 minutes of arriving at the Piazzale Roma bus station our bags were checked at the hotel and we were wandering around the streets. We spent the next few hours feeling rather smug as we passed numerous other tourists huffing and puffing with their bags over the myriad of bridges trying to find their hotels. When we arrived back, our bags had been taken up to our room for us, which was a nice touch. As for the hotel itself, I would say it is a decent three star. The room we had (806) is highly recommended. It appears to be the largest room on the floor with a view of the canal from each of the two windows. The room, whilst not huge, was big enough for a king size bed, small bureau and sofa. The bathroom was very clean and had all the necessary amenities (save for a shower curtain). The room looked a little tired but was cleaned every day with fresh towels provided if needed. Included in the price is a good continental breakfast. If you like sweet things for breakfast, you will be in heaven. There are lots of cakes and croissants to be had together with a selection of meats and cheeses. The coffee they serve was better than some we bought in cafes. The front desk guys were also great and seemed to speak just about any language you need. They were all very helpful and gave honest advice (even advising us not to take certain trips as they were overpriced). As for Venice, the usual highlights are advised. St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square is beautiful as is the Basilica. We would both strongly recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSecret Tour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace.

The water buses are also a great way to get around; we bought a three day pass for around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30.
