They first gave me a smoking room when I requested a non-smoking room. After they switched rooms, the \"Non-Smoking\" room still smelled like smoke! The smoking rooms and non-smoking rooms are on the same floor so the smoke travels everywhere. The halls are smokey and the rooms are dark and very outdated. After 10 minutes in the room, I went to front desk and ask for a refund due to the smoke smell in all rooms. The staff was very nice and refunded my money. I left and went over to the Marriot and got a very nice room for a few bucks more in a completely non smoking hotel.

Our first room: Upon inspection, the kitchen cabinet over the sink was off the wall and resting on the counter - room uninhabitable. One would think this would be known to check in staff. So we had to change rooms. Our second room: Upon inspection we witnessed the air con unit was ripped out from the wall, and only the grate on the external wall of the building was all that was between us and the outdoors. Room uninhabitable. Requesting a room NOT facing the freeway caused confusion as the staff tried to calculate which room numbers that might be. Hmmmm. Anyway, finally room 3 was acceptable, on floor 2, mid building, and slightly facing the noisy 101. Furnishings were fine, mostly clean, old TV, modest appliances in kitchen, basic amenities in the bath, which was almost clean. The night was noisy with air cons heard above, below, beside us as well as traffic noise. The hotel needs attention, better basic maintenance, and clearer communication amongst staff. It is what it is; tired, old, and a cheap place to try to sleep.

He needed something economical and where he could fix some meals. This place fit the bill. I went down to LA with him in early December to attend an award ceremony for him and we stayed here. The location is ok, it's almost next door to a Denny's and down the street a couple blocks is a shopping center with grocery store. Parking was free and easy to find when we checked in. Our room was on the bottom floor and was quite spartan and seemed clean enough. You could tell furnishings were older and cheap but they were not falling apart. The bathroom was large and there was plenty of vanity space. The only amenity were bars of cheap soap. The shower was ok, the curtain will stick to you. Sometimes you had to flush the toilet twice. The kitchen area had microwave, fridge, sink, and range (I think). Kitchenware was sparse but enough for two people. The tv did not work properly, the cable was falling out and you had to wiggle it and the remote was all messed up and did not work properly. We had to control the tv with buttons on the tv. There is no closet, just a rod and shelf in the corner of the room. I'd say my biggest complaint was the bed, it was NOT comfortable and felt like sleeping on a piece of wood with a blanked laid over it. I did not have interaction with the staff but my husband said they were all nice enough. We did hear laundry going all night and that was somewhat annoying. We did have free wifi in the room. This place is just ok. I probably would not stay here again unless I absolutely had to.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cHome Away from Home\u201d", "Author": "bronxgirl42", "ReviewID": "UR53795577", "Content": "From the moment I checked into the Woodland Hills Extended Stay America hotel, the warm reception and sincere response to all my needs exceeded my expectations.

As a senior citizen who is \"techie phobic\", I was particularly impressed by the patience of JoeAnn from the reception desk, who, when confronted with my inability to access the wireless internet, performed her \"magic\" on my laptop and made sure that I was able to access the internet with ease.

The front lawn, was also covered with dog poop and anytime you walked onto the property, you had better make sure you watch the ground as you walk! Numerous complaints to the front desk regarding the trash and dog poop not being cleaned up or removed, were answered with the \"alibi\" that they were \"in the process of hiring a new groundskeeper\" but in my opinion, just a \"baloney\" excuse for not spending money to keep the place clean. Because of this bad experience I will NEVER, EVER stay at any \"Extended Stay\" hotel again, and I don't care where it is located. My trip to Woodland Hills, CA was to be three weeks long, but after several days of trying to deal with this messy place, I moved out and stayed at another, CLEANER place! AVOID THIS HOTEL! I will mention some good points to this hotel: The parking lot is huge--and there is always a place to park. The layout of the room is quite nice, and pleasant. But--as I stated, the negative points far out-weigh the positive.

Finally, the 3rd room was somewhat habitable. Still dirty, ants, & the tub was backup up & would not drain. Although the front desk was friendly & provided room cleaning service for the duration of my stay, it did not make up for the inconvenience. I was there for 8 nights.

Only problem we had in our room was when someone took a shower there was this loud nosie ..and i mean loud, enough for me to have to leave the room.

When you check in they give you a little card stating what they would provide \"with just a call\" to the front desk. We had just got in from a long trip and were staying in the first night so we called to get one of those extra pillows stated on the card. Only to be told they didnt have any pillows..lol.

Clean your own room , take out your own trash, and go to the front desk at just the right time for clean towels or they wont have any of those either.
