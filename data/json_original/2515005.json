I lived in Paris around 10 years ago for 8 months, love the city. I have probably visted Paris at least once a year, probably twice since then. Majority of the time places I stayed were a bit stinky or a bit far away or too small . . . etc. Anyway this one is slightly pricier than the average but I think if you book in advance you might get good deals however it is worth every Euro. It has the perfect location, 5 mins to Louvre, 5 mins to Marais, 5 mins to Notre Dame, on line 1 ( the line you want to be on). It is very very clean and I have never seen such helpful, service oriented staff in Paris, (love the French but these guys can not be French sorry). If the light is bothering you get yourself a room from the back. But if you dont mind street lights coming into your room, I think the Victoria Avenue rooms has the most charming Paris street view. Breakfast is obviously a bit expensive for what it is. But if you ware staying one or two nights this is definatly worth it . If you are going to stay for a week or so , I think it might be a bit too expensive. You should be able to fine something else slightly out of the action maybe around 5th, 6th or 10th, 11th for around 50 Euro cheaper.

In all cases the staff was friendly, helpful, spoke as much or as little English as you needed and ensured that each stay was comfortable and problem free. The rooms are quiet and comfortable, but be prepared for the relatively small size of both the rooms and the quite comfortable beds - but after all this is Paris and you should be wandering the streets more, and in your room less. These are small rooms in most cases with limited room for luggage. The closets are good sized and have shelves and a personal safe to make sure you can take care of all your belongings. The showers are good and the water temperature and water pressure are adequate. If your room faces the street, you have a classic view of a typical small Parisienne street scene - especially if you get one with a small balcony. If your room faces the \"courtyard\" you will find it incredibly quiet and conducive to terrific sleep. Either way I have never had a problem with noise. It is clear the ownership is paying attention to the quality of the rooms and public spaces. Each time I have noticed upgrades to furniture, televisions, plumbing and the cleanliness of the overall hotel. The breakfast served is quite good, and very complete, but I believe it is currently 14 euros per meal extra....just something to consider if you are trying to manage costs. On the backside of the hotel is a wonderful boulangerie that opens at 7am and has great baguettes and croissant. Around the corner is a small grocery store so you can get some basics if you want to stock your hotel room with some snacks. The Chatelet metro stop is literally all around you, with several entrances within 50 yards of the hotel,so getting anywhere on the metro is a snap.

There's an entrance to the Chatelet metro almost just across the road from the hotel (although be aware that Chatelet and Chatelet Les Halles are big metro stations and can be a bit confusing). We caught a taxi to the hotel from Gare du Nord and the taxi driver was initially a bit confused as to where avenue Victoria was - good thing we had a photocopied map with us! We also had a short delay getting in to our room but this gave us the opportunity to have a free drink in the downstairs lounge area, which looked and felt like someone's private library - very cosy, and would be a tempting place to curl up with a book on a wet afternoon. The room itself was lovely. I've read a lot of reviews of Paris hotels where people complain about how small the rooms are, and I'm puzzled as to what it is people expect. No, the room wasn't huge, but I could walk around the bed without difficulty (and I'm not exactly a stick figure) and the bathroom was well appointed. Our room was on the first floor looking over the avenue but we barely heard any noise from outside with the windows closed. My favourite touch were the red geraniums on the small balcony outside our window - perhaps a bit of a cliche, but one I really appreciated. We had breakfast at the hotel on our first morning (mainly because it was gratis as an apology for the delay we had getting in to the room) and it was OK but I don't see why you'd pay for a hotel buffet breakfast when the area simply teems with decent cafes - get out and mix with the locals!

All the areas that a tourist wants to see are close by. We walked far more than took the Metro because we didn't have to resort to the Metro. The public areas are very nicely decorated. Very cozy. More like a living room. The buffet breakfast was as described and a wonderful asset to have available, as needed. The rooms are very nicely decorated. As previously mentioned, on the small side by American standards. I regretted not splurging on the Junior Suite. The King was very comfortable, but snug. Clothes storage was challenging. We emptied our luggage into the closet and stored the empty suitcases in the hotel's luggage room to free up space. The bed was very comfortable. We were on the back courtyard. I think, perhaps, the ideal would be a high floor on the front. The street is not busy so I don't think noise would be a problem and you'd have a view of treetops instead of looking across at other hotel rooms. The bathroom was tiny, but adequate. The only thing that frequently annoyed us was the internet connection which required repeated log-in's. There is a laptop available for guest's use in the living room but it had a European keyboard which makes typing laborious. We were always happy to return to the Hotel Britannique after a long day of sightseeing.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Choice\u201d", "Author": "Maisyandlilly", "ReviewID": "UR120528049", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Britannique in early November, 2011, and would definitely recommend it to future travellers.

The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the room was very clean with a minibar, safe, tv, and wireless Internet. The bathroom was a decent size with a roomy shower - newish fixtures and tile. We were in room 25 which was Quiet - it looked like the windows were double insulated for noise reduction. As with other Paris hotel rooms, our room was small,but we expected that. The front desk staff spoke English and were helpful with restaurant reservations and airport transfers. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel preferring the patisserie around the corner. As a side note, I recommend two restaurants: L'Auberge Bressane close to the Rue Cler and Sud-Ouest Monceau. We ate at L'Auberge Bressane this same time last year and returned on this trip - the food and service are excellent. By 9pm it was packed so get reservations and go early if you don't like a crowded dining experience. Love the dessert souffles! The second restaurant - not as conveniently located - was recommended by a foodie friend. This restaurant was a little more difficult to navigate on our limited French but we are adventurous and enjoyed it thoroughly. It looks like a small gourmet food store is connected to the restaurant for those who want to get snack supplies for the next day.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLooks can be deceiving\u201d", "Author": "OzzieAJ", "ReviewID": "UR120406139", "Content": "Great little hotel in strategic location of Paris.

Make sure you account for this time. They charged 20 euros per person per way. They also offer a breakfest at the hotel but it is not free. It was 14 euros per person. The hotel does offer wifi which worked well. The service at the hotel was hit or miss. Everyone spoke english which was a big plus for us. We had a room on the 5th floor with a small balcony. With beer being so expensive in Paris we ended up stopping at a nearby grocery store, (front desk clerk can direct you) and picked up some beverages. We enjoyed them while sitting on our balcony.

Did you hear me? THIS IS AN EXCELLENT HOTEL. How do I know? You can tell an excellent hotel by what they do when things go wrong.

After we had packed to move, the front desk said they were fully booked and had no other rooms. We pointed out that we had a confirmation, although we were satisfied with the room we had. The hotel then offered to provide us complimentary breakfast for our whole stay! In addition, the hotel notified us a week before we arrived that due to some maintenance issues beyond their control, the hotel would be without hot water for one of the days we would stay. They voluntarily offered to drop the room rate 30% or to cancel the reservation without penalty. We obviously chose to stay. My spouse and I spent 6 nights here, our first trip to Paris. It is clean, exceptionally well maintained, and QUIET even with a balcony overlooking Victoria Ave. (Triple pane glass window will make sure it is quiet.) Not super spacious, but downtown Paris hotels rarely are. Breakfast is good, some won't find it worth 14 euros/person but it is ample and the wait staff is helpful.

The location is excellent for catching the Metro (305 meters to Chatelet station entrances), the RER train (5 min. walk to Chatelet/Le Halle), and being only 1 block from the Seine, easy access to the island. 400 yards from the Louvre, 10 min. from Notre Dame, several cafes and restaurants around the corner, this is an ideal location.

It is also located within walking distance to the Louvre, Notre Dame, Latin Quarter, Jardins du Luxembourg and right next to the Seine.

I was sharing the room with a friend and while the 2 twin beds were spaced quite closely together, room never felt too cramped. Hotel had a nice feel to it and friendly staff. Other Paris hotels I've stayed at have been either too far away, too grungy, not good value for money, too small or too sterile. Hotel Brittanique was none of those things and also located on a quiet street so no noise issues. Only negative I can think of is that breakfast was not included.

In any case, room was very very clean as was the bathroom. Nice hot shower. Quiet. Wifi internet was fast enough that I was able to use Skype on my mobile phone with little problems! Downside of the internet was that you had to use a long-randomly generated password given to you from the front desk, and their router kills your connection with inactivity so if you use your mobile phone to connect to the wifi, it'll drop out if you don't use the internet for a few minutes and you have to log back in with a long annoying password. Front desk however had no problems giving us multiple passwords since we had 3 devices (laptop, 2 cellphones). Bed was comfortable. View from the miniterrace was really nice. We really enjoyed the romantic package and thought it was worth it with the half-sized champagne, wonderful heart-shaped container of chocolates, and rose petals/flowers scattered in the room/showers. Scented candles were also placed around as was a nice basket of fruit. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary (4th!) there and had informed the hotel staff at time of booking, and there was a wonderful 'congraulations/happy anniversary' card waiting for us with our romantic package, but the card had a picture of a woman and man kissing in front of a Paris montage which we found humourous given that we are a same-sex male couple. Not totally their fault as I didn't go out of my way to point that out during booking (despite our names being James and Geoff), but given their proximity to the Marais (gay) district I'd suggest they should use genderless congratulation cards instead (ie. cards without photos of couples) to cover all their bases. Location was fantastic - right across the street from the Chatalet-Les-Halles metro stop, and walking distance to the Louvre, Notre Dame, and Marais district (the main gay village). Breakfast was also wonderful - good plentiful supply of hot and cold foods, cheeses, espresso machine with I think 12 different types of insertable espresso coffee picks. The hotel's front door is locked at night and one night we got home late and had to ring the bell. The only downside of the hotel was that I found myself wishing I had access to some sort of gym or workout room. We had brought our own pushup bars but cold barely find any floor-space to use them. Would we stay here again? Probably. But if we could find a discounted rate that was similar to Hotel Britannique's at one of the large chains (ie.

Location, can't say enough. Two blocks from Louvre, walking distance to absolutely every other major attraction. The rooms were exactly as pictured on this website, cute and clean. I had a single, facing the river side and it was noisey until about 11 at night and then quited right down. Bathrooms were clean and well appointed, with lots of room for all of my \"girl stuff\". Staff were fantastic (all but one at check in) and spoke perfect english. I took the train from CDG, got off at the Les Halles station and only had to walk a few blocks to find the hotel. Suggestion. Buy a Paris Pass. For no other reason then it gets you past the line ups at all the major attractions. Every Museum / Gallery had what I would guess to have been a several hour line-up and with my Paris Pass I sailed right in. Ask someone official, showing them you pass and they will point you to the special entrance...it's not well marked. I also used my pass to hop on and off the \"hop on and off bus tour\" just to get around. If I was at the Champs Elysees and had sore feet, on the red bus I jumped and it took me almost right to my hotel (stopped at the Louvre of course). Eating in Paris was a bit tough for a single person, I hated taking a table all for myself during the very important dinner hour. Nice thing is the hotel has a great breakfast and lunch was easy. I kept some emergency rations in my room just in case. Last piece of advise, unless your a real museum / art lover, 4 days in Paris is plenty. I stayed 6 and it was too long.

I chose this hotel because of it's location in the Premiere arrondissement and the possibility of getting a balcony room. We were slightly disappointed to find ourselves assigned to a Queen room because they didn't have any Kings available. It was our honeymoon and we wanted everything to be perfect, and we're both very tall, (yes our feet hung off the edge of the Queen bed). There was only room for my husband and our luggage in the tiny elevator, so I offered to walk up the 5 flights of stairs to reach our room and just meet him there. The stairs were fine and not too treacherous, but I was a little breathless when we opened up our door to reveal... the tiniest little room I've ever stayed in. We purchased the \"Romance Package\" so we had rose petals on our bed, rose vases and candles around the room, a small bottle of champagne and a basket of fruit. It was a lovely presentation and I found myself not feeling quite so disappointed with the petite room size. The bathroom was immaculately clean and very serviceable, again resulting in a feeling of \"this isn't so bad.\" We sidled along the edges of the bed to reach our balcony and viola, there was the city! GORGEOUS! We could see the Eiffel Tower to the west and in the east, a stone angel guarding the bridge to the Isle de la Cit\u00e9. Don't get me wrong; this is not an unobstructed view. You're a block away from the Seine but you can't see it, the Eiffel tower is small vertical line in the distance, and your best view is of the treetops on the street below and the large building across. However, it was still quite lovely and we found the gargoyles on the building across very charming, quite enjoyed the trees waving in the breeze, and liked hearing the voices and laughter emerging from the restaurants below. We loved having our wine on the balcony reveling in the warm Parisian summer nights. I highly recommend this hotel for tourists (especially those who don't speak French), who would like to be within walking and biking distance to many of the main tourist attractions. We biked to the Eiffel Tower, walked up to the Arc de Triomphe, down Champs Eles\u00e9es, saw the Grand and Petit Palais, the Louvre, boated on the Seine, climbed to the top of Notre-Dame, strolled the Luxembourg garden, and much much more. All are fairly close to the hotel, but you can rent bikes or catch the Metro if you're not up for all the walking. Believe me, after our first day of walking the city we were absolutely waiting for the elevator, and we quickly tossed out our reticence of sharing such a tight space with strangers. You can fit 4 people in there if you're literally chest to chest! We did not partake of the hotel's continental breakfast until our last day. There are plenty of restaurants close by and we didn't see the need until we realized everything was still closed in the early morning and we had a plane to catch. We were pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the best breakfast we had, but it certainly wasn't the worst! The food was fresh, hot and convenient. In retrospect, we probably would have eaten there a few times and saved ourselves some of the not-so-good breakfast experiences. We asked the hotel to set up a taxi for us the night before, but it wasn't there at the specified time. The staff were very quick to get things straightened out, but I'd recommend following up with them about an hour before it's supposed to arrive. I found myself oddly disappointed at the rather sedate cab ride back to the airport, but it's still a good idea to line up your transport ahead of time rather than relying on hailing a taxi at the last minute. We had an absolutely lovely time at this hotel. Overall: it's a good value, especially if you get a balcony. If you're looking for lots of amenities, you won't find them here.

Also the only negative is that the walls are quite thin and u can hear the people next door...my two mums in my case so i could tell then to keep it down!!! :) Just to point out...the room was a good size for Europe. Visitors from the USA will feel that they are small, but they are larger that most i have stayed in! Breakfast is not cheap at 14 euros, however, it is plentiful with lots of choices. Croissant, Brioche, Toast, cheese, ham, scrambled eggs, sausage, yoghurts..also a choice of juices, tea and coffee. Just to finish..there was no probs with the WiFi, or the laptop in the lounge..used both with no probs at all.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holyoke, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel at a great location\u201d", "Author": "Masstravelers4", "ReviewID": "UR112093572", "Content": "Excellent service from the staff.

This saved my gaining 5 more lbs. -The Cafe Zimmer on the corner does a great job. Don't pass it up just because it is in a high traffic area. -Two blocks down Ave Victoria to the east is a cafe on the corner with a Crepe stand facing the intersection. For the love of mike...get a Banana Nutella crepe for yourself. The hotel room pricing is typical Paris pricing for a great locale. That is...high The hotel offers free Wi-Fi. It is slow as Christmas. We had lots of trouble trying to Skype calls home. The rooms are quite small as you would expect from a small Parisian hotel. Get ready to be very close with your partner, should you have one. There is a bar across the street that gets really loud at night on the weekends.

One thing that concerned me was the reviews on the size of the rooms. Once arriving at the Hotel Britannique my fears were instantly quenched because it was like walking into my home. The decor was almost as beautiful as the staff here. Two real shining stars in the Paris universe were Aimie and Audrey. The whole staff was great but these two really stood out. They instantly made myself and my wife at home. When staying here you have to consider this as your home with a lovely living room that you can find quiet tranquility in and a very nice dining room where you can enjoy a wonderful breakfast to start your day off every morning with great choice's of food as well as a wonderful choice of cheese and breads. Well worth the minimal charge. The beds were to die for very soft and always got a good night sleep. Make sure you get a room with a balcony it overlooks the beautiful Ave Victoria and its really like being in a movie it it so picturesque. Also make sure if you are spending a romantic time with your loved one make sure you order the romantic package. Well worth the very small price which you get back alone from the product you are served . I took pictures but I'm sworn to secrecy by the staff (not really) not to show how they decorate your room. Well I choose not to show the pictures so your loved one will be surprised. Trust me though its a great value and worth every penny. The location is perfect and you are also near at least 2 grocery stores where you can buy water and food. Many places to eat within walking distance as well from bistros to fine dining. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the Louvre as well as about 10 to walk to Notre Dame and the Left Bank. Its really the best location you could possibly have in Paris. Again you are made to feel like this is your home what kind of price tag can you put on that?I cannot say enough about this place. Both my wife and I were genuinely sad when we had to leave here. You can really tell the owner genuinely cares. Read some of the older (2006 and on) reviews. The problems bought up in the reviews have all been addressed and taken care of and are no longer a problem. This shows a great spirit of entrepreneurship and shows the owner cares about your stay in his fine hotel. Please keep in mind its not out of sorts to remember to bring a gift when you stay there (not that its required). Might I suggest some fine macaroons from Laudree if you visit there. The staff loves them. Again Hotel Britannique we already miss you and we will be back. Thank you Aimie and Audrey and the rest of the staff for making us feel so much at home on our first trip to Paris. And thank you for making myself and my wife's anniversary such a memorable one.

I am the travel planner in the family and did a lot of research before I decided on Hotel Britannique. We were not disappointed. Hotel Britannique is a lovely cozy hotel near everything you need to have a wonderful time in Paris. As first time visitorsm it was important to us to be close to the Metro as well as restaurants. Happily, Notre Dame and the Louvre are within easy walking distance from the hotel. Now, for some specifics: Staff - - Very friendly and helpful. Staff spoke very good English and were very kind in helping me practice my French. As a student of French language, it was a nice opportunity to practice my speaking skills (hard to do in US). Staff also was helpful in arranging taxi for us when we checked out. Getting there - - We arrived in Paris on the Eurostar from London. The station is not far from the hotel and I suggest you take a taxi rather than the metro unless you are in very good shape. The Paris metro does not have many escalators or elevators so handling luggage up and down stairs was a trial for me. A taxi from Gard de Nord is only about \u20ac25 and it's totally worth it. Hotel and room - - The hotel does have an elevator (great!) and was nicely heated. There is a nice lounge and the staff will stored your luggage if you need it, Our room was comfortable, with a very comfortable bed and pillows - and it was clean, I also did a bedbug check and it passed inspection! The bathroom was clean and had a full bathroom, with a tub. Very nice. For technology geeks - - please note that Hotel Britannique is in a historic building and so there are not many electrical outlets. My boyfriend and I are techies and brought iPhones, an iPad and MacBook. We just took turns charging out devices and did't have a problem. And the Internet connection was excellent (very important to us).

Everybody makes mistakes sometimes, of course, being human; it is how they then handle them that makes the difference. Anyway, the Britannique\u2019s rooms are elegant and really lovely, and the staff is extremely professional and helpful; the overall experience verges on being a 4-star rather than a 3-star one. Also there is a laptop PC in the lobby free for guests to use. The location is incredible, extremely central, with the Chatelet Metro stop literally across the street. However, a word about the street; although it is a side street with not much traffic, the hotel is 80 metres from an extremely busy street, with the authentic big-city noise one would expect, not directly under the windows but audible in the streetside rooms.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Djerba Island, Tunisia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful boutique hotel with fantastic staff\u201d", "Author": "sneo223", "ReviewID": "UR86677255", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in October.

We got excited about things like Kleenex, shampoo, washcloths ( no other place had them), a really nice clean and well maintained bathroom (be forwarned bathtubs are small here) that delivered a nice pressure and hot water quickly, a safe we did not have to pay extra for, reading lights that you could actually read with on each side of the very comfortable bed. The rooms are large by European standards and we had a nice tiny patio with table and chairs for morning tea or coffee and view of the street. The common room is wonderfully comfortable and I enjoyed hanging out reading the paper and drinking my morning tea there very much. The breakfast is marvelous - I expected weak or bad coffee, tang passing as orange juice and stale croissants. What was ofered was fabulous coffee and an assortment of tea, fresh croissants and other French baked goods, thin slices of various French ham and British style sausages, scrambled and soft boiled eggs, 3 kinds of fresh juice, an assortment of French cheeses, toast ( but why would you?) cereals fresh fruit and fruit cocktail. And it is open from 7:30 to 11:00am! I am a light sleeper and could hear the man next door snoring and his very loud TV in the afternoon. I did not howeve,r hear much traffic from the street but bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The staff were unfailingly kind. generous, helpful, and courteous. I especially want to thank Nadim, the concierge on the night shift for helping us with our travel snafu. Our shuttle failed to arrive and he helped problem solve and got us a cab when it became clear it was not going to arrive. He also set us up for breakfast before the dining room opened as we were leaving at 6:30 am. Thank you Nadim!!!! the cab driver you got us was great and we got to the airport safe and sound. An aside for Americans. Don't expect the French and Parisians to be like us. They are not.

We had rooms 45 and 46 which are considered Classic Double Room with Queen Size bed and Classic Double Room with 2 Twin size beds. Our rooms were next door to each other. Our rate that I booked over the internet included breakfast. Both rooms were on the back side of the hotel looking at the back of another building (probably an apartment building but I never saw or heard anything back there). The Queen room(46) had one large floor to ceiling window that opened like French doors plus the bathroom with combo bath and shower had a large window that opened wide. Immediately outside the window was a window box of flowers to enjoy. We had a desk with small stool and a kitchen type chair. Also had mini frig that we used for our wine and veggie and cheese storage. Beside 2 very tiny built in bedside tables there was a radiator cover on one side that acted as a shelf for alarm clock camera,tissue,etc. Also included was a tray with teacups, teapot and a couple of glasses that was refreshed daily (hot water is available from the front desk). Small screen tv on desk received CNN in English. Bathroom had shelf that was plenty big enough for my husband and I to share. Terry bathrobe was a very nice touch that I made use of. Room 45 with the 2 twin beds was similar in size but had 2 floor to ceiling windows that opened (with window boxes!) and an internal bathroom with just a shower but had the same storage shelf that my adult children made work for them. They had a more generous easy chair compared to our kitchen-type chair. Closets offered enough hanging room along with shelves and a free safe. Beds were so comfortable, neither too hard nor too soft. Crisp white linens were fabulous and rooms were made up daily. Newer double paned windows were easy to work and did the job. Noise was never an a problem. We were next door to the elevator on one side and I never heard it. Breakfast was excellent for us since it was included. There was something for everyone of my picky eaters! My daughter delighted in hot chocolate made with the hot milk always available. Yogurts, cereals, canned fruit, fresh fruit, sausage, scrambled eggs, soft boiled eggs served in the little egg cups with a cozy on to keep it warm, breads, cheeses, jams Nutella, coffee and tea and a couple kinds of juice. The breakfast room was small but there was always a table available for us. It was a wonderful place to linger over coffee (usually while I waited for the kids to come down) and plan our day's activities. Kitchen staff was very friendly. I really appreciated the front desk. We were always greeted with a friendly smile and anytime I asked for advice it was given freely and warmly. We made use of the free hot water for tea a number of times but the hotel also has wine by the glass or bottle that I ordered a couple of times. We could take it to our rooms or just enjoy it in the pleasant room near the lobby that had plenty of seating. This room had a laptop that served the purpose of keeping in touch via email. Everything about our stay was perfect, starting when we arrived jet lagged at 9am and were invited to drop our luggage and enjoy a relaxing breakfast before going out to explore and ending when we were checking out at 8am and I realized I had left my glasses at the cute little wine bar around the corner the night before.

I looked at about 8 options, and the H.B. met all the criteria, plus they had the best price. I will ALWAYS stay at this wonderful place for my future travel to Paris. Here's why: 1) Terrific location. Very close to Louvre and to Notre Dame. The Chatelet metro stop (a main one) is right across the street. 2) The hotel staff couldn't be nicer. You know how you hear that the French are rude? Not true! We loved everybody we met. I had a lot of questions in advance, and they always got back to me within a few days with answers. Truly, I know I was annoying at a few points, and they were very good humored and kind in answering all my inquiries. 3) Rooms were fine (we stayed on 6th floor). The bathroom was awesome; modern and clean. I really only care about cleanliness and the rooms met my clean inspection. These are tiny rooms - as is common in Europe - so make sure you set your expectations accordingly. Comfortable bed and wonderful mattress. Don't bother with eating breakfast in the hotel. (anywhere in the world, not just Paris) Around the corner (out the door and make a right and then another right turn), there is a PERFECT place for breakfast. It is a pastry shop operated by Mrs. Yuehl. We loved all the ladies who allowed us to feast on pastries and cafe au lait each morning while we planned our itinerary. Charming doesn't begin to describe it. There's no fitness facility, but the H.B. is one block from the Sienne, so I basically ran along the river and had the added benefit of crossing bridges and taking it more sites. Loved it so much!

It featured a safe (which was too high to even see into, but worked fine), a small flat screen TV not much bigger than a computer monitor, with French, German, and BBC and sometimes CNN programming, a desk, and a small bathroom with shower (the shower had good pressure and had those sliding doors on two sides to form a square like you see on a cruise ship, no tub). It suited us fine. My wife negotiated a price of about 185 Euros a night, breakfast included. On the last night, our sink started to leak. The desk clerk couldn't fix it and it left the bathroom floor wet. We asked for and were able to get a slight (10 Euro) reduction on the last night's charge because of the problem. The front desk staff, especially, Pauline, were helpful and gave us a good recommendation for dinner one night: Au Pied de Cochon on the right bank, which is a must-eat place if you go to Paris. It's open 24/7 and hasn't closed since the 1940's. Back to the hotel: we ate a good buffet breakfast there every morning.

We asked for another room and were shown one on the first floor facing the street and were told that was all that was available. It was small too but at least lighter and we could see something out the window. Alas, the street in front of the hotel was being torn up and being on the first floor we had no privacy and the noise was a problem.

For the astronomical price of $400 per night at the exchange rate, we were unhappy enough to search for something else. We found a room at Duo near the Hotel de Ville which though also quite small at least was on an upper floor facing the street. When we returned to Britannique and said we were checking out, guess what? A large suite on an upper floor had suddenly become available for no extra charge...Since by then we just wanted out of there, we declined. My advice is, if you are going to this hotel anytime soon, be aware there is significant construction on the street in front. Nevertheless, you do not want a room in the back. I'm sure the upper floors are better rooms - make sure you ask for one \"in the front on an upper floor\". We were very unlucky at this place and cannot recommend it because of our experience.

One cannot have a better location to stay in Paris. The hotel is perfectly located for the tourists planning to get knowing Paris, especially by walking. Many Paris' beautiful places and museums are at the walking distance from the hotel: Ile De La Site, Ile De Saint Louis, Jardin Du Luxembourg, Jardin Des Tuileries, Notre Dame, Latin Quater, and many many others. We even waked to the Alexander III Bridge (Place of Invalides) - about 40 minutes one way, to the Arc de Triomphe - about one hour along the Champs-Elysees, and to the Eiffel Tower - about 1.5 hour along Seine River. Service is very good, rooms are clean. We had one unfortunate incident with somebody's dirty stocks appearing on the night table. After I brought it to reception's attention, management had sincerely apologized to me and offered a complementary breakfast. Also - for some strange reason, they do not provide the shower caps, so plan on having it with you. The hotel offers the complementary WiFi connection - worked fine, and I was able to read the news on the WEB and to check my e-mails. The room (#32 - street exposure, no balcony) was great - small, with the king size bed, and very cozy and clean. Two huge windows can be wide open allowing fresh air in. If you are planning on having several electronic gadgets as I had with me, get ready to take with you the power cord, - there is not enough power wall outlets in the room. And, obviously don't forget a few 220v European power outlet adapters (I had 5 with me - used them all for my camcorder, photo camera, GPS, and two cell phones). The room has a safe with the code lock, it was working fine, so I used it for some of my valuables and purchases I have made. It was not trivial to understand how to use the lock, so I had to figure out it myself and only then I found a small sheet with the instructions on the table. Bathroom is a bit small, but still convenient and very clean. Towels are changed every day. After you check in, you may want to ask them for some more soap bars, as we had only one prepared in the bathroom, and bar us really small. There is an air-conditioner in the room - located just above the entrance door with the regulator on the wall. It's cooling the room sufficiently. We had a chance to try it it for the couple of days while the days in Paris were quite hot (up to 30 degrees Celsius). Breakfast, the hotel provides, is not extremely good. Despite the price for the buffet type of breakfast (15 euro per person), I could not persuade myself to eat it. We tried several various places to eat in Paris (breakfast and dinner alike), even using the hints from the well known \"Tom's Guide to Paris\", and we found the best to be the \"Zimmerman\" restaurant just across the street from the hotel. Breakfast for two: two omelets (one - with bacon), one big vegetable salad, two coffees, and three small croissants - all cost about 35 euro. The weather was not very good for the last three days of our stay - clouds and rain. I regretted I did not take a sweater and a raincoat with me. All in all, it was a great, unforgettable stay in Paris, we very much enjoyed, in large part due to the hotel we chose to stay in.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Home Counties", "Title": "\u201cTake your earplugs and eat out\u201d", "Author": "Owlooker", "ReviewID": "UR42247745", "Content": "To start on a positive note.

We could hear everything around us from conversations to bodily functions, and on to amorous activities. This hotel would benefit greatly from investment in noise reduction - and so would the guests. The breakfast was included in the price as an \"offer\". This \"offer\" was far more valuable to the hotel as a marketing tool, than it was to us as a breakfast. The \"variety\", in addition to bread, included scrambled egg and appalling sausages. Two kinds of very ordinary cereal, two types of cooked meat and cheese. Also a limited amount of yoghurt.

The whole place seems to have been refurbished recently, and the double-glazed windows with fitted blinds are great at blocking out sound and light. OK, so there are things this place could improve upon. A bedside alarm clock would be good, as would more channels on the TV (8 channels isn't much these days). A kettle added to the amenity tray would be useful, as well as access to more tea/coffee if needed (hot water available from reception, but only til 9pm). But these are only minor defects - as a cost-effective option that doesn't feel like you're economising, this place would come high up the list.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC Beaches", "Title": "\u201cVery warm and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Ivyfalls", "ReviewID": "UR25477884", "Content": "I booked this hotel because of the Tripadvisor reviews.

We were on the 4th floor (elevator) facing the front street. The room is not big but comfortable and well disposed - there is a double closet (with a safe) in the entrance, king sized bed (slept very well...) with a small night desk on each side, a desk with TV, a chair and a holder for the travel case. The bathroom is also not huge but you can normally move around and use it (I've heard all sorts of stories on hotels in Paris....), you get a two sets of towels and a robe each, there are shampoos, soap, shower cap - everything. The room is cleaned every day. We were there in the winter and it was very cold (below 0C every day) but the room was heated all day long, we even had to turn the heating off at night because it got too hot. The hotel itself has a reception desk in the lobby, a lounge, and a breakfast area. There is someone at the desk 24h a day and the staff is very friendly. Everyone spoke English. The breakfast is excellent and abundant: there are eggs, sausages, ham, 5-6 types of cheese, fruit, fruit salad, muesli, 3-4 types of croissants, 3-4 types of bread, coffee, tea, yogurt....and so on - you will not be hungry! The only negative side is the wifi access: there is a hotspot however you have to purchase traffic at the reception, and we could not do that either because they had some technical problems (we were given, though, a 20min. free card). I think every hotel should have a free wifi internet access, or at least offer it for a symbolic charge that could be included in the room price.

A tip, when going to Charles de Gaulle, get the front desk to reserve a shuttle, rather than a taxi. The shuttle cost 17 Euros per person, about half the cost of a taxi ride at 70 euros or more.

Facing this island, on one side, are the numerous restaurants of The Left Bank. On the right bank is Place du Chatelet - a large Square in the centre of which is a fountain with four Sphinx and a tall pillar crowned by a golden Nike (dedicated to Napoleon's victories in Egypt.) Chatelet is also the largest underground metro stop in Paris, with lines going everywhere so it's perfect for transport. And in a little side street (Avenue Victoria) just 20 metres from Place du Chatelet is the Hotel Britannique. The Hotel Britannique, as the name implies, is a hotel catering for English speakers. It's small - the rooms are small and the lift that carries you up to them is tiny. But believe me, the word 'small' here merely implies 'cosy' (the French call it a Bijou Hotel ... and bijou means 'jewel'.) We though so too. The Hotel Britannique really is a gem, set in the very heart of Paris. We booked directly via email, asking for Room 51 after reading many positive reviews. We had an immediate reply and our booking was confirmed overnight. Everything was ready when we arrived. Check-in was fast, and we were soon on our way up in the tiny lift. Room 51 is in the front of the hotel (see photo) and turned out to be a little gem with its own balcony (see photos) and a good-sized bathroom. It was spotlessly clean, nicely furnished in a period style, and the bed was impressive and comfortable. We never had a problem nor a complaint with the room and the hotel, and we've recommended it to all our friends since. You could grumble about size, if you were the grumbling type. But nobody likes a grouch and anyway you're in Paris, in a room with a view. Enjoy. The Hotel Britannique serves breakfast, and we checked out its cosy little dining room. The breakfast looked fine - it costs about 12 Euros a day and you can choose to eat brekky daily or not, as you like. We chose not, because Paris beckoned. There are cafes all around the Hotel Britannique in whatever direction you walk. Most looked tempting, filled as their windows are with delicious pastries. For instance, walk out the door of the hotel and turn right. Just around the first corner within 20 yards are four very good pastry/breakfast cafes and two Metro entrances, But most people turn left and walk 20 metres to the Place du Chatelet which has several large and popular cafes on each corner. They all have tables outside, usually filled with tourists engaging in a Parisian's favourite habit - watching people go by. But here's a TIP: When choosing a cafe in the Place du Chatelet, you'll quickly notice the ones nearest the Hotel Britannique are usually packed, whereas the ones on the opposite side of the Square seem much less busy. This has more to do with the traffic flow and the direction of the sun than it does with the quality of the cafes. Don't be a lemming ... leave the crowds and cross over Chatelet, admiring the fountain as you go, and head for a cafe called La Mistral on the far side of the Square by the riverbank. Take a seat at a front table, and look DOWN the river past all those crowded cafes opposite. You'll see what they miss - a perfectly framed view of The Eiffel Tower - for your eyes only! We enjoyed that view each morning as we sipped our coffee prior to a day's exploring the sights. In the evening, the Eiffel Tower lights up with 3000 lightbulbs and a revolving spotlight on top. If you're having coffee at La Mistreal in the evening, wait for the hour to strike. Every hour on the hour, those 3000 lightbulbs put on their own spectacular light show - they shimmer and twinkle for ten minutes. One final word about the staff at Hotel Britannique. The cleaning staff do the rooms every day and are very efficient. Never had a problem, and the rooms have a personal safe/vault if you need to secure precious items. The front desk staff are also good people who speak English and are very helpful. The front desk is staffed 24/7, often by several people, so there's no long waits in a queue. The staff can also book tours. arrange phone calls, etc. But a little warning - the staff are great hotel people but not necessarily experts at guiding you around Paris. They have free maps, and generally live locally, so they have local knowledge which they share freely and happily. But you should always rely on your own research and street-smarts, and double-check for yourself what others tell you, so you don't misunderstand directions or get unintentionally mis-directed.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent\u201d", "Author": "TravelatorAtlanta", "ReviewID": "UR18380074", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this quaint little hotel for our first anniversary trip and can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay!

I was looking for a place to stay in Paris after my study abroad ended in Dublin. The hotel was listed under the more-pricey options, but the comments said it was a good splurge. My main concern was finding a hotel that had an English-speaking staff, as I don't speak French. (I had a friend traveling with me that spoke French, but I didn't want to burden her with translating everything for me.) To avoid any confusion, I wanted to be able to handle all of the arrangements and the billing in English. From booking to billing, the staff was amazing. They were very quick to respond to my e-mail requests, friendly over the phone, and they were very helpful with anything that we needed during our stay there. They even helped us contact Lost Baggage at Charles de Gaulle when my friend could not get a hold of them. Our room faced the street, but it wasn't noisy at all. The rooms were well decorated and clean. I loved the antique feel to them. Some reviews I had read said that the rooms did not allow enough walking space, especially for two people. However, my friend and I had no trouble fitting our things in the room, and we still felt we had plenty of room to walk around. (Though, we had less than 4 bags in the room, so maybe someone with more than this would have trouble maneuvering around.) One thing to note--though it's pretty normal in European hotels--is that when you request twin double beds, keep in mind that the beds will be pushed together. They will have separate sheets and blankets, but they will not have the 2 feet of space between them that you would see in hotels in the U.S. But the lack of \"personal space\" is fine if you're staying in the room with a good friend. You couldn't beat the location of the hotel: 1 block away from the Seine, 1 block away from Chatelet (a major metro station), 1-2 blocks from a long stretch of shopping, and 2 metro stops from the Louvre. Also, the area is pretty safe, and we walked back to the hotel at night on more than one occasion. Admittedly, the hotel is a little pricey because of its great location ($400-500/night), and being a student, it might be a while before I have the money to return.

The lounge is charming and welcoming. The room was exactly as shown elsewhere in these reviews and just what we requested. Upper floor, facing the street. We had a balcony which I loved. The amazing windows kept out all street noises. Beautiful room, perfectly clean at all times. One of the most beautiful bathrooms I've seen, I loved the tub after a long day of walking. This location can't be beat. The river is just a couple of minutes from the hotel and you can see the Eiffel tower from the bridges. So beautiful at night. Every thing is close to this hotel. We spent all our time walking across the beautiful bridges to nearby Louvre, Tuilleries, and all the way to the Eiffel Tower one afternoon. Notre-Dame is just a ten minute walk as well. The Zimmer restaurant is very nice and just across the street. We had dinner there twice when we were too tired to go any farther. The metro entrance is a few yards from the hotel, so convenient and important as we had to leave very early in morning and took RER B to CDG and got there in about 45 minutes.

There are many places to eat nearby so you won't have to hunt for dinner. The hotel staff is wonderful. Everyone at the front desk spoke English and they were patient enough to listen to my poor French. We had a room with a king bed. All the king bedrooms face the rear of the building, so there was no view, but the room itself, although small, was nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was good sized and perfectly clean. There was plenty of hot water every morning. One night we experienced noise from the room next door. The people staying there stayed up late, talking loudly. Several reviews have commented on noise being a problem. Depending on who your neighbors are I can see what they mean. Since we had no problem the other five nights we were there I would not consider this a big deal. We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning. Most hotel breakfasts are overpriced, but I feel you're paying for the convenience of not having to go out. The food was good with a nice selection of breads, fruit, meat cheese and drinks. I was surprised to find no orange juice, but there was grapefruit juice, milk, water, coffee and tea. Overall I would rate this hotel highly.

Being our first time we were a bit nervous of what actually to expect. This hotel more than exceeded our expectations. The decor, the rooms, the unbelievable friendly staff just made our stay perfect. The staff are always willing to give you some ideas on where to go to give you a true flavour of Paris. They organised taxis for us and told us about some French customs and history which really helped us to enjoy our holiday even more. And after a long day translating and trying to communicate in French- with more than our fair share of weird looks - it was a pleasure to return to someone who spoke English extremely well and be able to relax a little more in the wonderful surroundings of the lounge area and reminice about your day. Hint to all travellers to Paris, if the car doesnt have a \"Taxi\" logo on it leave it alone, we were horribly ripped off by an unscrupulous driver when we arrived in Paris - Gare du Nord to the Hotel approx 10 mins was 105 euros, the Hotel organised us a Taxi to the Moulin Rouge which was 3 times the distance and is was 15 euros. The Hotel is literally 2 blocks away from the Latin Quarter and the Notre Dame, 1 block from the Siene river where you can see the Eifel tower quite clearly and about 10 mins slow walk from the Louvre. There is an entrance to the Chatelet metro across the street from the hotel as well, so everywhere else is within easy reach. We had breakfast at the hotel as it was easier and found the food to be great, fresh croissants, pain aux chocolate, fruits, yoghurts, cheeses, meats, boiled eggs and sausages and some wonderful coffee too. The rooms were very nicely decorated, plenty of hot water, nice TV and Bar fridge, we were in room 17, the view was at the back of the hotel but we didnt stay in the room to look out the window we were out and about all day and when we did get back to the room we were too exhausted to check the window view. Noise was never a problem as the street is a very quiet street so there was no noise from there and although the hotel was full we didnt hear anyone from where we were unless they were using the lift.

A double for my wife and I and a twin bed room for our adult children. Noise was not an issue for us as we were sharing a wall with family but it was apparent that there was minimal sound proofing which could be a problem if one is unfortunate enough to have inconsiderate neighbours. No street noise but no view either. We didn't see this as a problem as we were out of our rooms early and back late. More important was the comfort of the beds and spotless housekeeping - outstanding in our estimation. Our children's room had a standup shower stall while our room had a tub with flexible shower hose. If you are not agile and very fit do not take a room with tub only - once seated you may not be able to regain your feet without assistance. Poorly placed grab handle makes getting up from the narrow tubs a challenge! Good for a laugh for us but could present a hazard for older tourists I believe. Ask for the stand up shower stall if you have strength or balance problems. The electrical outlet in the bathroom accepts North American plugs. The small safe in the closet was useful. We had the hotel breakfast one morning only and it was very good but we preferred to go to nearby cafes such as the Zimmer and watch the morning street scene while we had a light breakfast. The location was perfect for us as we like to walk and this hotel is so well situated for the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Metro and restaurants.

Clean room and super clean bathroom. That's one thing I loved, the cleaning staff did a great job. 5. The price - 4 nights set us back about 620 Euros, not bad for a double with a view. 6. Walking distance to a supermarket (super marche) on Rue de Rivoli. Great to get water, cheese and bottles of Champagne. The Bad: 1. Small rooms. Very cozy - good if you want to snuggle with someone. Frankly it doesnt really matter since you are out most of the day and are only back to sleep. 2. Expensive breakfast @ 14 Euros. So ditch it and walk to any of the cafes around the corner for that omelette and mustard combo. 3. No iron in the room. You have to go down and use the ironing room.

There is a good bakery close by for breakfast (right from the door of the hotel, right at the end of the block, on the near corner of the next street, Rue Jean Lantier). There are also a couple of good enough cafes near by, although we found the food got better and the price came down as we moved away from the the river. We liked a bistro on Rue de Reynie, a few blocks notrth of the hotel, called Bistro Romain (or something close to that). Stay away from the cafes right along the Seine and those across the bridge on the Ile de Cite. The prices are very high, even for Paris, and the food so-so. Also near the hotel are an ATM machine (you'll need it given Paris prices) and a MacDonalds on the Rue de Rivoli if you have an urge for a Big Mac.

The bathroom was good, and all was clean and taken care of. Our room as a \"superior king) at 193 euros, but still quite small. A standard room size must be tiny. Our room's (#17) window faced a wall, which was too bad. Avenue Victoria is quiet and picturesque, so a room overlooking would have been better. Unlike a recent reviewer, we had no noise issues from the halls or adjoining rooms. We didn't ask much of the staff, but they were helpful in getting us a cab to the airport and making a reservation. Speaking of taxis, on the two occasions we took a taxi to the hotel, the drivers did not know the hotel by name. So keep its address in mind. There were a couple of drawbacks to the room. The king bed was really two twin mattresses with a sheet over them, which made for an uncomfortable middle. Not the best idea for a supposedly very romantic hotel in a romantic city. The plugs were odd, and there was no place to plug in our converter to keep our cell phones going. The bedside lamps were below the level of the bed and had only decoarative 40W bulbs, so reading in bed was not possible. With these caveats in mind, we would recommend the hotel.

Without doubt, this is an excellent place to stay. Everybody was so hospitable there. They went out of the way to help us on several occasions e.g. restaurant bookings, airport shuttle bookings, luggage storage for a couple of days out-of-Paris journey. They even arranged a luggage carton for us and a packing tape. The Hotel First of all it is not a luxury hotel and may not appeal to those who are used to five and four stars. It is a small 'boutique' hotel, which is charming and very well run. Staff will spoil you with their positive attitude and hospitality. They are fluent in English. Once inside the hotel, you will find the lobby area and especially the library room (or waiting room whatever you may call it) cozy and aesthetically decorated. Hotel offers free maps of Metro, Bus & RER. Get the one which has a 10% discount card of Printemps and keep it for shopping at the departmental store. Herald Tribune is available at the reception. CNN and BBC are available in the room. Room We booked their superior room, which was larger than the normal double bed room and had a bathtub + shower combination. It was a good decision & well worth the extra Euros. The bed was perfect (king size) and the mattress was comfortable. The room was of an appropriate size (not small but was not big either). Baby crib was comfortably placed in the room. There was sufficient space in the cupboard and around the room corners to accommodate our 4 pieces of luggage (2 large sized suite cases and two cabin sized bags). Even after all these things had consumed room space, we could still navigate within the room and on its sides. The rooms are spotlessly clean and very well decorated. They are definitely cute and appear exactly as shown on the hotel web-site. The wash room is lovely, it is very very clean and comfortably sized. Location The location is central & very safe. Chatelet Metro Station is just round the corner (it is one of the major tube stations and several lines pass through it including the one to Disney). Versailles RER is across the river, past the island. Taxi stand is also close by. Key tourist sites are within walking distance (Notre Dame, Louvre, Orsay etc). Several bus stops are nearby. Just behind the hotel is Rue de Rivoli, which has several stores and boutiques. McDonald fans can also eat 'Maxi Menus' on this road, hardly 1 minute walk from the hotel. There were three French restaurants nearby, which seemed good as they were full with people at the dinner time (unfortunately we could not eat in any of these places). We came late in the evenings (around midnight) and always felt safe, both on foot and on metro. Breakfast Yes it is expensive at Euro 14 a person but it is delicious. Different varieties of Cheese, juices, scrambled egg, breads of various sorts, croissants including the chocolate filled ones, ham, sausages, mixed fruits, tea, coffee, milk etc. It is a highly nutritious buffet breakfast which powers one for the whole day of sightseeing. Alternately there is a bakery round the corner as well (however we did not try it). Child Friendly We found the hotel to be very child friendly. We asked for a quite room and got it. The outside view was not good, but you are not in Paris to stay in the room and look out of the window. It was a compromise which we had to make (i.e. between a room with a view and a quite room) and we made the correct choice. The baby slept tight every night. The hotel has given an electric point in all rooms so one can easily use the electric sterilizer. Our sterilizer needed a microwave oven and the hotel had one. It was made available to us everyday with a smile.

The staff were very helpful throughout our stay. My english accent gave me away though as even though I spoke French to them they always replied in English! From checking reservations for lunch to recommending somewhere for dinner and advising us the best way to get to places they were faultless. Another recommendation for the Cafe Zimmer - we had a lovely Valentines dinner there. Location wise it was great. Only a few stops down from the Gare du Nord (Eurostar) and near a major intersection of the Metro lines. It was very close the the Seine and lovely for a walk over to the the Ile after dinner. We found the area to be ok and despite many homeless people we saw, we never had any problems with any of them and felt very safe. Overall we were a dissapointed with the view and the smoky smell in the room but were otherwise very impressed. We would definitely stay there again - just request a non-smoking room on a higher floor!

Based primarily on the reviews here, I decided to give this hotel a try for an extended weekend stay. Although the Britannique offers a decent value, I was generally unimpressed and I doubt that I will stay there again, primarily because of the excessive street noise (lack of soundproofing) and excessive smoke smell in the room. The hotel bills itself as a \"Traditional Hotel housed in 19th century Parisian private mansion,\" but, except for perhaps the main staircase, there isn't anything traditional that remains about the hotel. The rooms have been renovated, but any traditional architectural highlights are gone - replaced with \"Home-Depot\" style doors, wall-paper, fixtures, furniture, carpet and moldings (unusual for a Parisian hotel). As a result, the hotel lacks character. On top of that, our room (the junior suite) could have used a re-wallpapering. However, the rooms were generally clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke English. In my opinion, there were two \"fatal\" flaws with the room. First, the noise. We could hear everything on the street outside - including word for word conversations of people talking, cars, trucks, motorscooters, etc. From midnight to about 2 AM, it was primarily the bar crowd returning home that woke us up every ten minutes. Then, beginning at about 6AM were the sanitation workers and shop owners. In addition, the hotel is on a busy sidestreet, and just 1/2 block from the busy Point Chatelet - meaning that there is a lot of traffic noise 24/7. Secondly, someone in another review mentioned that the hotel smelled \"musky.\" I believe this was smoke. There are no non-smoking rooms and ours reeked terribly of cigarette smoke. Because of the noise and smoke smell, we came within a hair of relocating to another hotel. In addition, there was no thermostat in our room. To adjust the heat, we had to adjust the water valves on the radiators. As a result, we were unable to find a comfortable temperature. Having said that, when it comes to temperature, most European hotel rooms tend to have a mind of their own (even though most have thermostats). Turning to the hotel's location, someone in another review mentioned that their room had a great view. I find this hard to believe. The hotel is land-locked in the middle of a block, and the only view we had was of an ugly building across the street and a homeless person who spent every night on the sidewalk in front of the cedar furniture store next door. One block in front of the hotel is the Sienne and the Ile de Paris, one block West is Paris' main metro station (Chatelet), and a few blocks East is the Louvre. This is nice. A lot of sights are within a short walk, and the Metro will bring you just about anywhere else you might want to go. However, one block behind the hotel is the Les Halles district. Les Halles is not one of the best neighborhoods in central Paris. This neighborhood has most of the mainstream \u201ceconomy\u201d stores of Paris, and a large underground mall. These tend to attract a particular crowd \u2013 not necessarily bad per se \u2013 but not the same tourist or Parisian shopper crowd that you will see in most other parts of Paris. The high-end stores are a long walk up Saint Honore street. There are, however, plenty of cafes, patisseries and bars within a stone\u2019s throw of the hotel. Across the Sienne on the other side of the Ile de Paris is the Latin Quarter, which I find more interesting and entertaining, and a better location from which to base my stay. Hence, although I believe that this hotel is a good value, and clean, and in a decent location, I really don't understand the hype. For about the same price, there are many worthy alternatives, with better soundproofing, in more interesting neighborhoods.

The Chatelet metro stop is steps away and that one connects you to most lines. At the time we were there, there was construction going on across the street, it wasn't too bad, but when we tried to nap after a long day of exploring, we could hear it. The hotel is a few blocks from the Seine, Notre Dame, St. Chappel (a must see!) and shopping. We also always felt safe walking to-from the metro to the hotel. We were fortunate enough to see most of Paris because of the great location and metro passes. 3. Staff - Nice, but not very informed on places to go. We asked for suggestions for lunch/dinner and they suggested looking at the tourist pamphlet area. They were unable to help us with reservations for dinner at the Eiffel Tower. Things to keep in mind...the elevator is TINY! Two people fit, and that is it! We never ate the continental there, simply because we enjoyed the cafes that were close by so much.

The small rooms should be around $100...no more. Good things; The people that work here happen to be very nice. The location is very central, although a few blocks in the wrong direction at night can be scary if you're not used to big cities. Homeless, etc... The bathroom was clean, although musty smelling from no working fan. When they realized they messed up my room reservation, they did try to offer some alternatives as they became available...but none were any better than the room in which we were originally placed. Cute lounge. Bad things; Musty bathroom. They messed up my reservation (reserved for the wrong month). I was subsequently placed in the smallest room I have ever seen (the only room available). While peeking around SOME rooms seemed slightly larger, but do NOT book the standard double room if you expect to be able to fit you and your luggage in the room at the same time. Perspective, the room measured less than 8' x 8'. Again, I feel like complaining and adding sarcastic comments about one person having to walk across the bed if the other person was standing, due to lack of room to pass on the floor, but I will stop there. When I was shown a \"larger\" room it was about 2 feet longer, although no wider, but had no tub only a shower. We stayed in the smaller room. Our choice at that point. I was offered a discount as atonement for the mistake. When I was billed, the discount was listed as \"winter promotion\" so obviously a deal that was being offered anyway. And a deal that I wouldn't have been made aware of and hence would have paid more than I had to pay had they not messed up my reservation. If you travel with a back pack maybe a good option.

We have stayed in other parts of Paris and now prefer this location in the 1st arrondisement. Our room and bathroom were spotless and the staff was very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast at the Britannique is well worth the 13 euros - they offer delicious croissants and pain au chocolat, cold meats, yogurt, toast, jams, sausages and scrambled eggs, coffee, tea and hot chocolate, milk and cereal. We also ate breakfast at Zimmer Cafe at the corner of the street and it was good but the hotel breakfast was definitely a much better value and was delicious in a charming breakfast room. Also ate at Au Trappist for the 2nd time - they have great moules (mussels) and the salmon was good also. It's located right around the corner on Rue St. Denis. Would definitely return to the Hotel Britannique and hope to do so again soon. We had another perfect Parisien trip made all the more special because my sister and brother-in-law were with us and they now also love Paris.

The balcony overlooks a small one way street with a view of the hotel de Ville to the left and the top of the Eiffel Tower to the right. AWESOME The staff was incredibly helpful and polite. The breakfast, though substantial, could probably be skipped and instead grab a great croissant and cafe cream out the door right- the quick right on first block. If you dig mussels- try a late night moules de jour and a nice beer around the other corner. The metro Chatelet is right across the street and is the hub of all Metro (subway) stops including the airport.- however many things like the Notre Dame are in short walking distance. My suggestion- plan your trip around the full moon if possible- Nothing more magnificent then seeing the Giant moon creep up over the louvre from the Pont Neuf- Eiffel tour to your back.", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cOverall, Fine... but...\u201d", "Author": "WhiteTara", "ReviewID": "UR3934655", "Content": "I enjoyed a four night stay in this well kept, well decorated, well located, small hotel.

It was our first visit to Paris, and we booked this Hotel based on the TripAdvisor reviews, as well as the hotel's website. We were looking for a nice, clean, comfortable, central hotel with a middle-of-the-road price ... we're not part of the hostel crowd, but also can't swing the Four Seasons. We LOVED this hotel, and it made our stay in Paris wonderful. It has a lovely decor that is warm and friendly the moment you walk in, and the lounge area is marvelous. We had done a lot of reading prior to our trip, and were prepared for small rooms, and less than friendly front desk staff. The front desk staff were a delightful surprise - each person, no matter day or night, was friendly, helpful and eager to make our stay enjoyable. Our room was indeed small, but immaculately clean and had a very comfortable bed. Bathroom was also spotless every day, and big enough to easily accomplish the essentials (althought one at a time). There was decent closet space, a safe so we didn't have to lug lots of stuff around, and a small, flat-screen TV. A/C worked well - we like a cool room, even in November. And the best part - our room had a lovely,flower-potted balcony that looked out onto avenue Victoria ... just what we wanted in a Parisian hotel room! I can't speak about the breakfast, because we were up and out each day without partaking, but we heard other guests remarking how much they enjoyed it. Another important feature for some travelers out there - there is an elevator available to reach the upper floor that works without a hitch, although one person + suitcase is the capacity. Lastly, the location of the hotel is also perfect. One easy block from the Seine, and close to the Louvre, Notre Dame, 2 metro stops, and the Samartaine department store (great rooftop restaurant with spectaular view). Plus, a cab stand directly across the street, so it was easy to be out the door and on our way to wherever. You won't regret staying at Hotel Brittanique, unless you want a huge space, room service and the works.

The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They made several phone calls to make arrangements for a nice birthday dinner for my wife.

The hotel was perfectly situated as stated to many of the main attractions and the Metro was literally just over the road which was a great advantage to my some times tired feet. The only down side to the hotel that I can mention was that the rooms were not totally soundproofed and we could hear our neighbours perhaps a little too well. We did complain and were moved without fuss or question, but I do feel that perhaps the management should look at the soundproofing as it may be a problem.
