We had booked 2 single rooms and when we arrived, there was a major discrepancy between the standard of the 2 rooms. Our main issue was the first room we were given which was clearly a make shift room and the bathroom was appaling. The shower and toilet cubicle were situated in a carpeted coridoor ajoined to the room. This coridoor was also a PUBLIC FIRE EXIT! In fairness it was secured with an inadequate bolt but 2 additional doors opened onto public fire escape stairs as well as into the main walkway of the hotel! It was really unerving and we did not feel comfortable! Also despite being told no one could get in, there was a lock from the main bedroom into the bathroom which contradicted this, so in the event of a fire you wouldnt be able to access the fire escape if you were asleep. I doubt this is legal and I expect this does not comply with heath and safety standards whatsoever. Either way, we did not feel safe. This was not a bathroom, it was clearly an example of utilising extra space to make an extra second rate en suite bathroom. On top of this, old carpet on a bathroom floor is both unhygenic and unpleasant. The main sleeping area of the room was basic and OK, however compared to the other single room we were given there were some big differences despite being the same price. The carpet wasn't fitted to this room, just folded at the edges of the walls and was rather grubby! The second room was fine, totally acceptable, simple but more than adequate and much nicer than the 'Fire escape room' with proper fixtures and fittings and a real bathroom. In fairness the staff dealt with our issues promptly and pretty painlessly. We explained our reasons for wanting another room and they offered to swap it and waiver the extra charges, which was commendable. Once we were in the 2 other rooms they were fine and we proceeded to have a comfortable stay in rooms that were clean and suitable. Location was OK, very quiet, and it was only 10 mins walk to the nearest U-Bahn which allows you to get anywhere in the city. There is a great diner called Route 66 just at the end of the street, there is also an allnight garage called \"Come In\" just up the road, handy for midnight snacks!!! Overall I would definitley stay elsewhere next time, the room drama caused unwelcomed stress to our holiday as well as wasting time. I don't feel it was good value for money and would have prefered to stay in a hostel. It wasnt the cheapest option we could have chosen but we wanted something a bit nicer, unfortunately it turned out to be a bad decision. We booked via another site opposed to directly and breakfast wasn't included in the deal. I think this sort of pension environment that is charging the rates that is it should automatically provide a breakfast to all guests in the price instead of whacking on another 7 EUROS. It was a budget option, however I think basics such as free WI-FI etc should be made accessable to guests. If the place had been cheaper I wouldnt have complained so much, but I just feel for the money we paid we could have had a far more comfortable stay in another guesthouse or budget hotel. All in all, pleasant, helpful staff but the actual place is very outdated and needs some refurbishment as well as re-evaluating their rates. Also note they do seem to allow pets as one of our rooms has just had a doggy visitor check out and the smell lingered throughout the duration of our stay! If you do stay there avoid room 8a, aside from that other rooms are adequate.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva", "Title": "\u201cReal disounest place\u201d", "Author": "Niea", "ReviewID": "UR46481216", "Content": "Invents conditions never existing in your contract.

Down sides - Breakfast was very meagre with tea, coffee, juice, cheap meats and cheese and a tiny offering of smoked salmon. Eggs only on 2 of the 4 days. One type of bread roll and some sliced white bread. Not VFM in my opinion but convenient. Our room was a bit small but hey what do you expect for this kind of money.
