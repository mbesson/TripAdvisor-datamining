Special thanks to the doorman/luggage handler who was very helpful in providing umbrellas on days it rained...which is a touch I liked. We had breakfast one morning and it consists of cold continental and hot scrambled eggs sausage and bacon. All of good quality. There has been a few comments about noise from the traffic.....our room overlooked the front and you could just about hear traffic, but that wasn't a problem.

We can only add to all the positive ones! This is a lovely hotel-spotlessly clean, tastefully furnished & decorated, well placed for sightseeing with friendly & helpful staff, especially Kalvi on reception. We booked a standard double room, it had 2 large wardrobes, dressing table, large chest of drawers, flat-screen TV, one armchair plus one \"dining\" chair. The bathroom was HUGE-it had a large section with WC, bidet, wash-basin set in a large vanity unit, lots of mirrors, good lighting and small hairdryer. A glass door led to a wet room with power shower plus full-size bath with overhead shower and heated bath rail. Someone wrote that the rooms were noisy from traffic, but we were overlooking the junction of Balmes & Mallorca and we couldn't hear a thing when the window was closed. Just 2 (very) slight minus points-no kettle/tea & coffee making facilities in the rooms, (but we always take our own) and although the hotel allows smoking in the rooms (big plus for us) it doesn't provide ashtrays! I'd advise you to take your own. Breakfast was very good. Hot buffet comprising eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes. Also various cold meats, cheeses, olives, cold tomatoes, cereals, fresh fruits, yoghurt, pastries, sliced breads & rolls. Fruit juices, bottled water and tea, coffee, cappucino and hot chocolate As stated previously, the hotel is in a very good location for most of the sights. If, like us, you are happy to walk about, don't bother to buy a ticket for the hop on-hop off tour bus. It costs 27 Euros (discounted to 24 if you buy from the hotel) but is only valid for 1 day. Las Ramblas is about 15-20 minutes walk (down Balmes) and La Sagrada is about 30 minutes walk along Mallorca (admission is 16 Euros, but worth it) Casa Mila is about 10-15 minutes walk (along Mallorca and turn left into Gracia) This costs 15 Euros and gets you onto the roof (spectacular!) into \"the attic\" (amazing!) and round 2 apartments furnished in the style of Gaudi's era (really interesting!) If you walk up Balmes, about 2 blocks away, there is a Bistro/bar called Balmes Rossallo-highly recommended. Prices very reasonable and delicious food-particularly the pizzas. This hotel is part of a chain and has premises in Madrid, Valencia, Seville, Granada (and somewhere else I can't remember) Like the Leonardo in Berlin, I'd visit another city just to stay in one of their hotels!", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood place\u201d", "Author": "dianazi", "ReviewID": "UR126134990", "Content": "We arrived to Barce late night and when I saw 4 **** I told myself yeah right, In hotel fairyland maybe.

The people who service in the morning aren't the happiest looking staff, they all seem angry or unhappy but thats OK I guess. As for our room, it was perfect.

Our bathroom was modern, but we did experience sewage smells coming up through the plumbing at various times, but this wasn't continuous and not at night so was possible to deal with. We didn't really enjoy the food in the hotel restaurant, but only ate there in the first place as we arrived late.

The rooms themselves were exactly as described: modern, with neutral decor (a wardrobe each!) and a lovely bathroom with real toiletries (not those 'cheap' and tacky dispensers as found in some hotels). We had booked 'room only' but found that breakfast could be reserved the night before for about 14 euros and we thought it was good value for a city centre hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful; reception staff went out of their way to be helpful (they tried to get us tickets for a football match) and the 'doormen' were always willing to have a little chat. The public rooms were quite impressive (there were a couple of big functions while we were there and furniture was moved so efficiently and quickly, it was like being at Hogwarts!) We went up to have a look at the roof top terrace and hot tub - lovely!. The service in the bar was a little slow - but we were on holiday, so who cares? We liked the location and although the street was busy there was little traffic noise in the rooms. It is only about 10 minutes from Plaza Catalunya (weirdly though, taxi drivers seemed to have trouble locating it - tip carry a 'hotel card') We visited the football stadium (and that's 2 hours of MY life I won't get back!!) Gaudi obviously - big tip, Casa Batllo: get there before 9 to beat the queues and Sagrada Familia: start queuing NOW (honestly!).

The hotel is about 30-45 minutes away to the end of La Rambla (by the Columbus Monument). Initial impressions were very good, lovely decor and friendly staff. After seeing some reviews on TA beforehand, I asked at check in if I could have an exterior room but was told they are fully booked. However, the internal room wasn't *too* bad. It did have a [small] window to allow some sunlight to come in but don't expect a huge balcony. For a solo traveller like myself, I'd say it's fine. Room size wasn't too bad considering I was a solo traveller, maybe a bit small if you're with a family. The bathroom was very nice, although the bath handle came off and the shower kept leaning to one side, resulting in the water going out! On my first night, I noticed a form behind the door handle which said I was required to fill out and leave outside the night before in order to get breakfast. I called reception beforehand to ask to confirm if I still had to fill this out although I was going to go to the buffet and they said yes. The following morning, I opened the door to leave for breakfast to find a hotel worker delivering it via room service to me! Be advised, nowhere on the form did it say this was for room service, and the hotel also charged me \u20ac5, which again was also not stated on the form. The breakfast itself wasn't anything truly special. Bread/cakes/croissants/hot drinks/cerials/scrambled eggs and bacon. There was also different types of ham which I wasn't keen on trying. Communication for me was very important, and one of the reasons I chose this hotel was due to the free Wi-Fi. However, I soon realised that I was not picking up any signal in my room. After calling the reception, they said that Wi-Fi is only available in the lobby and that I should connect the Ethernet cable in my room should I want Internet access there. Okay, not a major issue but it kind of restricts you to a corner of the room unless you take a longer cable with you. The main issue with the Internet though was that it kept cutting off and was very slow. This was in particular annoying when I wanted to check in online for my return flight so that I could choose my seat - it took over 20 minutes of me refreshing the page to finally connect. Again, when reception were informed, was told the hotel was 'fully booked' and there was not a lot they could do about it. The bed itself was a little hard for my liking, but I suppose they cannot perfect it for everyone. I did notice a 'Pillow Menu' in my room which gave suggestions for different types of pillows to suit different guests, but it did not state how to order them. On departure, the staff were vey friendly, organised a taxi for me and kept me updated on the progress whilst I sat in the hotel lobby etc. The porter knew which terminal I was flying from when I told him my airline, and then told the taxi driver (as I cannot speak Catalan/Spanish).

The hotel room was very clean, spacious, quiet, well-furnished and in an excellent and lovely location. The only downside was the fact that the room was very dark as our window faced a walled compound which did not catch any sunlight so we had to turn on all the lights during the day! The plus-side was that it was extremely quiet (if you discount the faint rumblings of the understand which is not really a problem unless you are a very light sleeper). That was not really a problem for us as the hotel met all our expectations. A few people have complained about the bed but I didn't find it uncomfortable. The hotel has a restaurant but I would not recommend it for dinner - service staff are lovely but unfortunately the food is not very good. Thankfully there are lots of good restaurants all within walking distance but avoid the peak times! We felt very safe walking around at night even when there weren't a lot of people around (unlike El Ravel which is pretty dodgy at night). We also had a late flight but the hotel staff were happy to store our luggage for us all day and we picked them up around 6pm. Would definitely stay here again and recommend for those who want to be centrally located in a nice hotel and away from the hustle and bustle of La Ramblas. Use the airport shuttle which will take you to Placa de Catalunya (main centre). From there it is about a 20min walk to the hotel. A really good tapas restaurant a few minutes walk away (near Passeig de Gracia) is Cerveseria Catalana. Go early though (no later than 1.30pm for lunch or 8pm for dinner) as this restaurant is always busy during the peak lunch and dinner period! Also try Mauri cafe on the corner of Passeig de Gracia for breakfast or afternoon tea - they have great selection of pastries, little hamburgers and cakes. It's also worthwhile using the Barcelona Bus Turistic for one or two days as they take you to all the major (and some smaller) attractions which will save a lot of time as the sites are quite spread out.

It offers a good combination of reasonable quolity accomodation and fairly central location-about 7-10 min walking to Placa de Catalunia. It has to be said though it feels more like accomodation pension rather as a proper hotel as it is situated in a building a multiple block building looking more like one of many houses in this area containing private flats. Location is quite good as Passeig de Gracia mear 5min away and there are scores of excellent restaurants and tapas bars as well as a wide choice of chain and designer shops. Famous Gaudi's Casa Battlo, Casa Amatler (part of the block of discordia) as well as La Pedrera are all within short walking distance and there are subway stations (1.35 Euro for a sinle trip) neraby if you are lazy and tired of exploring the city on foot.

At that point I did mind the distance a little bit as I was exhausted after a full day work and the flying. Staff at the receiption were warm and helpful during my stay. I was given a room on the 6th floor. Room was big enough but I wouldn't say spacious. My room was facing the back of houses so not a noise throughout my stay - definately couldn't hear any trams passing by. Bathroom was clean with enough space and had a tub with the shower over it. They provided clean towels and topped up toiletries daily. **note to those who do use hair-conditioner, bring your own as they don't seem to provide that in the two hotels that I stayed**. Cabled internet connection was free and reasonbly fast - which was important to me. Breakfast was included with my room and it was good with enough choices I guess. Two juices, choices of difference coffees from two nice espresso machines, plenty of fruits, pastries, plenty of cold cuts and cheeses, bread, cereals, yogurts and the usual sausages and bacons and egg - I wish they had more than just scrambled eggs though. Went to the 'gym' - located on the roof - a couple of times. I must say I expected slightly better than a small small room with no A/C. It had one cycle machine, one rowing machine and one treadmill one right next to another - and they were not of the latest models by any scretch of imagination either. The room was about 10ftX8ft with sauna right behind the machines and a shower room with no door. The jacuzzis were nice but the hot one was far too hot. But because there wasn't a proper bathroom facilities, I had to go back to my room wrapped in towels...lol. Didn't mind but sort of expected better facilities at gym/jucuzzi areas. Location-wise, it wasn't too bad. A bit of a walk to/from the Ramblas but not too excessive for me, perhaps 15-20mins? But can be a bit much if you are tired or hate walking. The hotel however is quite close to the Passeig de Gracia. Out of the hotel, cross the road in front of it and continue for 5-10 mins et voila. The tapas restaurant everyone talks about is on the way just before you hit the passeig. The area, I felt was quite safe as I was out at 1-2am a couple of times and didn't feel I was in any danger. One complaint though, my bed (with some sort of moveable mechanisms) was making loudish squeaky noise as you turn - I asked the hotel staff to come and have a look a couple of time but no one ever turned up or at least nothing had been done. I wasn't even told if they ever attempted to resolve the problem either.... Overall, the stay was OK. As I extended my visit and stayed in another hotel (Barcelo Hotel), I must admit I prefer Barcelo - similar price, much nicer....would I stay again or recommend it to a friend...? Probably not...see my review on Barcelo and you understand why.

It's in a convenient (and safe feeling) area about 5 mins from shops and restaurants on Passeig de Gracia and about 20mins from the Ramblas. We had a front room on the 4th floor overlooking the intersection. The room was large and comfortable with a king sized double bed. The en-suite was also large with a full sized bath with shower over. All bedroom and bathroom fittings were pretty new, in good condition and very clean. There was a safe in the room which was useful to keep valuables and spare cash to avoid taking it all with you every day, especially useful considering all the pick-pocket warnings about Barcelona (although luckily we didn\u2019t feel particularly threatened at any time while we were there). Breakfast was included in our deal and there was a good selection of cold and hot dishes, our favourite being scrambled eggs on toast. We also had evening meal at the hotel on our first night, being rather tired after a 4am start and a long afternoon sightseeing, so it was nice to be able to go down to the bar, have a few drinks and eat well on the premises. The fixed price menu was about \u20ac18 for 3 courses, with a choice of 5-6 dishes for each course, which we thought was good value for the choice and quality on offer. We tried out the Jacuzzi and sauna a few times which was refreshing after day\u2019s sightseeing. All in all a comfortable, clean, safe hotel with good food and service. Tips: We used the train from the airport. Passeig de Gracia station on the RENFE airport line is the nearest to the hotel. The station exit is at the intersection with C/Arago, alongside Gaudi's Casa Battlo about 10mins walk to the hotel. Note If you use the airport bus and then change to the metro, the Passeig de Gracia METRO station is further south, nearer the Ramblas so is not so convenient. The nearest Metro station to the hotel would be Diagonal. On the return to the airport the trains depart every 30 mins from Passeig de Gracia platform 1, at 2 mins and 32 mins past the hour (March 2009), journey time about 25 -30 mins. Great tapas close to the hotel at Cerveceria Catalan on C/ Mallorca - a lucky find for our first lunch straight after checking in. Also it's worth trying the menu de dias in restaurants in the old town. We tried two and enjoyed a 3 course lunch including wine for \u20ac9 each. We chose them on the basis they were busy with locals and the menus were only in Spanish, (so not tourist traps) and with some help from our dictionary we were rewarded with excellent meals.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pegswood england", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel.\u201d", "Author": "mesaswife", "ReviewID": "UR24686456", "Content": "My husband & I have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel.

We arrived late only to discover there had been some legitimate linguistic confusion over the room. We had emailed the hotel asking for a regular room with a cot for our seven year old. The English receptionist on duty seemed surprised that we had asked for a cot for our daughter, gently hinting that she thought we needed a bigger room and that our daughter was a \"little big for a cot.\" We replied that, no, she always sleeps on cots when we are in hotel rooms. Eventually, we learned that for Brits cot means \"crib\" and not simple foldaway bed! Anyway, she and the other attendant decided that the standard room would be a bit cramp[ed with a foldaway bed and they upgraded us to a beautiful suite on the 5th floor, replete with balcony-type windows....all for the 80 euros a night price we had secured via the hotel website. The room was tastefully decorated and well serviced by the cleaning crew. Though the room faced the intersection, it was incredibly quiet--we did not even feel the subway rumble that some readers mentioned. I think the only negative thing was that the hot tub/jacuzzi was broken while we were there (they are waiting for a part to be shipped in order to repiar it), but that was a very minor disappointment, as there are lots of other things to bve doing in Barcelona! We didn't eat in the hotel, but rather took the desk attendant's recommendations and went to the two tapas places they recokmmended (one was a half block away on Via Mallorca and was always busy--we ate our breakfasts there and were very happy) and the other was 2 and a half blocks away and was terrific. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the names. But they steered us very well. The hotel is in an excellent location--an easy 5 minute walk to Gaudy's celebrated apartment building, not too far from a subway stop, etc. The neighborhood is mixed, residential and business and there are restaurants, cafes, grocery stores and everythign else you could want just down the block.

From the roof terrace you can see the Sagrada Familia (25 minute walk) and Mont Juic. Best parts for us are the Eixample cafes and bars for tapas etc. The Born/Sant Pere area for exploring and shopping.The Gothic quarter for strolling round and for a bit of an edgy experience the Lower Raval. We found ourselves in a street (Il Roberador) which was pretty grim and for me - on the wrong side of scary. We were warned to stay away by some random guy as we obviously stuck out like typical tourists. It was wall to wall prostitutes, dealers and users, not to mention the gangs (one guy banging some metal piping against the wall as we approached!). My heart was certainly racing a bit. However we survived and a bit of sense and caution is advised. We loved Barcelona. What a great place. The Aerobus is a little over 4 euros to the City Centre. A taxi about 21 Euros (including 1 case and a supplement of 3 Euros). The Tourist bus is a great way to see other parts of the City which you can hop on and off and change routes (red and blue). The Nou Camp (17 euros is well worth a visit).

The location was great, about 10 minutes walk from the ramblas, in a quiet area which we found quite safe, there was a nice very reasonable Chinese two or three blocks down on the way to the ramblas on the right and also a great Irish bar nearby , Scobies, if thats what you are into. The hotel itself was very nice, our room which was on the third floor was very spacious with lots of storage space and a large bathroom. We requested that there was a cot placed in the room and there was a travel cot set up and ready for us when we arrived. The rooms were cleaned every morning. I didn't find any noise issue with either traffic or trains. The hotel breakfast was lovely, with plenty of fruit, pastries, breads, eggs cooked two ways, meat and cheese. Our daughter loved the fruit and cheeses. However if it wasn't included in our room price i don't think I would have paid 17 euros for it. I also found the staff in the hotel fantastic, especially the porter who took our bags to the room, spread a map on the bed and spent ages showing us the sights of Barcelona. The reception staff were also great and always friendly and willing to help. As a hotel for a baby it was great as they were very welcoming and eager to help and also talk to our daughter. There were however a couple of minus points, we ate in the hotel restaurant one night and i wouldn't recommend it, there wasn't much food served and what there was wasn't great. The staff in the bar and restaurant were also quite abrupt and unfriendly which was a contrast to the other staff we encountered. There are much better places nearby. Also internet access in the lobby was only available if you had your own laptop as the computer in the lobby was always used for meetings. Finally unfortunately the jacuzzi was closed for maintenance for most of our stay but the night we got in them was fab. Sorry this review was so long but it includes the things i would like to hear.

After having stayed in another, more \"modest\" hotel in Barcelona the week prior, we wanted to splurge and booked this hotel for our last night in Spain. We picked this hotel based in part on location and reviews and made the reservation 1 week prior to arrival(although I was really hoping to get a room at Hotel Puitzer but it was booked due to the last minute nature of our reservations). Regardless, we weren't disappointed with this hotel. Getting there: Having used the metro and aeroport bus on our first trip to barcelona, we decided to take the taxi this time (23 euros for 4 people w/ luggage). The return trip to the airport via taxi for 2 of us was 24 euros (more traffic). You can also take the aeroport bus (~ 2euros) from the airport (buy the tickets when you board) to the center of the city at Plaza Catalunya and then take the metro (L3/Green Line) towards the Diagonal stop (2 stops down) for ~1 euro per person (would definitely recommend buying a T10 pass for the metro if you plan on being there for a few days as you can use the pass 10 times for multiple passengers and it only costs 7.5 euros). The Hotel is about 2 blocks from th metro stop Diagonal. The Hotel: Although check-in is at 1pm, our rooms were not ready for some reason at 3pm when we arrived and we were told to wait or walk around until it was available. My friend was able to convince them to comp us for free drinks and sandwiches in their cafe while we waited another 15mins. The room it itself was very nice for $247 after taxes/night. We had 2 twin beds pushed together instead of a double \"since they were full.\" The same happened to my friend and his wife as well. Not a big deal though. There was a large LCD TV w/ the option of having access to the all their movies and internet for 20 euros/day. The bathroom was also very nice but did not have a shower curtain (a theme we noticed throughout spain), so we had to be careful about getting water on the floor. As for amenities, the hotel had a small work out room (treadmill, stationary bike, and row machine), sauna, as well as 2 outdoor hot tubs on the roof which we definitely took advantage of. The staff was friendly and helpful as well (to be expected in a 4star hotel). Location: Nice location that was within walking distance of Las Ramblas (~15mins). Also within 2 blocks of the Metro stop (Diagonal). Downside is that it's right over the metro/train and you can hear them rumble when eating in the cafe. We were on the 5th floor but could still hear a faint rumble (not bothersome at all). Overall, would recommend this hotel given it's nice atmosphere and convenient location to several restaurants and shopping areas nearby. My wife and friends enjoyed it quite a bit but I might consider staying at Hotel Casa Furster (sp?) next time as I preferred it's location and it seemed nicer from the outside. It was a bit more pricier at 187 euro/night (even with a \"special promotional rate) though.

The location is excellent, right next to Las Ramblas and you can get guides for the Bus Turistic at reception (you pay 3 euros and that gets taken off the full ticket price when you actually board the bus). CONs: The rather nifty bed pillows are long and sausage shaped, but they are so soft that when you lay your head on top of them, its as though they don't exist! There are some harder, square pillows hidden on the top shelf of the cupboards in the room, which are better than nothing but not wonderful. The bed itself is hard, but not so much that its uncomfortable. If you don't mind having a straight back, its fine. Breakfast is foul, its cheap, greasy stuff that you'd find in any budget hotel. The coffee is instant and not a pleasant experience. Breakfast was not included in our room price (you can choose to include it if you want). We tried it one day and had to pay 17 euros per person! Its a crime! I only wanted a bowl of cereal, but felt I had to fill up on something more substantial at that price. So avoid breakfast, find it somewhere else. CONCLUSION: Despite the cons above, I would actually recommend staying at this hotel because everything else about it is great. HINTS: You have to go to \"Osmosis\" a restaurant of contemporary Catalan cuisine about 2 blocks from the hotel. They open at 9pm and are on the corner of Aribau and Mallorca. The food is absolutely amazing, the service extremely attentive and helpful and.. well.. you just have to go!

The hotel is located in the Eixample district - an easy 10 min. walk to the Placa de Catalunya, La Ramblas and the waterfront but away from all the noise and craziness of Las Ramblas. There were plenty of restaurants/bars/cafes nearby as well as shopping. The hotel is located on the corner of Calle Mallorca. We were never disturbed by outside noise or other guests.

I didn't see any internet cafes on the street like there are in Rome but maybe we just weren't looking in the right places.

We did book a day trip to Torres Winery, Monserrat (a monastery in the mountains) and Sitges (a small town by the sea just south of Barcelona). The winery was about an hour outside of Barcelona and very nice. Monserrat sits high on a mountain and the views are breathtaking. The boys choir sings every day at 1 p.m. and was amazing to listen to. Sitges has alot of history and architecture and the beaches there were beautiful. I would highly recommend this day trip.

Linen was changed every other day and the bed was firm but comfy (with lots of spare pillows that were allegedly of different weights and fibres, but I didn't try them out so can't say). Annoyingly the massive framed pictures above the desk were crooked and couldn't be straightened, but this was only a minor niggle. Reception are not terribly friendly - it was unusual to get greeted when you came in and out of reception - but if you needed help they were fine (good for restaurant reservations). Location is not perfect but this is down to Barcelona's geography - the city is laid out in a long strip. To walk to Las Ramblas (the other side of Placa Catalunya) takes about 20 minutes, Barceloneta and the beach a further 20 or 30 minutes (depending on how busy Las Ramblas was, which was largely dependant on the number of people pretending to be statues. Quite why people find this so entertaining it beyond me, but there seemed to be a lot of them there so there must be some money in it!). We spent a lot of time in the Eixample (there are some excellent restaurants there and the area is less touristy than Las Ramblas) and the hotel is perfect for this. It's also well located for Casa Mila and Casa Batllo/Manzana Discordia as well as lots of designers stores and boutiques. The Barcelona metro system is pretty poor so try not to rely on it too much - there are two systems and although your ticket will work in both you will need to use two credits if you want to use them both. Also if you have to change systems it's a very, very long walk between platforms. If you do stay at the hotel and don't want to walk everywhere walk one street up Carrer Balmes and take the metro (any S route) from Provenca down to Placa Catalunya. Most of southern Barcelona is within walking distance of this stop. Either that or walk to Passeig De Gracia or Diagonal and take the L3 or 4 to Barceloneta or Jaumes. When arriving from the airport if you catch the airport bus take the metro from the North West corner of Placa Catalunya and get the metro just one stop to Provenca and save yourself what seems like a long walk to the hotel when you\u2019re toting a case. A T-10 ticket costs 7 euros and allows you 10 journeys and can be shared between passengers - just run it through the machine twice. Also note that there are lifts to the platforms in most stations. So, I digress. The hotel is very good. It really does just become somewhere to sleep because Barcelona has so much going on there is no need to do anything else there. For restaurants I would strongly recommended blowing the budget and going for the menu degustacion at Cinc Sentits (book at least a week in advance) and try the Sommelier's wine pairings. A fantastic experience and sure to have a Michelin star before too long. For an a la carte menu try Hisop which is just the other side of Avenue Diagonal. Fabulous service and a really excellent wine list.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cA Barcelona Wedding\u201d", "Author": "ikiikipiki", "ReviewID": "UR8739657", "Content": "Great location close to transportation, sites and restaurants.

A nice and hard shower stream with enough pressure and after a shower the floor didn't get wet ( in many hotels it is). We had 2 large beds (2,10 x 1,00mtr) next to eachother. The airco was fine and individually adjustable. There was a flat LCD television with overall spanish channels but also BBC World (English) and MTV (German). We had breakfast every morning (0700-1030) and there was enough to eat like fresh fruit, baked bread, cheese, ham, yoghurt, scrambled eggs, cornflakes etc.. The atmosphere in the hotel was luxurous with fine details like thick carpet in the hallway so you didn't hear anybody walking along your door. The sound insulation in the room was also okay. We didn't hear any guests. On top of the hotel you have a really large terrace with 2 jacuzzi's (one cold one hot) and this was open from 0700 till 2200u. Very nice! There were also a small health club where you could run and row. A dinner in the hotel was available for only 16,50 for 3 courses (we didn't consume this).

On way back to the hotel on most nights we stopped off at the Haagan Daaz icecream parlour which is just one block away in Rambla de Catalunya. Would definately recommend the use of the Metro which is a quick and easy way to get round - they do a \"one day travelcard\" type thing for about 5 euros which is great value and allows you to go all over the city and sights.
