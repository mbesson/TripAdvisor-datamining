The rooms were very good, and to be honest the only problem I had with noise was my mate snoring through the night. Every chance he kept half the hotel up!

This apparthotel has a lot to offer, especially for families. Each room is spacious (35m\u00b2), and has a kitchenette. The location is about 2 minutes walk from the Rocafort metro stop on line 1. There are 2 supermarkets almost next door, and numerous caf\u00e9s and restarants, delicatessens, and what have you in the immediate neighbourhood. Apart from the Line 1 metro, there are 4 TMB (barcelona metro area transports) buses. It's possible to walk to Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya and even Barcelona Sants Railway station is walkable (10<>15 mins)(We're arrived by train from France). The staff are very helpful, and speak at least English and French, as well as Spanish (Don't forget that barcelona is catalunya, and Catalan is the language, it's kind of mix of spanish and french, pretty easy to understand when read, in any case, if you know French and/or Spanish) The breakfast buffet was ordinary, and during our stay during school holiday period, was packed with screaming kids. we decided to have breakfast in the room because of the noise and because of the poor quality of the breakfast. We weren't charged for the 1 morning we had breakfast, maybe itwas included in the rate. If it is/was then it's acceptable, but not for the 8\u20ac per person suplement advertised. Really, the only really bad point about the hotels were the thin walls, and hearing even quiet conversations from the neighbouring room very clearly. I had to phone reception one night because I couldn't sleep. If you want to sleeep, then you take a risk,because it depends on how you sleep through noise and how noisy, or not, your neghbours are. I don't like to exagerrate, but seriously, the neighbours didn't have to be rowdy to be able to hear them, the walls are very thin!

We found that it's good for families (like us - with a 2yr old) the fact it had capacity for 4 people, also that it had a kitchenette (even if you don't cook it's useful to have a fridge for baby milk etc). The rooms was a bit dated if you were being picky but fit for purpose. Bathroom had a good powerful shower and was clean. Location, while you can't pretend it's really central, was not bad especially in relation to Place de Espanya (Magic Fountain etc) and Sants station which was where we arrived and departed the city. For La Rambla, Placa de Catalunya etc we took the metro a few stops - same for Sagrada Familia although that is a bit out of the centre anyway so you'll always have to take the metro. Area around hotel is fine, not touristy which is good, we ate tapas round the corner which was perfectly nice. Supermarket next door is very useful. Breakfast plentiful and tasty. There is a little play corner in the lounge for young kids (has puzzles, books, building blocks etc) which is a nice touch. Reception staff speak English and were nice enough though we didn't have to test them by complaining or anything! So the main bad point about the hotel/apartments was the noise - not from outside, as it's a quiet area a little off the beaten track - but from other rooms. We were woken early in the morning by neighbouring rooms singing, talking etc, and people above us walking up and down. I guess you often get this in hotels but it was annoying as you sometimes want to be lazy on holiday and not get up at work time! That was the only thing which would make us think twice about booking again... that and the fact that you can't lock the room door from the inside and the lock generally seemed flimsy. I think if you had a mind to, you could probably get into the rooms without too much difficulty. Though maybe I'm being paranoid.

Also a balcony and a small kitchen area with 2 hobs a fridge, 2 pots and a frying pan, plates, cutlery and cups. There is no kettle or microwave, so if you have children who drink formula milk you may have to get a kettle out there or use the pots instead. The staff at the front desk all spoke English, gave us a map and highlighted the top sightseeing destinations on arrival. Some were friendlier than others but on the whole the staff were polite. There is a breakfast buffet in the morning with quite a good selection, eggs, bacon, toast cereal tea juice, fruit, pastry etc. We choose this hotel because it was supposed to be child friendly, but they put us on the 5th floor and any industrious child can easily open the balcony door as the handles are so low. They do have high chairs (but these have no straps) but on the plus side they do have a travel cot. If I were to grumble I would say that the floors were marble and quite cold and the lifts seem to like to trap any available body part each time you use it.

Just to give you an idea of its location, it was very central to Montjuic, Plaza de Espanya, Camp Nou, and La Rambla. Plus the fact that the metro station was only a block and a half away made it very easy to get around the city. See below for environs. The room was sparsely decorated but nonetheless exceptionally clean. I booked a triple room for 2 nights at 80 euro per night. The room contained 2 twin beds and a couch that converted into a bed. Other furnishings include a desk, phone, tv, nightstand, and kitchenette stocked with pots, pans, glasses, and flatware. The room also had a patio/balcony but the view left much to be desired. The bathroom was immaculate and was generously stocked with amenities including shaving and shoe polish kits. My only qualm with the room was that the heat was not functional. Luckily for us the days were quite warm and the room retained much of that heat throughout the nights. The reception varied throughout the day. At our time of checkin an elder gentleman was seated and looked non too friendly. I paid no mind as I understood the fellow probably knew no English as we knew no Catalan. At other times of the day younger receptionists manned the desk and they were very friendly and always greeted us with a smile. Other amenities include a bagroom where you can leave your bags if you arrive before checkin, and an elevator just in case you're all worn out from the day's travel. The media room had soft lighting, sofas, a 50+ inch plasma tv, and a computer with printer. Even though there was only one computer, getting online was never a problem as not much people were ever in this room. Breakfast was outstanding. Food selection included breads, cheese, ham, sausage, eggs, fruits, juice, coffee, tea, and milk. As mentioned earlier, the hotel is a block and a half from the Rocafort station. Right next to the hotel is a parking garage and a supermarket. An ATM is just around the corner on the same block. A 20 second walk past the metro station along Gran Via takes you to a wonderful Chinese restaurant, and a couple of doors down is a quaint Irish pub where futbol on tv is the main draw. Actually a 15 minute stroll down Gran Via takes you to Plaza de Espanya, which consequently is one of the stops of the airport bus to El Prat. This hotel was a great value.
