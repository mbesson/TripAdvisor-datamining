This hotel came up at a good price and in a good location so I jumped at it. We stayed between 26-31 march, and changed rooms immediately to a marginally better room. Ok..let's do positives. Location is great literally is less than 10 minutes walk from the colleseum, roman forum and many other sites. Also very near to the train/metro/bus station for ease of travelling around the city. The view from the 7th floor at breakfast was brilliant. Also the bed was actually surprisingly comfortable. Negatives... The room was very basic and in need of some serious upgrading. The walls were covered in scuff marks giving it a dirty feel to the room, the bathroom also felt dirty..the shower head needed to be cleaned by me before we could use it. This was after moving rooms because the first was even dirtier. Tv in room had a poor signal also..but thats just being picky as we didn't go to Rome to watch te tv. The lift had mind of its own..didn't like stopping on our floor as the doors didn't open and had to wait 5 minutes before it worked out that we did want to get out!! Overall, disappointing hotel.

The room was just as expected from the photos online, very charming and ideal for a short stay in Rome. Unlike other travellers we don't spend our time taking endless pointless photos of the hotel acting like we are professional hotel critics. We went to Rome to visit the historic buildings and to experience the culture of Rome, and spent very little time in the hotel itself. The bed was extremely comfortable, in fact we over slept breakfast on the first day it was that comfy. Breakfast was continental and an ideal starter for the day with a good view over the city.

Which I have to admit it wasn't. But at the same time this hotel was absolutely perfect for what we needed. We went on a weekend trip to Rome (Friday to Sunday), with a view of seeing all the sites & therefore never intended on spending much time in the hotel. It provided us with everything that we wanted - a comfy bed, a clean bathroom & breakfast in the morning before we went out. The rooms were very small, but came with a large wardrobe, a safe, a TV & a minibar. The bathroom was by far the best bit, it was large & very clean, with big fluffy white towels and a heated towel rack (which came in so much use as the weekend that we went just so happened to be the weekend that it poured with snow in Rome for the first time in 26 years..). The breakfast wasn't to my taste as I am not a fan of any continental breakfast to be honest but it had all the standard things & still had bits that I would eat & was enough to keep me going until lunch time. We didn't see much of the staff, but from what we did they all seemed very polite & friendly. When we requested an extra pillow & an extra blanket they were more than happy to help. One of the main points as to why I would recommend this hotel is for its location. It is within walking distance of a lot of the attractions, all except the Vatican which we took the Metro to & then walked back. It is right next to the Termi Station also, so even if you do not want to walk, you can easily get a bus, a train, a taxi or the metro to any location that you want. Also there are some fabulous restaurants nearby. If you read some of the other reviews, yes they will moan about the flakey paint around the hotel & the rickety old lift that can only hold 4 people at a time. But at the end of the day if you want a hotel that is relatively clean & comfy, in a very ideal location then I would recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cOk hotel for a low budget vacation\u201d", "Author": "RIR_2011", "ReviewID": "UR123802423", "Content": "The staff was friendly, cleanliness was average.

If you're carrying any weight or perhaps pregnant, you will not fit in! The cups at the bathroom sink are plastic and the complimentary shampoo etc are plastic sachets. There is no tea/coffee tray and the extremely small wardrobe had 3 hangers none of which would hold clothes of any weight. To be fair when we pointed out that we couldn't see anything in the room as so many light bulbs were out and the shutters on the window were firmly shut and would not open, the managment had rectified the problems later that day. Well, they replaced two of the bulbs and had eased the shutters out! The buffet breakfast is just ridiculous. You get to not only go fetch your meagre breadfast fare and take it to your plastic table, you also get to go find your cutlery,cups, plates etc. And you won't have to spend too much time choosing your breakfast. It is dismal pickings with undrinkable coffee from a machine, extremely suspect orange juice again from a machine which is a radioactive red and a choice of one type of cheese and two of ham which remained unchanged throughout our 4 day stay. The surly staff, particulary the older lady, thumped around the room with a plastic carton taking away the used plates etc. THIS IS NOT A 4* HOTEL and I would love to know how it gets away with declaring itself as such.

We found a very good deal online so the value was fine, but had I paid more I might have been disappointed (except with the location). Upon arrival we were planning to take the train to the termini station. However, when purchasing tickets we were offered a shuttle bus option that would take us all the way to the hotel for only 1 eur more per person than the train (thus 15 euros per person). We waited for 5-10 minutes max for them to fill up the shuttle bus and it turned out to be a very comfortable option - plus the sightseeing was very nice on the way to the hotel! The name of the shuttle bus company was italyrent and the driver was very helpful telling us about the sights that we passed. On our way back to the airport we took the train, the termini station is really about 100 m from the hotel (if you come out from the station and see a Mc Donalds, you can see the hotel sign a bit further down the next street on the left. The train was fine too, but do note that it's a long way to the platform from where you buy the tickets so don't leave it until the last minute. Upon arrival to the hotel before check-in time we were given our room. The tourist tax needs to be paid upon arrival even if you've paid the room beforehand (3eur/room/night). The room was quite small, but this is to be somewhat expected of downtown hotels in European capitals like Paris or Rome. It did have a certain charm, though, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The room showed wear but was clean and the airconditioning was fine. The pillows were very hard and the breakfast was a real disappointment, though. There were basic things like bread with jam or cheese/ham but nothing was really appetizing. There was no fruit! The hotel also didn't have an iron. There is a small grocery store between the termini and the hotel, we bought drinks and fruits that we stored in the minibar. A big grocery store with an excellent cheese selection (we bought loads to bring home as very cheap) can be found if you continue the same street past the hotel, 50 m and around the corner. The location was great for walking around the city and taking the bus and metro. On 2 evenings we took the bus to Trastevere where they had a festival by the river ( the Noantri had passed and we didn't catch the name of this one, but they said it would continue for all August) There were booths selling all kinds of things, bars and restaurants that were set up like at a festival.

INITIAL IMPRESSIONS - The hotel is old style glamour with a bit of wear and tear - loved it. If you want a modern, all singing, all dancing expensive Intercontinental, then go there. (pay for what you get) STAFF - The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. If you're pushy, as Italians are, they will treat you the same, we were very relaxed and they were very helpful, letting us know about all the best places to go, etc. ROOMS - they are comfortable, not huge, but perfectly adequate if you're using it as a base for travel and sleeping. The bathrooms are \"cosy\" (I'm 6 foot 2), but how long do you need to spend in there! Aircon is on the gentle side (fine in April) - suspect a little bit inadequate for hot summer months. Yes, you can here a bit of noise from other rooms, but most hotels are like this. TV is just Italian channels and the fridge is sparsely stocked. No WIFI. BREAKFAST - good rooftop views, breakfast is generally cereal, bread rolls, meat, cheese, boiled eggs, juices, tea/coffee, etc - as much as you want - no fruit, but certainly hardy enough for setting you up for walking Rome. SUMMARY - it is a quaint, reasonable hotel located very close (2 mins walk) to Termini and is ideal for using as a B&B. If you want SKY/WiFi and the full Monty, then pay more and go to a modern chain hotel. The 4 stars maybe misleading depending on what you want - but remember this is Europe rating and not UK or US.

The air con did not work (it was pumping out heat!!) and we could not sleep as when we opened the window it was TOO loud! I rang mgmt and they gave us a fan. The next morning I went down to reception and spoke to the manager - I explained that the hotel advertises air con and we could not sleep due to the temperature in the room last night. The manager explained that the system can only heat or cool the air and can not be switched over on a daily basis (due to it being an old system). He also explained that the weather we were getting was not normal and temperatures should only b c14 degrees in April - and to be fair this was a valid point. He told us to pack our bags, go out to the city and enjoy our day and he would move us to a new room. That he did, we moved to the third floor, a big room with two windows, one of which was facing the quiet street so we could open the window. We had no issues with our new room and we even had the fan transferred from our old room (the old room was like a box room compared to the new one!). In general we were happy with our second room but i would have been extremely unhappy had we not moved (watch out in high season as hotel might not have capacity to move room). The breakfast was terrible really, we went up our first morning and didn't go back but hey, for me that was not a big issue. The location of hotel is good, you can walk to the centre of Rome in 15/20 mins.

Could never expect such a small bath tray in any 4 star hotel!); The area of this hotel doesn't appear really safe at late nights; terribly old television sets in room; empty fridge (never expected from a 4 star hotel!); over all quality is just of a 1-2 star hotel!", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria UK", "Title": "\u201cNOT A 4* HOTEL BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION\u201d", "Author": "KelCumbriaUK", "ReviewID": "UR90149597", "Content": "The location is about 5 mins walk from the Termini station which I thought would be an advantage but was in reality terrible - very dirty area.

The room we had was tiny - barely enough room to walk around the bed, no tea or coffee making facilities, only 1 plug, only 1 drawer and missing light fittings. The bathroom was the width of a shower tray and when you were sat on the toilet your knees were touching the wall! The TV was ancient and there was no wi-fi - which from a \"4*\" hotel should be standard! There was also absolutely no privacy at all as every single sound made could be heard in other rooms. We could hear the people in the room opposite coughing loudly, and every time someone used a hairdryer or flushed the toilet it could be heard as if it was in our room. The other residents made a lot of other noise which made it impossible to sleep for at least 2 nights of our stay, as there was literally no soundproofing anywhere in this place. The cleanliness wasn't great either. There were dirty finger prints all over the door handles etc, and the bathroom floor hadn't been mopped. The beds were made everyday however, although I don't know whether clean sheets were used everyday. Breakfast was basic but bearable - if you're not fussy.

We arrived to a hotel that didn't look nice from the outside, but appeared nicer inside from the extensive use of marble. Staff were helpful and pleasant and our check-in was swift. Our rooms were very small and the bathrooms tiny. One bathroom was so unclean the room had to be changed for another with a smaller bathroom, which seemed of little bother to staff. The showers in both bathrooms were minute. The decor was traditional Italian, with marble bathrooms. Neither extractor fans worked, causing very hot rooms. Walls were thin, we could hear the neighbours 'activites' throughout the night. Both safes in the rooms had problems, sealing belongings inside them. These issues were fairly quickly resolved by staff, again who seemed untroubled by the inconvience. Beds were stripped with clean sheets and towels every day, no complaints there. However there were no tea making facilities, all of the television channels were in Italian (despite paying 10 euros for a remote with the promise of English channels) and the door to our rooms didn't lock at all. Breakfast was a different experience completely. It was served on the 7th floor, the top floor of the hotel but thankfully there was a lift. The continental breakfast seemed very meagre and the breakfast staff seemed to be watching your every move. The bread rolls were tough and chewy, the milk and fruit juice powdery and the hot water either lukewarm or boiling hot. The pastries were certainly enjoyable, but when our group took a few wrapped in napkins to take with us for the day we were greeted with very frosty looks from one particular member of staff. The following morning the same thing happened, although he paid closer attention to what we were taking from the breakfast counter. He also studied the napkin parcels that were on our table, watching where they were. As we left the breakfast room on the 3rd day he peered into one of our groups handbags presumably to look for the offending pastries. It wasn't until our fourth and final morning when he told us that 'cakes were not allowed out of the breakfast room', though for a hotel that does not provide a lunch or dinner service, let alone a bar, it was unfair to only provide a limited breakfast. He seemed particularly unhappy about the 'cakes' as many other members of the hotel had noticed and were doing the same thing. The coffee bar on the ground floor was not opened at all in the five days that we were in the hotel, and nor was the alcholic bar on the top floor. When two members of our group ventured up to the top floor to relax on the balcony with a glass of wine they found the floor to be locked with no access available. Although reception staff were friendly, helpful and spoke English, their good manners were overshadowed by the resentment from the breakfast staff. The lack of facilities made for an uncomfortable stay which shouldn't have been. Rome itself was very enjoyable, lots of sights to see and bus trips to take.

With so many scathing reviews, I was prepared for the worst, even laying some money aside to change hotels if really necessary. But it wasn't that bad. Starting with the positives, this is literally a stone's throw away from the main station (Roma Termini), which saved a taxi fare on arrival. It's also near plenty of other attractions - I walked around the City almost all of the time. It's five minutes from the Opera, a good fifteen-twenty minutes walk to the Colusseum and a similar distance to many other attractions. The area that the hotel's in isn't dodgy as such, but it's certainly not one of the nicer areas of Rome. I put it down to being near a train station - in London you'd probably have much the same thing in a similar location. Now the negatives... many people on here had complained about bedbugs or over starched sheets. Not one to take chances, I brought along my silk sleeping bag liner and used that on the bed, so I can't comment on it. But to the hands, the sheets did feel quite chemically treated. It certainly wasn't the same as 4* bedding I'd seen in other hotels during my trip. The only thing which really annoyed me on this trip - many on here had complained about tiny TVs in the room. I was stunned to find a 32 inch flatscreen on the wall of my room, but couldn't find the remote. When I went downstairs to ask where it might be, I was told that I'd need to be a 10 euro (refundable) deposit to use a remote control as the televisions were so new. Out of principle, I refused to pay this. I was still able to operate the TV manually, but this meant getting out of bed to change the channel or volume so I didn't watch it that much. This was a really pointless policy of theirs which is another thing which I am certain a 4* hotel (or even any hotel with a sensible business model) wouldn't do. The facilities were OK, but again, not 4* standard. The room and hotel generally were relatively dated, but some of the furniture in the room was nice (solid wooden desk with inlaid marquetry), if you appreciate that thing. The bathroom was a mild disappointment. Perfectly functional and with marble walls/floor, but the age/condition overshadowed the very use of such material. The soap dish in the shower was rusty and the dimensions of the bathroom were slightly inconvenient. The complementary products were fairly basic; you might expect a bit more from a supposed 4*. The thing is, due to the deal I got online, I was only paying about \u00a342 per night for this hotel. I think I got what I paid for. It certainly wasn't 4* and I think if I went again, I'd happily go for a 3* in the same area.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "sunchaserLondon", "ReviewID": "UR49722270", "Content": "Not sure if I stayed at the same hotel as the other people who have written negative reviews but thank god I took no notice and booked this hotel.

HOTEL: First I would like to say that we were with a tour guide who made the reservations. The hotel was old and not safe at all. I feel that the pictures of the hotel on their website are very deceiving. I stayed in a room on the 6th floor that looked like an attic room. It was very small poorly lit and dingy. The window was very small and the TV did not work. We had no mini bar, no air-conditioning and no amenities. The bathroom was also not very clean and the \u201cshower\u201d (nothing more than a plastic insert) leaked. My friend who was staying on a lower level was staying in a room that was equally dingy but was much larger and had a large window. The lobby was okay, but there were no bellmen to help with bags and we had to haul our luggage up 10 very steep stairs to get to the front door. The elevator was very old, slow and malfunctioned several times while we were there. To make matters worse, one gentleman in our group was locked in his bathroom all night long. He pounded on the door for hours but no one heard him (he was the only one staying on that floor apparently). It wasn\u2019t until the next morning when we were all leaving that someone noticed his absence and went to check on him that he was let out. Thank goodness there wasn\u2019t a fire or an emergency! I felt so sorry for his situation. The hotel didn\u2019t even say sorry just said they would \u201cfix it\u201d which I doubt they will do considering all the other broken items in the hotel. SERVICE: Poor. Check in was easy but the staff was surly. No bellmen. No room or laundry service. INTERNET: None. RESTAURANT/IN ROOM DINING: They serve breakfast on the top floor which had nice views but was very sparse. SECURITY: There was no safe in my room. No doormen to watch who came in and out of the hotel and of course the faulty door. The building also creaked horribly and I would doubt it would pass a safety test. OVERALL: I would not recommend this hotel to anyone! It goes beyond not being comfortable; it is a big safety hazard. Don\u2019t let the 4 star rating fool you. Our tour guide said that the rating system in all of Italy is not on a uniform scale and it is very hard (especially with older hotels) to tell if a rating is true or not.

However, it is out of proportion to the general size and you might actually find yourself with more room to manoeuvre in the bathroom. Generally this space was quite attractive to behold but both w.c and shower unit seemed a tad flimsy, needful of some very careful handling. Living space is well ventilated and quiet with the windows shut. There\u2019s also a safety deposit box in the wardrobe and a fridge .All the same, it is a little lacking in such niceties as extra coat hangers and kosher looking room keys.

Another minus point mobility -wise is the fact that this seven floor building has but one extremely cranky lift that is apt to give up the ghost if more than four people jump in.

A rooftop garden and operational bar area -advertised online- were incidentally no where to be found .However, there are a number of excellent \u2013and delightfully unpretentious- restaurants in the neighbourhood; the trattoria directly across the road is deservedly popular with guests.

That\u2019s a result frankly, as breakfast is not the Champagne Palace\u2019s strong suit. Juices (selection of two-wow!) were like water and coffee (from a machine) like tar. The freshness of the limited fare was questionable and any guest who fancied something as luxurious as say, yoghurt would have been up a gum tree. In addition, crockery was apt to be chipped and key cutlery items were not always available as and when required. All in, I\u2019d be keen to stay in this super-central area of the Eternal City again .Its proximity to Termini can hardly be topped plus the 45 minute link between there and Fiumincino Airport is a great boon. However, I think I\u2019ll be checking into the more promising Albergo Meditteraneo in nearby via Cavour-what a foyer!-and urging fellow Rome lovers to swerve a pricey option that\u2019s very far from palatial.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "bratislava", "Title": "\u201c10 sqm rooms in this 4* hotel!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bublina", "ReviewID": "UR8029645", "Content": "LOCATION: Hotel Champagne Palace is situated near the Termini Station.

This ain't no shangri-la for your Roman Holiday. This is not what discerning travellers would call a four star hotel! Instead there are a number of very specific problems with this hotel that you should be made aware of before parting with the considerable sum of money you'd need to stay here. A lift which can only accommodate four people is not sufficient for a hotel which has seven floors. It frequently broke down, leaving elderly guests to fend for themselves. A buffet breakfast was of quite the poorest quality I have ever witnessed and certainly not befitting of a four star hotel. Staff who were plainly running late were surly when people turned up at the official opening time and dished out chipped plates and glassware. Hot drinks were like dishwater. I am not satisfied that the fare was fresh and was served up with such bad grace, I ultimately chose to breakfast outwith the hotel. And there is NO coffee shop or bar within the hotel, contrary to publicity material on every online site I read. The maid service was woefully slow \u2013 it was the norm for a room to lie unattended to until well after 3pm. Why does a four star hotel consider this acceptable? Safes malfunctioned all over the hotel with great frequency, proving impossible to open. Desperate guests were forced to contact reception who then charged them 10 Euro for the privilege of having these opened with a key. Tripadvisors - be aware that that staff stated that they could not be held responsible for items that went missing from the safe! Have you ever heard anything like it? The staff's attitude to problem solving leaves a lot to be desired - here is a good example. I had a specific problem with my WC which needed attended to. I complained twice and was assured a plumber would visit the room and if the problem could not be fixed I would be moved to another room On returning to my room after a day trip, the situation had worsened. It quickly became clear to me that contrary to what I had been told, no-one had been near the room. When I challenged the receptionist, he admitted that he had lied to me. The proprietor who is very much worth a watching then told me that she was unable to move me because the hotel was full. After a heated discussion, I was eventually moved. The scenario I described could so easily have been avoided and represents a level of hassle I do not care to deal with on holiday. We have a case here where problems are not dealt with and guests are being lied to. And the same guests are paying over \u00a3100 a night! I have been visiting Italy for more than two decades.

I've been to Europe in the summer, and air conditioning in Europe isn't what it is in the U.S. I vowed I'd never go back to Europe in the summer after that trip - only when it was cooler, which is why I opted for a spring trip. This hotel was clean, breakfast was good and the staff was friendly. The only drawback, if you will, was that there was a flight of marble steps going up into the hotel, and a very small elevator that only holds 4 people (without luggage). It was close to restaurants and shops, and 2 block from the train station, so we were able to get around very easily. I felt safe walking around at night, too. The rooms were small - like that you'd get on a cruise, but we didn't spend much time in the room - too much to see and do in Rome! The only drawback was that we had luke warm to cold water in our room, and no hot showers, but that was only one room - the others in my group all had warm or hot water.

We had nice clean rooms, hot water, lockable doors. The TV was fine - there were English channels - BBC World, Sky Cinema 3, CNN and about 25 other channels to choose from if we so wished. All with excellent reception. But hey, we never went there to watch TV, we wanted to see the sights. Breakfast was fine, in a rooftop restaurant with a fine view of the city. Adjacent to the restaurant is a bar and lounge area, also with excellent views. All in all a very pleasurable experience. The staff were always smiling and courteous - we never had a problem getting a taxi, simply ask the desk clerk and he or she will ring one for you and it will be outside the door the moment you step out of the door. The room was fairly small but this is typical of European rooms but they weren't cramped and there was plenty of room to walk around. There is a fridge but no kettle but with so many cafe's and bars around it wasn't really missed. Each day we came back to the room about 6.00pm to find that the maid had been in and straightened or changed the bedclothes and put new towels in the bathroom. There was plenty of bathroom accessories including a hairdryer, shampoo and showergel sachets as well as blocks of soap. You will be told that the area at night is one to avoid, but the hotel is on the corner of a very busy street with lots of shops and bars and restaurants very close by and at no time did we feel threatened or unsafe. as long as you are careful and stick to the well lit main roads you will be okay but then that could be said about any city at night. All in all a very pleasent hotel, situated in quite a busy built up area - yes it is noisy but the windows when shut, block it all out.
