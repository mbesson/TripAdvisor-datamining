The room has a sofa but is not closed off from the sleeping area but I was still able to sleep while my husband used his laptop so that worked out good. The free breakfast was great with a wide variety of items including the hot waffles, hard boiled eggs, various cereals, bagels, and buns with all the side items like cream cheese etc. Free newspapers were available as well and there was plentiful seating. There was a helpful woman who kept everything clean and supplied in the area. The pool did have the overflowing water bucket area for the kids and a small slide and water toy. Beware of the $1.50 per day charge for the safe. You have to ask for them to remove the charge if you don't use it. They told my husband they would refund that amount on my bill but I'm wondering whether that will happen.

I was a little leary after reading some of the reviews of the unfriendly staff but decided to go ahead with it as it was the best value for the accomodations--one room that could accomodate 6 people (not too easy to come by) for $200, including taxes and the breakfast. Our overall experience was positive. We arrived early and asked to check in. While the front desk staff is not the friendliest, they did accomodate us with an early check in. The room was clean and spacious. While the hotel is not in the thick of the OC happenings, it is a SHORT drive from all the action and there are plenty of eateries and stores within walking distance of the hotel. The pool was an added plus. Unfortunately, they have a potentially very nice play area in the back of the hotel with basketball hoops and swings but the area was obviously neglected--swings were broken, grass was overgrown, etc. It's a shame they don't maintain it better. This did not interfere with our stay at all since we weren't even aware of it before we got there. I did hear one pretty upset guest complaining about the staff at the breakfast--which was completely overcrowded. It's a very basic kind of spread--don't expect much more than cereal and fruit as the line for the other items is crazy long.

Now, I've been a member of the \"Choice Rewards\" program for many years so I am familiar with this chain. However, I had not stayed in a Comfort Suites. We were pleasantly surprised. The property is well-maintained. Outside, in addition to the pool area (closed now), there is a picnic area with a grill and tables, playground, horseshoe area and basketball net. We took a nice stroll around a small pond. Inside, there is a game room and exercise room. Our suite was very nice. It was a bit smaller than we've had at other \"suites\" hotels, but it was quite sufficient for our needs. Everything was in good condition. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were terrible. We will bring our own if we need to stay here again. Good shower however I felt like I couldn't rinse the soap off; later I realized that it was not the soap but the fact that this area has very soft water that makes you feel like you aren't rinsed off. Wifi is available but very slow. Microwave and small refrigerator are available as is a coffeemaker. There is not an actual kitchen area (no sink, stove, etc.) as we've had in other suites. Breakfast is included in your room rate. Our breakfast choices on Sunday were outstanding. Scrambled \"eggs\" (not real eggs) and bacon (perfectly prepared) in addition to the continental offerings. Coffee was hot and abundant. Good selection of pastries. Monday was a different story. According to the gal at the desk, the guy that was supposed to do breakfast didn't show up and she was doing the best she could. \"Eggs\" were flat rounds meant for a English muffin. Bite-size sausage accompanied the eggs. Both ran out quickly. She was doing the best she could. We hoped for better on Tuesday but the meat offering this day (along with the same flat egg rounds) was a mystery. Sized for an English muffin, they were pink and tasted like Spam. Seriously, Comfort Suites, Spam? Just very disappointing. The only employees we encountered were those at the front desk who were all warm and friendly and the man who did breakfast on Sunday, who was very present and efficient. (I think it was the same person on Tuesday but he was not as visible, we only saw him come out from the pantry area to replace the coffee.) Locally there are a number of restaurants and shopping areas. To my husband's delight, there was only one building separating us from Dumsers Dairyland, so we did take a few walks there so he could get his favorite ice cream. From this location, you can be in Ocean City in minutes, so for a family that wants a beach vacation but doesn't want to be right in the thick of things, this is a good place to stay. We would stay here again if the need arises. I did expect the room rate to be a bit lower (we paid $69.99 a night) since this location is a few miles from the ocean in West Ocean City, and it is the \"off\" season.

The drive to the beach takes less than five minutes, if there is no traffic. It is close to the OC Outlets and other shopping venues. Check-in and check-out were satisfactory. As to the hotel, it was fine for our family's needs. Since there were five of us, I requested a rollaway bed, to accommodate one of the children. However, we didn't spend much time in the room. The breakfast was adequate, similar to choices offered at other hotels in this star category. The outdoor pool in this hotel is wonderful for the kids. In fact, as we were pulling into the hotel for check-in, my wife and kids couldn't believe we would be staying here. We only spent a few hours, in the pool, as most of our time was spent lounging around on the beach. There is a picnic area in the back of the hotel with a small kids' play area; it's nice for younger kids. We didn't try the fitness center or the business center. The price was certainly less than the rates being charged, closer to the beach. And, the hotel was newer than most properties lining the beach area.

This hotel is a five minute drive to the beach and it will cost you a dollar an hour to park at the beach. The pool in this hotel is great for children. The pool is sectioned off so that the small children will be out of of the way of the older children. The water slide was a hit for young and old. The water snake is great for the older kids. My girls spent hours in the pool which by the way has a lifeguard at all times. We found some great end of the summer fashion steals at the outlet mall across the road. If you can believe this I found a Marc Jacobs bathing suit that sold for $160 retail and I paid $29, also a Ralph Lauren infant bathing suit that was retail at $54 an I paid $3, both were fashion steals at Marshall's.

This place was in a good location but if you want to stay right on the beach this is not recommended. We as a family liked this spot very much as it was somewhat out of the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk and the night life. Very convenient to the to OC strip and easy to navigate to other areas around. This was a great family hotel. We did not take our pet to this hotel but we did see other families with their pets. The staff was good to the pets and even offered treats at the desk. Overall our 4 day say was great and did not have any problems at all. The only thing I had a problem with was leaving.

It took 3 weeks and many overdraft charges to get the hotel to reverse the charges and give us back our money. I will not stay at this hotel ever again. The cleaning staff couldn't speak English, so we had a hard time making her understand what feces was. There were many dogs here as well, when we were having breakfast one came by all wet and proceeded to shake himself off right next to the diningroom, how disgusting, we were bit up by what I assume were fleas.

We originally had just booked one night (Saturday) at the Dunes Manor, but decided to come down one night early. I booked the jacuzzi room with the fireplace and it was very nice/romantic. This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and they have some great off-season rates. Our room was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. The employee at check-in didn't have much of a personality, but the woman who checked us out was quite friendly. The breakfast was average, but not bad for a free breakfast included in the rate. One of the previous reviews docked the hotel for it's location. The hotel was in a perfect location for us as we were going to both Assateague Island and Ocean City. I wouldn't select this hotel as a 'resort' if you are looking for a one week stay in Ocean City because you would often have to battle the Route 50 bridge traffic into town (note that there were construction signs up saying that work would start on the bridge this week and that the local paper said that it may last until Memorial Day - one lane in each direction closed over the bridge). However, this is a great off-season choice or for the traveler who might just want to spend one or two days at a hotel in Ocean City (and don't care about not being 'at the beach'). This hotel certainly beats most of the dumps in Ocean City!", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "beachymd", "ReviewID": "UR17657219", "Content": "Just returned from comfort suites ocean city and had a wonderful stay.

We had a first floor double queen suite near the lobby. The room was tastefully decorated and had two queen beds, desk, chair, dresser and TV, then a half divider with a sitting area with a sofa and coffee table. The room was equipped with a coffeemaker, complimentary coffee and tea, a microwave, a small fridge, hair dryer and iron and ironing board. There is a safe in the room that you can use for a cost of $1.50 a day. The bathroom was quite large and the entire unit was very clean. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate is available in the breakfast area 24 hrs. The hotel has a game room for children (coins needed) and an exercise room for those over the age of 18. There is an outdoor pool only which was not open yet for the season. Ice machines are provided and there are a couple of vending machines as well. The included continental breakfast was quite ample offering sausage, eggs, bagels (both mini and regular), juices, fruit, donuts, donut holes, coffeecake, rolls, english muffins, white and wheat breads, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, applesauce, 3 different cereals, make your own waffles, mini pastries, coffee, tea, hot chocolate. One of the best continental breakfasts I have come across. The entire hotel is very, very clean and bright. Wireless internet is provided free of charge in the rooms and worked great. Also no problem using cell phones. Lots of restaurants nearby and is right next door to Carrabba's Italian restaurant. Across the street are the Ocean City factory outlets and about 5 miles away is Assateague with the wild horses. Cross the 50th street bridge (now under construction) and you are on the Boardwalk in about 2 miles from the hotel. Luggage carts are provided for your use in loading/unloading your belongings. TV reception was a little weak, but we weren't there to watch TV. We had a room that could be used as a connecting room with the one next door and the only problem we had was with the people in that room. They were very noisy at 5:30 am each morning waking us up so I don't know if all rooms would have that problem or if it was just the fact that they could be adjoining rooms and the door replaces the wall for that purpose.

I stay here when I work with the fishing boats at the harbor and probably spend 30 days or more a year here. Up front, it's not cheap in season, but nothing here is. Out off season, the prices are very competitive for the quality of experience, in my opinion. It's not at the beach, but there is a park and ride down the road a half-mile:$1.00 fare good for the whole day. That saves a huge hassle of driving into town (especially if you're not familiar with the traffic patterns there), looking for parking while dodging the other vacationers crossing the street. Maybe not so convenient if you want to walk from your motel room to dinner, but there is a Carrabas within short walking distance, and many restaurants on US 50 close by - including an Outback, Applebee's, Sakura Japanese steakhouse and sushi, Marlin Moon Grill, and several seafood restaurants around the harbor. Dumser's ice cream is a conveniently short walk for dessert. Food Lion supermarket and CVS drug store are within walking distance on Rt. 611. I find the motel staff extremely friendly and helpful, but this may be because I spend so much time here. The motel is smoke-free, although the air freshener is a bit overwhelming. Wireless internet in all the rooms and a work desk and chair are convenient for business people. Being off the main drag I find it more peaceful and conducive to relaxing or getting work done. If you find yourself in town during Senior week (high school seniors), bike week, or car show week, and want to avoid the noise all day long, this is a nice, relatively quiet option. Free breakfast with waffle makers, scrambled eggs and sausages, as well as pastries, bread, bagels, dry cereals, coffee, hot water for tea, juices. Coffee and hot water for tea (and tea bags) are available in thermos carafes all day along with a milk dispenser. Coffee maker, small refrigerator and microwave in some rooms (all the rooms I've stayed in, not positive if every room has them). I've always found the rooms, common areas, and grounds clean and neat - at least as clean and neat as you can be with guests tracking beach sand and kids around. Small workout room with a limited selection of machines, video arcade room, washer and dryer are available.
