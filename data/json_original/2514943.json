This was our first visit and we could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Hotel Galileo. We came in on the red eye from Chicago at 7am Paris time. Upon our arrival at the hotel (midmorning) we asked if we could store our luggage and freshen up in the restroom. Not only did they graciously receive us, they also checked us into our room about 30 minutes later, which was far above and beyond our expectation. I realize this depends somewhat on the availability of the room, but it certainly also speaks to the personalized service provided at this property. The room was quaint and clean, exactly what we needed. Overall this hotel has great charm. The mattress was very firm, but as we only stayed two nights this was not a problem for us. We did not have a chance to eat downstairs, but overall the hotel seemed very well kept and managed. The woman at the front desk assisted us with a map and recommended many wonderful sights to see. She, along with every staff member we encountered, was incredibly kind and helpful. I must also say that the location of this hotel is incredible. About 1.5 blocks from Champs Elysees, and just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe. We dined and shopped very easily within just a few blocks, and walked to many monuments and points of interest. The George V Metro stop is extremely close to Hotel Galileo, but the weather was so fantastic that we opted to walk. This was without a doubt the best way to see Paris for the first time. I highly recommend this hotel, and very much feel that it deserves the wonderful reviews it received thus far.

The room was surprisingly large for Parisian standards, plenty of towels (good quality) in the bathroom and a good stock of bathroom amenities. The bed was confortable and heating was ok (not to hot, not too cold). The room was quiet. I also appreciated the (American style) coffee maker with coffee and tea.

They were extremely knowledgable and were able to answer pretty much any question I asked - or knew who to ask for the answer, they booked tickets to the shows I wanted to see and also helped me out where possible knowing I had an injury to work with.
