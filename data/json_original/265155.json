I called 5 times and she was never rude and she always answered my questions. We were still a little hesitant about staying there. On the way to the Resort, we got lost and the Property Manager guided us right to the Resort over the phone. She was very polite and even though it was about 4:50pm she took her time and read through all the material with me. She also had given me her cell phone number if anything was not right. The stay was perfect and we are going back for Thanksgiving. The Resort is a little far out, but the stay is well worth it. We felt as if we were still at home. The apartment was huge and clean. I would recommend this Resort to all of my friends and family.

It is nothing like any of us were expecting. We stayed in a 3 bedroom 2 bath villa. It was okay. There were a lot of roaches and the place reeked of moth balls. Upon arrival I had to wash all the towels and rags because they smelt like mold. It appeared someone had washed them and didn't let them dry all the way and then put them back under the cabinets. So first night in, I am already doing laundry. Upon check out, There is a notice on the door reading that we must wash and dry all soiled/used bedsheets, towels and wash and clean all dishes. Now the dishes I can understand. However, I did not come on vacation to do all the bedsheets and towels that we used. We are paying a cleaning fee and I would assume that would cover this. Our rental agreement said no such thing, but in big bold letters on a note attached to the door it specifically said this must be done prior to check out. I already had to wash this stuff when I arrived. No way am I doing it when checking out also. And they expect you to wake up on check out date and clean, wash and check out prior to 11am. Are you kidding me? Also upon arrival, It is 82 degrees in the home, the fridge is unplugged and so now I must plug it in and hope that is cools off all the food that was purchased. The hot water heater is not working, Oh that is because that is not plugged in either. There again on that nice bold letter attached to the door it says when you leave to unplug all appliances, turn the air to 82 and unplug the fridge and open the doors of fridge/freezer. Again, Are you kidding me? We did find the lake, It was quite large. But you need to bring your own boat or kayak. No fish were biting, We were told by a local resident you need live bait. We are in the middle of no where, No bait shops, no boat rentals. This is NOT a resort. This is a community of villas and town homes that just has the word \"resort\" in the name. It was quite a disappointment. The Tiki bar that was mentioned to us upon booking the place-Well it's there but no one works it. There is no liquor or beer or anything served at the pool. In fact, The same local we saw at the lake informed us that the staff hours had been cut and they worked only M-Friday for 3 hours a day. So good luck finding any help. There are tennis courts, volley ball courts, basketball courts, ping pong table, and pool table. However, You must have your own stuff to play. There are no tennis raquets or balls, no balls or sticks for the pool table, and so on. I am quite disappointed in what was supposed to be a nice Fathers Day retreat.

We arrived on a wednesday night having flown in from london gatwick, this was not our first holiday in the orlando area we have been frequent visitors since 2003. First up, the guys on security are first class, really helpfull, we had booked our accomadation direct from a villa web site and the owner of the condo, having looked around at prices we were suprised at how cheap (for uk) the condo seemed to be. We paid \u00a3500 for 2 weeks and having looked around could not find anything to match the price. I hoped that like all people do the price was not going to mean that the place was a dive and the pictures were from 1977, but no, the condo was spot on. Very clean and plenty of space, nice on suites and everything we needed for the holiday. You will find however that you are out in the wilds. It is a good 40 minute ride in the car to 192, and although the map makes it look like haines city is close, it is not, that's at least 30-40 minutes away as well. Ponciana is the closest town and its not bad, we found the cheapest fuel around at $2.99 a gallon (cheap for us brits) at the local publix, but ponciana is still in the throws of development, it does have a walmart and a publix and a dennys and a few of the other type shops like a pizza shop a chinese a couple of banks, but none of the other regular restuarants yet, and as has been the way in orlando & kissimmee for the past 10 + years there are road works on most of the roads locally. I cant say why some poeple have given this resort a bad review, I can only tell you about my stay, this place is great, nice and clean, yes the linen in our condo was not egyptian cotton, but it was clean and so was the condo. Price wise you cant go wrong here. there are 2 pools and an outdoor jaccuzzi, only one of the pools were heated but that was fine, we swam in both, tempreture was around the high 70,s most of the time, oh and yes there is a lake, its not been really well sign posted and the road from the reort to the lake looks new, but its stunning and well worth the 2-3 min car ride to have a look, there are also nature trails and if we had had more time I would have hired a bike to ride about on. If you have kids and have a budget you cannot go wrong here, it's just the traveling to and from 192, the theme parks and eating out that takes a little longer, as the fuel prices are so cheap in the us it was not a major factor for our family, we tended to go out for the whole day rather that return to the condo mid afternoon. So I can recomend this place highly, the only bad bit that we came across was the people in the resort reception, they were less than helpfull (our experiance) as we didnt book our condo through them it had very little impact on stay.Very happy to speak with anyone regarding this stay.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kissimmee", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting!!!\u201d", "Author": "gatorfan1710", "ReviewID": "UR8005026", "Content": "Check in is at 4 but the office closes by 5:30 so we called to tell them that we would be a late check -in.

It worked for about 40 minutes. Another phone call to Carmen (the manager) and we were told where to find keys to another unit. Our second unit had a working air conditioner and more updated furniture so we were thrilled...until we found the bathrooms had no towels, no toilet paper and were never cleaned! Our third unit was nice. The units are old and poorly constructed. (shower door wouldn't open, floors creak on 2nd floor). It is a 2-bedroom villa for the price of a hotel room but I would recommend staying elsewhere. No general store, ridiculous continental breakfast (little debbies), no watercraft rental, not friendly, and definitely not 3 stars.
