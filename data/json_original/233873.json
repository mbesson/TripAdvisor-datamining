From the moment you arrive, you're met by a friendly and accomodating staff. The rooms are very large, totally new and spotlessly clean. A tasty continiental breakfast is included with your room. The management takes real pride in the place and I can't recommend it too highly", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Maryannoz", "ReviewID": "UR39631311", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location. Train, Bus, Tram very close although we didn't bother using any, we walked everywhere. We found to come from the Tegel Airport by bus it was easy to get out at Karlplatz stop and then walk up Reinhardstrase to Friedrichstadtpalast and the Hotel is just around the corner. We even walked up Reinhardstrase to the Central Station easily with our luggage. If you are looking for a luxurious stay this hotel is not for you, it is a basic hotel, good beds, fluffy white towels, buffet breakfast with good selection breads, fruits, ham, cheeses, cereals. Staff very friendly and helpful. The restuarant was not open except for breakfast and there is no facilities for tea/coffee etc. or laundry/ironing. Could do with little extra's in room like soap, shampoos etc. It is has two backpackers either side of hotel and the noise from them is quite loud in the early hours of the morning. We did use the internet at one of the backpackers daily. There are a lot of restaurants/cafes/supermarkets around the area. We used a small takeaway around the corner for tea/coffee which was very cheap. A lot of hotels nearby probably offer more for the price.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kmn727", "Title": "\u201cBest kept secret in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "kmn727", "ReviewID": "UR21536569", "Content": "This hotel is quiet, clean, friendly, reasonably priced, and in a great location.

Clean, efficient, and unfailingly friendly. I needed some special help and the staff went out of its way to provide it. I would have felt like I was imposing at a bigger hotel, but at Dietrich-Bonhoeffer the staff shared my joy in resolving the problem (hint: passport). The bathrooms have soap but you need to bring shampoo. Comfy chairs in the lobby to sit while you cruise the free internet. Breakfast typically good, and they served me early so that I could eat before heading out for an early flight.", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest deal in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "scarlett_reinhardt", "ReviewID": "UR4158949", "Content": "Wedged between clasy Friedrichstrasse and bustling Orianenburgstrasse, right in the heart of East Berlin, this is probably your best deal in Berlin.
