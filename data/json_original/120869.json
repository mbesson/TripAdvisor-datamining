All three of us slept in the room this evening. When we woke up all of us noticed small bite marks on different parts of our body. After getting a shower and getting into the car I slowly realized just how many bites I had on the drive back home. I was covered in bug bites. The bites were large and swollen on me and little concentrated red ones on my girlfriend. I checked my body when I got home and found 35+ bites on my scalp, eyelid, forehead, arms, legs, back, chest, and so on. Due to the severity of the bites and my swollen eye I went to the doctor who confirmed that these were bites and most likely bed bug bites due to the pattern of the bites and the location where I got them. I brought this to the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention at the hotel that proceeded to get the room checked for evidence; he called to tell me that they checked the room and did not find any trace of bedbugs. The manager I spoke with kept blaming it on bugs outside in the streets. I explained that we were no where else to get the bites and that when we entered the room no one had any bites and 8 hours later when we woke up all three of us had the same bites. I further explained that they could be fleas or something but something in the room bit all of us in an extreme manner. The manager was no help and was accusatory. I eventually got put in touch with a claims department who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer service was even worse than the manager at the hotel. I explained that I am a platinum member and have never filed a claim or made a formal complaint before and I stay in Marriott hotels over 200+ nights a year for 4 years now. I was still treated like a liar. No manager would ever show me proof that the room was checked and cleared of bed bugs. I forwarded the claims department photos of both my bites and my girlfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bites along with a doctors bill and prescription bills for the visit after the hotel stay. I was refused any payment for my belongings that I discarded before getting back to my home. In the end Marriott treated me horrible. The management staff refused to pay for the bag that I had to throw out and the change of clothes that we threw out. I wanted my experience to be heard so that future customers can no what to expect from Marriott regarding their handling of a situation such as this. Keep in mind that I am a high level Platinum Elite member and this is how I was treated.

We were going to make a reservation at another hotel because we were not familiar with this property, but decided to \"go with the flow\" and stay where the couple suggested. We are so very glad we did! The hotel was in the most perfect location. The Security Center (where the wedding was held) was a short walk away, perhaps a block. We felt safe walking around, even dressed up for a wedding. Canal Street was a block away. Bourbon Street was within walking distance. Cafe du Monde was within walking distance. The aquarium was within walking distance. Mother's Restaurant (divine) was within walking distance. In fact, we parked our car at the hotel on Friday and did not need it again until our departure on Monday morning. Although the hotel charges $26/day for parking, what we saved on gas and the stress of trying to park in a city more than made up for the fee. The humidity in this town was almost unbearable, so the convenience of a quick walk to Walgreen's and CVS on Canal Street for a hair de-frizzer remedied that issue! The hotel was extremely clean and quite. There were no obligatory hairs in the bathroom. Also, they provide Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner. I was really impressed by that! Our room had no view, but we didn't come to New Orleans to stare out the window of our hotel room. The air conditioning worked perfectly and was quiet, even though I kept it set at a steady 66 degrees. We were sad there was no room service, which we like for breakfast. Several restaurants deliver, though, and the front desk was more than helpful by offering menus to these restaurants. Only four stars were given because of a problem with billing on our last day. The final bill was under the door and was incorrect. I called the front desk at 4 a.m. and the man who answered (who claimed to be a manager) told me that I had made the reservation on December 13, 2011 and that was the rate I agreed to. I explained that I didn't even know there was going to be a wedding in December (we actually made our reservation in March 2012) and would have had no reason to call in December. He curtly told me that the computer showed that I had called and that is all there was to it. I asked him what I called about in December. He replied, \"How should I know? You were the one that had the conversation!\" I realized I was getting nowhere, so spoke with a different manager upon our 8:30 departure.

We booked two rooms, one king for 2 and one double for 4 through marriott's website and rates were approx 220 and 260 per night including breakfast. Parking is valet and was approx 30 night. Check in was fairly painless but tried to give us two kings so had to remind them that needed a double. No mention that my package that was preshipped had arrived. The staff member was having several different conversations with several different people while trying to help me. Went to the rooms. The double was fine. The king was the smallest room I have ever stayed in (smaller than rooms in europe). I went down to inquire about my package and asked about the size of the room. The clerk responded that I must be in a room ending in 14 and that they were the smallest in the hotel as the are really just an adjoining bedroom to the corner suites. No offer to change room. (Not to be snobby but why would you put one of your elite members in the smallest rooms in your hotel? So much for inspiring brand loyalty) During this conversation, the clerk was having other conversations that she initiated with other staff members and other guests walking by. Late that evening, I decided to go for a walk and eralized that I left my jacket im my car in valet. I went downstairs and the lobby was empty except for 4-6 staff members in the lobby joking around. I had to ask who the valet was. After explaining what I needed, they went back to joking around. Finally, about 5 minutes later, another valet went and got my jacket. Rooms were nice and comfortable. There was toothpaste on the door jam in our room. It was a nice clear green color that was easily noticeable about 3 1/2 feet up from floor next to the sink. Did not hear any noise. The king room was in the backside of a little hallway which was block by maid cart. Although the maid saw us lifting or luggage up and carrying sideways to get through, she made no effort or offer to miove it. Breakfast was included in our rate so we went down for breakfast. The breakfast is in the lobby where you order at the counter. You basically get your choice from the menu which is somewhat limited. The food was decent. Service was horrible. we were not sure we were in the right place and waited at the counter to ask. The girl working the counter does not talk to you or recognize you until she is ready to.

I rated this hotel average because the facility is nice and as a general rule, service is poor in New Orleans.

Housekeeping were not stingy when giving us extra towels. The hotel also had a whirlpool hot tub that we used during our stay. Perfect for those long days of walking. The only drawback was that you have to make sure to put the Do Not Disturb sign outside or else housekeeping will try and enter your room in the early morning. We were surprised at this considering we got a knock on the door at about 8am. Also, the buffet breakfast was a bit expensive considering the area has plenty of places to eat for much cheaper - and better. We liked the free coffee and tea though.

The staff was also very nice...... laid-back, casual..... but nice. I am not a very demanding traveler. I just want a clean room in a safe convenient location, and this fit the bill. If you are downtown for a conference, YOU MUST GO OUT AND SEE THE 9TH WARD!!!!!!!! Downtown is totally put back together, but you are not getting remotely the whole story of the city till you see outside the downtown area!!!!!! I was at a conference but took a break to tour the 9th ward and it was one of the best things I did on the trip.

The location absolutely can't be beat for watching the parades! We'd head out, set up out chairs, come back in and have a cocktail at the bar and when the parade began to start, we'd head back out. In addition, the hotel always had coffee and tea available to guests, which came in really handy on those icy cold February nights! They also have a little 'store' which came in handy for those late nights when you just HAVE to have a Snickers bar! The staff were all very friendly. I think housekeeping was a little overwhelmed by the large numbers of guests, but they were always polite and did a good job. The front desk staff were also very helpful and friendly. We never made it down in time for breakfast, but heard other guests speak highly of it. My husband was especially pleased with their gym. They have all new equipment; treadmills, elipticals, etc. He is usually disappointed in hotel gyms, but said this one was the best he'd ever used!
