If you do not speak German and are not familiar with the city, you should first check with the maps and find out about the location. It appears to me that this property \"fills up\" later than other Holiday Inns in Berlin and rates are economical even at the time when some West Berlin properties are full. The new airport may change the situation though, from June 2012. In terms of public tranist, the hotel underlines that it is just one tram ride from the City East. But for further connections, change of tranist mode is usually necessary. The surrounding area is typical East German housing construction, \"Platbauten\", overhauled for the contemporary demand. The main door of the hotel is at the rear side. For a late evening arrival the situation may be baffling. There is an entrance on the main street side as well, but it seemed to be closed part of the day.

We booked early and paid 120 Euros for three nights. We were not expecting much for that price but instead we got a priceless travel back in time. The hotel is nowhere near any usual tourists\u2019 landmarks but being located in the middle of a working class area of former East Berlin it gave us the opportunity to grasp a feel of how it might have look before reunification. Apart from big international corporations\u2019 billboards, the area appears very much like on DDR \u201cideal workers cities\u201d pictures. We\u2019re not sure whether ideal and concrete boxes go well together but for three days our massive concrete box hotel offered us a spacious, comfortable and clean room where we slept tight. Despite an effort to mask the hotel recent past with a coat of paint, in our standard room, a few details like the shower curtain, anti-slip mat, toilet pan, etc., were bearing the vintage East Germany fashion hallmarks, and we liked that. We had the choice of a smoking or non-smoking room, which is becoming a rarity these days, and it feels good not to be treated like Pariahs sometimes. There\u2019s also a free parking and best of all, the staff at reception, despite sometimes not having a clue, were very friendly and welcoming. Finally, although the hotel isn\u2019t in a tourist area there are three tram lines stopping a few steps away from it and taking you to the city centre in about 20 minutes. You can buy tickets at reception, and if you have the time, use the three lines to get a glimpse of different areas but make sure you take a walk in the vicinity of the hotel.

Except for this minor detail of no sleep, the hotel provides good value in a very expensive city.

It is a ripoff at 13 euros per person specially if you do not eat dead animals or unborn birds. But then there is no other choice around the hotel. So the hotel has got you captive.

Room as well as the bedroom looked clean enough so no complaints there either. I noticed that every time I passed a person on dutie inside the hotel, there was always a friendly good..something. A positive thing as I must say. In the morning breakfast was served in buffet style on the ground floor from 6am to 10:30am. The way it was presented was pleasant to see. Only, where was the coffee? Probably inside the white thermos can in the middle of the table but who knows for how long it had been standing there. Also missed the eggs service, I've seen some hard boiled ones and scrambled passing along the buffet. So that had to do for that day. Besides that everything was in order during my stay. One advise though, don't pay extra for booking the business room because of the free WIFI. It only allows you to log in with one single device only. So if you connect with your smart phone, you can forget about using your laptop or any other device after that. It probably connects the log in data to your devices MAC address.

Get the tram northbound, in the direction of Zingster Stra\u00dfe or Eiesaer Stra\u00dfe. Get off the tram at Landsberger Allee, walk towards the Renault car place and you should be able to see the hotel's three towers rising above you. Now for the review: The first night, we had the misfortune to be a room nestled in between the rooms of an Italian school trip. Our entire floor as well as those above and below, the noise was ridiculous, shouting, screaming, smashed glasses, slamming doors. We complained at 8PM but we were told there where no spare rooms, but they'd move us again in the morning. We complained a further 3 times that night and finally got given a new room in the business building at 2am as well as 2 free breakfasts, which were pretty good. The hotel was clean, although our sheets and duvet weren't changed on the third night. The facilities are pretty basic, by no means 4 star, 3 star at best, but we had everything we needed, including a kettle in our newer room, TV with CNN and a bunch of German channels, shower room and the beds were very comfortable. All the extras are pretty extortionate, drinks from the vending machine are around 2 Euros, there is a small bottle of water in your room you'll be charged 3.50 for opening. The location isn't too bad, it's right in East Berlin, so it's got a kind of Eastern Bloc feeling to it, which I liked.

The hotel is well run, clean and so forth. Rooms were recently updated over the past several years and have been kept in good shape-- at least on the high third tower we stayed. Beds are comrfotable. Decor is reasonable. Housekeeping attentive. Common areas are well kept. Restaurant has a reasonably priced lunch special. The location is hard to reach withou specific Tram directions. Take subway to Landesberger Allee station then take one of two trams several more stops to within two long blocks of the hotel. We did not know thise however... despite calling the front dek... so if you're not certain of the Tram on day one-- grab a cab from the hotel directly across from the Landerberger Allee station. (Note: Good Internet Cafe located on North side across from Tram stop next to a very busy Gyro place.-- it's the only one in the area and will save you the very expensive Holiday Inn rate). The Tram service is very convenient once you lighten the load of bags. You're about 8 stops from Alexander Platz -- maybe 15 minutes in rush hour and you are very happy because you have a spacious clean room while other people are paying lots more money in cramped tiny rooms near there. Of course you are living in the East German area but who cares. You've got foresight becausee you purchased the best deal in town-- the 30 Euro 7 Day unadvertised on the flyer--you have to ask for it-- Subway/Tram/bus pass to all zones around Berlin. You zoom around town using Alexander Platz as your base and connecting to the Tram to go home. All because you read it on Trip Advisor right here. Ok-- so things are going well. The breakfast buffet is pricey but worth it a couple of days and you're eating with the locals in Alexander Platze the other days.. so who cares. The key to this hotel however is the rates. When you check in MAKE SURE YOU CONFIRM THE RATES WITH THE FRONT DESK. Otherwise, as happened to us.. THEY CHARGE THE RACK RATE REGARDLESS OF YOUR RESERVATION. IN FACT, THE SALES MANAGER FREELY ADMITS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE AN INTERFACE WITH THE HOLIDAY INN ONLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM. So the approach this hotel has to put the ONUS ON YOU TO PROVE that you have the rates you say you have. This lead to quite a startling bill at the end of the stay-- nearly 300 Euros in over charges, denials from the front desk staff, the manager on duty and the sales manager that they had our original rates and a copy of the original reservation and meantime-- were' running to catch a flight. Not a problem. I whipped out my laptop and showed them the daily rates and-- to their credit-- they did revise the rates back. However the Sales Manager-- who I asked to look into why they didn't have the correct rates in the first place never returned any follow up e-mails or inquries as promised. So clearly this is the modus operandi of this hotel. SO MAKE SURE YOU REVIEW -- NOT WITH THE FRONT DESK STAFF BUT THE MANAGER ON DUTY-_ ANY ONLINE CONFIRMATIONS OF RATES BEFORE YOU START YOUR STAY. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TOP MANAGER\"S INTIALS ON THE CHECK IN TO CONFIRM THE RATES AND THAT YOU RETAIN COPIES OF ALL YOUR ONLINE RESERVATIONS. Otherwise.. it will be rack rate for you. It really is unbelievable that the staff cannot soften itself to reach out to the public. The only thing worse then a staff that charges \"any old rate\" is the a staff that's in denial and disarray about what rates to charge-- then put's the onus on customers to produce in a big rush what rates there were. Plus it seems to be endorsed all the way up the management chain. It's time Holiday Inn Corporate took a look into this situation. And thus a 3-Plus star rating for the property and value falls to a 1-star on the basis of poor management of finances.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cValue over location\u201d", "Author": "Kenny-Lyle", "ReviewID": "UR46782863", "Content": "As a frequent leisure visitor to Berlin I always look for value over location.This in part due to the wonderful public transport service that Berlin provides. The hotel is in the former East and as such does not have a S Bahn or U Bahn station within walking distance. There is however, a tram stop within 5 minutes walk with a service direct to Alexander Platz running every 5 minutes during the day. The hotel is a typical former East German concrete edifice with two wings and not the easiest on the eye.However, the rooms are large and reasonably up to date with flat screen tv and adequate air conditioning. Staff were pleasant enough and spoke fluent english. The main deficiency is the lack of any shops,restaurants and bars within the vicinity of the hotel. Not an issue really if you are fed and watered adequately on arrival. As with all ICT hotels I have stayed in , the breakfasts are inordinately overpriced however.15 Euros per person did seem vastly over charging taking into consideration the room rate of 50 Euros. Overall I would probably opt for one of the Express properties nearer the city centre next time. Small gripes I would say for a city that I still class as one of the most fascinating and enjoyable on the continent.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "aw2010", "ReviewID": "UR23422248", "Content": "I booked this hotel for a 3 day break to Berlin with my partner.

The room was spacious, clean and amenities good. There is a German Bistro type restaurant on the ground floor, as well as an International restaurant. There are other facilities there although we did not try these.

I chose this one because it offered a good deal (3 nights for the price of 2 in a 4-star hotel) and because it seemed to be well located. Well, on both counts my choice was wrong. First, the hotel looks really ugly. Big (three towers), unpersonal, no room service, no air conditioning, poor choice in TV Channels, no shower products (just a gel for hands, body and hair....), and my room looked really gloomy. Things in favour of the room: it was clean, it had a fridge and some cutlery. But then I hadn't booked a studio, so it was quite useless. [NB: I cannot comment on the breakfast as I had chosen not to have it at the hotel. Indeed, it's normally quite easy to find nice bakeries in Berlin where to have breakfast for very low prices. However, it wasn't the case with this hotel as it is located in a residential area] As for the situation, the hotel is just close to the crossing of two big roads. As I were on the sixth floor, I wasn't too bothered by the noise, but I all the same had to sleep with the window closed. Regarding its location, it is in a \"residential\" area of East Berlin, that is, insereted between apartment towers, with no shops or restaurants close by. The surrounding are a bit gloomy (big bars of apartments) if you are there as a tourist. Well, at least it's relatively easily accessible with public transportation and you can reach a S-Bahn station in 10 minutes with the tram, which is by the way running all night. The hotel is relatively close to Friedrichshain and Prenzlauer Berg, two areas with lots of nice restaurants and places to go out. So what's the conclusion? Well, I expected better from a four-star in Berlin. During my last stays, I had been two 3-star hotels that were much more beautiful and well situated for comparable prices (the hotels were Agon Opera in December 2006 and Agon Frankfurter Allee in April 2007). In the end, I would not recommend this place unless you really just looking for a place to sleep. But then what's the point of booking in a 4-star?", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, a little out of the way\u201d", "Author": "djpalmer32", "ReviewID": "UR8612198", "Content": "My partner and I stayed here for three nights.

I threw it in the bin and mentioned this when we checked out, the woman at the reception was sorry about my discovery and said that something like that should not happen. I agree but didn't let this ruin my holiday mood. During our stay the weather in Berlin was hot and so was the room (24h), as it did not have any air-conditioning. Furthermore, the drapes did not darken the room efficiently so it got quite light in the morning. The buffet breakfast was great, there was nothing missing and the empty plates were replaced efficiently. Checking in and out were done without much cordiality. The hotel is not situated as well as hotel info lets you to believe, but you can get around quite nicely with trams that stop close to the hotel.

Very handy to the tram line though - about 2/3 minutes walk - and this took us directly into Alexanderplatz. Trams run quite late into the night so it's fine getting back to the hotel after being in the city centre.
