Anyway, keep in mind to look for a key posted at the entrance, by the front door, for each registered hotel. The hotels that don't have that key are illegal!!!Hotel Veneto can be good or bad; depends from where you look. It has advantages and disadvantages like everything else in life.The best thing is of course its location - in the middle of everything, close to every main museum or objective made you came to Florence (so, no need for taxi or public transportation...just a nice walk on the beautiful streets of the old town).For the ppl that don't know, the hotel has two buildings, one of them used in case of emergencies, when the main hotel is full. If you are offered a room in the old building, you can pass it and look for something else. Better to spend 25 euro more and stay in decent conditions. The only nice thing for the room in the old building is the person who plays the piano so wonderful. The rest is just a hard experience, especially for ppl used with a higher standard.The room in the main building, the one we've got, was ok except for the shower. Missing a bath tube, the water spread allover the bathroom and after shower you should fly in order to get out of the bathroom. The building is old and constructed in old Italian fashion, meaning that you can hear your neighbours chatting sometimes. It can be disturbing and quite annoying for the sensitive ppl of for the ones who would appreciate a nice nap during the afternoon, between two museum visits. It is true that the breakfast is lame, poor, but considering the prices anywhere in town, you can have your tea or coffee (especially if the Romanian young lady is on duty) and few slices of toast with butter and gem; better than nothing. I don't know how are the rest of the meals, because it was too hot when we've been there and ate only in the evenings, to the restaurant next door (food is excellent, service is excellent, prices a bit high for the portions you get, but you don't go to Florence to eat food, but art and culture, so...).The personnel was excellent since the first moment. Actually, we had a reservation to a hotel close by, which room was like a jail room, with toilet inside, smelling awfully. We ran away from there as fast as we could and tried to find something else according to our budget. The gentleman in the reception offered us a room for one night in the old building, promising a better one next day, in the main building. And so it was. We stayed for 5 days altogether but i never saw anybody smoking, especially the manager, Mrs. Maddalena, who was very kind and carry since the first moment. It is true that the place looks like run by a family and this thing makes you feel somehow that you belong over there, in Florence, even only for few days. You feel like being at home in the Universe.Bottom of line, for its price and stars, you get the best conditions you can get in Italy.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR546793857", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tinergetic"}, {"Content": "Keep Away of This Hotel!!

On the last day of my trip with another friend, my silver paper bag with some of my belongings (thank God they were of low value) were actually stolen in the room itself! We always make sure that our doors were locked before we went out. Funny enough, after a long day at 11pm, we unlocked our room door to discover my bag was missing. We confronted the receptionist about it and he called someone. This very unprofessional and extremely rude Italian lady (yes that chain smoker ppl are talking about), who claims to be in charge, came in and argued (what courtesy!) with us at first sight! Here was how she dealt with us:- always cutting in before we could explained clearly the problem. She refused to listen to us even when we do sound polite.- refused to believe our claims, defending and insisting her cleaners/staff are 'honest' without doing any proper investigation- extremely aggressive in her attitude towards us, cursing us in Italian and screaming at us- touched our belongings without permission when we allowed her to our room (no. 302 in a building across the main one)- she was already smoking a cigarette when she came into our room (we are non-smokers) and threw the cigarette out of our window in frustration, cursing a swear word in italian- told us to get out of the hotel (we had already paid for that night, and luckily it was our last night in Florence) in the middle of the night, us two young girls!- told us to go to the police station ourselves without helping us get a taxi - she expected us to return in 30 minutes after our complaint with the police, screaming that she had a child to take care of (without considering us foreigners alone in a foreign land where we could hardly speak a word of Italian, and it was already close to midnight)Our room was also in such a poor condition when we first came in:- frame of the door was weak and rotting- back wall of the cupboard had already collapsed- no fan or air-conditioner unlike other 2-star hotels we stayed in Italy, making the summer heat unbearable- TV had bad reception- security of customers highly in questionNote: We were told by the tourist information board that such hotel qualities are ILLEGAL in Italy! All these were very opposite their claims in their website, and is DEFINITELY not 2-star quality. It was also rather obvious that the lady's extreme and defensive attitude greatly weakened the hotel's reputation and heightened our suspicion in their involvement with the theft. After all, she claimed that only THEY have access to our rooms. We had reported to the police about the burglary that night. The next day we complained to the tourist information about this incident which you guys are now reading. Thankfully on that fateful night, we found another hotel nearby that had room for us.So PLEASE DO NOT stay in Hotel Veneto unless you want to risk getting your belongings stolen, highly unprofessional services or being cheated of your stay and what you paid for!!!!", "Date": "Mar 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR387556136", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Galaxnite"}, {"Content": "A terrible Experience I was visiting some european cities with my daughter for a month.I can't complain about almost anything.When you book a room at a hotel that is not 5 stars , you must be ready to deal with small, uncomfortable rooms, maybe not so neat,etcBut what I never expected was that a reservation made online, wouldn't be respected.When my daughter and I arrived to the hotel there was a young woman who wanted our passports.She wrote down some information from them and gave them back to me. After that I was waiting to get a room key and some information about breakfast , facilities ( hehe) etc.instead of that she just said SORRY BUT I HAVE NO ROOMSI couldn't believe what i justhad heard. I told her that i had booked the room a month ago.She said SORRY the hotel was overbooked, so i have no rooms.I was really upset and I told her that she would need to solve it right away because I wouldn't leave nor try to find another hotel.After she realized that I wouldn't leave she made a phone call asking somebody to get a room somewhere else.I told her that I wouldn't pay an extra dime for a room at other hotel, and I added that what she did , not respecting a reservation that was confirmed online was a bad mistake, and that I would complain.Her answer was that she didn't care and that nothing would happen if I complained to the webpage I used to book a room there.After some minutes, and for some reason she changed her mind.Suddenly another maid showed up and led us to a building not far from the hotel.The building was dark,dirty and the key to open the lift didn't work, until another guest opened it.She guided us to a room that was a complete mess, it looked like nobody had cleaned it in ages. The matress couldn't be worse, the bathroom was so tiny that taking a shower there was a nightmare.  I read the former reviews, so I don't need to add much more.As I said at the beginning of this review, you should expect almost whatever when you book a budget hotel room , but having problems with an online reservation should be a good reason for anybody, who wants to visit Florence, to avoid this terrible hotel.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR572955368", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ticherina"}, {"Content": "Your city-break in Florence will be badly damaged if you stay in this 'hotel' If by some bad inspiration you chose to stay in this place, you better try to visit as much as you can in beautiful Florence and make sure that when you get back you are very very tired so you can have a deeeep sleep without breathing. And this only if you didn't find another place to stay. Why? Because the rooms smell horrible, the door handles don't work, the light switches are broken, the TV is just a piece of decoration, the blankets are gnawed, the bathroom stinks, the pigeons are mating at your window early in the morningand the information they gave you at the reception is totally inappropriate, especially if you have a car. You have to feel extremely privileged because if you stay at hotel Veneto you get a discount for parking your car in the neighbor garage for only 20 euros a day (from 25). But if you somehow arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, no chance to park your car (even at the price of 20 euros) because the parking day starts at 1pm. Don't trust Fabrizzio! ..he's the guy who guards the welcoming hotel in the absence of someone at the reception.

When my friends and I arrived, we were led by a maid to a different place a block and a half down (on via aprile). The room was horrible. The door had been punched in the middle, and was cracked. If the door didn't have double layering, there would've been a hole you can look through. The shower in the bathroom was like a dripping faucet at times, and the hot water was more in between cold and lukewarm. The floor leading to the shower barely has a little dip, so you have to be careful not to let the water get all over the bathroom floor. The building that our room was in also had apartments and offices, so at night...the families would be really loud. Teenagers were playing in the hallway, and would keep knocking on our door, laugh and run away. During the day, while we were away...we would worry if someone would break into our room. Luckily, no on had. Given these conditions, it's obvious the room wouldn't be cleaned during our stay...and it never was. The receptionist (the chain smoker everyone mentioned) was decently nice, giving us maps and directions. She also let us keep our luggage in the lobby area after we had checked out. On the other hand, she really was distant...as if she was unhappy to be there. Overall, the location was great...but find some place better.

Two weary travellers, a friend and I were met at the train station by a cheerful fellow named Mario who held out a brochure and asked if we needed accommodation. Indeed, we did, and Mario may as well have had a halo for how much he resembled at that moment someone sent from heaven. But, unfortunately, Mario was the only bright and shining aspect of our experience with Hotel Veneto. Hotel Veneto is a family-run affair and I sensed that Mario just does his best with what he has -- a chain-smoking sister named Magdalena who apparently runs the place but who has all the people-skills of an irritated rhinoceros. Why this woman is in the hotel business escapes me, but I digress. As we walked from the station to the hotel, Mario caught up with us to explain that he'd phoned his sister and she had said she only had one room left for the night, and he was mortified by it, embarrassed deeply that the room he told us about at the station would not be the one we were given. However, we were still game, after all, how bad could it be, right?Upon arrival, Magdalena and several unnamed friends or family members were fairly perturbed to have their smoke-break paused. Instructions to go see the room and come back to the desk with our passports were followed, yet upon my return to the lobby, no-one was around to record the information and I was waved off, told to come back later by one of the unnamed family members. When I came back later, still no one was at the desk. They were all outside on the sidewalk, cigarettes in hand, and again, I was told to come back later.When, finally, the passports were recorded, we settled into the room - a crackerbox only slightly larger than the two twin beds they had crammed inside. Only one person could walk in this room at any given time. There simply was not room for more than one person at a time to be mobile. We began to understand why Mario was so embarrassed, but we had at that point not yet realized that the shower didn't work.If you wanted a cold shower, you could probably get about a tablespoon of water to come out of the shower head, no exaggeration. If you wanted a hot shower, well - ha ha - you had to go somewhere else, because there was no hot water. The shower was actually just an extension of the bathroom, not even a lip to keep any water that did manage to come out from running all over the bathroom floor. But, though we couldn't get water to run from the shower, other things ran. The toilet ran loudly all night, and I woke up to find a spider in bed with me. Charming.The end cap to this story is that, when we went downstairs to leave at about 6-ish a.m., Magdalena was downstairs, cigarette in hand. Are you staying another night? she rasped. We had only managed the first sound of our negative response, N--- and Magdalena had already turned around and walked off down the hall.
