Choose with Breakfast as I think it\u00b4s very good ! Easy to get to from the Airports. From Schonefeld, you can get the S9 train which stops at the station 150m from the hotel. It cost around 3 euro. Good location if you like to explore the Prenzlauer Berg area. Very good breakfast for this standard of hotel. A large range of bread, fruit, all the different things you need for your meal and some good cakes to finish off with! The breakfast room have a good size and I have never had a problem to get a table. The rooms are of various sizes, but I have always had a good bathroom in the rooms I have stayed in. I would like to have a flatscreen TV in the room , as they have stlll oldfashioned TV's. Maybe an internett connection with a cable in the lobby would also be better than current WiFi system.

I've stayed in quite a few budget hotels including Holiday Inn and I must say that this very hotel has exceeded my expectations. Room was just huge, very clean and the bathroom was something of a 5-star hotel. I used to judge hotels by bathrooms (and it seems like many other people too) and this is number two hotel bathroom in the list of nearly 30 I've seen. I did not try the hotel breakfast as I prefer to eat in my favorite places in the city, but I passed by the restaurant and it looks very decent. Among the down sides of this hotel I can only mention a few small things: quilt and location. The quilt is made of synthetic materials and therefore makes at night. As for the location - it's neither good nor bad. You'll have to take a tram (10 min ride) to get to Alexander Plads, which is not the center yet.

Personally, I cannot imagine how, with a tram stop right outside the door and an S-Bahn station 500m away, anyone could feel this was too far away from the Mitte, etc., its only a 10 minute tram ride to Alexanderplatz ! Downside - yes, the \"bistro\" is not great in terms of decor or menu but there are many good places to eat/drink a couple of tram stops away, i.e. within walking distance, e.g. Kollwitzstrasse, Knaackstrasse.

The hotel is a new property and the rooms are pretty big, roomy, with modern nice decoration, light slightly scant. The location is not great, but it depends what you are in Berlin for. If you are interested in the Eastern part of the city and the Museuminsel, then it is pretty good. You have one bus stop just outside the hotel, bus number 158, you can take it to the end of line (five or six stops), Michelangelostrasse and take the 200 from there, or the TXL to the airport. You can also use the streetcar, number M2 (frequency 10 min) , that leaves you in Hackescher Markt very near the Museuminsel. Or you can walk about five minutes north and take the streetcar number 12 (frequency 20 min) and it leaves you in Friedrichstrasse. So it is pretty convenient for the whole eastern part of the city. Not so for the western part. It is great to have one supermarket under the hotel and another one just in front of it but the area is not so great for restaurants. My advice: Take the streetcar M2 to either Kollwitzplatz (Station Marienburgerstrasse) or Helmotzplatz (Station Prenzlauer Allee / Danziger Strasse) and you can find plenty of places there. Otherwise the area where the hotel is located is in the north part of Prenzlauer Berg, full of Berliners but not many tourists. The hotel lobby is unimpressive, the minigym just adequate, but the breakfast is ok and the price is also good (paid 90 euros per night for a double room including breakfast through the holiday inn website).
