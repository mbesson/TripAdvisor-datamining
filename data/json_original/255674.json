The bed was very comfortable. Internet access was free (given my Marriott status) and I found the speed to be just find for using email and Facebook. I also has access to the Executive Lounge on the 30th floor, but only used it for breakfast. The fare was decent, offering breads for toasting, cereals, limited fruit and yogurt, eggs, etc. The location of the hotel is excellent and makes life easy. The property is steps from the Circular Quay train, ferry and HoHo bus stations. There are ATMs for 4-5 banks on the same street as the hotel. There's a McDonalds and Starbucks around the corner and a convenience store across the street. The Harbor Bridge, Opera House and Botanical Gardens are just a short walk away.

I also have to confess that I never choose to stay at a hotel whose windows do not open, and this was an exception on a night where any of my other choices in Sydney were full. I also paid a high room rate comparable to that at the Observatory so my expectations were perhaps higher.

I will start with the positives, because there were some. I liked the buffet breakfast, it was very busy but the staff were extremely attentive, the coffee was great, very good choice of fresh fruit, smoked salmon and cold cuts, cheese, sweet treats, chef who cooked some great eggs, everything you could possibly want in a breakfast buffet and more. I have no complaints about the staff at all. The pool area and gym looked great. The negatives for me was the terrible smell of stale cigarette smoke coming from the air conditioning system. It really was very unpleasant. The bedroom was of a reasonable size but the bathroom was really small and I felt it needed some upgrading and a little more industrial cleaning and luxury for the price. The bed was very uncomfortable, very hard and despite being very tired I found it very hard to sleep. It would be fine for people who love hard beds and floors. The pillows were good. The sheets were of reasonable quality but once again had the same sort of smell as the air conditioning. The carpet had several stains and patches of sticky stuff so I made sure I put socks on to walk around the room. The iron was of inferior quality as was the ironing board and not kept in good condition. I could not iron at all with it. The alarm had been left on by a previous guest so a 2am wake up call was not great either, but I perhaps should take some responsibility for checking this. The queues at the elevators at all times during the evening and most especially in the morning were really bad. Obviously not enough elevators for the amount of rooms. I wont even mention the check out queues!! This Hotel does have many airline crews and I wondered whether their sleep had been as bad as mine. I hope not!

This was followed with a complimentary bottle of wine. The bell captain assisted us with a Qantas luggage replacement and Abdul repaired another damaged piece on his own! Abdul then greeted us every day with a wave and collected both sets of luggage on our departure. Geoff at the valet desk greeted us daily with a smile and waited patiently with us when our car ride was an hour late--explaining that it was not normal in the Australia he lives in. We even met his family and were surprised to hear that he kept his wife informed of our wedding plans. Adam & Ben were terrific too. At the breakfast buffet Jenny, Viktor, Ashlee, Tim & Tatiana were wonderful. Jenny in particular remembered us and personally made us apple juice on our last day! This attention was only exceeded by the staff in the executive concierge lounge!! Roaslee & Johanna went out of their way to welcome us and make us feel like we were staying with \"family\". Both were sincerely interested in our son's wedding and gave us thoughtful gifts on our last day. Johanna even called our room to make sure we would say goodbye! Amazing! We looked forward to seeing them too, along with Jimmy, Aleen, Sally & Mariam. The maid staff also gave us conscientious attention, including helping with beach towels. Without question they are most amazing Marriott staff we have ever stayed with! As a Gold member we had daily access to the Executive lounge on the 30th floor and this too was amazing!! Breakfast, snacks, appetizers, desserts plus beer & mixed drinks were ALL included!! I had a great rate on the buffet so we usually had breakfast there but either was more than adequate. The Gym was a pleasant surprise for a hotel since it included free weights. Pool, hot tub & sauna were okay for a city hotel. We found this location to be ideal for seeing Sydney. The Opera House & Harbour Bridge, & The Rocks were right there plus buses & ferries are steps away at Circular Quay to go anywhere else.

From this location, the entire city of Sydney is easily accessible by foot, train, bus or ferry, to include the International Airport (accessible by train on the airport line). The Rocks neighborhood is a very short walk from the hotel, with many options for dining, drinks, shopping and so on (although we found the Rocks to be a little too touristy, especially while one of the big cruise liners was in port). The major tourist spots are also walkable from the hotel, including the Opera House, the Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Royal Botanical Gardens. Using our hotel as our launch point, we easily traveled to several parts of the city. We took the train from Circular Quay to Town Hall and explored the Queen Victoria Building and shopping area around it. Following dinner in Darling Harbor, we walked back to the Marriott - which took us about 30-40 minutes at a relaxing, post-dinner pace. The next day we caught a bus from Circular Quay (which is a terminal for many of the Sydney's major bus routes) out to Coogee Beach, then returned to Circular Quay from Bondi Beach on the bus (with stop on Oxford Street in Paddington for some high fashion/boutique shopping). The following day we took a morning ferry to Watson's Bay and bussed back to Circular Quay, then took an evening ferry to Manly to explore Manly Beach and the surrounding area. We really felt as though everything in Sydney was accessible to us from Circular Quay. Each morning, we thoroughly enjoyed breakfast and excellent coffee at a wonderful little cafe called Utopia, located right next to the Marriott (accessible either by taking a left out of the \"back\" door off the lobby, or following the alley from the front entrance). The woman taking our order remembered us by our orders the next morning, which is quite an amazing feat considering the place was always full of customers! You can either grab your coffee to go or do like we did and start your day by enjoying your coffee and a nice small breakfast al fresco-style just outside of the cafe. The hotel itself is everything I would expect of a Marriott. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable about the area, and helpful with all of our questions or requests. Large umbrellas were available from the bell-stand, which (unfortunately) proved to be very useful for us during our trip. We stayed in a standard room that had a city view (no Opera House/Harbor from our side of the building), and the room was very comfortable. The price of the hotel was more than I'd hoped, but in comparison with other options in the same area, the Marriott was on par or less than competitors at the same level (we stayed the week prior to Christmas 2011).

The Marriott is less than a 5-minute walk from the harbor and Opera House, as well as the hop-on/hop-off bus route and only 10 minutes from the shopping district. You're close to everything, including many great restaurants and bars. The hotel itself has recently been modernized and all rooms have somewhat of a minimalist, Scandinavian approach to decor. Rooms are not large but are adequate if you don't plan to spend all day in your room. On of my rooms was right outside the elevator and yet there was no noise at all. Some rooms have a nice view of the Opera House; others overlook the air conditioning system. You get what you pay for . . . be sure you understand what you've paid for. Was upgraded to a jr. suite which had a windowless separate bedroom and a sitting room that overlooked the harbor. The view is probably worth the price . . . the extra space isn't unless you have two people. The bath is modern -- some rooms only have a large shower; others have separate shower and tub. Everything is marble and granite and very clean. The concierge desk was extremely helpful - great suggestions for touring and dining. There was never a line and everyone wanted to assist whether you were here on business or pleasure. You can buy your hop on bus tickets here, which makes that tour quick and easy. The bell desk was also great -- prompt and courteous and always available. The concierge lounge is a nice perk whether your pay or receive it as a frequent traveler. A very large breakfast with American and European style food. There are heavy hors d'hoeuveres and drinks in the evening. If you're not from the US, be forewarned that the overwhelming majority of people there are Americans and, during tourist season, people going to and from cruises. The lobby bar had a great piano player while we were there -- a great way to unwind at night and there is absolutely no pressure to purchase any food or drink. The only thing that keeps me from givin the Marriott 5 stars is the front desk. Every single time I went there, day or night, weekend or weekday, there was a line. And, often, there were 4-6 employees at the desk but only 1-2 actually helping customers. I watched while one employee counted room key cards for over 5 minutes while 8 people waited in line. It's a large hotel and probably needs more people working the desk, especially during peak check-in and check-out times. There were other issues such as the keys not working (twice), etc. Overall, however, if you want a large, newly remodeled hotel with all the amentiies that is close to almost everything, the Marriott is for you.

This is not the case with the Marriott at Circular Key, other than the location which is excellent. When arriving, one would expect the bell staff to ask you for assistance with luggage, rather than chatting among themselves and trying to re-arrange the busy car parking in front of the hotel, being more interested in the 'flashy cars' than the customers. In fact, I received not once a greeting or a remote attempt to open a door. The receptionist other than over friendly (..how lovely and what a pleasure... ) did not make an attempt to alter the room in line with my requests for high floor. The assigned room was it! When stepping into the room, I found it rather on the small side but with an excellent bed and clean. My requests for slippers and bath robe (when booking on the Marriott site) were not fulfilled. Then I tried to ring reception. There is no such number. You have to ring for all issues number 9 and then you will be answered by some neither friendly or competent telephone attendants. What is most annoying is the fact the you are put into a waiting line, as if you would call from outside ...this is the Marriott blah blah. My first call was answered in over 2 minutes and I was told that the receptionist, which I wanted to speak to is for the reception duties and not for answering calls from guests, this is the telephone operator's task. At other times I waited again between 1 and 2 minutes, fastest about 20 seconds. The bath robes and sippers were then delivered (we do this always when the guests have settled in...?). No enlarging mirrors, no handheld showers and after a shower, the bathroom needs a clean up. No ever turndown service, despite the advice by the duty manageress, in 5 days. The staff either at the concierge desk, reception or else do not know how to great guests, or are not interested, insufficient training, a management issue. The hotel was previously the 'Renaissance' a 4 star business hotel (I stayed there some 12 years or so ago) and that is it, when you rate the place.

We had breakfast as part of the package and the spread was fine. The bread/pastry section was fresh and of very good quality and they even had a live counter for eggs and pancakes. They had all the usual breakfast fare including a selection of Asian cuisine. They were very prompt in removing the food at 10:30am sharp! The rooms were nice and the beds were very comfortable - something that you come to expect from a 5-star property. The rooms now have 42 inch LCD TVs too with satellite TV. As a Marriott Rewards member I got free WiFi which was very useful in keeping my child occupied with the iPad. The only grouse I have with the Rewards Programme is that they have so far, refused to credit points for this stay since I booked it through a travel agent (NOT an on-line discount website like Priceline or Hotels.com) and paid the same rate as the Marriott website. Not sure if I have the energy to fight them for it. If someone from the hotel or the Marriott Group reads this review, I hope they sort this out for me. In terms of location, the hotel is very well placed. A stone's throw away from Circular Quay, Sydney Opera House and The Rocks areas. So if you need to take a ferry to the Taronga Zoo or to Manly Beach, it's very convenient. Also, across the hotel are a few convenient stores so you can always buy your jujices/milk, etc. in case you are not on the breakfast plan. There are also some bars around the corner opposite Circular Quay which were always crowded and seemed very popular with the locals. You can also walk to the shopping district which is about 3 blocks away and we used to do this often with our baby (in a pram of course!). The Botanic gardens are also a 15 min walk so that's another useful option. They have a pool and health club too but we didn't use either. Room service was prompt though the children's menu was a little limited. The quality of food was acceptable but with so many options to choose from in Sydney, one really does not have to eat in the hotel unless, like us, you have a very young child and therefore room service is an obvious choice.

A less misleading name for the room would be the \"AMP Tower\" view room (we had a magnificent view of this grey monolith from all parts of the room). If you want a proper view of the Opera House you are better to go for the Four Seasons or the Shangri La Hotels which have better locations for getting a clear view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge and are closer to the Rocks precinct. If you are not happy with your view, complain straight away and demand a better view that is consistent with their sales representations. The mini bar had a half-drunk Gatorade (assume it was left by the previous guests) but when we took it down to reception they apologised and sorted it out. $5 for a small box of Pringles is absurd but what you expect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are plenty of convenience stores nearby which aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that good value either but cheaper than the mini bar prices.

The gym (open 24 hours) and pool were good but this hotel is starting to look a little tired in some departments, especially the bathroom (the toilet flush actually came off from the wall, the shower door did not close properly and the tiles were quite dated). The shower itself was nice and hot and had a strong flow rate but the room only came with one set of towels (tip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c take some extra from the gym on level 4 if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to call room service for more). When we asked about whether the room had a bath upon check-in, we were told that the newly refurbished rooms no longer had baths because a survey the hotel performed indicated that most people did not use them or have a preference for them in the room. This surprised us a little as we recalled seeing on the website that the Opera view rooms are meant to have a bath. To add to the confusion, upon entering the room it DID have a bath! I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that their website is entirely accurate about the amenities that come with each room so check carefully and hold them to it if what you get does not match what is indicated on the website.

Breakfast was pretty good with a wide range of choice (even had Miso soup for Asian tastes) and the staff there were in good numbers and quite efficient at arranging coffee, replacing popular dishes and clearing plates away. The breakfast cost $38 a head - convenient but not very good value. Free newspapers but limited range (eg no Financial Review). The official check-in time is quite late (3pm) but when we arrived at around 1230pm they were able to get us straight into a room which is always a plus. Bed was King size, firm but comfortable.

The hotel has 32 floors and is triangular in shape. There are rooms with 3 categories of view in order of price: Opera, Bridge, City. I believe that the Opera view rooms are also the largest, from the floor map. The room was very new and comfortable; large 42\" TV, splendid view over the harbour and the city, with the Opera and a few skyscrapers. The room was spacious, had a table, a little table, multiple chairs and armchairs, one footstool. Air conditioning was powerful and very quiet. The room (with window that can't open) was very quiet. The large king bed was comfortable. For Marriott fidelity card owners, internet was free 24h and worked very well both wired and wireless. One of the best rooms you can ask for in a 4+ star hotel. The bathroom was spacious, with both tub and shower, but it was quite old. Despite the contrast with a beautiful and modern room, the bathroom was still comfortable thanks to marble, large mirror and abundant space. But one thing is unexcusable: the shower floor. Instead of a ceramic shower plate, there is the old bathroom floor with little tiles. The floor remains very humid inside the glass contained shower, so that the floor appearance is not good, clean and healthy with mouldy grout. I arrived in Sydney from Europe and I got a flu (I was probably infected during the flight). So I extended my stay from 5 to 12 days. During my long stay everyone was very friendly and helpful: frontdesk, concierge, room service, housekeeping. They never failed; they always made it right. The breakfast buffet was very rich; there were lots of fruit and very good pastries. There also were some different flavours of yoghurt (plain, vanilla, different fruits) although no packaged ones. I was very happy with this hotel and its services. I also called the Hotel Doctor for my flu; she came quickly and was very kind. During my stay I also used the laundry service (everything worked fine, although prices are high). There is no self-parking, so the last day (when I had a rental car) I used valet parking. Just at the hotel entrance there is an AVIS office. I must say that I loved this hotel, excellent for its position and its services. I always had dinner from room service: the menu was large and varied, and there was one of the best pizzas I have ever had in a hotel. Since I got sick with flu and high fever for the first days, I had a couple of in room breakfasts. My room rate was inclusive of breakfast and it is customary for hotels to charge only a delivery fee for room service breakfast, when it is already included in the rate. The only thing that I really did not appreciate at this hotel has been finding room service breakfast charges in full. I sincerely though it was a mistake and asked at checkout whether those two charges for breakfast could be waved. I was firmly told that the rate includes breakfast in the restaurant and does not give any credit for in room breakfast. Obviously I was not happy and a modest discount was offered. I had 12 days at this hotel; since I had to extend my reservation during my stay, the rate I was offered for the last days was higher than the initial one; I used a lot of hotel services (room service, minibar, laundry, etc.) and I spent more than 5k$. I was astonished that they wanted to make me pay a breakfast that was already included in the rate, just because it was delivered to my room. It is not 60$ on 5600$ that make a difference, but this attitude of the frontdesk made me wonder whether they really value their guests' business.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "naperville, illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great staff\u201d", "Author": "imwmn913", "ReviewID": "UR120475660", "Content": "We stayed here Nov 6-10, 2011 using our points.

I had city views which was actually very nice - one side of the room was almost all window so the view of the skyline was pretty spectacular (even without the bridge and the opera house) although I was pretty high up (in the 40's floor). One thing to note about the renovation is that the flat screen TV is HUGE. I mean seriously huge - a bit ridiculous considering I didn't use it much. The money saved on getting a slightly smaller TV could have been put into the bed. A bit stiff and lumpy for my liking and at the price they charged, they should seriously consider putting in a big fluffy feather bed topper like they do at the Sofitel. The bathroom was a bit awkward in how it was laid out but it might have just been my room. The shower was behind the door which was a bit weird as I almost missed seeing it and at first glance I thought I only had a bathtub option. The shower is pretty small and I'm not a huge person by any means. A rugby player would find it uncomfortable but since I'm pretty tiny in height and size it was ok. As others have said before, sign up for the Marriott rewards which can be done online before getting to the hotel. I think you can even do it when checking in. By having a rewards account (it's free!) you get free internet during your stay. This really is a cost savings since the price of hotel internet access in Australia is highway robbery. If you are there on business and you need to do some printing, you can do print jobs at their business centre. The first 20 printed pages are free (no double sided printing of course). What the hotel made up in the renovations, it lacked in service and charm. Don't get me wrong, there were a few lovely people who worked there and were very helpful (especially the evening concierge). But a few bad experiences ruined the bunch. First the morning concierge was completely rude. If there is a queue, it is common sense to acknowledge the people in line, to say \"I'll be right with you\". People are more inclined to wait patiently. But the concierge did not acknowledge me and after standing there for 10 minutes I asked for a map so I can work out directions myself. He threw the map at me without a word. Thanks for the attitude mate. To round out the experience, I wasn't told (nor was it on my reservations) that my rate included the buffet breakfast upon check-in. I didn't know until I got the receipt shoved under my door the night before check-out and saw that the rate said \"including breakfast\". You would have thought that the person checking you in would tell you this. It's in your best interest to ask upon check-in so you don't needlessly pay for an extra meal. Would I stay here again? Yes, I would give it a try again. The rooms were spacious, clean and modern and the location is great. The location is close to the touristy sites since it's across the street from Circular Quay. Very easy to walk to Pitt Street Mall and the shops. Across the street from the train station which is convenient if you are a tourist looking to get on the city loop.

Sally Glen, a sweet Charming lass for Scottland and Jimmy Hofilena from the US were two of the best people we met on our trip. We met both on the wonderful concierge floor of the hotel. It overlooks Sydney opera house and the Bridge and is wonderful. Sally and Jimmy were both incredibly friendly and made us feel so much at home. Jimmy went above and beyond by bringing american flags for our 17 and 18 year old kids on the 4th of July. Sally and Sally both led the hotel in personal service. Rodi was also great and is a credit to Marriott. We stayed at a lof of hotels in our life but it will take a long time to top the wonderful service we recieved at the Marriot. Great timefor all.

As before, service was great. We did not eat at its restaurant at all because right beside the hotel is a good breakfast cafe. Additionally, there are many restaurants in Circular Quay as well as other parts of the city to choose from. Although we did not book an \"Opera view\" or a \"bridge view\" room, our city view was O.K. The only thing I wasn't comfortable with was there was hardly any storage space and no bathtub. I don't consider this a negative, though, since the room seemed newly-renovated and more \"modern\" than it was the last time I was here. One negative for me, however, was that the pay phone in the lobby wasn't working (there used to be 2 phones before). When I informed the front desk I was told that they had called the service provider several times, but they never came out to fix it. But this is no big deal because when you walk out of the hotel, there are 2 pay phones on the sidewalk - you just have to deal with the traffic noise.

I had booked a room with city view but took a chance and asked if they had any rooms with a view of theOpera House. That demanded an upgrade, an extra $40 a night but I reckoned it was worth it. I wasn't disappointed!! The view was AMAZING!! Couldn't quite see Harbour Bridge but hey, you can't have everything! The room was spacious, light and airy, soft tones, well-maintained, nice big spotlessly clean bathroom with all amenities, plenty of cable tv channels, and the bed was heavenly - quite literally the best night's sleep I had had in ages!! And of course, I saw the Opera House and that was a real treat. I showered and went diwnto breakfast - what an amazing array of hot and cold dishes, cereals, pastries, made-to-order omelettes and great eespresso coffee! Service was impeccable. As the days went by the waiting staff started to recognise me and would take the time to chat and ask me how my stay was going. Got loads of insider tips on places to see, things to do, and places to eat. The hotel is 2mins walk from the CBD, 5mins to the Opera House, 5mins in the other direction to The Rocks where the outdoor market is on Saturdays and where there are restaurants galore.

We sat down to have drinks and were immediately offered drinks. We asked if they had any fruit and one of the staff members ran off to go find us some apples and oranges, which I don't think was a very easy task. A really sweet woman named Josephine brought us drinks and couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable. She asked us about our stay, brought us snacks and drinks even during non- happy hour times. Another one of the staff members, a nice woman named Rosalee told us they were offering complimentary buffet dinners at the restaurant for Marriott Gold Members.

The breakfast buffet was a little overpriced, but such is the case with restaurant breakfast buffets, so you should be expecting that going in. The hot tub in the pool area was either not really working fully or someone had altered the settings because there was almost no jet action to be found and the water was tepid, at best. This wasn't a huge issue for me, but I do expect a better hot tub from Marriott. There was some wild remote-control type device so I assumed that someone messed it up with the keypad rather than it being a permanent issue, but I don't know. As expected, wireless access is fee-based and was not the cheapest out there at .50 AUD a minute. Australia was expensive on all counts, though.

The suite was absolutely stunning with gorgeous views of the Opera House. It had 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, one of which had a spa bath.

The suite is literally fit for a President, and I felt like a princess staying there. The Marriott also has a gym and pool/spa on the 4th floor. Both the gym and the pool are small but clean. And the spa is large, but requires a degree to turn on (it's not as simple as pushing 1 button). The Marriott's buffet breakfast is delicious and provides a great variety of hot and cold food. The only down side to the Marriott is the customer service. The room service food is good, but they got our order wrong (chicken instead of fish) and kept knocking on the door when they were told to simply enter. The parking attendants are also careless - I had my hands free cord ripped apart. Overall, I would give the suite 10/10, and customer service 5/10.

When I first arrived they informed me that their executive club was under renovation and an area was designated on the second floor for us to use. This was not good for me since I was traveling with 4 other business colleagues and we needed an area to convene. We were allowed to use the business conference center but it was a mess. Soiled table, used coffee cups, water bottles were strewn about. They have renovated their rooms in a minimalist, modern style which, in my opinion, was not very comfortable or inviting. Yes, you get a beautiful view of Sydney Bridge but a view without a comfortable room isn't ideal. No bathtubs in the bathroom, just showers. Wireless worked only sometimes. Wired LAN connection was broken. When I called to have it fixed I was directed to a third party customer service group who informed me it was my computer that was the problem! I knew this was not the case since I was able to connect wirelessly all week in other places. The breakfast buffet was the usual spread of fruits, cereals, eggs, meats, cheeses, cooked to order eggs and was very pricey at 34 SYD. The lounge closes at 11pm which was unfortunate. We all wanted to socialize for another 30 minutes and have a nightcap after a lovely dinner and we were told to go to a bar around the corner. Not something we wanted to do so we ended up retiring early. The exercise facility is very good and open 24 hours. The concierges were very helpful and always very busy between the 3-7pm timeframe. So, it's best to approach them in the morning or early afternoon when you don't have to compete for their time. Bottom line, I expect much better customer orientation for a high end hotel, charging high rates than what I got. Would I go back to this Marriott? Probably since I have a huge loyalty to Marriott.

I stayed in one of the newly decorated rooms with a view of the bridge and it was comfortable...bed was comfy - perhaps lacking in some storage when you are around for longer than a few days. Has a good gym and spa is good if not expensive; $70 for a pedicure as an example: a little steep given that I got another very good one about 5 mins walk about for half that so worth shopping around for spa treatments...the pool is lacking in any ambience in that it is inside a glass window with nothing to look at and you wouldnt be enticed to stay there. Mini bar food very expensive: there are mini shops across the road but they are equally expensive ($7 for small water and banana!) so if you are looking for snacks suggest a quick trip to Woolworths or somewhere to stock up. Food isnt bad is in the bar: ate in the restaurant only once and food was ok but not good enough for what you pay. bar staff very friendly as well as Adriana in the Spa.

In addition, I would question cleaning standards to an extent....I tended to notice that they would hoover around things as opposed to picking them up: and tidy away paper wrappers plus the bathroom sink never seemed like it was really cleaned and empty shower gels would be left in the shower every day. When i called to complain and ask about the standards, I was advised they would advise the Housekeeping manager and ensure it didnt happen in the future..but nothing changed. I also did get to the Exec lounge on one evening and the toilet there was so dirty I refused to use it - I did advise the staff again on that occasion...taking short cuts regarding cleaning is a major faux pas in my opinion but am wondering if this is the norm as when I moved to an apartnment, I experienced the same 'cleaning' issues.

The bell staff, the restaurant staff, and the man in the gift shop were very friendly and personable 4. The breakfast buffet was great 5. Dinner in the dining room and room service was also great 6. The room and bathroom were clean and newly renovated 7. The hotel was very quiet 8. The view from my room overlooked the harbor Opera house Here are three slightly negative things: 1. There is very little storage in these rooms. There is only one closet and it is on the small side. There was only one drawer that was usable. 2. We could not regulate the temperature in the room. The thermostat would not adjust. 3. The safe did not work. In fairness to the hotel we did not say anything to the staff about the thermostat or the safe so these items might have been easily remedied. Even without them working properly they didn't really affect our stay. Now for the one negative item: When I booked the hotel (through a travel agent who used a travel booking agency) I booked a wheelchair accessible room. When I got to the hotel they did not have me in a wheelchair accessible room. When the woman at the desk tried to change my reservation to wheelchair accessible room she discovered she could not do this because the floor on which the wheelchair accessible rooms are located was shut down for the week I was there due to renovations. No one had informed the booking agency that the wheelchair accessible room would not be available for the week I was going to be staying there. Even though the agency had reconfirmed my room a week prior to my arrival. To compensate me they moved me to a Opera house view suite. The room itself was great and is wheelchair accessible except for the bathroom. It made for an awkward three days using their bathroom. On the third day evening they installed a hand-held shower hose on the sink which made washing so much easier. To compensate me for their mistake they did reimburse me for my dinner meals and for two nights of my stay. They did not reimburse me for my breakfast because that was included in my hotel room rate. In my opinion the upgraded room, reimbursement, and the installation of the shower hose was adequate compensation and if I go back to Sydney I will have no problem staying at the Marriott again. I will just be much more vigilant about double checking that my room is wheelchair accessible. I recommend to all those who require wheelchair accessible rooms to check several times with your hotel to make sure that the room they have you booked in is wheelchair accessible.

Outside of lunch at the lounge and the usual breakfast and appetizers in the concierge lounge, I failed to take advantage of the kitchen's skills. The Circular Quay Marriott is a premium property in a premium location, but I would suggest keeping an eye on specials.

This hotel is an a great location, just a few minutes from the Sydney Opera House, Circular Quay, shopping district. You can even walk to Darling Harbour and Chinatown if you don't mind a good 30min hike. I paid a little extra to have the room with a view of the Sydney Opera House. Now that I know what the view is like (you see it from the back side of the opera house), I recommend you save the money and just walk there and see the real thing. The quality of the view was not work the extra 30USD or so that I paid per day. The room itself was large with large working table that was faced to the window so you can look at the view while working if you have to do some work (which I did). I was there alone, but the room could easily fit 2 people. The bathroom was large with separate tub and shower. The furniture looked a bit outdated (like 80's style) and not as luxurious as the 5 star I had just stayed in for work at Melbourne, but I also didn't pay as much per night here. I am a Marriott gold member, so internet and breakfast was free for me. The breakfast buffet was typical english breakfast. They didn't change the food most days, so got alittle boring but it was decently good food for starting out my day (of alot of hiking around the city). The hotel staff is exceptionally nice. I couldn't figure out how to get my access card working for the executive lounge and the sent someone to come with me to the elevator and showed me. The staff in the execution lounge also made effort o greet me and ask about my day without being too impeding on my privacy. Just friendly.

We had a room in floor 24 and could see the Opera house from our window. That made our stay much more pleasant. Most of the guys at the concierge were useful and had lots of tips, but one night, there was a newbie who sent us on a wild goose chase after a restaurant where one of his colleagues had made reservations for my friends and me earlier in the day. The hotel apologized and send me a free bottle of excellent Australian wine to compensate me for spending an hour looking for a restaurant in the wrong part of the town. The staff is friendly and eager to serve. This is a Marriott after all, and they know about customer service. So, would I go back again? Yes! although I'd make my bookings much earlier. We started to book our vacation in September 2010, and by then there were no availability for New Year's eve. So, we had to make Sydney our first stay and leave to Port Douglas on Dec 29. If you want to be in Sydney on Dec 31, and stay in a good hotel that's near the Harbour (so you can watch the fireworks), it's best if you make your bookings by June, cause after that, you're unlikely to find a decent room, and not in the harbor area, anyway.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Pole", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, beautiful lobby, average rooms and fixtures\u201d", "Author": "voyageuse_81", "ReviewID": "UR93954497", "Content": "The hotel is in a great central location, with a wonderful view of the Opera House from the executive lounge on the higher levels of the hotel.

However, for the $310 standard room price (even with a Marriott Gold Card!) there were far too many letdowns for the price: 1. Air-conditioning simply didn't work in our room. To be fair to the hotel, I didn't request a room change, as I was too busy while I was there and by the time I came back to the hotel each evening, I was exhausted. 2. Bathroom, although clean, was really old and could do with a total upgrade. The shower actually feel disgusting to walk into - things were rusty and tiles had that grimy, old look and feel to them. Not pleasant! 3. No buffet dinner! We were disappointed by this - but the a la carte dinner was okay - not amazing food, but pretty good. 4. Super expensive Internet. I think in this day and age, hotels should not be charging $9 per hour for broadband Internet access in the rooms. Room service was also okay - obviously super expensive, but okay food.

Given the accommodations and the average level of service by the staff, I feel that I may have overpaid for the city room too. The walls of my room had black scuff marks on them. The TV was old (and confusing - if you pressed the power button on the TV itself to turn it off, the remote wouldn't turn it back on). The tub had big gouges and permanent scuff marks in it, making it appear perpetually dirty. Water from the tub/shower can be heard draining through the large grate in the bathroom floor - so loud that I guarantee it could be heard out in the hallway... speaking of that, I could hear every passing guest and noise from the hallway in my room. Wired internet costs $19.95 per day, which is crazy when many hotels offer it for free. I traveled with a friend, and on the 2nd day of our visit he misplaced one of the two room cards. We went down to the front desk to request a new card. They programmed a new card for him - and then about an hour later, they disabled my card. This started a cycle in which we repeatedly visited the front desk to report that one of our cards wasn't working, they issued a new card, and then disabled one or both of our working cards within a few hours. Every time one of us left the room, we had to check our card to see if it still worked or if we had to make yet another trip to the desk. I expect room service and hotel restaurants to be overpriced, but $99 per person for a buffet in the hotel restaurant? Lastly, I know that brewed/drip coffee is hard to come by in Australia, but for an American-owned hotel in a tourist area, which likely has its fair share of American guests, to only offer single-serving instant coffee packets in its rooms is disappointing. There were several positives - the location is excellent, walking distance to the Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge and Royal Botanical Gardens, room service and housekeeping staff were extremely friendly, there's a taxi rank just outside the entrance so you can always get a taxi, and there is a nice little cafe and a convenience store just across the street from the hotel's entrance, so getting a quick latte and a snack or picking up forgotten toiletries, etc. is easy. Finding affordable meals in the evening can be difficult - one should be prepared to pay anywhere from $26-$45 for an entree (excluding sides, drinks etc.) if you visit any of the restaurants along or near the water. After paying exorbitant prices for dinner several nights in a row, my friend and I visited the concierge one evening and asked for suggestions for a more affordable place to eat. He promptly grabbed a map and began circling the most expensive places around the Opera House, completely disregarding my request - after several frustrating minutes he finally explained that there really aren't any inexpensive restaurants in the area. We ended up at the Paragon Hotel around the corner where we had an OK meal for much less than we'd found elsewhere (but note that this place isn't a proper restaurant, it's a pub). For a quick and affordable lunch, there is a food court in a building around the rear of the hotel. We traveled to the Surry Hills area of town at one point and had excellent, fairly cheap Indian food from a little dive there, and I hear there are much more affordable places to eat in North Sydney if you happen to be there. I highly recommend taking a walk through the botanical gardens - they are beautiful with sweeping lawns and wide walking paths, and look out for the enormous bats roosting in the trees.

Our first hotel stay was at the Sydney Harbour Marriot - we stayed there based on TripAdvisor reviews and it's close proximity to the Harbour. This is your typical Marriot that you would see anywhere in the world - very clean, nicely decorated, modern, etc. Unfortunately there were 2 areas where we felt they fell short. Firstly their concierge's were not as helpful as we had hoped. Only traveling with LonelyPlanet books, we were hoping for a lot of insight into Sydney and the \"must-do\"s for our 3 night stay. Their recommendations seemed to be driven by the price of the tour, not necessarily the quality of it, and they also gave us inaccurate information about the local transit system which left us stuck at a train station with a ticket that got us nowhere that we wanted to go. We figured it out but it would've been nice to have some solid direction in the first place. To be honest, we got better recommendations from the front desk clerks. Secondly, our room rate included breakfast. When we reserved the room, we selected that there would be 2 people staying and even mentioned it was our honeymoon to give them yet another clue. Yet, they still neglected to tell us that the breakfast that was included was only for 1 person, not both of us. We weren't told this when we booked, when we checked in OR when we actually told the waitress that we wanted breakfast for 2 that was included in our room rate. We found out when we got our bill slid under our door. After complaining, they did offer to remove the charge for 1 of the extra breakfasts but we were still left with a $30+ AUD charge for another.

I could have done with a bit more drawer space for my length of stay but not a major problem. I don't know why hotels don't make lighting controls easier. There are a couple of lamps around the room and it would be better to have all controls by the bed. There was a good size TV with plenty of channels but no BBC World! The bathroom was size adequate. A very good powerful hot shower and fluffy towels. The big mirror steams up but with my face that's probably a blessing. Everything was kept very clean. Checking in and out was slick and efficient. I had problems with my internet connection (due to my company security policy) but the Philipines based Domoco help desk were excellent and got it working.

Only go if you are really hungry and not a coffee drinker. There is a cafe right next door that was popular and did a good looking English Breakfast and decent coffee for a fraction of the price. I didn't eat at the restaurant in the evening. The bar in the lobby is pretty quiet and no atmosphere. There are plenty of better, cheaper bars in the immediate vicinity. There is another bar attached to the hotel - Custom House Pub which is more lively with outdoor seating and heaters.It had a good selection of beers and bar food. The chcken satay was enormous and tasty. Only problem is that you can only get to it by walking around the outside of the hotel. My colleagues were on the executive floor and I was lucky enough to join them in the exec lounge most nights. A worthwhile upgrade. The free drinks saved me a fortune! One of the key benefits of this hotel is the location. It is 100m from Circular Quay so you can easily walk to The Bridge and the Opera House. The Rocks is a few minutes walk away and from the quay there are frequent ferries to lots of places around the Sydney area.

Both times we have had really good experiences. The first time we were traveling with our teenage son, and the second time we were alone. The Marriott Circular Quay's best feature is the location! :-) The first time, we have been on an extensive trip thru New Zealand and Australia and called the concierge ahead of time to have some intricate plans followed. They consisted of picking up members of our family, taking them from the local cruise ship terminal, on a tour, then on to the airport, additionally... picking up our luggage and storing it at the hotel, until we would arrive a few weeks later. When we arrived from the driving portion of our trip, weeks later,weary from the road we had all but forgotten about our bags....we arrived to our room, and our bags we waiting, just as planned without a hitch, with a note from the concierge...saying welcome to Sydney. The service of the concierge at the Marriott Circular Quay is professional and we called on them for their services a few times during both of our stays. They offer quick advice and are very helpful. They allow most things to be billed back to the room, which is nice when you dont carry a lot of foreign currency. On our first trip we had booked two rooms on the concierge level. At check in, the manager on duty asked us if we would like to upgrade to a \"duplex\". Naturally, we said of course. What a great surprise. The duplex was actually a 3 bedroom suite, which included a large living/dining room, kitchen, 2 bathrooms and large grand staircase. The view was fantastic of the harbour,and Opera house. With the duplex came perks such as, access to the concierge lounge, a gift basket and other things of that nature. Unfortunately, on our second visit, we booked our room using Marriott points and there were no upgrades available(either with cash or points) at check in so we were relegated to a standard room. After the duplex that was a let down. The location of the hotel is top flight. Within walking distance to shops, restaurants, bars, and all the touristy things you would want to do in Sydney. Sydney reminds us of a \"clean\", compact San Francisco. It has a great charm to its waterfront area, and the cafes are not to be missed. Although we didnt utilize it, many of the restaurants are open 24 hours. Whether it is for coffee, tea, or a quick sandwich, a walk along the area adjacent to Circular Quay is a great way to spend at least one day. There are a lot of souvenir shops who seem to be undercutting each other in the area. The hotel has \"free\" WiFi in the concierge lounge but charges an astronomical 25.00 a day for it in the regular guest rooms. It you are in a standard guest room, save your money and go to the Starbucks around the corner where the Internet is something like 6.00 an hour, or do what the locals do, and sit outside the Mc Donald's and borrow it for free! We were surprised that the Internet in the lobby of the hotel is not free either. If you didn't bring a lap top the hotel has a business center and sells cards for the internet. The food at the hotel is really good. We especially like ordering room service and it was delivered quickly and served hot, and as ordered. The selection is good and the prices were reasonable. The gym at the hotel is really pretty good. But be forewarned there is not an outdoor pool, and consequently, there is not anywhere to sit if you are interested in sitting in the sun. You will have to save that for the cafes on the wharf. There is an onsite Avis car rental/return which is really very convenient. On our first trip we had scheduled to rent a Hertz car but when we saw that they had an Avis on site we changed our reservation. You can actually return the car to the valet at the hotel. 1, 2, 3 and you are done. They will even take the car and get gas for you, if you like. At the suggestion of a local we took the bus to Bondi beach. DON\"T. Its a long crowded ride, and makes dozens of stops. If you really want to go, take a cab. The high-light of our trip this time was seeing AC /DC. They were amazing. What a fantastic show! WE, and about 60,000 of our best friends rocked out. They played all of their hits and it was an incredible night. We had hired a car thru the concierge and he did a great job of waiting for us. Over all the hotel is really nice.

Another bonus is being very close to the bus stops and the train station, all located at Circular Quay. The hotel room itself was practically perfect! We had room 2008 with 2 double beds, and it was very roomy with a large bathroom- big tub, lots of counter space, well lit and excellent water pressure. The bed was so comfortable! Another review here mentioned that the room need refurbishment but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree at all. Maybe the furniture wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brand new but it was relatively new, well-appointed and in excellent condition. Not a flat screen TV, as also noted in another review, but not what I judge a hotel by. Very clean, and the room was always quickly made up. The only shortcoming is there are only 2 dresser drawers, but, I always pack a supply of those wire dry-cleaner hangers and hang every thing up! The closet does offer 10 wooden hangers by the way, generous. You may want to bring your own hair dryer though, the one they have didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a very good job on my thick hair.

In my view by far the best point/plus of the hotel is it's position which must be the best at Circular Quay. The ferries, restaurants and Opera House are only a few minutes away. Whatever faults the hotel may have and it does have some, they are in my opinion more than outweighed by its wonderfully convenient and central location. My Opera House view room was as far down he corridor as possible to get the best view of it and the ferries at circular quay.It is worth pointing out that the Opera House is not directly ahead looking out of the window but in my case was to the left and the general view is not helped by high rise buildings. I have attached 2 photos of the view from the room but with the zoom lense probably make the view seem better than it actually is, by taking out the high buildings. However I consider it well worth the extra cost. Not only great views of the Opera House and some of the ferry wharfs but also out in the direction of Manly - obviously, the higher the floor the better the view. I was very happy in my room for nearly a fortnight but I would say it is in need of a refurb. Perhaps a little dark and certainly the television needs upgrading to a flat screen. A comfortable, large bed although storage space for clothes was somewhat lacking. I did get back to my room at 4.50pm one evening not long after I arrived and was amazed that it hadn't been made up. In fairness it was made up immediately after my call and afterwards I completed a card on which you can specify what time you would like your room made up. In future it was made up every day without fail within my requested time so a negative turned into a plus. They do have a good system here where basically you only have to telephone one number - 9, for any service you may require - i.e room make up, room service etc. I had a few meals in my room and the service was quick and efficient. Breakfasts were good but not cheap at $35 - why don't they do hash browns for breakfast?! A very large restaurant which is needed on occasions when do they do have large coach parties in. One morning and only one morning it was absolute chaos with the staff simply being understandably unable to cope with sudden influx of about 80 for breakfast. Try and get a window view table - not a great view but nice and quiet. I would recommend the Custom House bar which belongs to the hotel - at the back beyond receptiol, particularly the al fresco section on the street. Great atmosphere and good, cheapish food - fish and chips were wonderful. This is a large and very busy hotel and there can be frustrating delays normally at peak times for lifts which you don't generally experience at similar standard hotels. There are three computers with internet access in the business centre - $10 an hour. However for at least a week one was out of order which I found completely unacceptable. I appreciate the responsibility for them is outsourced but a hotel like this should have the clout to get the wretched thing repaired inside 24 hours.

There were two kiosks nearby which sold bottled water for only $1AUD. The Circular Quay deli on the same side of the street as the ferry terminal was also a good choice.

An example of this is the large clunky cabinet that houses the old fashioned TV. The rooms are a little dark. The location of this hotel cannot be bettered as it is minutes from all of the main attractions / shopping areas of Sydney. Another advantage for executive room guests is the executive lounge. Someone has already mentioned that the lounge is not particularly large but we never had a problem getting seats at breakfast nor at 5:30pm at \"happy hour\" . We were told that if the lounge was full at breakfast, then staff would give guests a voucher to have breakfast in the main dining room on the first / second floor. The executive lounge has the longest \"happy hour\" that we have come across starting at 5:30pm and closing at 9:30pm. Once again, we never had difficulty getting a seat and the service in the lounge was excellant. The views from the lounge are limited but I belive that originally the views were wonderful and unobstructed until an insurance company built a very large building in front of the hotel thus severely restricting the views.

My coworker left a package for me when she checked out. I asked the front desk for it- they sent me to the concierge. I asked the concierge for it- they sent me to the bell man. I asked the bell man for it- no luck. I went back to the front desk a few hours later and they finally found it- seriously though! The concierge is rude and not very helpful unless you have them do everything for you. I called to ask a question and was told they were busy so I went to the desk- there was no one in line. While I was speaking to the concierge, the phone rang, he took the call and told me he had to talk to that client and not me. They also do not have some basic things that a tourist would like including the ferry schedules. My bathroom had mildew in it.

Location was great. As others have writen, it is convenient to Circular Quay, making transportation to other areas quick and easy. It is an easy walking distance to Quay, Opera House, Rocks, and Botanic Gardens. (The distances to these areas were judged to be quite walkable by my companion who is soon to have a knee replacement.) We paid just a bit more for rooms at executive level. I had a suite and my friend had a king room. Both had good views, and were quite clean and well-appointed. Though not as large as the suite I had in another Marriott recently, it was plenty big enough. The shower was great! On the 30th and 31st floors we heard no traffic noise, and I heard nothing from any of the adjacent rooms. Soundproofing seemed quite good. Beds were comfortable. It is true that the TVs were not LCDTVs, but I didn't go to Sydney to watch TV, anyway. ALL staff were unfailingly helpful and courteous. We especially appreciated being checked into our rooms quite early, at about 7:30 AM, as our arrival time had been moved up some hours by the airline after we had made our reservations. The hotel does have an early arrivals lounge, equipped with showers and other amenities. We made use of this service after checkout on the day we left, as our flight left Sydney rather late. It was great to have a place to freshen up before the long flight home! This service is another reseaon I would recommend this hotel. Wi fi access is free in executive lounge, but would not work with Iphones or Ipod Touch. Marriott tech assistance staff were unable to explain or resolve problem for us or for the several other guests with same issue. At first, we were compensated with a half hour of free PC access in business center, but they quickly changed policy and began to charge $5 a half hour. We then began using internet access ($4 an hour) at city market across the street. The breakfast in the executive lounge alone made it worth the ugrade, as most restaurants in vicinity were fairly $$. I am judging restaurants in area to be expensive based on my recent trips to New York City and Washington DC, while my friend, who is from San Francisco, also found Sydney to be quite expensive for dining. I think if NYC and San Francisco prices look cheap by comparison, then the costs will seem high to many Americans! Admittedly there is a McDonald's, Starbucks and Subway within a block or so, but excepting those places, which were not places we ate, I would say expect to pay more in Sydney than in major US cities for dining. There are a great many restaurants in easy walking distance of hotel. Ask about the freeshuttle service, bus 155, that will take you to Australia Museum and up and down George Street for shopping. The Queen Victoria shopping center is quite lovely, and was decorated with a 3 story Swavorski crystral Christmas tree when we were there. The Blue mountans were doubtless lovely, but fog was so thick the day we were there you could see nothing from any of the overlooks. Check weather before you go.

WE GOT IT!! while the rooms weren't huge, there were three of us, and it was certainly adequate. on the first weekend, we took the upgraded harbor-view option...it was a larger room, with a larger bathroom, than the lower-priced 'city-view' we opted for on the second weekend...however both were sufficient, clean, and well-serviced. although we arrived in the early morning, the staff were able to accomodate us with a room. that same 'CAN-DO-SIR' attitude was the rule in every staffing area during both of our 3-day stays. the examples are too numerous to list...suffice it to say that for each 'opportunity' we had...a team-member efficiently found a solution... and that included the concierge calmly and expertly coordinating our efforts to locate a passport that had been lost in the city. he first quickly outlined the replacement requirements...and then directed an effective search... the document was recovered in short order. so...if the property was good, and the staff supurb, could anything top that. YES!!! the location of this mariott was amazing. it was a short walk, or a quick cab ride to almost everything you'd want to see in metro sydney. the trains and ferries to every- where were close at hand... and after we picked up our rental car, the marriott was easy to find...even driving back into the city from the countryside. you could see it from the sydney harbour bridge!!! (driving on the left is no big deal...'no worries' as they say) the only negative during our stay didn't come from the hotel...but is worthy of note. on arrival at the airport, we opted to take a shuttle operated by a company called 'easygo.' it stopped at the hotels of the passengers on board. we purchased a round-trip ticket, and per the instructions given, the concierge called the day before to set-up our pick-up for the homeward bound flight. that was done, i know, because he wrote the time on our tickets. that morning...the shuttle didn't show-up...and we ended up taking a cab. since there were three of us...the per/person fare turned out to be the same as we paid for the shuttle...and the cab was easier, and faster. the unfortunate part came at the airport...when i visited the 'easygo' counter to obtain a refund. they wouldn't issue one...and said that i had to 'APPLY' when i got home. suffice it to say that that's a bad policy...and the administration of it was even worse. i reported that to the 'help' desk at the airport, and the staffer there said that that was a frequent complaint about 'EASYGO.' i finally did obtain a refund, but with the help of the airport staff. go easy on YOURSELF...take a cab!!! so...to get back on topic... STAY AT THIS MARRIOTT!!! you can't go wrong. i fully intend to on my next visit...and there will be one since australia was a very pleasant place. just one thing... next time...I'll take a cab from the airport!!!

I think we took photos of the view every time we returned to the room because the Opera House looks different in every kind of light. We were on the 25th floor and the elevators were not as bad as some reviews have said. Our room (2 double beds) was comfortable, not spacious, but we never felt crowded with 3 of us there for 6 days. The bathroom was very large. Everytime we came or went from Circular Quay, which was 1/2 block from the hotel, we were thankful we stayed there.

We had purchased the Sydney Pass at the airport so the included Airport Link train took us to Circular Quay and in 2 minutes we walked to the hotel.

Rather, it is an observation I make on the nature of the accommodation and service provided. I was happy with the room I received, for the rate I paid, but the experience is not what you would call special. We stayed in an executive suite for 3 nights at $AUD 337 per night with the marriott gold card. The executive suite had a separate living area and had clear views of the opera house, story bridge and botanic gardens. There was plenty of natural light. The living area was comfortable with sofa and two chairs. I enjoyed sitting there and watching the view. On the 27th floor, where our room was, it was a genuine view straight out the window. I like a view and this was the room's strong point in my opinion. Overall, the room was large and comfortable and suited our purposes very well. It was starting to show its age, 6 years since opening, but was in good condition. It is not as plush as some other 5 star hotels and looks a little old fashioned. The bathroom was clean and functional but nothing special. The king bed was very comfortable and lived up to the hype of the Marriott Revive bedding. It was both comfortable and supportive and ensured a good night's sleep. The room had two TVs. Both were small and CRT. We didn't have a problem with it but most hotels have moved on to LCD or Plasma. So long as they keep the room rates low you can't complain. If i was paying top dollar for these rooms then I would have been disappointed. We found the executive lounge underwhelming. When you look at the website it appears to be a luxurious space at the top of the hotel. In reality it does not feel exclusive and you do not receive much service. The buffet where the breakfast and canapes are laid out is small and feels cramped. In fact, the lounge itself feels cramped unless you are lucky enough to score one of the lounge suites that they have. On Sunday morning it was busy and it wasn't very relaxing to eat there. For some reason they only give you small plates. I am not so desperate as to pile my plate very high but I like enough room on the plate to be able to use my cutlery and eat my food. We like a big breakfast and a wide variety of items. We were not satisfied with the lounge and ate in the main restaurant downstairs. The lounge does have some benefits. You receive free wireless internet and this was popular with many patrons bringing laptops. Unfortunately Iphones don't work on the wireless system. There is unlimited coffee and tea. The coffee appears to be decent quality and you can takeaway. We found the dessert quite good and visited after we had been out for dinner in town. When it is quiet, it is a pleasant place to lounge around in take in the views and enjoy the food. Depending on where you sit you can get views of the story bridge. In my view the lounge was not about luxury but was really about a value for money package that could be added on to your room. Consequently, the cheap feel and lack of service reflect the nature of the offering. If you add up all the things you receive it is probably worth the extra you pay. As gold card holders we only pay 50% of the cost of meals in the hotel anyway so it is not worth that much to us. If you were paying full price for all your meals it would be better value. The main restaurant was much better than the lounge. It felt spacious and had a better decor and atmosphere. We tried the seafood buffet and the a la carte menu. Both were good quality. The buffet breakfast was much better than that on offer in the lounge and had a fairly good range of hot items to choose from. I particularly liked the Hank's Jams they laid out each day with different jams on different days. This was an excellent idea. Overall, we received good service. When checking in I didn't receive that \"warm, Marriott welcome.\" I wasn't perturbed but thought a little more hospitality was in order. Otherwise all requests were responded to promptly. After ordering turn down service on the first night it was provided without prompting every night thereafter. The service was efficient but lacked warmth. This comes back to my comment earlier about it being the McDonald's of the hotel world. We had problems with our room access cards on the first two days. At one stage they stopped working completely and we couldn't access our room. Security let me in but asked to see ID. This was reasonable but I felt like I was under suspicion due to the manner of the security guard in asking for ID. When I had the keys reprogrammed in reception I had to provide ID again. I appreciate the need to maintain safety and security but would prefer it to be done not so officiously. Interestingly, I didn't have to provide ID when I checked in to the hotel. In summary, this is a large hotel with efficient service. It can offer good value for money depending on the price you pay. We enjoyed our stay and found the Marriott to be comfortable. But we weren't charmed by the hotel or the experience. Instead, we got what we paid for which was a large room in a full service hotel at a good price.

(3) The bellmen were super great. They were very helpful and you can ask them questions if the concierge is busy. (4) The concierge was also very helpful, making dinner reservations for you when needed. (5) Our room had lovely views of the harbor and the Sydney Opera House.

I booked a partial Opera House view room for 4 through the Marriott web site, but upon check-in was told that the room I booked cannot accommodate a rollaway bed in addition to the 2 doubles that were already in the room, but for an extra $40 a night I can be upgraded to a room that can. The rollaway bed also costs $55 per night. These caught me by surprise since they were not mentioned at the web site. I ended up paying an extra $95 per night than I originally budgeted for, but since we were rarely in the room and only used it for sleeping, I did not see the need to book an extra room for my 2 teenagers. (2) We had dinner one night at the hotel's restaurant. The food was horrible and expensive, and were in small portions. The waiter was also inexperienced, and did not seem to want to serve us Miscellaneous: Taking a friend's advice, we did not bother with the breakfast buffet, but just had breakfast at the cafe right next to the hotel which was run by a Vietnamese family. The prices there were more reasonable. Additionally, although the check-in staff was very pleasant, a few did not know what travelers checks were (apparently these are not widely-used in Australia).

The main problem (and a constant complaint from the guests) when I was there is the elevators. The elevators operate on key card access and several of the key cards do not work properly. This causes havoc with the guests because they cannot punch in their floor numbers and end up riding up and down the elevators. This transcends annoying when you are trapped in an elevator with 10-12 other people. Also, the bell staff leaves something to be desired. I waited almost two hours for my bag when I arrived (also due to the elevators) and finally went down to the desk to get my bag myself and lug it to the room.

I would come back for both business or pleasure. Definitely a place you could come for business and bring the family as there is plenty to do and see. I can echo what others have said in that the location is unbeatable along with the stunning views. I'll skip repeating what has already said and try to give a few helpful hints. A few tips: 1. Do eat at the Sydney Cafe Restaurant. It's a short 5 minute stroll. It has indoor/outdoor seating on the roof with an breathtaking view of the harbor. The food will please and the mixed drinks are unique and well executed. The service was good but American's beware they serve at a European pace (slow). The atmosphere is excellent and not too formal but you shouldn't wear too casual clothes (no jeans and sneakers). A polo and khakis will do just fine. If you have business colleagues in town this is the perfect place to take them. If you want to try the native Rocks oysters (no much brine, a little sweet) go the Waterfront restaurant - they were better there. Pricewise the entrees are all about 35 Australian Dollars or about 25 US. 2. Try the Kangaroo! It's sort of like venison but not as gamy. The Marriot has it on the room service menu. 3. Opt for the rate that includes breakfast. The breakfast buffet is $35 AUD each if purchased at the restaurant but if you opt for the rate that includes it when you book it's only $20 per day more for two adults. 4. Jet lag? Head to the spa for the Jet Lag package ladies! It includes a facial and massage. They use dermatologica products and seemed to have a good amount of experience. The spa is not luxorious by any means. Just little rooms off the gym, the prices were average but the service was excellent. 5. The gym is well equipped for a hotel. Free weights, check. Cardio machines, check. Weight machines, check. 6. The business center has a small conference room with seating for 4 around a small table. You can book it thru the front desk or if you only need it for a short time just walk in and use it. No one seemed to mind. The bar staff will bring food/drinks in their for you if you ask. 7. Beware of the phone. You can only make credit card or collect calls. No simply dialing and seeing it show up on the bill. For whatever bizarre reason you cannot make a 1800 call even if you try to pay for it. Not such a big deal until you need to call American Airlines to reschedule a cancelled flight on a Saturday and the Australian office is shut! Had to have the hubby deal with it from the US. Also, the phone in my room did not work properly. They never did fix it. It seemed to be a line issue. People would just cut out or their was a huge amount of noise on the line.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cWow what location, upgrade to an opera house view room\u201d", "Author": "oztravellerLeeds", "ReviewID": "UR22784007", "Content": "My wife and I sateyd at the hotel in November, we upgraded to an Opera house view room which was excellent, much larger than a city view and the view we had was worth a million, cannot fault it. bedroom was clean and very comfortable, bathroom large and clean.

It was a perfect day UNTIL we checked into the Marriott on Circular Quay. We live in Sydney so we had booked into the Marriott as a treat for our wedding night. We had booked through another website so we had paid in advance. When we were checking in, we were in our wedding clothes so the receptionist was very nice to us and even said he would send up a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate the wedding. He also offered us a late check out of 1pm. We headed up to our room which was pretty basic. We called room service and asked for some bath robes so that when we returned from our wedding dinner we could change out of our formal clothes. After about an hour we went to dinner-the bath robes had still not arrived. After we returned from dinner we checked for the bathrobes as I was dying to take off my corset and wedding dress. No bathrobes. So my (new!) husband called down and asked for them again. We were told they had already been delivered. We checked the whole room-no sign of them. To this the person on the phone sighed and responded that they HAD been delivered but he would send the guy up with two more and that it may take a while as the guy who delivers robes was busy. Eventually, as we were about to fall asleep the robes were delivered. The robe guy was pretty apologetic and said that he had delivered the robes to the room next door earlier by accident. There were also a number of other problems-the cold water was not running in the sink so the only choice for hand washing was hot water only which was uncomfortably hot. Of course, we never received our complimentary bottle of wine. And we just checked our bank account and they have charged us a SECOND time for the hotel room. I'm not sure why they charged us again as when my husband checked out there was no outstanding charges on the bill. I called to see what the charge was for and before I could even explain the situation, a very rude lady told me I would have to contact accounts when they open at 9am tomorrow. So yes, I don't think I would recommend the Marriott and we definitely will not be using this chain again. We were expecting a great experience from a 5 star hotel.

I was a bit disappointed because I originally booked (through the Marriott website) a non-smoking king bed room. We checked in very early on 21 June and our room was not ready, so we came back late in the peace. When we came back to the hotel, we were given a double bed smoking room. I was extremely disappointed with this, as I specifically asked that my preference would be a non-smoking room double bed, but I got smoking. I had previously stayed at the Marriott in Victoria, Canada in 2007 and was very impressed with the facilities and location. Unfortunately, with these expectations in mind, I was expecting that the Sydney Harbourside Marriott would be the same - unfortunately, it wasn't as good. I do have to say that the Marriott in Victoria was recently renovated in the last year, but the Harbourside Marriott has not been and I saw this in the room. For those who were thinking of staying in a opera house room (I stayed in one of these rooms on the 19th floor), it is not quite what you think. You can see the opera house, but the view is seen through in between 2 buildings to the left and right of the window - you don't have a 180 degree view which looks directly onto the opera house (if that makes any sense). Also, your room faces east, so when you go and open the blinds in the morning, the sun comes directly into your room/face and blinds you. I do not recall seeing in the room a USB port (which I saw at the Victoria Marriott) which would have been handy to charge an ipod (for example). The reason why I'm posting this post is because of something that happened on the evening of 21 June, which I was a bit concerned about. I went down to the health club on Saturday evening around 7pm. Firstly, the spa was empty and did not have any water in it (was covered up). So if you have expectations of having a spa in the winter at this Marriott, forget it! Secondly, for those who have children and were thinking about using the pool, the pool does not have a \"shallow\" depth for you to stand on (I was planning to do some aqua exercises and couldn't, because I'm short and couldn't touch the bottom of the swimming pool without my head being submerged!). The pool is 1.4 metres deep all the way around. Nice pool, despite this. Finally, the biggest concern for me was that I was there for 40 minutes and the health club in that time was not manned. I was appalled because of the swimming pool and the dangers of children drowning - too bad, no one was there to save you if you drowned. Also, there are lockers, but at the time I was there, there was no keys for the lockers, so you could use them. I went to the desk and because it wasn't manned, I couldn't get help, The sauna was very nice, I must admit (though it was not steaming when I was there - it was nice and hot!). With the Bvlgari pack you get, you only get one soap bar, bath salts and something else for ONE person (not for 2 people). We also didn't have bathrobes in our room, so that was a bit sad. Finally, the buffet breakfast is good (on the whole). The fruit was very sweet and nice (given the fact that it is winter in Sydney). Don't go at 10am - we had to queue for 10 minutes before getting a table! I forgot to mention - the location is excellent - 2 minutes walk from the airport train and circular quay.

Requested a late check out the night before and we were able to stay until 2pm @ no extra charge due to late flight. Lovely gesture. Handy map at the desk, short walk to the centre of town for shopping and make sure you do the Walking tour of the Rocks. The tour guides are brilliant !

The hotel rooms were very spacious with nice bathrooms, a robe, a small hotel bar/refrigerator, coffee maker, and safe. The showers were excellent - plenty of hot water and excellent water pressure. The gym was okay, with several treadmills, stairclimbers, stationary bikes, and machines to work the legs and arms. However, they did not have any machines that worked the abs, something needed after all of the seafood that I consumed! Pool area looked nice, but I didn't actually use the pool. The hotel location was perfect for the Central Business District, and walking to the office was very easy. The hotel is also half a block from the Circular Quay bus stops and ferry dock - excellent. We took buses to Bondi beach and Watson's Bay and the ferriy to Manly Beach. Back to food - there are also plenty of restaurants near the hotel, including a wonderful Italian restaurant right next door. The hotel also has a phenomenal seafood buffet available nightly, with expanded offerings on the weekend. I went during the week and had my fill of crab legs, jumbo prawns, and many other excellent dishes, including multiple mini-desserts. The lobby bar area offers live music Wednesday - Saturday. The Wednesday night piano/jazz singer John Harkins, a Chicago native, made my stay that much more enjoyable - have a nice club sandwich, some tiramisu and a drink and sit back and enjoy the music. The staff in the lobby bar were also outstanding - very attentive and friendly, not overbearing. The only draw back of the hotel was the lack of wireless internet in the rooms - I took my laptop to the lobby to use the wireless access. This is expensive on a daily basis but for 24 actual hours of use at $24.95, this option was very reasonable for a 2 week stay. Concierge staff was also very good - recommended good restaurants, a phenomenal tour to the Blue Mountains, and a place to get my eyeglasses fixed/replaced. They also sold calling cards for the US - very convenient and reasonable. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel for business and leisure. Had a great time, in part due to the very good service that I experienced from the room attendants, front desk, conceirge, and lobby bar staff!

The pillow menu was very interesting...makes sleeping a lot more fun! The in room furnitures were in perfect conditions. My understanding is that this hotel is quite old but has probably gone through quite an extensive renovation recently as everything in the room seems to be spotless. The lounge on the 30th floor was quite nice, but with the only drawback in terms of size- it was too small. It gets crowded very easily and can be hard to get the waiter's attention. Breakfast is served here but it could have been a bit better as it lacked variety (eg. only scrambled eggs are provided, no other choices available). Nevertheless, this is a great hotel.

But, ...) Really, quite irritating and no one seemed to understand what we were talking about when we called down to the front desk. We also had a problem with our bill for our first stay. We were given a smoking room but (per our request and based on our booking) were moved to a non-smoking room which was a little smaller and not quite the same stunning view. And although the desk staff stated that breakfast was included (confirming our reservation) we were mistakenly charged for breakfast. It required talking to the manager to reduce the bill to reflect the correct amount (a concession for the smaller room and removal of the breakfast charges). Annoying but at least it was fixed.

I did look into staying in Paddington (marginally more affordable), but in hindsight am so glad that I didn't - not that Paddington isn't lovely, just that at the end of the day for me, as a first time visitor to Sydney, it was better to be so Central. When we arrived at the Marriott we knew we had a double room with a view and had been quoted $220AUD. At check in we were offered an upgrade - for $60AUD per night for both of us we could have a room on the Executive floor (higher up, 30th floor) and a view of the Opera House. That also included breakfast and use of the Executive Bar (views of the Harbour Bridge)with as much free drink as we wanted and snacks (which turned out to be lovely buffet style food early evening). As breakfast was going to cost $25AUD per day EACH it was a no brainer and we took it. And so glad we did. We had a gorgeous room with a great view, huge comfy bed, plenty of space (I don't know how big the normal rooms are I'm afraid). I also used the Internet access the Hotel has in a small Business Centre which was $5 for half an hour (didn't find a better rate near the hotel). Sydney itself is fantastic. I'm a Londoner and loved the fact that it was city life - but outdoors! I would recommend to anyone going for the first time to go on one of the tours of the Harbour by boat. You could just take the ferry, but it is worth going on one of the Guided tours. I would also recommend the bus tour which leaves from various points in the city. You learn a lot about all the areas (Paddington, Potts Point, Darling Harbour, Kings Cross) as you drive through them, and you can also pick up the bus which goes to Bondi Beach on the same ticket (valid for 24 hours from when you buy it and you hop on and off). My only criticism of the city is that the restaurants seem stupidly priced (though the food is very good). $30+ AUD for a main course EVERYWHERE seemed a bit excessive.

Also walkable into the CBD shopping areas too. Sydney felt a pretty compact city and I walked most places, helped by a hotel in a good area as base. As for the room - it was spacious, with a fantastically soft and large bed which could fit 3 people, let alone just myself. Bathroom was shower only, but it was big and clean. If I'd stayed for more nights, I might have wanted a bathtub but not an issue this time round. Had no trouble with noise and slept well (aside from having to adjust a lot of time zones!). Buffet style breakfast was plentiful, though I tended to eat out more so can't comment on the restaurant fully. Lobby area was nice, with lounge singers in the evening and staff waiting on tables bringing drinks and food. My stay wasn't trouble free though - my booking wasn't actually on the system, which meant I had to be checked in as a walk-in. As a result, I was on the 8th floor which doesn't have much of a view and is probably the floor most of the flight crews who seem to stay here are on. But I'm not that fussy and was pleased with how it was handled. They did offer to move me, but I was already unpacked so declined but nice of them to recognise the error. If not for this mix up with the reservation, it would've been 5 out of 5. I imagine that I would have been put on the 20th floor or higher, so I'd advise to phone ahead in future to make sure, should the view be important to you. Want to mention specifically, the high level of service from staff I received. All were very friendly and helpful but I want to highlight the particular time where I foolishly lost my passport in the Botanic gardens (obviously no fault of the hotel).

We took the train from the airport to the Circular Quay Station which is just a short walk to the hotel. We then made use of the \"early arrivals lounge\" that Marriott offers, since we landed in Sydney at 7am. There was already another couple in there, so the shower was in use, but we had some coffee and cookies and we used the internet. After we freshened up, we checked our luggage with the bell hop and explored the city. We went back and wandered the Circular Quay and took a morning cruise on one of their ferries! We then walked to The Rocks and browsed through a lot of stores and had lunch. After lunch we walked all the way up to the QVB on George Street and then we walked back to find our room was ready at 2:30pm. We didn't upgrade our room for an additional $90/night which would have given us a better view and access to the executive lounge.

City and Bridge view especially nice at night. We had breakfast in the Executive club lounge. Lounge access was provided with my husband's Marriott gold status. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage/bacon, toast, fruit, cereal and pastry. Nice deserts in the evening. We didn't take advantage of Room service because the menu was a little pricey. I had planned on using the Health club but I chose to be a lazy girl instead. My husband, niece and nephew enjoyed playing in the pool and hot tub.

Before booking our hotel in Sydney I did some research and decided that using Priceline to book the hotel would be best, and that's what I did. For $90 US/night we got the Marriott. February is a high-peak month, so I highly recommend using Priceline to secure your hotel for a good rate! We arrived with the United Airlines crew around 10am and we were escorted to an upgraded room since we were here for our honeymoon. It was great that we were able to check-in right away and didn't have to wait for our room, although there is an early-arrivals lounge with a bathroom, food, and free Internet. The room was large with a city-view on a high floor. There were both a tub and separate shower, however the sink area was small. The lounge in the lobby is very active and reasonably priced. The location is in Circular Quay which is 2 blocks from the Ferry building and the Train. I highly recommend using the train to get from Sydney Airport to Circular Quay (Sydney Harbour Marriott, Four Seasons Hotel, Shangri La Hotel) because it's a lot cheaper than the $50 AU in a cab and very efficient. The ferry will take you to all the nearby harbours (Darling Harbour has great restaurants, the Sydney Aquarium and Casino). The hotel is about a 10 min walk to The Rocks area, which is where the Park Hyatt is, as well as some fabulous restaurants and pubs. Try Sailors Thai if you enjoy thai food. The concierge worked with my husband to surprise me with a dozen roses in our room and flower petals decorating the room, they really went all out to make our honeymoon and first visit to Australia amazing!", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "allgoodnamesaretaken", "ReviewID": "UR3504474", "Content": "I was there hours before the normal 2PM check-in time, but they had the room ready, plus they offered to upgrade me to the Executive level for $50AUD.

The staff in the Executive Lounge were very knowledgeable about every question I had for them. Every member of the staff I encountered during my 5 day stay was exceedingly courteous and helpful. The location is perfect for sightseeing in Sydney. The Circular Quay train stop is a very short walk, doable even laden with luggage, and the harbour is so close, it's practically inexcuasable not to end each day at the harbour, enjoying a drink or gelato from the cafes, bars and restaurants that seem to be open 24 hours a day there.

Absolutely brilliant location. As another reviewer noted though, Hotel lacks a little character and is perhaps somewhat sterile but rooms were first class and bed extremely comfortable. Dined in on first evening and meal was excellent with well researched wine list providing many highly drinkable Aussie vintages. Didn't bother with hotel breakfast as found small cafe right next to Hotel that provided good English/American breakfast for only a few dollars. Walked to most sights of interest, even walked from Oxford St. Paddington back to Hotel. Paddington is an old, very interesting inner suburb with chic shops and delightful terraced houses. Lovely stroll back through beautiful Hyde Park. (Reminiscent of Londons Parks). It is many years since my wife and I last visited Sydney and it is still a fascinating and delightful place to visit. The Marriot being so close to the magnificent harbour and surrounds made it just that much more enjoyable. An absolute must is to visit the cocktail bar on the 36th floor of the Shangri La Hotel (a city block away from SHM). We arrived just before sunset and had amazing views of sun setting through one set of windows and rush hour traffic crossing Sydney Harbour bridge directly below us through another set of huge glass windows.

Booked using Marriott reward points for 4 nights. Closer to the trip, we added an extra night but explained that we wouldn't be arriving until early the next morning (landed at about 6 am and wanted to get straight into our room after the long trip from the UK). Got to the hotel and the fact that we had booked for one night and were only just arriving caused them no end of confusion. We had phone messages every day because they couldn't find the reservation with the points on. On one occasion, they also couldn't manage to switch off the message light so we had this flashing all night (or until we unplugged the phone). Other than fairly useless staff, you could have been in any big chain hotel anywhere in the world. It was clean, comfortable and characterless, but we only wanted a city base so weren't bothered about that. Wouldn't bother paying the upgrade charge for the harbour view. I imagined a glorious view of the whole sweep of Sydney harbour with the opera house. What we got was a view of the opera house in between other tower blocks - really not worth bothering with. Didn't have brekkie included in the deal and there are loads of places you can get a good breakfast for half the price of the Marriott. Don't bother paying for brekkie unless you really want to pig out at the buffet.
