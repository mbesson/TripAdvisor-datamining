The rooms are kind of tucked together at weird angles so it felt like you were entering a closet to get to your room. We had two rooms and all four keys to those rooms stopped working at the same time. The front desk person, instead of apologizing and just reactivating our keys, immediately placed the blame on us saying we kept the keys too close to our cell phones or credit cards. One problem with that is that one of the keys had never left the dresser except to verify that the keys weren't working. You never blame the customer with your first reply.. Some Customer Service training is certainly in order.. This was a one time trip to Chicago but if by chance we do return we probably wouldn't stay here again.

I was looking for a hotel in Chicago for my Bachelor party in September. I liked the rate, location and reviews of the Crown Plaza Magnificent Mile so I went ahead and booked five rooms with queen beds for 2 nights each. This is where I screwed up. I selected the best rate of $234 a night for the rooms. This was among the first group of rates listed. What I did not realize was that the first group of rates on top the the results page was the non-refundable advanced purchase rate. I completely glanced over this, that is my fault. I've booked quite a few hotel rooms in the past, and have never seen the non-refundable rates listed on top of the search results and with no significant warning posted near them. Nore did not get any sort of warning before I clicked the \"book it\" button, alerting me that this was a non-refundable purchase. But, my fault I should have double checked and done my due diligence. I panicked when I saw I had just put $2500 on my credit card and called Priority Club to see if there was anyway I could cancel this. I admitted I screwed and said I was willing to re-book the same amount of rooms at the normal rate (which was only $1 more!!) for the same weekend. I made this call about 30 seconds after booking. The Priority Club rep said there was nothing they could do, and I would have to contact the hotel directly. I contacted the hotel directly and talked to Mary in reservations. I explained my problem, acknowledged that it was totally my fault but if there was anything they could do I would greatly appreciate it and that I would re-book the same amount of rooms at the higher available rate. Mary said that there was nothing she could do, and that I would have to contact Priority Club directly. I told her that PC had sent me to her. She said they were wrong and that I would have to call them back. I called Priority Club back and passed along what Mary at the hotel had said. The Priority Cub rep was very understanding and helpful and again said there was nothing she could do and that once the hotel has a non-refundable advanced purchase reservation booked it's totally up to them to cancel it. Which makes sense and I understand. So, I tried Mary in reservations one last time. This time she gave me a huge attitude, said that the Priority Club people lied to me and that she would contact them herself and have them call me. That was five hours ago, no call. So I get it, the hotel got their money out of me upfront and they are totally within their rights to keep it. They are at the whim of people canceling reservations so when someone pays up front they are going to keep that money. But I just hate the way they went about it. kind of misleading website aside, Mary in reservations straight up lied to me twice, once with attitude. I'm a big boy if you want to keep the money I paid and are within your rights to keep it I understand. But don't lie to me and say there is \"absolutely nothing you can do\" and only Priority Club could cancel the reservation. The funny thing is I 100% plan on making this trip, and will have 20 people coming with me. I was planning on booking 5-10 additional rooms later this month on top of the five I already booked, but I guarantee those additional rooms will not be at this Crown Plaza. In addition I plan on never saying at a Priority Club property again. I screwed up, I get that.

The package included a one night stay at one of their suites with a romantic dinner. 03/02/12 Friday late afternoon my husbands calls me and tells me he is going to run a little late from work and since it started snowing outside, i was worried we will not be able to make our reservation. At 4:30 I called the front desk and spoke to a Lady, and explained her the situation, she told me that the restaurant stops serving at 10:30pm, however since we bought the package deal, we would be able to use it for a breakfast or lunch the next day. If we arrive to late at the hotel. Since we could t reschedule the reservation, because it was less then 24 hours. Which all was totally understandable and fine with me. We arrived at the hotel at 9:30pm. Another lady at the front desk checked us in and and we told her that we would be not having our dinner anymore but use it for the breakfast in the morning. As we 'had\" to leave the city by noon. She took our living social receipt and said it was fine, but she never returned us our voucher or receipt. Later as we arrived in our room, i saw the guest book and saw that the sky lounge offered breakfast in the morning, so i called the front desk again, to confirm that \"We are having the breakfast at the sky lounge\" the next morning. And the lady at the phone said, that would be ok. The next morning we go upstairs to the sky lounge and told the bartender that we are guest trough living social. And he just sat us and asked us what we wanted to drink. As we proceed downstairs to the checkout counter, we received a final bill of an additional $70. Which we did not quite understand except the $12 for tax. We thought we were using our free breakfast from the package. But the lady at the front desk informed us that we had the breakfast at the sky lounge and it was going to be an additional $58, and she told us that we had used our breakfast voucher at the wrong place??!! And see, this is why i would never come back. Throughout our whole entire stay at this hotel, my husband and me encountered different types of service people. We spoke to different people at the front desk over the phone and in person, and even the waiter upstairs, and every single one of them failed to tell us that we could not use our dinner from the elephant bar at the sky lounge upstairs. even though we told each one of them that we were with living social. At checkout I finally talk to the same lady that i called the previous day about our reservation. But i did not like how she handled this situation at all or how she treated me. She said that she informed me that i was able to use it for a lunch or dinner. and thats fine, however she failed to inform me that they had 2 different restaurants inside the hotel. We ended up paying $58 additionally, as she refused to make an adjustment. Even though every single one of her staff members including herself failed to inform us properly.I felt very unhappy as we left the hotel and would def. not be able to make a recommendation upon my experience . I expected a little better, since it was advertise as a 4 star hotel. By the way we never used our food \"voucher\" as we had to leave the city by 12noon.

No in room movies, which we usually get for the kids so that was a bummer but oh well. Don't touch anything in the honor bar, there are sensors and you'll be charged.

The room was nice. It had a desk, a hide-a-bed. flat screen TV, and minibar-fridge in the living room. The bathroom was standard, clean, nothing out of the ordinary for a hotel. The bedroom had a king size bed and a TV. All pillows including the extras for the hide-a-bed were feather down. The room was very clean, no complaints at all. The lobby was nice enough, but there wasn't much going on. Check in was quick and easy. Never had to wait long for an elevator. We checked out the sky lounge for sunday brunch, but didn't eat. It was a little pricey for the limited buffet. It did have a great view. The pool is on the roof, but was obviously closed and drained being it was February. I had read other reviews about the noise. My kids did remark that the noise from Michigan Avenue disturbed them a little. I had a long day and slept like a rock. Maybe the best aspect was the location. It is right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. We took the kids to the Water Tower Place to the American Girl & Lego stores. It is only about 3 blocks north of the hotel. We lucked out and had pretty good weather for the season. If you're not from New York, it probably doesn't get any better than this if you are looking for a big city experience.

Not good when you're in a hurry. And of course, the $4 cokes in the mini-bar were irritating.

The Elephant and Castle pub (attached to lobby) is fantastic for a drink as you come and go. The hotel is perfectly situated for shopping and restaurants on the Michigan Mile. Another knock, truly out of their control, is that the hotel is situated directly across the street from a large hospital...and all of its ambulances and their sirens. It has never kept us up at night, but is something to consider. Again, the location as a whole outweighs the hospital noise. If you are a shopper or foodie you will gladly endure the odd ambulance in trade for a quick walk to nearly anything retail that you would need.

We had also seen reviews of the hotel on various websites and had no hesitation on booking it and we were not disappointed.

The beds were so wide and comfortable and the Zebra chairs were amazing. It was also nice to see programs of your favourite American shows first before they come back to GB. Turn right out of the Hotel, walk for 30 seconds and you're on Mag Mile (Magnificent Mile) where all the Designer shops are and soo many places to eat.

It also has views of the city and Lake Michigan (helps if a nice morning weather wise for the views). Another string to its bow is the fact that you don't need to leave the premises to go out for a drink as it's attached to a Pub on its ground floor (Genius).

I travel here for business quite a bit, but this trip brought both a change in pace and a traveling companion. My wife and I came to Chicago for a wedding being held at a local hotel. We decided to escape the crowd of wedding goers and save a few bucks and stay somewhere else close-by. Who would have known that we would land the Crown Plaza for such a great rate! We stayed 5 nights and were upgraded to a nice corner suite on the 22nd floor. The concierge welcomed us as we strode in at 11 p.m. absolutely exhausted from a long day of travel. He was very cordial and checked us in quickly. The upgraded room included a sitting room and wrap-around windows! The view was mostly high-rises, but looking east we could see the lake shore. Traveling without a computer, using the hotel's was easy to access and they were very nice with a choice between 2 macs or 2 pc's. The room was relatively clean, but the walls were a little thin...let your imagination run wild with this because you will probably be right with assuming what we heard. Needless to say it did not last too long and otherwise the hotel was quiet and pleasant.

They made multiple screw ups, some small and some big. Our first night we arrived exhausted with our small children in tow. We were pressured to hurry and unload even though there was no one else waiting behind us to get into the loading/unloading zone. I felt rather unwelcome, as that made getting settled quite stressful. We then got room service for dinner, and ordered a set of mini burgers for our toddler for dinner (kids menu). They arrived rare, which we did not ask for and is really dangerous for a kids' entree. I called to complain and they were actually gracious and gave us a fruit platter to compensate. This is the only time they made good on mistakes. Housekeeping walked into our room twice while we had the do not disturb sign up, once while our infant was asleep and the other time my husband was urinating. They never knocked. Their only parking option is valet, so we paid the $48/day for that. When we went to pick up the car, we saw that the door on my husband's brand new car had clearly been hit into a concrete wall, a big dent and scrape. The dash heads-up display that was glued on had been ripped off and stepped on and no longer works. Between these two things that was nearly $1000 damage to the car. We filled out a report but no one was apologetic, in fact they acted like it was not their problem. A small ding is one thing but this was a large dent and scrape. Not pleased at all.

There were numerous quirky things though. I might call it the good, the bad and the weird. THE GOOD The location, just barely off North Michigan Avenue is in the real heart of things, especially for anyone visiting on leisure. Tons of great restaurants and shopping is all in walking distance. Other attractions and destinations are a longer but nice walk in pleasant weather, a short inexpensive cab ride way or accessibly by subway, the nearest station being just five short blocks away from the hotel. I wouldn't call the room spacious, but it's not cramped either. There's adequate room for two. The firm beds with pillow-top mattresses and very comfy linens provide a great night's sleep. Having a window that opens enough to allow a decent amount of fresh air in is also a great feature of the room. Giant kudos to this hotel for having free wireless Internet. Not only that, but the quality and connection is solid and doesn't even require having to continually sign on an agree to terms each day. I didn't have a single hiccup with it during my entire stay, which is a rarity for free or pay Internet access. The minibar is not only appropriately stocked with useful/common/popular items (instead of some of the strange things that some hotels offer), but the pricing on it is very fair. Housekeeping was prompt, thorough and very courteous. The staff was generally very helpful with requests and directions. THE BAD My one major complaint was the heating/air-conditioning unit, which was controlled by an electronic thermostat, but curiously located on a side interior wall, though it looked like a wall unit that would typically face outside. (Note that it was set at 65 when I arrived and it quickly became too cold, and I'm not a person who usually minds cooler air). Regardless of the setting, it seemed that the fan wanted to run nonstop. The temperatures during my September stay were moderate with cool nights and I felt like Goldilocks, because it seemed that it would either make the room too cold or too hot, but never just right. Turning the thermostat setting up just one degree, to 69 or 70 would cause it to start firing heat, which was completely unnecessary. Before the first night, I quickly learned that turning it off completely and opening the window for a while during the daytime made it perfect, not to mention quieter. I If this were brought to management's attention, they would probably say they would address it, but really, I think it's just a matter of the way the system is and not that it's malfunctioning. 'd be willing to bet that in hotter or colder months, the unit would do it's job better. Speaking of air-conditioning, even on chilly nights, the central air in the hallway was blasting cold air at full throttle from the vents in front of the elevators. Speaking of elevators, as others have pointed out, there's only three servicing 28 floors of rooms plus the lobby and two other floors. For the most part, it wasn't a big problem, but if you happen to catch an elevator rush hour when several people are checking in or a lot of people attending a convention are returning to their rooms at about the same time, it can get rather interesting with long waits from the room floors and a line in the lobby. THE SORT-OF BAD Soundproofing wasn't a strong point. Thankfully, I couldn't hear anything from my neighbors' rooms sans one toilet that flushed at least once every half hour all day and all night, but even on the high floors with the windows closed, the windows don't keep out the sounds of frequent sirens, horns and some other street noise. It didn't bother me in the least, but some light sleepers may be annoyed, While there was a newer desk lamp, newer duvets and and a newer flat screen television, most of the furniture was older including two lamps and the desk. I don't mind the mix of eras, but the desk, which was nice and large to work on, creaked when it got a little push. A new desk with some desk level electrical outlets would be a welcome addition. The bellman was plenty polite, but I have no idea why he offered to get me a cab every time I came down. Even when I asked for DIRECTIONS to a restaurant that was barely a 10 minute walk away (on a beautiful night, I might add), his response was \"It's about a $5 cab ride. I'll get you a cab.\" I had to ask again, specifying and stressing that I was walking. Do the bellmen get a kickback from cabdrivers or what? THE WEIRD The cab-happy bellman could certainly fit into this category too. All of the front desk/guest services staff (it seems to be all one in lobby) were plenty nice and professional. Some were quick and confident in giving fairly simple directions and others had to pull out maps and/or ask someone (which sometimes led to asking someone else). They weren't beyond suggesting cabs either. When it came to accommodating a special request there were some inconsistencies -- one attendant gave an apologetic \"no\" without any checking while another was pleasant and more than happy to accommodate. The indoor pool and (outdoor) sundeck on the top floor seems like one of the hotel's treasures, and a secret treasure at that. The front desk staff never brought it up at check-in. On day 2 of my stay, I noticed it conservatively listed next to the 40th floor button on the elevator and checked it out. Another secret treasure is the breakfast (additional charge) available on the top floor, with a great view. Again, the front desk staff never mentioned it, but I noticed a very small sign for it somewhere in the hotel. The biggest unanswered question: Why are all glasses and cups stored at the furthest possible point from the sink? Seriously, both glasses and coffee cups were on a little table by the window at the far corner. They're almost hidden. Something should be rethought here. I've heard of water-saving shower-heads, but the fancy one in this room must hold the record -- at least for the minimal amount of water it puts out. I'm not sure that having to shower for twice as long ultimately saves anything. Personally, I'm of the opinion that they should save a little on energy with the nonstop AC and spend a little more on water. The fancy rod for the shower curtain, which curves out beyond the bathtub, requires users to really be sure to create good seal with the inner curtain. Amazingly, that meager amount of water can still flood the bathroom floor with the way the curtain is set up. I would have never guessed that I would ever notice that a room has too much artwork, but this one does. The room is still quite pleasant, but five wall-hangings in the modest size room is a bit much. Three of them are stunning black-and-white nicely framed large photos of the Chicago skyline and various Chicago landmarks. One of the three is partially masked by an old lamp that sits in front of it (photo provided). The two that seem out of place are panoramic color photos of the Chicago skyline that hang at a high level above each of two beds, above the already high good-looking headboards of the beds. Even more odd is that the two pictures are exactly identical. Someone astonishing is that in my room one of them was not centered with the bed -- and it was off by a sizable amount (picture provided).", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location\u201d", "Author": "rosamund_bone", "ReviewID": "UR118269636", "Content": "If this is your 1st time to Chicago, then you can't go wrong with this hotel.

Priority Club members will have the normal recognition. Only two check in counters so check in is a little slow. SECURITY: Anyone can walk into the hotel lobby and take the lift to any floor without the use of a key card - there is no security. No security camers on any of the floor corridors so secutity is very poor. There are no in room safes at this hotel and you need to apply for a security box at the front desk. This is inconvenient as you have to go to the reception to gain access to your security box. ROOMS: Windows are not double glazed. The hotel is directly opposite a major hospital so there are sirens going all night so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to get much sleep. It will make no difference how high your floor is as the noise will be the same - even on the 40th floor. Tip - use the ear plugs provided in the comfort pack and turn the airconditioning to the manual fan position so it will be on constantlly and help to drown out the siren noise. Bathrooms in the suites are very small and cramped so no room for toiletries on the side of the basin. Instead of being the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWindy City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it should be called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Siren City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because of the interminable sound of sirens all night. DRINKING WATER: No bottled water in your room so you need to purchase it from the Mini Bar. If you exit the hotel, turn right and take the next right into Michigan Ave you will find a Supermarket on the corner about 2 blocks up - most items available including water and Australian wine 750ml bottel for US$6. INTERNET: Very slow and drops out all the time so not very convenient. Also problems with not being able to send e-mails so had to open up a Gmail account to send any e-mails out. Definitely the worst internet connection I have ever experienced in any hotel ever. BREAKFAST: Sky lounge breakfast ok. Consists of scrambled eggs (made from powdered milk so not very good), bacon, saussages and potatoes. Good selection of fruit etc. and rolls (some not so fresh though as they appear to be a few days old). Tables in the Sky Lounge are the smallest I have ever encountered - just enough room for 2 plates and 2 cups of coffee. Very cramped. Breakfast also available at the Elephant and Crown which is the on site restaurant. We had dinner there one night but not good so would not recommend it for a meal at night. CLUB FLOOR: There is no club floor at this hotel. There is a Sky Lounge which is open for continental type breakfast only though. REFRIGERATOR: Read the fridge instructions very carefully because if you move anything the sensor will detect it and charge it directly to your room. It is not possible to place any of your own drinks, medications or other items in this fridge. You can have an additional fridge placed in your room for a cost of US$20 for the entire stay.

It was actually quite nice and we may consider staying again in the future. Upon check-in with the super friendly staff, we were upgraded to a room with a complimentary MAC desktop. Imagine that!?!? Not only do you get free Wi-Fi at this hotel but a huge desktop computer to use. Don't try to stream anything - it has it's limits. But it was nice when due to rain we wanted to find something else to do in the city and could easily look it up on the MAC. Our room was large and well-appointed. The King bed was deliciously soft and the lighting adequate for reading before bed. The bathroom was a wee bit small especially when trying to get ready for an outing at the same time as my husband. When I tried to put some soda in the refrigerator I noted the dire warning that if I put any personal items in the mini-bar, I would be charged a $25 restocking fee. Yikes! They suggest asking for an additional refrigerator for the room which I'm quite sure you would have to pay for. Fortunately, they provide a large ice bucket and a couple cans of soda stay adequately cold in that. Housekeeping must be a bit over-worked as they did not get to our room until later in the afternoon. We also discovered a cashew left by a previous guest next to the chair which means they don't vacuum quite as thoroughly as one would hope. I can live with an errant cashew. The air conditioning unit was a whole other problem. When we arrived, the room was absolutely frigid and the AC was set at 65. We turned it to a more palatable 72 and the heat came on. We turned it back a bit to 68 and were soon back at the North Pole. Turning it to 70 resulted in the heat coming back on. After an hour of experimenting, we were finally able to get a fairly comfortable temperature at 73 (go figure) but didn't dare try to change it after that in fear that we would be frozen or parboiled. We probably should have mentioned it but previous experience with similar problems at a hotel resulted in too much hassle to make complaining worth it and we did after much experimenting, end up fairly comfortable. Avenue - if you are reading this - the AC problem was in room 3301. Also, the air conditioning unit is louder than many of the planes we saw at the Air and Water Show. But it helped to drown out the frequent ambulance sirens. The hotel also thoughtfully provides a set of ear-plugs. One wonders if they are to drown out the sirens or the air conditioning unit?!?!?

There is a roof top pool with a terrific view - the pool area is rather small and when we went to check it out, the eight or ten people up there made the area quite crowded so we crossed that activity off our list. The hotel also offers a breakfast buffet which at the time of this review was $17 per person. After reading some other reviews and considering the price, we decided to enjoy breakfast elsewhere. There's lots of great choices in the area for a lot less money. Parking is priced at $48 per night just so you know. Having lived in the Chicago area for years we know that just a couple of blocks off of Michigan Avenue to the west is a plethora of less expensive parking buildings and lots if you don't mind walking a couple of blocks. The location of the hotel is great - just a short block off of Michigan Avenue. We walked over to the Chicago River to have dinner at a restaurant just off of LaSalle. We did a lot of shopping just a couple blocks away at Water Tower Place. We enjoyed a concert at Millenium Park and we walked up to North Avenue Beach for the Air and Water Show. Cabs are easy to come by and the subway and buses are all close-by if you do not enjoy walking. Will I stay at the Avenue again - I just might. The location, the view from our room, the comfy bed, the wonderful staff all make returning a possibility. The noisy persnickety air conditioning makes returning a wee bit less of a possibility.

We stayed in a one bedroom corner suite at the Avenue Crowne Plaza just off Michigan Avenue. The room was spectacular, bigger and better than in the photographs and immaculately clean. The bathroom had a rain shower and was a good size. There is no in-room fridge, which was a bit inconvenient as we had to keep our beer cool by putting it into the ice bucket. You could rent a fridge for $20.00, but we didn't bother as this was only a minor detail. However, I would recommend that the hotel reconsider putting a fridge in each room as this would indeed upgrade the already excellent focus on the customer needs. The hotel does not have a bar or restaurant, but is adjacent to the Elephant and Castle Pub, where we had an excellent breakfast for around $8.00 each. The hotel does have a breakfast buffet available in the sky lounge on the 40th floor, but we do not recommend it - it was very pricey and the breakfast was not the greatest. So unless you want to go up for the view - which you can see from the outdoor pool area, we would suggest you skip the hotel breakfast ($40.00 for two) and head downtown to the many excellent and economical breakfast joints that surround the hotel. We would also recommend you park in one of the self-park lots, or train it in, as the parking at the hotel was $48.00/night.

The lounge is suppose to be for priority club members but others were coming in for it so some of us ended at the bar while others sat a small table.

The rooms were well appointed, though maybe a touch small (Double Queen Room). The only real downside was the sound of the emergency vehicles. We heard them during the day, which didn't bother us, but also during the night, making it difficult to sleep. Perhaps because we were on a high floor, the noise seemed louder as it echoed between the buildings...the sirems were definitely louder than we've ever experienced before, and it woke us 3 to 4 times per night into the early morning...makes for unrestful sleep.

Internet access is free and is both wired and wireless. Plus the business center is free, even for printing. This was convenient for both maps and boarding passes. There are 2 macs and 2 pcs, so waiting was never an issue. Desk staff and housekeeping staff were all polite, helpful and prompt. As an example, we didn't have a car, but were incorrectly charged for parking. They simply removed the charge, no haggling, no second guessing. We appreciated that. Very professional customer service. We stayed for a week and the housekeeping staff was always very good about anything we needed. A little disappointed there was no refrigerator. One was available for the week for $20 (and we stayed for a week). Not sure what a nightly charge would be. I wouldn't have minded paying $20 for the week, but we declined the frig, since there was no microwave either. An inconvenience, but not a negative, as long as you are forewarned. In downtown Chicago there are 24-hour drug stores and convenience stores every block, so we never wanted for cold drinks, cheap snacks, fresh fruit, and the like. The hotel location is prime. Several bus lines run along Michigan Ave and are only a block from the hotel, plus buses into the Loop are easy to find too. Check out www.transitchicago.com to easily find a route to the museums, neighborhoods, or downtown. We bought the unlimited-use bus pass for 7 days for $23.00 (at the Walgreen's two blocks from the hotel). We easily made it to Wicker Park, Lincoln Park, Wrigleyville, Kedzie, all the downtown museums, and the science and industry museum south of downtown.

We shopped around for good rates, and paid a very decent rate for a king sized room for a night. The location was perfect for what we had planned to do (15 minute cab ride to the United Center, a couple blocks from navy pier and only a block off of Michigan Ave.) First, the valet parking was a little steep (although, normal for the city), so we parked at Navy Pier (14$ for 24 hours) and took a cab over to the hotel. Check in went smoothly and quickly (Emily was very sweet and efficient). We were able to choose the floor we stayed on. We ended up on the 37th floor with an amazing view of both the lake and Michigan Ave. Our room was amazing, and much more than we expected. We were both very impressed by everything in the room. The only problem that I encountered was that the lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom did not turn on, but it was not a real problem as I didn't really use it. I also loved the full length mirror in the room. We were not in the room for very long, pretty much just used it to sleep, but the time we were in there, we loved it. The bed was AMAZING. We agreed that it was one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in and wished we had the hotel for a second night, just for that reason! I read some complaints about the elevators being slow, but we did not encounter anything like that. This could have been because we were there on a Wednesday night, and the hotel did not seem particularly crowded (in fact, I think we only encountered one other guest the entire time there.) Also, we did not notice any of the noise that I read about in other reviews. They also had free wifi (which is apparently not the case at some hotels these days) and it was very fast and easy to access. We ended up getting some food and drinks in the restaurant attached to the hotel, both before and after the hockey game. Both of us really liked the atmosphere of the bar, and the nachos were pretty delicious, also. My boyfriend also really liked the selection of beers that were available. The only thing that turned me off a bit, was at checkout, we asked to check our bags, as we were going to be shopping, going to the art institute, etc for the day.

The reservation folks are most accommodating of the various arrival times, and the front desk staff are very helpful. Our meet and greet luncheon party catered in one of the event rooms were fabulous. They provided us with a generous room which was bright and spacious where the buffet presentation was lovely , the food delicious and the service excellent. Their audio/video equipment was first class, taking many of us down a lovely memory lane. There are quite a few public areas on the 7th and 13th fl where many of us congretated late into the evening to catch up, with plenty of hugs and tears to go along. The young cousins enjoyed the outdoor swimming pool on the 40th floor while the grannies simply sat and enjoyed the aerial view of Chicago's skyline. The hotel location is tops! The Magnificient Mile of N. Michigan Ave is actually just around the corner! Our group partied together by walking everywhere. We walked to the Chicago River boat tour, Navy Pier, the Millenium Park and the Art Institute. We walked to Dominick's for fresh fruit and bottled water. We dined together at the Corner Bakery, TGIF, Gino's Pizza East, Portillo's Hot Dogs, Panera Bread, Pockets and Morton's. The amazing grace is that they are all within 15 minutes of walking distance, and some are simply just around the corner. I must say we walked up our appetite, and after a scrumptuous dinner, we walked it off by heading out to the Lake to cool off in a hot summer evening.

After researching many hotels in the downtown area based on location and price we narrowed our choices down to a few that fit our requirements. One of the elements that we were interested in was a swimming pool, so I sent an email to the Crowne Plaza Avenue Chicago to see if it was opened, and their quick response was that it was under repair until the Memorial Day weekend, but we received incentive to try this hotel anyway, and how glad we are that we did. Personal attention was given by management in the form of our email, when we arrived at the hotel we were greeted and handle professionally and expediently. Once we arrived in our room we were very pleased by the comfort and luxury of our corner suite, which was spacious, well appointed and very relaxing and favored a view of the surrounding buildings, (we were on the 27th floor, but in the Miracle Mile part of Chicago where this hotel is located, most buildings are double that in height), but we were too busy to spend much time looking out at the view. What we did love about our room was the washroom facilities, shower and tub, simply yet modern and clean. But first and foremost was our bed, which was extremely comfortable and may have actually been the best hotel bed I have ever slept on, definitely high quality for comfort and support and king sized too. My spouse and I had 3 great night's worth of sleep, which is more important than you think when you are travelling away from home. We were right beside the Miracle Mile and in close proximity to everything that you might want to do in Chicago if you are on a visit. What we did in Chicago that I would recommend. 1. The Architectural River Cruise 2. A trip to the Skydeck at the Willis Tower.........and do step out on the Ledge......if you dare! 3. Shopping on the Miracle Mile, even if it is window shopping. 4. Grant's Park 5. Lou Mitchell's for breakfast.........simply the best! 6. Get a CTA day pass to get around, if you want to go to a baseball game or even somewhere too far to walk. 7. Rent A Bike and take a ride and get some excercise on the Lakefront. 8. Take the Hop on and Hop off double decker bus. 9. Do eat a deep dish pizza...........they're not as filling as you may think! 10. We ran out of time to do everything we wanted..........so we will come back again and stay at the Crowne Plaza Avenue Downtown Chicago. I give this hotel 5 stars all the way around because it met our needs and went beyond, the service was awesome and the room extremely comfortable and relaxing, the bed comfort second to none.

Second, the picture shows a roof top pool, but it looks closed in. This is not the case, it is an outdoor pool. So, even when it is finished, it will be open only in the summer months. Do not count on going to this pool for your children to swim. Pick another hotel!! 4. The rooms were not up to standards of a four star hotel. The sheets were rough to the touch also.

The E&C pub off the lobby was very good for breakfasts and the occasional dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c excellent selection of on-tap beers for the Canadian traveller that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the biggest fan of American suds (although, I did try the Fat Tire Ale and the Samuel Adams Lager, and both were quite nice). Also, just being in a pub is about as close to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home-away-from-home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type feeling as one can get when visiting the US from Canada.

That said, deep-dish is a must do in Chicago, and this is the place to do it! ACCOMMODATIONS The room was fairly large, but with an awkward setup that made navigating around the king bed and office desk/chair somewhat challenging. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor needs some updating though in terms of drapery, wallpaper and carpeting (the hallways outside the rooms could also use some freshening-up). The king bed & pillows were exceptionally comfortable! Seriously, I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t emphasize enough how comfortable this bed was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I slept like a rock every night! The windows opened to allow for fresh air, and the ac/heater worked perfectly (although it was a little noisy). The washroom wallpaper was peeling slightly, the toilet looks like a public washroom unit, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no exhaust fan in the washroom (this is where opening the window comes in handy!). That said, the room was very clean and was kept that way every day by the staff. OVERALL For the price I paid (less than $100 US per night pre-paid), this was an outstanding hotel for the location!

I have been flying with Porter for several years now, and they are certainly my regional carrier of choice. The staff, service and flights are impeccable, and the prices can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beaten (return flight from Ottawa to Chicago was about $350). Porter is the way to go folks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c try it and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely never fly Air Canada again (unless Porter can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get you there)!

The receptionist who checked us in, a woman named Arta, was very impolite and did not even have the courtesy to give us a smile.

When we checked in, Arta said she did not receive any request and gave us what was available. When we went to see the rooms, we were very disappointed. One of the rooms (3220) were still ok, but the other one (3219) was much smaller, dirtier and had a broken fridge. We went down to the receptionist and when we told her we did not like the room, she gave us attitude and said \"Whats wrong with the room? Its a nice room.\" She offered us another room but it turned out that it was a similar room on a floor that was much lower than our friends' rooms.

I must say the best part about this hotel besides the location (steps from Mag Mile), are the beds. The beds were perhaps some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in in a hotel.

To be honest, I usually stay at several of the Hilton properties around Chicago because I am an Hhonors Diamond level, but this stay was already pre-arranged for our group, and I stay at Holiday Inn/Priority Club properties as a back-up. I was pleasantly surprised at the room quality, outstanding service and superb location, especially for the price! We easily walked a block or two to the John Hancock Center for evening cocktails, had only a few streets to all of the famous Chicago restaurants & shopping spots, and quick, unlimited in-out priviledges for the valet parking that was connected to the hotel lobby ($46/nt.) Sarah at the front desk was my angel, as at check-in, I asked for a possible upgrade to a suite, so that our group could congregate in one room and relax, after our daily convention meetings. She not only was able to upgrade me, she took the time to upgrade ALL 5 of the rooms in our party to 2-room suites, which were spacious, super-comfortable, and made our business trip so much more pleasant and affordable! (We found a liquor store closeby where we purchased some beer, wine & snacks that we shared in the suite, each night!) It saved us all from a heafty bar bill, as the adjacent restaurant had the typcial Chicago prices for food and beverages. Sarah is a real asset to this hotel, so be sure she is the one who handles your check-in and questions! (I thought for sure she was the hotel manager, as she was so professional and it seemed that the other employees kept asking her questions all the time! If the GM reads these threads, you need to keep that girl around for awhile! :) I guess my only complaint would be the pricey breakfast that is offered upstairs in the lounge. My Diamond priviledges at Hiltons/Homewoods/Doubletrees/Embassy Suites & even The Whit Chicago, always include continental breakfast with the room rate. This hotel charges $18 for breakfast, which I didn't think was worth it. A more reasonable option for convention attendees & families would be very popular, if offered! I just walked across the street one block to the Corner Bakery and had a hot sandwhich and coffer for under $6 bucks. I know that sounds a bit petty when staying in Chicago, but after a few days, that $18/day could easily add up to a nice meal at Cheesecake Factory or Ed Debevics, when most of us just want a muffin and some juice for breakfast, anyway! The hotel pool was under renovation, so we didn't use that on this visit, either. I would recommend this hotel for the clean, large rooms, good staff and primo location. I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for Peace & Quiet, as it is located next to the hospital, and you typically hear sirens non-stop. (I like city noise so I just tune them out, but if I was deliberately trying to sleep before a long flight or maybe a job interview, I'd choose somewhere with less street noise & traffic!) Still, I don't think you'll be disappointed staying here! Check out their rate that includes a jewelry choice AND room for only $149/nt!

We took a taxi from O'Hare and I'd advise anyone doing this to hand over the address to the driver, we said we needed The Avenue on E.Huron and said it was a Crowne Plaza, then we were taken to the wrong Crowne Plaza. It was quickly sorted and no real problem but I believe the hotel recently changed name so to avoid confusion, hand over the address (most taxi drivers we used didn't speak very good English either, so that made things harder) We booked a one bedroom suite and were lucky to get a 35th floor corner suite, with excellent views of the city. It was a very large suite, king bed, TV in each room, individual heating in each room, wi-fi, mini bar, excellent coffee machine etc There was no food included but for the price we paid, this wasn't an issue. There is an Elephant and Castle pub in the same building and while I'm not one for visiting \"English\" or \"Irish\" pubs while away from home, this was more of a restaurant selling mighty fine food, with some decent beers on tap. If you're looking for a one bedroom suite, a minute from the shops, you'll struggle to find anything this good at such a good price. It's only a 10 minute walk to the Wrigley Building/ Chicago River, or 15 minutes to Cloud Gate (The Bean). It's only 5 minutes from the Water Tower and John Hancock Building and a few more steps to the Excellent Cheesecake Factory! A small tip - if you're going up the Willis (Sears) Tower, it opens around 10, so go a little earlier and visit Lou Mitchell's Cafe a couple of blocks away. It's an original at the start of Route 66, you're given a small doughnut on arrival, the ladies get a free box of milk duds, the panckaes are huge, the service is excellent and you won't need anything else until much later on!

My family is from Chicago, however, I'd never stayed at this particular hotel before. This was my boyfriends first trip to Chicago for a long weekend... St. Patrick's Day weekend. After booking the hotel, we called and asked if there was a way to reserve a king room. We were told we had to wait until the day of our reservations, but it shouldn't be a problem since they had plenty of rooms available. We waited. My boyfriend was flying in from the east coast and wouldn't be arriving until late... like nearly 9:30 p.m. We called the day of our reservation only to be told that we couldn't request a king room. Okay...Would it be possible for an early check in by me, his girlfriend, to ensure that we got the room we wanted? Not possible. The name was reserved in my boyfriends name, not mine and we would have to switch it by contacting Priceline. Big hassle. So, we decided to take our chances and wait until we arrived late. We got a basic room with two queen beds and a terrific view of air conditioning units. We generally stay in a 4 star or better hotels, but this fell far below our expectations. The bathroom was small and it didn't have a fan. That was inconvenient due to the steam from the shower... The door had a large gap under it and we shoved a bath towel under the door to keep the noise down from the cleaning staff or other hotel guests. The thermostat was difficult to use too. It ran constantly... either blowing cold air or hot. We ordered room service the first morning which was pretty good, so no problems there. Pricey, but it usually is.

I have never had trouble getting excellent hotels for a steal in Chicago, but this weekend was an exception. We got a \"great\" deal for the weekend at the Avenue. Average price per night was $225. My first impressions: Our room was HUGE --you could have fit 4 queen beds in there comfortably. The problem with this is that the tv was so far from the bed, I couldn't read the baseball score! And I have perfect vision. Also, there was a random medical grade hospital seat in our room, even though we weren't a handicapped accessible room. The good: Location is to die for, would stay here again knowing what to expect and loving the location. The beds are comfy. The curtains block out all light :-) It's a clean and comfortable (not exceptional) hotel. The bad: Water pressure is NON existent. I am all for being green, but the shower heads are abysmal. There is no safe in the room, but there are lock boxes at the front desk. This is incredibly inconvenient. I'm not carrying the queen's jewels, but I like to put my jewelry in a safe when I am gone, along with my ipod or camera, or even my wallet if I am not carrying the whole thing. The lock box was SUCH a pain, as I had to constantly wait in line while people were checking in/out to access it. Also, several things in the room were broken--a sliding door on the closet and the vanity light didn't work (was nice that they had a lighted, magnified mirror though). I even mentioned the terrible water pressure when at the lock box, and kind of got a shrugged \"sorry\" but there's nothing we can do. Summary: All in all, a good hotel if you are prepared for what I consider a 3.5 star experience. I would stay here again, the staff was very nice, the pub had great shepherds pie, and most importantly, the bed was comfortable with great pillows. And the location is fantastic. If you are expecting a 4 star hotel, I would stay elsewhere.

Also don't eat at Pizzeria Uno as its not real one down Ohio St. Totally recommend The Corner Bakery Cafe, which is left out of the hotel, to edge of that block then turn right to end of that block bout 3 min walk!! It was best breakfast I had on our trip! Cinnamon rolls to die for, plus my mate enjoyed her Oatmeal. Sear aka Willis Tower is brilliant especially at twilight. The Hancock tower was good also.

The Avenue has invested wisely and well in amenities that really matter, while paring away costly but less vital elements. You'll find great beds, linens and housekeeping here, for instance, but no fancy lobby or cable TV. That adds up to a great value in a neighborhood where other hotels are charging 30-40% more. Pros: -- Tailored, serenely modern decor; not a floral print anywhere -- Sumptuous bed linens with plenty of pillows -- Clean rooms and public areas -- Huge windows and ample space in our \"Junior Suite,\" essentially a large room with a sitting area nicely furnished with a leather couch, coffee table and armchair. It even had a walk-in closet. -- Kid friendly, but not kid overrun. -- All-pro front desk staff. Jael and Julio went to great lengths to resolve a problem caused by the room discounter we used. -- Casual restaurant and elegant lounge both on premises -- Just a block from the ideal segment of Michigan Ave., where the Water Tower, stores and parks are nirvana for shoppers, people watchers and sightseers. -- Great soundproofing -- A small, pleasant outdoor rooftop pool and deck on the 40th floor is a perfect escape from Chicago's street-level bustle. We saw a family bring in fruit, bread and cheese to picnic with a bird's eye view of the city and lake. -- Brunch in the 40th-floor Sky Lounge was pricey, but the food was great and service fast and friendly. Cons: -- No convenience store on premises...but in this neighborhood, none's really needed. -- Cheesy disposable cups for the in-room coffee maker, and no discernible recycling effort, in this otherwise Green hotel. -- 10 or 12 TV channels just aren't enough, according to the insomniac in our party. -- Powerful but noisy AC -- A label on the refrigerator warning of a $25 restocking fee scared us so badly we never even opened the darn thing. Which is probably just as well. -- The lobby is small, with utilitarian seating and minimal decor. If you like lounging around opulent lobbies and lobby bars, this is not your hotel. On the other hand, you'll be thrilled if you like getting from the front door to the elevator bank quickly, without navigating obstacles. For breakfast, walk two blocks to Cafe Lux on Michigan for amazing made-to-order beignets, great coffee, and a fantastic menu selection.

The rooms are a tad tiny but for the time we were in it, the space was fine. The rooms have very large windows and our view was great. We could see the lake to our right, Gino's East right below, and the Magnificant Mile to the left. Our king bed was very comfortable. The shower/bathroom was a little small but we managed. We had problems with our wireless internet the first night but tech support walked us through. The air conditioners have sensors and kick on when you walk through the door. The elevators were pretty quick. Sometimes they were on the sluggish side but I never complained. The front desk was helpful when it wasn't real busy. We did ask for priority seating for Gino's East since there was a really long line and received that. 20 mins later we were seated!! We never went swimming but the water is heated and it has a great view. We also never had a chance to eat at the two restaurants. Parking is steep . . .$49/day, but that is Chicago. I wish they would offer some type of discount for hotel guests. Our last night there was also the worst. We had a group of young adults on our floor. When we seen security there once around 8:30 pm, we knew we might be in for a long night. About 1:00 am the group returned and were extremely loud, slamming doors, foul language, yelling/screaming at each other. We called security and they came up shortly after. They were warned. They were quiet for a little while and then a couple was outside our door arguing and yelling at each other. My husband then called security and they came a second time. Shortly thereafter the cops arrived. I'm not sure what happened but luckily I was able to go to sleep and tune it all out. I would have liked to see the hotel escort this whole group out of the hotel so the other guests could get some peace and quiet. A group shouldn't have to be warned more than once to be quiet.

The lobby has an interesting design with somewhat annoying euro-pop techno music playing. The sky lounge seemed a bit small, but cozy. The ambiance is nice except the same music in lobby, plays there, loudly. The drink prices there were outrageous though, $9 for a rum and coke. I had to make sure one lasted awhile! The pool area was also small but nice. The pool was clean and nice and warm. Just a handy tip is that there is a dunkin donuts and a 7-11 two or three blocks down St Clair so you can save a little money there to dodge the breakfast costs in the hotel. The concierge was friendly and helpful in arranging the boat tour and just general getting around. This hotel is in fairly comfortable walking range of the Navy Pier, Ogden Slip (where some of the boat tours leave from) The Magnificent Mile, and Millennium Park. The room itself was spacious with a feeling of privacy even when sharing. The bathroom is a wonderful size, with plenty of space to change without standing in the splash of the shower. The shower though left much to be desired. The fixtures were loose against the wall and the pressure was dreadful. You would have better luck bathing in a water fountain. The water just dribbled out and never really left you feeling clean. Everything else about the bathroom was great. I'm not sure if the water pressure was poor due to being on the 34th floor or what, but I was glad I didn't take advantage of the weight room because I know I would have never gotten the sweat off of me. Outside the window you can hear the ambulances coming into Northwestern University Hospital, but its not too bad as it quiets down at night and if you're from another city, like I am, the sound kind of disappears. It was nice though to have free wireless internet! Overall we did have a pretty comfortable stay here, but I think the hotel needs a little bit more work, before it can really be as classy as its neighbors.

We try to stay at a different hotel every time to experience all the fun things to do in Chicago. I decided on the Avenue hotel this year because of its location (which is excellent) and its price happened to be within my budget. I called the hotel directly to find out if they were doing anything special for Mother's Day as most hotels where we've stayed over the years have done. They explained to me that they had a special package deal that weekend (for an extra charge) that included complimentary brunch and mimosas. I thought, \"My Mom will love that\" and made my reservations. When we got there, we were immediately surprised at how small the lobby was compared to all the other places we have stayed in the city. When we got to our room, again, we were dissappointed by how small and dark it was. I had brought an expensive, special bottle of wine to share with my Mom over the weekend only to find that in order to keep it cold, I had to pay $25 for the USE of the refrigerator. Keep in mind, I wasn't planning on consuming anything FROM the refrigerator. The special wine is a tradition and I have NEVER been charged for the use of the refrigerator in any other hotel. The first morning, when we got up, we were excited about having our complimentary brunch and a mimosa and headed to the \"Sky Lounge\" to eat. The front desk had given us vouchers for the two days. The brunch was just ok (definitely not worth the extra money I paid). What really irked me though was, when we asked the semi-comatose and unfriendly \"waiter\" for our mimosas, he said, \"Uh, we don't serve alcohol until after five.\" Now this is an orange juice-based drink (that we already paid for, mind you) and is traditionally drank during, I don't know, BRUNCH-THE TIME BETWEEN BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. We were very dissappointed as my Mom had her heart set on the extravagant drink. We ended up going down to the neighboring Elephant lounge and ordered them there. When we complained to the front desk, absolutely nothing was done. We weren't given our money back for the cost of the drinks (which would have been four total). Later that week, I contacted the manager who credited my credit card $50 for the mixup. Of course that was appreciated but it should have been addressed when we complained. The one bright spot was the concierge who was incredibly helpful in suggesting where to have dinner. All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience but it wasn't a memorable one.

Overall, I felt that I was staying in an old building that had been superficially spruced up to try and meet a four-star level. There is no proper concierge or concierge desk (if there is, it is hidden). It seems that the front desk staff doubles as concierges. The day we checked in we asked for information about the river architectural tours (seemingly one of the more popular tourist activities in the city). We waited a few minutes while two staff members rifled through a desk to find brochures. In the end, they could not find anything. One of them very kindly gave us a map and directions to the site of one of the tour companies--that was very helpful. I, do, however, expect more from a four-star hotel. A proper concierge at a proper four-star hotel would have booked the tour for me or at least had ready access to brochures and detailed information. Housekeeping came into our room without knocking about 2 hours before check-out time (we were checking out at the regular check-out time for all guests). The bed was very, very uncomfortable--it sloped in the middle and tilted toward the head. The staff, while friendly, were not as professional/formal as I'd expect from a four-star hotel in one of the largest cities in the country. The exception was one gentleman at the front desk who might have been Mik, the general manager. The lotion in the bathroom had a seal, and the seal was broken. I don't usually see seals on hotel bathroom amenities, but when there is a seal and it's broken, it makes you feel like you are using used lotion... Would I stay here again?

Overall I thought this hotel was a fantastic value for what we got. We have stayed many places in the downtown Chicago area, from the way overpriced Hyatt Regency on Wacker to much smaller hotels like the Rafaello and Allerton. I decided I will do this review as a pros and cons list. Pros: -Great value. We paid $108.00 to stay in a king bed suite - you don't easily find this in the city. -The room. The bed was fantastically comfortable. We spent many hours just laying in it and staring out the picture window. Also, the sleeper sofa in the living room was nice to pull out and watch a movie from, although not too comfortable. -Location. Half a block east of Michigan Ave. is great. Also close to the Chicago Red Line stop if you want to go elsewhere in the city. -The view. We were on the 36th floor in a corner suite looking south. I haven't had a better view of the city from any hotel. Cons: (some of these are pretty picky details) -The TV in the bedroom was an old tube TV of about 24 inches. An upgrade would be nice. -The toilet was *very* loud in the bathroom. Easily enough to wake me up at night. It seemed I could hear it from other rooms as well. -The heating and AC seemed a little strange. We had it set to 65 to try to cool the room and there was heat coming out. It seemed to stay at a comfortable temp, but not what it was set to. -Parking. I have seen many people complain about $48.00 for parking. This is common for valet in the city, anywhere from $40-50. Park a block east at the hospital and you'll pay less than $20 per day. All in all for what is rated as a 3-star hotel this was a fantastic stay. I would definitely go here again, maybe just bring earplugs to sleep with.

One was just OK size wise, and 3 were larger suites with wonderful views of downtown and\\or Lake Michigan. Make sure to ask reservations staff to get the room size and view that you want. Reservations staff was very accommodating - our non-profit group received a free upgrade (to suites) from their friendly staff - how nice! Rooms were very clean and modern. Beds were very comfortable. There are only eight rooms on each floor so sleeping was easy. It was quiet considering the proximity to Northwestern Memorial and Michigan Avenue.

The lobby is small -- but you are greeted promptly by the doorman who arranges for valet parking as well as the person who handles baggage valet. Check in was smooth and took all of about 3-minutes. We were in our room on the 36th floor within 10-minutes of pulling up in front of the hotel. We did not eat in the restaurants or visit the Sky Bar, so I cannot comment on that, but my son did order a cheeseburger and fries from room service one night. The price was reasonable for room service in a major city, and the service was fast and food fresh. My teenage son did call me on my cell phone from the room, and the charges were outrageous. He dialed the wrong number once for $10.95, reached my voicemail once for another $10.95, and talked to me for 3-minutes for $15.00. Ouch! We asked for a room on a high floor and received it. We faced the city (not the water) and the children enjoyed the view and marveled at how high up we were (36th floor.) The room itself was medium sized and tastefully decorated in browns, beiges, and ice blue (up-to-date color scheme and furnishings.) The beds were comfortable with down comforters and pillows. There was a mini-bar ($4 for an 8 ounce Coke.) On the second night we realized that there was a 7/11 store within 2 blocks, so bought our drinks there before turning in for the night. The TV was a 32 inch flat screen, and there was a coffee maker in the room that made single cups from pods. The bathroom was a nice size and clean -- with the bowed shower rod for extra room in the shower. The hairdryer was high quality, the toilletries were sparse for three people, but I'm sure we could have asked form more. Our room was very quiet. I did not hear people in the hallway or doors slamming. It must be well insulated.

The rooms are old but refurbished and the beds with down alternative are a plus.

One drawback was that the hotel is right next to a hospital, so you do hear sirens all night, even being up that many stories high. Obviously not the hotel's fault, but still a minor annoyance. The beds were the best part of the room; they were super soft and we wanted to bring them home with us! Some other flaws with the room: the bathtub didn't drain, so you had to take a quick shower to avoid the tub filling up fast. And second, the hooks on the back of the bathroom doors fell right off if you put anything on them, so there was nowhere to hang clothing or towels. Actually, this bathroom had the least amount of places to put things than any hotel I've ever been in! So that's one suggestion I would make to the management staff at the hotel; a lot of people like it when the bathrooms have some small shelving or places to hang things. One good point about the staff...when we asked for something, they came with it right away. The concierge was also helpful in making calls to find us a restaurant of our liking. Other things worth mentioning: There was no mini fridge in the room, and that was $20 extra if you requested one. We would have liked to have one, but we didn't want to spend the extra money. Also, anything that you take from the snack fridge provided was $20 to replace, so that $4 pack of cookies could potentially turn pretty expensive!

Best part (in our opinion) of our stay at The Avenue was going to Elephant and Castle located just by the front doors in the lobby of the hotel. The bathroom in our room was decent-sized and had a shelf by the sink for extra room which I loved because I'm not a light packer. The water pressure in the shower was just right and had some space for extra products if needed. The only thing about the bathroom was in our room the hot was cold and the cold was hot in the shower which was confusing at first. The bed was a little on the hard side but the down pillows and blankets made up for it in my mind. Overall I didn't have any complaints about this hotel!
