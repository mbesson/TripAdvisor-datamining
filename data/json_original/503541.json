It is right across from the subway which is great for getting around. However, the entrance to the hostel is off a side street and there were always at least three prostitutes sitting outside the door. Half a block down is an 'erotic sex show' and this area was very seedy. My pre-teen daughters were fascinated by the hookers and watched them furtively from our balcony. There is lots of shopping up and down the busy street outside the hotel and also lots of restaurants. So this aspect is good. However, there is no air conditioning, only fans. Not a great family place to stay.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway", "Title": "\u201cLovely little hostel in the centre of everything!\u201d", "Author": "GaticaNera", "ReviewID": "UR133270419", "Content": "It was relatively cheap to stay here, considering it's located just off Gran Via with access to everything on your doorstep.

There was no aircon but we managed to buy a fan (which made it's way to friends thereafter). The room and bathroom are all very dated but it suits it and gives an antique sort of charm to the place.

Top position just around the Gran Via, in a calm, narrow street few metres away from Fuentcarral. I booked a double room with insuite bathroom. Everything perfect. Clean, lot of space available, very kind receptionists. The room was on the 7th floor. It was gorgeous! We could see from our balcony the Gran Via and far away the skyline of La Castellana. During the night we slept great. A double pain on the window insulates any noise from the outside. I would high suggest it.

As already has been mentioned the location is great. Could be easily reached by metro from the airport (gran via station located in about 50 meters from the hotel). There is an elevator in the building, so no worry about the stairs. The room is clean, seems to me that the walls were painted fresh recently. The room has a small TV (only Spanish channels), small fan, small safe (costs 1 euro to open each time). The room was cleaned daily and we had a new towels each day, only got 2 pieces of soap for 5 days though. They got breakfast there, but doesn't worth the money you pay for it. They got WiFi, which works only in their lobby. The hotel stuff are all nice people, do speak English, Spanish and some of them Russian (a nice surprise for me). The only major inconvenience is that the room could get noisy at night (the noise is coming from the Gran Via). Overall good place to stay on if you are planning to travel all day and only get to a hotel for a sleep.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNot bad, not great\u201d", "Author": "RoaryCat", "ReviewID": "UR106841228", "Content": "Stumbled into the Pereda after my flight into Madrid; the price was decent for 2 people and the room was clean and comfortable, the building secure (you have to buzz in from the stairwell and buzz into the building at night. Location is great; right next to the Gran Via Metro stop. However, the Gran Via can get loud at night with traffic and kids hanging out until 6am, the water pressure in the shower was really poor and while there was a safe we couldn't get the key out and when we asked about it the guy at the front desk had no idea what we were talking about! They serve breakfast but save your money - coffee, orange juice and packaged pastries. Much better options around Madrid. At first my wife and I hated the place and were looking to check out early but the experience got better and it's hard to find much better value for the price.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBasic, clean, very central, cheap\u201d", "Author": "brush-head", "ReviewID": "UR101419946", "Content": "Was about what we expected.

Having been before and stayed with family we were lucky to know where most things were and what to do. Hostal Pereda is in a perfect location right on Gran Via meaning you could walk to most places if you wanted to. (The metro station is right outside though which means it's easy to get to from the airport). The hostal itself and the rooms are surprisingly big and also quite basic but still have some character. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels and bedding. Our window view was terrible so I would request a front road view before your stay if possible. The staff aren't particularly friendly but it doesn't matter as we didn't spend much time in the hostal. We thought we had paid online so were unaware that you had to pay on departure which caused a bit of hassle as we were leaving. Another slight issue was the noise; we were woken up with lots of banging from around 7am each morning. Forgetting these couple of things though, it was excellent value for money and we would definitely stay again.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cNot luxurious, but fantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "veedub72", "ReviewID": "UR28568356", "Content": "This is a pretty quaint place - the rooms remind me of staying at my Grandma's place which is not necessarliy a bad thing! They're clean enough, have attached bathroom with hot water, and some rooms have a small balcony which opens out right onto Gran Via! So a brilliant location. If you're a light sleeper the street noise might be an issue, but it didn't bother us. McDonald's is right across the road (if you need a coffee etc) and the Gran Via Metro station is literally a 30 second walk from the front door. The area verges on a red light district so there are quite a few prostitutes around, but it's very safe and not an issue (well, it wasn't for us). WiFi is included in the room price, but breakfast isn't. We tried the breakfast one morning, and I wouldn't recommend it! There's a laundromat about 10 minutes walk away, and loads of restaurants and tapas bars. We stayed for 6 nights and it was fine for what we wanted (a place to sleep).

THe people are friendly, humble, and very courteous. The adventure of getting in a cage elevator, then entering your small modest room with a view of the Gran Via --that is, if you have the chance and opportunity to be on the top floors facing the street. If you want privacy ask for the rooms where the windows face towards the inside of the building. The walls may be thin, but just a phone call away and they are kept respectfully quiet. Breakfast is served, but there is so many walking distance places to have it, why bother? They offer sound advice for anything from great places to eat, wine, non-tourist, local places to visit. It's the Madrid you will savor. It's good, t's clean, and cheap. Now, just a matter of clarification. This is not a Best WEstern nor a Red Roof Inn, you may get some bathrooms where the shower or tub's water pressure is not what you expected. Yet, you can't go wrong. It is close to theatres, Cinemas, and El corte Ingles. Plaza del Sol, s less than 5 mnutes away, Plaza Mayor is a 10 minute walk, Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is a 15 minute walk.
