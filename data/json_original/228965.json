The rooms are a bit on the small side and the shower was very arkward to work out. But Hey when in Rome! Yes it is in a multi- cultured neighbourhood however we felt this added colour and flavour and felt quite safe at all times.. There are many small restaurants nearby, the Milky Bar seems very popular and is less than a block away.Opposite the hotel are two large markets; one selling all manner of clothing,bags and shoes. The other is fresh produce; a bonus if you have a craving for their delicious peaches and grapes. So tip #1 Be adventurous and try them as there are bargains to be had. The location is ideal for those needing theTermini Station, a ten minute walk away and the Metro is just behind the hotel. You can walk to the Colloseum and the Forum.

When looking for a hotel within our budget \u00a3300 and at 4 star, i was limited to ones quiet far from central, or others with not great reviews. The advsisor recommended this, and i thought that the reviews on this website were good enough for me to go ahead. However approaching the holiday, got anxious when i saw soem reviews from other websites. I needed to not worry thought! We had our 9 year daughter with her so safety was important, travellign to centre, and breakfast with room quality. All of these were very good. The staff were brilliant. Very accomodating, pleasant and helpful. Spoke great english and gave us a tips on where and when to go and best times etc. The cafe down the road - milky bar - is their local, and it was great for lunch and snacks. Bedroom was clean, quite big for a european hotel, and all the amenities i needed. The sofa bed was big enough for 2 kids, although we just had the one. Breakfast was again very good, included regular european food, eg croissants, pastries ( large selection), hot food, cold meats and cheese, cereals and much more. Hence we had a good start each morning. The location albeit is in an ethnic area, i can imagine is daunting at night. However we had no problem! The location, hotel and price outweighed it. Metro, 2 mins away, although we only used once!! Train station nearby - never used. We found it easier and nicer to walk to the colloseum from hotel all 3 days and take it from there. 20 mins sounds alot, but actually my duaghter managed fine, and we got to take in the surroundings. Generally a lot of walking involved in rome, and we were up to the challenge. We used an audio guide for the colloseum - wouildnt recommend that - it was 5.50 but we did not like it. Would have preferred a guide - 5 euros per person, but every hour so we didnt bother waiting. Howver we were approached by several tour operators on the way to vatican, but chose to go with one who was great! He took us to the office where there was others, we all had a radio and although initial start was shaky, was worth spending 20 pound extra on top of 20 pound for the man. He was very helpful, saved ALOT of queuing and was worht every penny if not more - we gave a generous tip. Journey from airport was initially tricky. Planned to get train, then things got confusing so opted for taxi. However a taxi just for us was 85 euros, if you prepared to share iwht others, which we were, bought the bill to 45 euros. Took about 45 mins to get there with traffic. On the way back, it was only half an hour. Had some noise at nice, but staff did point out that it was roadworks and that it was unfortunate. Didnt stop us sleeping well though.

I was very impressed with the Ambra Palace Best Western Hotel on the internet, and chose that as our first honeymoon hotel. Upon arrival, I was somewhat surprised at the appearance of the surroundings outside the hotel, and that hotel parking was 5 blocks away. This became a problem during our checking-out process. When we checked in, with our 9 bags, we were informed by the manager and porter that we could leave the bags in the area of the hotel, past the lobby, and they would be brought up by the porter. I was a little hesitant about this, but was told they would be safe. All of the bags made it up to our room safely. However, when we were checking out, after our three night stay, we brought the bags back down to the exact same location. The lobby was not busy because it was Noon, and most of the guests had probably checked out earlier. The staff knew I was leaving the bags there because I had to walk 5 blocks to get the car (not stated on Best Western.com.) My new wife was sitting near the bags, in the area provided by the hotel. However, with all of that being said, during the 15 minutes it took for me to get the car and return, my camera bag, containing my camera, camcorder, copies of all of our credit card and passport information and 3 days of honeymoon pictures was stolen; right from the exact same spot in the hotel that was supposedly safe during our check in. We spoke to the manager who told us we should have watched the bags better, and that it was our fault. That confused me because the bags were safe in that same area while we were checking IN, and neither my wife nor I were with them because we were being escorted up to our room by the porter. After I scoured the entire bottom floor of the hotel, frantically searching for the camera bag, we were told by the hotel staff to go to the American Embassy and the police station to report the theft. Upon our arrival back to the hotel, several hours later, after reporting the theft and canceling all of our credit cards, I asked if we could view the hotel's security camera tape, which showed the coming and going of people in and out of the hotel. We watched it with the manager, from the time I left to go get the car, till the time we left to go to the US Embassy and police station. Most curiously, no one was seen leaving with the bag. The bag is quite large, and would have been easily recognizable on video. It leads to the obvious conclusion that whoever lifted the bag was quite familiar with the hotel's operations, thus avoiding the security camera. It stretches the imagination that no hotel employee witnessed anything unusual, given the low amount of lobby traffic at the time we were checking out. I was also told by the manager that there was no other way out of the hotel, except for the front door. The hotel manager, realizing our situation, offered us an additional night\u2019s stay for free. He also assisted us with adjusting a few of our subsequent Best Western hotel reservations at other locations in Italy. Despite his gestures, my memories of our stay at the Ambra Palace hotel are as follows: We were violated at a time we thought we were secure at the Ambra Palace. We lost over $1300.00 US of photographic and related equipment during our stay at that 4-star \"luxury\" hotel. We lost 3 days of photos (perhaps 500+) and videos which are frankly not replaceable. We lost an entire day of our honeymoon, spending it instead at the US Embassy, on the phone canceling our credit cards and arranging for replacements, and at the police station. We had to cancel our Best Western Credit Card, which would have allowed us to receive points toward future hotel stays. We were unable to visit 2 destinations we had planned for our trip. Due to cancellation of our credit cards, and the resulting lack of available finances, we were unable to purchase souvenir gifts both in Rome and Venice, as we had planned, for our bridal party back home. We had no finances until we received a new credit card in Florence, 4 days later. In addition, canceling our credit cards and securing new credit cards with my cell phone cost over $110.00 Finally, we came away from our experience with a destroyed opinion of personal safety and security at Best Western Hotels. Over the past 12 years, we have visited Europe and had always chosen Best Western Hotels. Up until July 16, 2010 I had a very favorable opinion of Best Western Hotels. That being said, however, the events surrounding July 16, 2010 at your hotel were indefensible. As I stated on the phone, and in the email I sent to Best Western International, explaining my story in greater detail, the bags were not left alone. My wife was seated in the next room, with view of the luggage. It is correct that she was not sitting with the luggage, but there were no seats for her to sit on while she waited 15 minutes for me to get the car; the seats were in the next room. The luggage was placed in the exact spot that we placed it in upon check-in, when the porter took us up to the room, and no one was with the luggage, and it was safe. Had I known that there was no parking area at the hotel, I would not have chosen that place. The Best Western website states the Ambra Palace has a nearby garage. That garage is an 8-10 minute walk from the hotel. After reportedly looking into this sad situation, Best Western and the hotel itself refused to accept responsibility for what happened within their hotel to a customer. Either there are unscrupulous visitors to the hotel, or some individual who frequently is present in the hotel was involved in this theft. The hotel and their management effectively look the other direction in not taking responsibility for crimes within their walls.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel...

The only really annoying disturbance we had was the delivery of the hotel laundry, which started about 4am on the Saturday morning and continued for about 90 minutes. We did not feel threatened in the neighbourhood, but you should be aware that the locals tend to congregate at night round street corners. A few stare at you sullenly and one or two may ask if you have a cigarette. The odd one will say hello. I fond them friendlier than the average Londonder. Certainly, we did not come across one unpleasant Roman during our trip - it is quite a friendly city.

They will not bite! There's nothing to be afraid of and it's fine at night too. However, there is a definite third world feel to the area, bordered with modern Italy near the station, two blocks away, a large park to the west and the nicer touristy area four blocks to the north. Highlights: - There's a market across the street with an amazing array of very fresh seafood, meat, and vegetables. Made me wish I'd rented an apartment instead! Another building houses the shoe, clothes and baggage stores. - For a number of blocks there are some very small store fronts selling basic convenience foods, what must be custom clothes stores showing very few items, and an electronics store next door. - The Termini station is a hub for all the buses, overground and underground transport. Beware, it's a bit of trek to the underground but we have optmized our route so that we were indoors for the rest of it. - At the station is a shopping mall, above and below. Don't buy from the Spar place - it's a tourist trap rip-off. Coke for 3 euros, which can be bought at the much nicer grocery store under the station; we went there several times to gobble up the local foods for lunch. - A park was nearby but we didn't really use it because it was so hot; however, just a little further south is a gigantic gelato & Italian ice shop called \"palazzo del freddo\". - Food was readily available in several ethnic groups - Chinese, expensive Korean, Indian and further north, a lot of Italian restaurants in the Termini area. Overall, I recommend this location for the sheer variety, it's not Italian but it's an insight to how foreigners have built up their own little town. Real Italy (tm) is just a stone's throw away so there's no need to pay, probably double to go just a few blocks north. The hotel is fine, breakfast got a bit dull but was essential to supply the energy for the rest of the day. We had some pretty nice, large rooms for our group so no complaints there. TV reception sucked in one of the rooms but we had our own entertainment anyway. Two foreign power supplies were at the desk which was nice and doubled my charging capabilities. One thing which truly sucked was the lack of wireless internet in the rooms, a crazy firewall system and a broken ethernet cable - a wireless router was not on my list of things to bring!

I have used Golden Tulip hotels in other parts of europe for business purposes. They are generally of a good standard and the Ambra Palace is no different. From previous experience there is a good train service from Fumincino airport on the Leonardo Express which runs half hourly direct to Termini station for 11 euros. It is just a five minute walk from the station if you come off the train and take the first set of steps which bring you out of the station earlier than walking the length of the platform which we did on the way out. The hotel itself is clean and smart looking despite being in a bit of a run down area. Do not let the area put you off as it is very convenient for transport links, with Vittorio Emanuele Metro station a couple of minutes walk if you come out of the hotel and turn right and walk along via Ricasoli you come to Vittorio Emanuele Park with the entrance to the Metro. Back to the hotel, the rooms are quite spacious for Rome although the shower cubicle is a little on the small side despite the batroom being a reasonable size. I was fortunate that the room allocated was at the back of the hotel but cannot see it would be a problem at the front as the air conditioning was excellent. Breakfast was more than adequate with cereals, a small selection of hot food (mushrooms, scrambled egg and bacon) and the usual slection of cold meats, cheese and pastries.

Now last comment about Rome; this city is one large museum, lot to see, lots of walking if you want to see beaucoup. Take the effort and buy a good city tourist guide to not miss worthwhile \"must see\" spots. A city bus tour (open roof buses) is recommended for the first day, then start your journey on whatever you selected to see. There's plenty of restaurants, pizzerias, trattorias and alike, but believe me 99% of them will screw you one way or the other (laugh). A must is also to visit the most famous gelateria named Giolitti, they sell eventually 500kg of ice cream each day...go for it.

At times it got a bit noisy, but never all that bad. The rooms are small by US standards, but comfortable. We had a slight problem with breakfast on the first day. It came with our reservation, but the hotel didn't have a record of it. This was quickly cleared up. The breakfast is great and for budget travellers like us, helped us cut down on our food spending. Eggs and bacon - as well as the mushrooms - were greatly appreciated, along with fruit, bread, croissants,and assorted other sweets. After we picked this hotel, we were concerned by some of the reviews about the safety of the neighborhood. It looks a bit rough around the edges, but we never had any problems. I can't understand how anyone would have any concern during the day - unless they just plain did not like seeing a lot of working immigrants. This didn't bother us. At night, it might be intimidating to some people who just aren't used to rough-around-the-edges sections of big cities.

Here are our observations: 1. Nicely functional King bed room with mini-bar and electric kettle for instant coffee. Closet had plenty of space, hangers, a safe to store valuables, and a spare blanket and pillow. Overnight, the room was very quiet. 2. Lights to the room are controlled by the room key in the special slot of the room (bellhop will explain how to use it when you check in). Lights will initially turn on for a few minutes when you enter the room, but to keep them on, you have to keep your key placed in this slot. There were multiple times I forgot to do this and found myself in the dark all of a sudden about 5 minutes after I entered my room. 3. A wide staircase was by the elevator, much appreciated. It allowed us to exit the hotel without having to wait for the elevator (wait time was not bad either, though). 4. The hotel offers a private car shuttle to the Da Vinci airport. It costs 50 Euros but we were a few people and decided to try it. The driver arrived exactly on time with a fairly large car and we got to the airport quite quickly without any problems. 5. Going anywhere in Rome was easy using the subway. The (Line A) Vittorio Emanuel station is around the corner of the hotel. You can buy a multi-day pass from a self-service machine at the station for best value. 6. As the Termini train station is large, walking to it is quite close if you enter Temini by one of its side entrances (if you use the main entrance it will take about 10 minutes to get there). In there, you will find a whole shopping area for essentials and souvenirs. They charge 1,60 Euros to use the bathrooms in there but it was very clean. 7. Our room rate did not include breakfast but we decided to pay extra and try it one morning. If you are from North America, you will be quite disappointed. The scrambled eggs tasted like powdered yolk, the bacon was very greasy. and they seemed to easily run out of things like juice and toast. All this for up to 30 Euros per person in a fairly small banquet room. When we finished, we noticed there was now a line for people waiting for an empty table. 8. The bathroom had a hair dryer, lighted shaving mirror, toilet, bidet, and shower (no bath). Water pressure was nice and strong. 9. The room has an Ethernet cable for free internet access for a laptop. They also had a public computer in the lobby area if you did not bring a laptop. In either case, get an account from the front desk to get access to the internet. 10. The staff was very helpful and spoke English quite well. They even recommended a reasonably priced trattoria to eat a few blocks away on the same street (Il Cecio). 11. I don't know if this is hotel policy, but we received a coupon for complimentary welcome drinks at the bar located near the lobby. It was most welcome after having been travelling most of the day to get to Rome. 12. All phone calls from the room are charged. They do have a complimentary phone at the front desk if your number does not work. There are pay phones either on the street or at the Termini train station as an alternative. 13. The temperature in the room can also be controlled by the front desk. We tried using the thermostat in the room but we found the room too hot no matter which setting we tried. The front desk staff remotely turned off the heat to our room at our request, which helped. 14.

Breakfast was a decent buffet and I found all the staff to be pleasant and efficient. Several other reviews have commented adversely on the area: it was very scruffy but so is much of Rome outside of the main tourist areas. I didn't feel unsafe: perhaps the complainers were unsettled by the fact that it is in a neighbourhood of Asian shops whose shutters are covered in graffiti. (The other side of the railway tracks was a different story. We ventured there in search of a Michelin recommended restaurant. We arrived too early for dinner and were not minded to go to a bar to await the 8.30 pm opening as we would usually have done. Fodor describes the area as counter culture/artsy: my assessment is more like squalid, worse than any other area I have seen in a major West European city. There were a lot of vagrants near the railway track and I wouldn't have felt comfortable walking back to the hotel late at night.). The Ambra Palace is a 5-10 min walk from the main railway station (convenient for trains to the aiports) and very close to a metro line. A downside of the area is the lack of good restaurants: we weren't impressed with the other Michelin rated restaurant we tried and although there is a Michelin starred place nearby it doesn't put its menu outside: if I am paying big bucks I like to know what is on offer before I go in.

Nothing was too much trouble and our room was large, clean and quiet (and we were on the front street!). The buffet breakfast (included in our rate) was an array of food both hot and cold and the service considerate even when they were literally overflowing with hungry guests.

Reception also organised a private car to pick up and drop us off at the airport - a luxury that worked out only a few euros more than a taxi and gave us a sleek, airconditioned ride in a spanky clean car with a polite driver.

I stayed here over New Years 2006 and was quite pleased overall. The hotel itself really is a 4/5 stars by any standard, American or European. Rooms are large, clean, and comfortable. The continental breakfast is nice and there is a large seating area to enjoy breakfast. The hotel provides a free high speed internet connection which is very handy. The closest entrance to the Metro is less than a city block away. Arguably the best museum for ancient art in Rome, the National Museum\u2019s Palazzo Massimo, is a five minute walk as is the Termini (which is a great way to get to and from the airport as trains leave about every half hour). The location is very convenient for those who want to explore the city. Many reviewers comment on the Termini neighborhood itself because it has the perception of being an immigrant community and slightly run down or dangerous-appearing at night. Personally, since most of Rome is similarly covered with graffiti and appears run-down, I would have a hard time telling a good neighborhood from a bad one without a local telling me. Talking with some of the shop and restaurant owners, I go the impression that it is actually quite a tight-knit community that looks out for one another. If you think that you might be put off by the neighborhood, then you probably will be. I would recommend this hotel for families and couples. Although I feel fine walking around at night, I think young women traveling alone might desire to stay in a different neighborhood simply because whether you have to or not, no one wants to feel like they have to look over their shoulder while they are on vacation.

Our room was on the 1st (non smoking) floor, adequate space-wise and the bathroom was well-equipped with lots of towels and toiletries, though no bath, only a shower. We had a problem with the sliding door to the bathroom, which twice locked itself and had to be opened by a staff member - not exactly the best thing when you need to use the room in the middle of the night! The breakfasts were very good, lots of choice. We ate in the bar one night due to the dreadful weather and the food was fine, though you wouldn't want to eat there all the time. The hotel is very near the Vittorio Emnmanuele stop on the Metro, so handy for transport. One thing we discovered on lleaving was that by taking the next side street after the hotel you got straight to the side entrance of Termini, so there was no need to walk through the less salubrious streets with all your luggage - this would also be handy if you needed to use the other metro line. As it is, you are not very near to any of the top tourist sites. All the staff were exceptionally good and we must mention the housekeeping ladies, who were so friendly and good at their work.

On the positive side - the hotel staff are friendly and helpful so deserve 5 stars. The bathrooms have been partially renovated and the internet is free!! On the downside, it is in an absolutely terrible location for anyone thinking of wandering around after dark. Yes, it is not far from the Central Station but nowhere is in Rome (it is not a huge city) and like any Central Station area in any major city, it becomes an ominous place once it gets quieter. Two nights running I had a taxi driver who could not find the hotel and got dumped a few hundred metres from the hotel. However, pleasant the majority of locals, this is not an area you want to be wandering around in the dark - run down, dirty, graffitti ridden. The hotel itself is one of faded glory. The rooms have certainly seen better days and the bed and pillows were rock hard. The original standard room I had was pretty grim and the upgrade I received (at no cost and with no argument reflected very well on my view of the helpulness of the staff who were 5 star!) still very much had that faded glory feel to it. If you genuinely want to stay near the Termini station then 250 metres away and much nearer is the SAS Radisson. No meaningful difference in price (unless you start using the mini bar or restaurant in which case get out your Gold Card!) and a more superior, efficient and pleasant modern 4 star hotel right next to the Central Station.
