We are a family of four, with two sons aged 12 and 14. We found the apartments on tripadvisor and decided to trust the reviews. We were thrilled with that decision. We were incredibly impressed with all the staff. The reception staff were the most helpful we have ever come across with brilliant multilingual skills.They could not do enough to help and advise us and nothing was too much trouble. The cleaning staff were delightful. Whoever owns/runs the business should be so proud of the staff and the atmosphere they create. In terms of location if was superb. We have been to Barcelona many times but decided to take the bus tour on the first day to show the boys. We got great advice on which route to follow as there is a choice by the staff. We were very tired 2 nights and asked staff to suggest places to eat. Again, great suggestions of two tapas places nearby. We cannot recall the names, but super and the only places the staff suggested. We went somewhere further afield the other evening. We did not eat in the hotel but the menu looked good. There is a very large excellent supermarket about 2 minutes walk away or less and a lovely bakery the same distance in the opposite direction. It was tempting to cook from the incredible fish counter but we didn't. The apartment was lovely and ample size for four of us. We had a view (sort of) from the top floor but we would have been just as happy at the back of the building. We were not woken by noise. Lovely sheets and towels, slightly poor water pressure. In summary, have no hesitation, in terms of location and value (especially for families) unbeatable.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location offering a first rate comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "Nilas5", "ReviewID": "UR128059112", "Content": "We stayed at the Hispanos 7 Suiza in April 2012.

The location wasperfect, right next to the Sagrada Familia. The apartment was close to the metro as well. The reception staff were very helpful. It was great having a balcony overlooking the Sagrada Familia. The best feature was having a housekeeping service so one could have the benefit of staying in an apartment while at the same time getting the perks of a hotel stay. One of the guide books that we had read said that breakfast was complimentary but that was not the case, it was 5 Euros per person.

Reception staff were great: helpful, efficient, spoke English well. It is a nonsmoking facility. The location can't be beat because right out of the hotel turn right and at the end of the block on the left is Sagrada Familia cathedral and it's subway station. Unfortunately that's the best bits. At 295 EUR per night it wasn't a good value. Read the rest of this post and see why Beds were very hard and none of us slept very well. I also developed a rash on my face and my physician back home thought it might have been caused by something on the towels or linens. It might have been from the bleach since there was a noticeable \"bleach\" smell. Never had that happen before. Noise from the halls and other rooms was VERY pronounced. We had room 501 which has a door that connects to the next room/suite. Let's just say I could hear the man next door with the smokers cough through 2 closed doors. He also liked watching tv at 03:00 in the morning. Every time another guest(s) would leave their room you can hear every footstep on the wood floors and all of the conversation. If you order the breakfast the \"savory\" breakfast is a packaged ham and cheese sandwich, a bottle of juice, fresh fruit salad and Nespresso. Not a bad price at 5 EUR per person but definitely not 5 star. The Nespresso machine in the room is a little tricky to use but worth the effort. Our room had only one bathroom with one sink. With four people in room/suite it really needs at least two sinks. My suggestion is for management to redo the bathroom with two sinks and remove the bidet. Maintenance of the unit could be improved too. The baseboard along the main part of the little kitchen and squashed toes, twice. One chair's cushion didn't have support and one of our guests sunk into it. That chair was also poorly upholstered and could see the foam pad.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta/Romania", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Family Stay\u201d", "Author": "AmericanExpat92", "ReviewID": "UR127783568", "Content": "We just visited Barcelona for Spring Break.

Friendly staff, clean and well maintained rooms, secure, close to metro and to the deservedly famous Sagrada Familia, great grocery market just around the corner, cafes and good restaurants short walks away, and a very fine restaurant (La Cupula) attached to the hotel. Minor complaints: our room overlooked a busy street and traffic noise lasted well into the night. The windows are pretty thick and good at shutting out most of the noise, and we slept well overall. Ask for a room on a higher floor so you have a view from the cute balcony. The kitchen could use more cooking equipment, so if you plan to cook in a lot bring along a good knife and frying pan. Otherwise, the kitchen was adequate. The washer/dryer was weak by US standards, but serviceable. Dishwasher OK. Take along some detergents, a sponge, paper towels, salt/pepper, sugar, tea bags, if you can fit it in. The coffee maker is a Delonghi pod espresso type, so ground coffee is useless. Buy pods. More positives: we ate twice at La Cupula and loved it both times. My teenage sons still talk about the meals we had there. It's a bit pricey, but it is a Michelin rated place and the hotel gives you a 10% discount. They also have a fixed price menu that changes daily for a reasonable 13 or 14 euro (19 dollars), and the wine list is very reasonably priced. The paella we had at La Cupula was by far the best version of several we tried that week. We would definitely stay there again. And don't let all the chatter about thieves and pickpockets deter you from visiting this fabulous city. Just use common sense. Lock your passports and other valuables in the room safe, hide your money and credit card inside a zippered pocket, avoid La Rambla at night, and enjoy! We never felt unsafe all week. The people were the friendliest of any city in my experience. No one gave us \"attitude\", even with our very limited ability to speak the language.

The apt. was very nicely furnished, modern and comfortable. The location was very good as it was just around the corner a couple of blocks from the famous Sagrada Familia Cathederal and close to public transportation and the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus line.

Onboard food and drink was too expensive but we knew that beforehand. Taking just one checked bag kept the cost down and was all we needed. The room was in fact an apartment and I don't think we appreciated that fully before we went but it was a two-bedroomed flat within the Hispano 7 Suiza hotel - very well appointed and comfortable, everything working including aircon, and a modern fully-equipped kitchen with dishwasher and washing machine. The dishwasher was straightforward enough. Although we didn't use the washing machine, a previous comment about no instructions still stands, but I'm sure we could have had it explained. The bathroom was modern and clean. The lounge came complete with 3-piece suite and a 40\" colour TV. So apart from the TV programme languages - mainly Spanish and Catalan a bit of home from home. We ordered breakfast as room service twice, which was supplied promptly and was good value. The hotel has a permanent display of well-restored old Hispano Suiza cars (hence the name) - a bit bizarre perhaps but we did have a look! Reception service was always prompt helpful and courteous.

A 100 metre walk took us to the nearest internet cafe at \u20ac1 per hour, so no great problem.

Despite being slightly out of the centre the Old City and beach and other attractions were easily accessed by either the Tourist Bus (which did on the second day) or by T-10 ticket on the very clean and efficient underground system. The T-10 allowed 10 separate trips and 2 of these cost us around \u20ac17 which for a week's transport was excellent. There is so much to see and do in Barcelona that we could only cover the main attractions such as Gaudi's Casa Bottli, Picasso Museum, Museu de la Reia (municipal museum with a wealth of artefacts and excavated Roman streets), La Rambla to mention a few. Only one attempt at pickpocketting on a crowded underground but I recognised the MO - woman distraction while her accomplice was busy trying to open my haversack, foiled when I suddenly pulled it round and he ended up on the floor!

The apartment was very clean & comfortable and had everything we needed. We didn't hear anything from other apartments and only minimal street noise - to be expected in any city. Wifi and TV were fine - kids mainly watched the FC Barcelona dedicated TV channel - didn't matter that it was in spanish - just showed endless football! Location was fantastic with Sagrada Famillia and metro just around the corner- 10 trip metro tickets are great value. It was very easy to navigate the metro and we could easlly get all around the city from here. Taxis generally only take 4 unless you find a rare larger taxi so metro was much better. 24 hr supermarket with wonderful deli opposite is just a block away. We didn't bother with breakfast from the hotel, just got supplies and catered ourselves. We ate one night in the restaurant - great value Menu Del Dia - 3 courses & coffee for only \u20ac16 or \u20ac20 wth glass of wine.

We didn't require the second bedroom but it was a nice to be able to put all of our luggage in there to store and a second bathroom was handy too to spread ourselves out. Our room overlooked the back of the hotel which was a view of the rear of other apartment blocks (residential by the looks of them) and a school yard. This didn't really bother us too much but if you were expecting a view of the Sagrada Familia you might be disappointed by this. (I've included a picture). The staff on reception were all helpful and friendly and all spoke excellent English. The lady in the bar/breakfast area was very sweet and the waiters in the restaurant were pleasant enough. Everything was clean and they were happy to provide a high chair when we ate in the communal areas. We borrowed an iron and ironing board - if you are thinking of doing this don't bother or ask for one that actually works. The one we had was hardly worth the effort for all the difference it made. My main negative point would have to be the general noise - the rooms weren't very sound proof and you could hear the school children playing on their break times, people walking in heels on the floor above, people in neighbouring apartments closing and opening their window shutters (electronic) and their TV's and chatter from people in the corridors. It wasn't dreadful but enough for me to make think to mention it although I wouldn't let it sway your decision. The only reason I have not given the service 5 stars is because half way through our stay they changed the breakfast policy that instead of going down to the bar area as we had been doing for a buffet style breakfast we received a note under the door saying from now on breakfast will be room service only and you must order on the previous day. I preferred the old system as I didn't always know what I would want the next morning and want to order in advance. I'm not sure if this was a one off for any particular reason or if it's a winter season thing maybe? As for location - we were happy with that. You are a stones throw from the Sagrada Familia and there are some little shops and supermarkets nearby for food. There are a couple of tube stations within walking distance and it is possible, if you don't mind a longer stroll, to walk to places like Las Ramblas which I think took us about half hour (maybe slightly more). It depends what you want though as it was a little further away from the action in terms of shopping and nightlife and there didn't seem to be too many restaurants on the doorstep. With a small baby this didn't really bother us too much but it may be a problem for other people who would prefer to be really central and in the thick of it.

Would definitely recommend to everyone! I went to Barcelona with my parents and brother for one night and this hotel was great, especially for a group with more than 2 people. It had a large living room and kitchen, 2 bedrooms that were across the apartment from each other (1 with a queen or king and one with two twin beds) and 2 full bathrooms and free wi-fi! All for only 160 euros. We booked this rate directly through the hotel site. I wish we could have stayed more than one night, but we were on our way to Alcossebre (towards Valencia). Definitely the perfect place for families or two couples looking to stay in a great place for a great price. Pros: - Space! Huge kitchen with washer/dryer, dishwasher, all kitchen amenities you need. 2 full bathrooms made getting ready in the morning a lot easier - 1 had a tub and one had a standing shower. 2 large bedrooms that are separated across the apartment (if you've ever shared a wall with a roomie in an apartment you'll know this is a great and rare thing) Large living room / dining area with full couch and full kitchen table. Balcony was great add on to the space and beautiful spot for morning coffee - Modern with hardwood floors, new bathrooms, etc. - Free wi-fi. - Good Service - the staff helped us get a around and stored our luggage - Balcony with views of Sagrada Familia! (Architectural gem by Gaudi) - Location - not on La Rambla or in gothic quarter, but safe neighbourhood with lots of shops and restaurants, very close to the Metro. A couple of grocery stores within a few blocks - just ask at the desk! Cons: - A little hard to find. We had never been to Barcelona before and the street signs are virtually non-existent or hard to find in some areas. We walked from the Metro and had trouble due to street names changing in mid street and confusing us a bit and the hotel sign wasn't too noticeable. Would recommend calling ahead and getting clear 'turn right turn left' type directions - A couple of small maintenance issues, but minor. Shower head in main bathroom didn't stay up. If we had stayed more than 1 night we would have asked them to fix it, but we just used the other shower. Window in 2nd bathroom was broken. - Beds are pretty firm - didn't bother us, but it might not work out for you. When looking for Barcelona accommodations it was hard to find an affordable option for 4 people. (Most of Europe has rooms for only 2 or occasionally 3 people). We were going to get 2 rooms and hoping to do so for around 100 euros a night, but knew that the place wouldn't be that great at that price. Instead we got to stay at Hispanos 7 suiza for less money and in a beautiful place in a good location. Note: it's not right in the Gothic Quarter or right on La Rambla, but the money you save makes it easy to walk or use the metro to get to these more central areas. We did actually walk into the centre of the city via the shopping on Passeig de Gracia and then over to the gothic area and la rambla and eventually to the water. But we took the Metro back because by then we were all exhausted from the walking. So if you're ok walking a fair bit or taking the Metro the location will work great for you. Tip - get a T10 metro card - it can be used by multiple people and makes using the metro super cheap!

It can be difficult to find a hotel that is modern, clean, centrally located, and still allows you to maintain a vacation budget. This hotel addresses these concerns. Yes, this hotel is not inexpensive, but compared to other hotels in Barcelona, this hotel is a good value. We are a middle aged couple (50's) who was accompanied by an elderly parent (96). We speak Castellano, however the hotel staff does speak English so communications was not a problem. Our suite was on the 5th floor, in the back of the building. Evenings and nights were very quiet.; so any concerns you may have about getting a good night's sleep in a densely populated city were not a problem. In addition to a kitchen table, the balcony has a table for outdoor dining, so we ate all our evening meals there relaxing and enjoying the beautiful sunset. The kitchette is equiped with mini-refridgerator, dishwasher, flatware, dishes, venthood and stovetop. We cleaned the kitchen after our meals so as to avoid the costly cleaning fees. There are two neighborhood supermarkets (Consum and Carrefour) around the corners from the hotel with reasonable prices on local produce so you can either prepare your own meals from scratch or buy cheeses, sausages, a variety of cured hams, freshly baked bread, and local wines, as we did, for late night dining. Although the hotel is three blocks from the Sagrada Familia, were there are many tourists, the street was safe. Getting a taxis outside the hotel to visit most tourist sites was easy, costing about 5 to 7 Euros. The neighborhood is inhabited by a mixture of mainly elderly and professional couples, so there are some restaurants and cafes, however you'll most likely find more restaurants in the areas of town frequented by tourists. This was not a problem since we were sightseeing in areas of the city were we could find a reasonably priced menu del dia. Between 7:30 and 11:00 an extensive buffet breakfast is provided offering eggs, yoguts, fresh fruits, cereals, pasteries, sausages, sobrasatta, fresh bread, coffee, milk, fruit juices, cheese, and ham.

As such I feel that the location of the hotel is somewhat far, but metro works extremely well so everything is within reach. For someone visiting the city for the first time, I suggest going more towards the city center. But all in all, the price-quality-ratio was reasonable for us (2 adults, 2 kids). However, and unfortunately, our stay was dominated by a major problem: 2-4 times a day (and we basically just stayed in during late evenings and nights) the apartment was filled with the most terrible smell. This \"sewer smell\" brought through airconditioning lasted 10-15 minutes each time, but was strong enough to wake us at night. When mentioning about the problem we were offered a change of rooms, which we decided not to do, just out of sheer laziness and general pessimism (changing one problem often turns into just another problem i.e. a more noicy apartment).

The spacious two bedroom, two bath apartments with full kitchen AND washer/drier, plus porch, gave us plenty of room to roam and all the amenities we needed. The location is great, very close to the Metro which is clean, very easy to use, inexpensive, and fast. We never waited more than 2.5 minutes for a train (I wish we could say that at home in DC!) and with the hotel close to two different lines, it was easy to arrange a route to most place we wanted to visit. Staff was generally friendly and all were accomodating of our needs. There are TWO playgrounds, each about a block away. One is in the plaza next to the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, so the adults can sit and admire the architecture while the young ones run around. There are some things worth knowing. The area immediately around the Cathedral is very touristy. This has some advantages (restaurants are open even on Sunday night and serve at odd hours) but the pizza joints and t-shirt vendors get old quickly. However, this is only the area *immediately* around the Cathedral. Turn the corner and you have your own \"authentic\" Barcelona neighborhood, with your own neighborhood corner grocery, fruit & veggie stand, cafe, etc. While there are two complete baths, only the bedroom with the twin beds has a bath accessible from within the room. The room with the double bed has a bathroom about two steps from the bedroom door. If you are traveling with people who have a high need for privacy, this layout may be an issue. Also, the twin bed bath only has a shower, no tub. The hotel restaurant offers a very reasonably priced \"menu\" -- 3 courses for E20 -- the food and dining room are both pleasant. However, they only serve dinner at 9 pm. If you shift to \"Barcelona time\" that works great, but if you are used to an earlier dinner, that can be a limitation. Service is a bit formal. Think of it as an easy resource for a pleasant night out, not a family dinner. Breakfast was a buffet including fresh fruit, various kinds of bread, cheese, and sliced meats, hard boiled eggs, a sweet tart, plus cereal and juice. Lots of choice, but don't expect a \"full English breakfast.\" Rooms on the front of the hotel may have a view of the Cathedral (we were on the 3rd floor and one of the two balconies had a view) BUT also get a lot of street noise. The recycling containers for the neighborhood are right across the street and the early morning pick up of the bottles was quite a racket. The rooms on the interior of the hotel get a view of Barcelona life, with a view of many apartment patios and balconies, plus the sounds of children on a school playground. All in all, I preferred the interior apartment for sound control, since I was only 1/2 block from the Cathedral plaza with a spectacular view, but it will make a difference. The hotel shows signs of a high quality hotel which is in need of a bit of a spruce up -- the TV was small (not an issue for us, since we never turn it on), there were a few stains on the sofa, sometimes internet reception was slow, that sort of thing.

Breakfast (included) in the main room was peaceful, with large tables, plenty of space and a large selection of mostly cold foods. The clientele was mostly families as the layout of the rooms dictates this - a double bed, and two singles in the smallish second room, therefore not really suited to friends sharing. Reception was always polite and helpful with restaurant bookings. The only possible downside to this accommodation is the location - it is not in the epicentre of the city. If you are coming to Barcelona for a short weekend you may want to be closer to the action (i.e. restaurants and cafes). If staying for longer it is an advantage to be in an area that is more peaceful on the street, and with the opportunity to see the Sagrada Familia (1 minute away) lit up each night. That said, travel options are plentiful with a couple of metro lines nearby (3 mins) and buses leaving from beside the SF that will take you into town and the Port Vell area (number 19) or to Montjuic (number 50).

Many ugly newer apartment buildings line the streets, only very few of those nice modernist buildings the Eixample is famous for. Next time I wood definately stay closer to Passeig Gracia.

We also enjoyed having a sitting area to relax after a long day of sight seeing. We didn't use the kitchen except to keep a few snacks and bottles of wine. I did like having a washer/dryer, although it was a bit musty so we only washed blue jeans - nothing delicate. I also had a hard time figuring out how to work the machine but that may have just been me. One thing that surprised me was that the hotel charged for everything in the kitchen (from tea towels to dishwasher detergent). I bought some laundry soap at the supermarket and didn't use anything other than wine glasses. This may be typical in Europe (in Canada a kitchen would be fully equipped for no extra charge) so I won't portray it as a negative, just something to note. Having breakfast included was a bonus, with a selection of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheeses, breads etc. After a few days it was a bit repetitive, as it always is in these circumstances, but there are alot of options at nearby cafes if you wanted a bit of variety. The waiter in the restaurant was very pleasant. Probably the biggest negative was that our room (number 102) was very noisy, largely due to a crying baby who must have been staying directly above us. The rooms were cleaned every day to a reasonable standard. The front desk staff was very helpful and professional. We only used public transport once, to go to a football game at Camp Nou and otherwise walked everywhere, including Parc Guell, Barcelonetta, the Port etc. We enjoyed this as it justified all the eating and drinking but may be a bit much for young children or the less able. The smoking in Barcelona is hard to take if you're a non smoker so it was nice that the hotel had a no smoking policy in the rooms which it seemed to adhere to.

One thing to keep in mind-- it is a little bit away from the old city and other attractions, but it only takes 3 metro stops to get there, and with metro being just around the corner, this wasn't an issue at all. Overall - we would stay there again with no reservations.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SAM_smitian", "ReviewID": "UR8252521", "Content": "We stayed here and loved it.
