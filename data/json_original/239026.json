However, we found it to be very suitable for our needs, being very central. Our rooms were well-appointed, and the en-suite bathrooms lovely, with jacuzzi-style baths. The beds were large and comfortable, and maid service was daily. The only down side was the heat in the rooms. We think they must have been over the next-door restaurant's kitchen, as the temperature was very hot, and we couldn't leave the windows open as the mosquitoes would eat us alive! (we got bitten anyway!) We asked one of the receptionists if the air-conditioning was broken, and he told us it was too early to be switched on (April). We asked if we could have an electric fan, and he very obligingly provided one, which helped considerably. The continental breakfast was more than adequate, and the service was excellent. All the staff seemed very friendly, and were very obliging.

Beatrice, She was outdtanding, che could be described as a shining light in the dark in this holel. in fact, she has to be one of the most helpfull people Ive come accross who is working in hospitality in europe. The only other thing this place has going for it is the location its not even 5 minutes walk from St Marcs Square so super handy for going back to the toilet instead of payning the 1.50 euro to use the publics! The negatives. The rate for a night is the most expensive ive paid accross Europe, and ive had a less enjoyable stay here than in youth hostels, it is not worth what they ask for it. The rooms feel like a sauna, there is no air conditioning but just a fan to push the air around. This can not be classed as airconditioning, it doesnt matter where you come from. The heat in the rooms is in sufferable. The floor is so hot you cant walk on it, its as if they have underfloor heating turned on full, and in the middle of a hot summers day in Venice, it nicer to stand outside in the sun because it to hot in your room. For these first reasons, we asked to change rooms on our first night there, as we got about 2 hours sleep combined, all night!! This is when Beatrice came in, she helped, made sure we had a nicer room with better ventilation, and actually seemed genuinely concerned. The walls are paper thin, and you can hear everthing, and i mean everything going on in the rooms around you! The beds are unconformatable, and when making the booking, we asked for a double bed, but what we got was two singles pushed together, that in it self isnt a bad thing, but, when the beds are of a different height, it just adds to the frustration of trying to sleep. The cold water in the sink in the room we had wouldnt run cold water, the cold side was infact hotter than the hot side so we ended up using bottled water the entire time at great expence to ourselves. this includes brishing our teeth. Ive stayed in plenty of budget accomodation over my time with shared toilets and showers, but this one ahd to be the worst. The showers and toilets were dirty, the floors in the bathrooms had the same issue as the bedrooms, so much so that the staff put towels on the floor to keep the heat off your feet. I had to rig the shower head up so it would stay in one place. They advertise breakfast is included, but you will want to eat something decent as soon as you leave, it wes not a pleasent eating experience. the breakfst staff were pleasent enough, but the food most certainly wasnt. Even when complaining to the managment, all they could say was 'we are aware of the problems, and were sorry' this is un satisfactory. Bottom line is, do not stay here, the few redeeming qualitys this place has are not enough to convince me to ever reccomend it, never stay here, you will regret it for a long, long time.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "TheodoreKoulouris", "ReviewID": "UR111423570", "Content": "I could put up with everything really, but the rudeness of some of the hotel staff was something I'd never witnessed before; the female receptionist - fair hair, blue-eyes (I think), in her late twenties or early thirties perhaps - was one of the rudest people I'd ever dealt with.

So, almost every affordable yet beautiful hotels at San Macro were all booked out for Friday and Saturday nights. So, after reading many reviews on the internet, I finally decided to book this hotel with no expectations more than just to find a place to stay at the lowest price in San Macro area to stay during the weekend and stay at another hotels that I desired on the weekdays when their rooms were available. However, this hotel turned out to be beyond my expectations. The hotel location is very great since it is close to go to San Macro so. it's very convenient to do many things e.g. go see the sun rise in the morning at the piazza when there is almost no one there, walk through the area until at late at night and still can find a place to eat, come back to the hotel to take a short break for using toilet and resting my legs for a while when I feel that I cannot walk anymore during the day and easily access to both Rialto port and S. Macro port, etc. So, I think this hotel is perfect for people with limited budget who only want a place to stay in San Marco with an acceptable level of facilities and do not want to stay in the hotel room for no more than just the normal 6-8 sleeping hours. Besides, the hotel staffs are also nice and the hotel location is not that hard to find when you googles the hotel location before you go. You can walk to find this hotel on your own without having to ask anyone. For the cons, the room I stayed was so small that the door panel hits the bed if I open the door wider than 40-60 degrees and there is no elevators. Even though I have no problems with tiny spaces and the large luggage, I still don't like this smallness of the hotel room because you can find a lot larger room with a lot better facilities at a lot cheaper prices at somewhere else in Venice. Moreover, there are no meats, vegetable or eggs in the breakfast menu at all (Almost 95% of the hotel breakfast is CARB w/ tea, juice, milk or coffee) but I was OK with this because I usually do not eat breakfast anyway. So, if the nice, healthy breakfast is the MUST for you, I would suggest you find an additional breakfast meal on your own.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "marsascal", "Title": "\u201cfirst visit to venice\u201d", "Author": "boysy", "ReviewID": "UR104523879", "Content": "easy to find walk across san marco square pass the americano coffee shop right ay ferrari shop right by the cartier shop and just beyond small piazza .

The hotel is just a few hundred metres from Piazza San Marco but as others have commented a bit difficult to find the front door! Head inland through the bell tower and find the black-fronted Cartier jewellery shop. Head down the alley on the right of Cartiers and you will come to a square with a restaurant ahead of you. The hotel is above the restaurant. To get to the front door you will need to go down the alley to the right of the restaurant and hang a sharp left through the walkway under the building behind the restaurant - front door to the hotel is in the corner on your left as you exit the underpass. This is a clean well run little hotel with friendly helpful staff. The rooms are fairly basic but quite adequate and nicely decorated. Ours was on the 2nd floor with shower, comfortable double bed, TV, fan and light dimmer. There have been some comments about noise and mosquitos. Well here's the thing; in a lively, vibrant city with lots of water all around, what do you expect? Only noise we had was the chatter of people enjoying themselves in the restaurant until around 11pm and the odd mosquito, so get some repellant if that's going to be a problem. The restaurant below is also excellent with friendly efficient service and a meal and drinks averaged out at about 80% of what we would have paid at home.

We were travelling around Italy for two weeks and started the tour with three nights in Venice. Whilst there we would be celebrating our first year of marriage. This hotel is exactly what it claims to be. It is very cheap accommodation for very basic accommodation needs - it's for people who want to see Venice and aren't bothered about having a posh hotel room because they're not planning on spending a lot of time in the room anyway. I personally think that the for the price and value for money this hotel was actually better than I expected it to be. The first great thing about this hotel is the location. It is literally a couple of minutes walk to St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge, two of Venice's biggest attractions. Most hotels near here are priced significantly higher than this one so it really is a bargain with Venice's hotspots right on your doorstep. We arrived to the hotel and checked in quickly and efficiently. One downside is that our room was on the top floor - up three large flights of stairs and there was no lift so this was a bit of a struggle with suitcases so this may not be the best option for disabled people or those not in the best of health but we found it fine (once we had our suitcases up after the first day) and joked it burnt off all the calories we ate for dinner! We had booked a double room with a private bathroom but I know this hotel also has shared rooms with shared bathrooms though this wan't for us! Our room was not decorated very nicely admittedly - a little dark and old fashioned BUT it was very large, very clean, had TWO balonettes, a TV and the bathroom was clean as well. A maid came daily to replace the sheets and empty bins etc and we had no problems at all. The room, when we visited in June 2009 DID have air conditioning also and this was great because one night we left the windows open and the mosquitos got us bad so it was a blessing. I know other reviewers have said there was no air con but they must have listened and installed it because ours was fine and worked okay. Breakfast admittedly wasn't the best, offering only a croissant, bread roll or one type of cereal with organge juice or coffee BUT it wasn't terrible and bette than not having anything available for breakfast. It was adequate and suited the price of the hotel. Finally, the staff at this hotel were wonderful. We had the same lady who dealt with breakfast every day and she was polite and willing to please. The two men we encountered on reception (one old and one young - older man in the evenings, younger man through the day) were both very polite, frindly, welcoming and willing to help. They were great at heloing with directions and the older man even helped us with our anniversay meal. We asked him for a recommended restaurant that was not ridiculously expensive but near the Grand Canal as we wanted to watch the Canal as we ate. He even went to thr trouble of searching the net and left menus, directions and maps with the other man on the next shift to pass to us next time he seen us! We ended up having a lovely meal at a restauant at the foot of the Rialto Bridge overlooking the Grand Canal which was exactly what we wanted! Thank you so much o this hotel and its staff for making our stay wonderful and I would redcommend this hotel to ANYONE that wants to be near all the ation in Venice, in a cheap, budget, basic but CLEAN and ADEQUATE hotel.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salonica", "Title": "\u201ccentral location, expensive for what they offer\u201d", "Author": "vayio", "ReviewID": "UR12486378", "Content": "Location of the hotel is great, only 5 mins walk from San Marco and Riarto, although a bit difficult to find it.
