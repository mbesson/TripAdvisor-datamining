That said, I must add the lack of restuarants within walking distance and the difficulty of the need to always maneuvere the large highway interchange when arriving or leaving the hotel proved to be more of a hassle than we expected.

I will be on a project here in Dallas until mid-July and I plan on staying here that entire time. I have Diamond VIP status with Hilton and I still have chosen this hotel over a Hilton brand. LOCATION: Location is great for me. My client is near Greenville and Walnut Hill. From the hotel, it's a short 10 minute commute if you take the back roads. The hotel is at the intersection of LBJ and Central Expressway - so you have easy access to the highways. However, my favorite feature is that the hotel is right across the street from a great paved bike trail. The trailhead of the White Rock bike trail starts right near the hotel. I packed my bike with me and I can get on the trail right after work and get a good 23 mile ride in. The GPS coordinates of the trail head are: 32.921981, -96.780399. Get on the trail and head south - it'll take you to White Rock lake where you can loop around the lake and head back up the trail to the hotel. ROOMS: The rooms are very clean. They have a large flat screen TV. The beds feel new and are comfortable. The mattress is firm, but I like that (so does my back). They have a small kitchenette in the room which consists of a microwave, 2 burner stove and a full size refrigerator (with a working ice maker). I wish it had an oven though as I like to cook my own meals for dinner. The bathroom is a good size. The room looks freshly painted. The counter tops appear to be granite (or some kind of imitation - either way, it looks nice). The rooms are quiet too. I have yet to hear my neighbors. A fair warning though - this is a pet friendly hotel, so you could get stuck in a room next to a barking dog. FACILITIES: They have a business center, which consists of a computer and chair located in a hallway. The workout room has two treadmills, a bench and free weights. I wish they had some kind of elliptical machine or stationary bike. They also have a nice courtyard outside which has a pool, a tennis court and a basketball court. AMENITIES: The hotel offers a free hot breakfast in the morning. The eggs are your typical powdered eggs, but they also offer french toast, hashbrowns, fruit, yogurt, milk, coffee...overall a good breakfast. In the evenings, they have a 'managers reception' where they have free wine/beer and munchies (hotdogs, nachos, veggies, cheese & crackers). My only complaint about the amenities deals with the wireless internet. For the past few weeks the wireless has been down. My computer finds the network, but the signal is so low that it wont connect. Fortunately my company gives me a Verizon aircard, so I use it to connect to the internet. STAFF: The staff is very friendly and helpful. Not a single one of them has shown me a sour face. They are either genuinely happy with their jobs and happy to see you, or they are the best actors in the area. I prefer to believe it's the former. OVERALL: Don't hesitate to stay here.

The location is great too because it is right next to the expressway. We could never here it because most of the rooms are in the back. It is located in a business park but there are many restaurants and shopping just a few miles down the road.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas, tx", "Title": "\u201cWorked Great For My Family\u201d", "Author": "smithdallas", "ReviewID": "UR7115820", "Content": "Forced out of our home for 3 nights due to work on our house in Feb. Two bedroom /bath suite was $169. Cost compared nicely with smaller suite hotels in area. This offered more room for a few more $. Definitely room enough for family of 5. Place was quiet, clean and staff was great. They didn't seem put out by having to deal with a family (with 3 boys) at all. Breakfast was normal RI offering - great. stuff, plus a free buffet dinner that worked for us. Made being out of our house as painless as possible.

I have two children under 3 and we were spaciously accommodated in one of their two bedroom suites. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were soft and fluffy and we had 3 TVs - one in each bedroom and one in the livingroom!! The rooms were quiet and there was no traffic noise. Our room was cleaned, towels were changed, new toiletries were left and our supplies of coffee/sugar were replenished daily. We all loved the breakfast buffet which changed daily. The swimming pool and out door hot tub were a fantastic place to retreat to after a long day of sight seeing. This is a great place to stay and we will certainly stay with Residence Inn on our next vacation.

(The Cooper rate is $95 a night + tax.) The drive from DFW Airport is a straight easy 13 mile shot east on the LBJ Freeway. On both stays (the other stay was in May 2005), it was easy to find a space in the parking lot. The staff is always friendly, and helpful with maps and directions. On both stays, I stayed in an efficiency that came with a full kitchen that included a full-size refrigerator, oven, stove and microwave. The kitchen was stocked with some basics including plates and silverware for four, glasses, toaster, colander, and measuring cup. I found my room conducive to getting a good night's sleep. The sound proofing in this hotel is better than your typical Marriott. Although I could hear occasional noise from the rooms above and next door, it was much more muted than the noise I hear at a Marriott Courtyard and other motels. It also helps that a lot of business people stay here who have to be up early in the morning. The bed was comfortable, although the sheets had a low thread count, so were a bit rougher than they could have been. I was able to completely close the curtains and liner for a very dark room. Also helping with a good night's is that the place feels safe with a deadbolt on the door and keycards needed to enter the building. The room is less conducive to watching TV, as the TV faces neither the bed nor the couch. (It's possible though that being on the end, I had a unique layout.) My biggest complaint about the room is that it's difficult to regulate the room temperature with the analog thermostat. Setting the needle to anywhere in the 60s made the room too warm. I'm impressed that the entire unit was quite clean on my first day and after every housekeeping visit\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcleaner than your average hotel. One day I was running late and left some dishes in the sink, and returned to find them all clean. I didn't use any of the amenities, except for the business center computer. There is only one computer in the business center, so I had to wait a while for to use the computer with its ancient flickering monitor. The next night the internet hookup wasn't working, so I had to do without. (Had I brought my laptop, I could have used the free highspeed internet in the room.) I noticed that there was a small, very unimpressive gym, and a coin laundry room for guests. Most night's there's a buffet dinner downstairs. On Valentine's Day, lots of people were eating the lasagna with salad, and munching on the chocolate hearts the motel provided. The atmosphere in the common room area is congenial, with people eating, watching TV and playing cards, much like a bed and breakfast. Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Residence Inn Park Central, and highly recommend it, particularly to business travelers, people taking Cooper Institute workshops, and people who need to stay in the Dallas area for a few weeks to a month.", "Date": "February 17, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn Dallas Park Central", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d223887-Reviews-Residence_Inn_Dallas_Park_Central-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$94 - $156*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7642 LBJ Freeway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75251</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "223887", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/43/f4/43f455fee7f0c2108ebcdbef576ec5296large.jpg"}}
