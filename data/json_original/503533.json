Big rooms if that matters to you. I prefer a small room in a nicer hotel in a reasonable location. It cost me 40 euros from the airport. It is the usual amount. It wS the amount estimated bynthe taxi fare calculator in line. The metro from the airport involved at least one change and was estimated by the madrid metro website as a 1 hr trip. Wifi is good. Staff are more interested in looking at the Internet than helping you but not rude. They speak enough English to get by. The area is very depressing. Rubbish on the streets, old run down mini marts, restaurant are ver basic and nothing to see or do. It is a fairy poor area. It is great to see how the locals live but the distance from everything is a pain. If it is really cheap and you are ok with the location it is fine.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bussum, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cvery nice, friendly and pleasant\u201d", "Author": "jhundt", "ReviewID": "UR120431089", "Content": "we stayed at this hotel because it is right across the street from the Matadero cultural arts center, where some friends were performing. Looking at the map it seemed quite removed from the center of Madrid. In fact it was quite easy to reach via the Metro from the airport. There is a large and accesible Metro station right outside the hotel, and the Puerta del Sol station is about 10 minutes away. The neighborhood is totally non-tourist (which suits me fine). We found several suitable restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful (in English, too). Our room on the 4th floor street-side was quite large compared to most of what I have seen in Europe. It was very attractively decorated, well-kept and cleaned. The bed was comfortable (except for those crazy yard-long pillows!) and the spacious bathroom was well-equipped. The breakfast was OK, and the cafeteria room was pleasant. There is a garage, though we didn't use it. Our room (for 3 nights) actually cost us less than the price we had been quoted when we reserved on-line. In summary: a very nice and well-equipped hotel with friendly service and attractive rates; easily accesible, situated in a real Madrid neighborhood and just minutes away from the heart of the city.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cCity Break with Extras\u201d", "Author": "BirminghamMezza", "ReviewID": "UR118620156", "Content": "A friend and myself stayed at the above hotel last October and were very suprised as to the type of accomodation offered as well as the very friendly staff. Although the room was 'L' shaped it had plenty of wardrobe space, a fridge, seating area and an enourmous bathroom with a seperate shower, sunken bath, vanity unit, hairdryer and fluffy white towels. Nicely decorated with good quality linen. I would definetly recommend the hotel and the daily rate is very reasonable. The room would benefit from having a kettle as this was the only thing lacking on this occasion. The hotel benefits from a bus service outside with the metro service just across the road and taxi rank. This part of Madrid has very chic bistros, pubs, tapas bars as well as medium sized supermarkets as well as other various amenties. It is approx 30/40 minutes from the centre of Madrid by public transport and quicker via Metro or taxi.
