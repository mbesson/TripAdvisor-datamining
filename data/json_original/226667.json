The pool, dirty and the fencing has jagged rusty nails poking out everywhere. 2. The ridiculous playground is an infection waiting to happen. Sharp metal is sticking out of the 1 swing and monkey bars.there is an infant swing but its that rough yellow cordage that cuts skin. Who in their right mind would look at this playground and think 'yep, its good enough!' Not to mention the boat kids are automatically drawn to...I almost lost my mind at that point. I was so done with this place I picked my 2 year old up and we left. 3. The showers. You have to see them to believe me. Nasty stagnant water and mold everywhere. As one reviewer said, they should be condemned. 4. There is nothing, and I emphasize nothing, for children to do at this 'resort'. There is a half hung volleyball net, a deflated ball and a few rackets near it. 5. You are staying in the middle of a really shabby trailer park. Every person we talked to did the same thing we did, drove right past it thinking 'this can NOT be it...' Yes my friends, you have been duped as well. 6. Maximize profit seems to be their main goal, which hey...the American dream, go for it. But cleaning your facilities doesn't cost a lot. Painting and showing pride of ownership makes people want to come back. 7. The lots are jam packed and you have a tiny crumbling concrete pad to place your items on. No grass anywhere and you stare at your neighbors. Not a big deal as I'm a friendly person and like getting to know people however, this was a joke. I do want everyone to know I'm not afraid of germs or getting dirty, this place is beyond terrible. I camp almost weekly and this is the worst place I've ever stayed in. We left after less than 12 hours. I will say they gave us a refund but not before the 'we just don't understand what's wrong?' question. I have never written a negative review but this place just crossed the line.

The next option was three times the price of the one we wanted. We mentioned it and they gave us the bigger boat for the lower price, no questions asked! All very friendly knowledgable staff. Minutes from silver dollar city, few more minutes to the strip but easy to find. Everything worked fine.

Our friends stayed at the rv site which was a very small space with no fire ring and too close to the cabins. It was all concrete and gravel as well. The swimming pool by our room was being repainted and the water in the hot tub looked dirty and nasty. The pool over by the office had water in it but was covered so we didn't even check out the hot tub there. The third pool over by the game room was okay but still needed to be cleaned because their was debris swimming on to of the water. The hot tub did not have water in it at all.

I sent the letter on 8/9/2007 and never received a response. I can see by some of the other reviews on this site, that I wasn't the only one with an issue.} It was not a good stay due to three major issues: Mold, roaches and the size of the unit. When we arrived, we found that the unit had a strong odor of mold and that odor was there the entire 5 nights. The air in the room was always humid in spite of the constantly running air conditioner. I noted that there was space around the air conditioning unit that allowed outside air into the unit. This may have been part of the problem. Our clothes retained the moldy odor even after we left. We found roaches in the unit. We had to be careful to store all our food, including dry stuffs, in the refrigerator to protect them. We also used disinfectant constantly on the counter tops. When I made the reservations, I used Indian Point Resorts' website to research the amenities. The website shows a diagram of the unit but neither the diagram nor the narrative, had details on the unit's dimensions. Based on the relative sizes of the cabinets and furniture depicted in the diagram, it appeared that the unit would be spacious enough for our needs. However, when we arrived, we found the unit was much smaller than expected. In reviewing the diagram, I found that even though its perimeter was proportional to the perimeter of the actual unit, the furniture (beds, table, cabinets, etc.) was not. The furniture was depicted much smaller in the diagram which, without any dimensions, gives the impression of a more spacious unit. I felt this was deliberate. However, I would like to compliment the staff. Each time we communicated with them, they were knowledgeable and very helpful.

The TV was old but there were several channels to pick from other than just local channels and the picture was actually good for being such an old TV. It was on top of the refrigerator which made it difficult to get to and a short person would have to stand on a chair to get to the TV. It also made it difficult to watch because of the way everything had to be arranged in the room. The window unit A/C had to be on \"high\" or \"off\" so sometimes it was too cold which was better than being too hot since we were there in July.

There is no insurance available and no one under 21 can drive the boats or jet skis. There are alot of deer around the park-that was nice. But.... The RV park was awful. The water is not close.The sites are small and trees are overgrown. We had a thorn tree over our picnic table. We cut it back so we could sit at the table. They have rvs for rent but some were not inhabitable. The people who rented one were moved. The said the telephone did not work or the shower and it was infested with ants. The window was broken and duct taped and you had to squeeze past the airconditioner to get in the door.

We spoke to several (7 families) rvers in the park all were first timers and we did not find anyone who was happy. All said they would not be back.

I felt bad for my family since I had picked the park. When we first drove in I was disapointed on arrival. I told them it would be a nice spot once it was dark and we couldn't see. Then the cops showed up. One rv site is on the side of the road on a hill. It was not level. The guy had the front of his camper on the ground and his only area was a very small deck and then a ravine. I was afraid someone would drive by and hit his camper it sticks out in the road. . The rv park seems like it was built in the 50's and appears to have had very little attention since. Our sewer hookup had no lid was only covered by a rock. The trash dumpster is not within walking distance if you are carrying much trash. There is a shower house available. I was thankful we did not need it. The toilet had no lid on the tank. There was no trash however. There is very little room for kids to play and it would not be safe due to they layout. All the sites we looked at had a small patio or deck and then dropped of the slope. We felt they should level the place and start over. When you look at their website you will not find any pictures of the park or spaces. We now know why.
