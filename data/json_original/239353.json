They wouldn't let us go to a different hotel since the guy lied to us. They just want to give us a coupon for 30 on our next visit. Well you can bet that it will NOT be at this motel.

How in the world are you going to charge the same price as the Marriott Downtown Memphis when clearly this \"MOTEL\" is a hottttttttttttttttttttttttttttt messsssssssssssssss. Please Please be careful if your trying to book a room at this motel. I always always look at the reviews before I book a room and everyone was right about this hotel. The owner is crazy.

When I explained that I had seen his regular prices online, he proceeded to say that all the rooms online are booked and people would be willing to stay at his hotel 5-6 nights for the rates and that he could cut them a deal of $115/night. This is such an unfair practice that this hotel is using to abuse possible customers. I thanked him and promptly hung up. I would not stay here or recommend this place to anyone!!!!

When I went home to visit I looked at my mail and found a letter from the holel stating that an iron and ironing board was missing and they were charging me $48.00. Thinking it was a mistake I called up and was told that the items were missing therefore they charged me. When I explained that I had never seen an iron or ironing board and had only slept there for about 8 hours, I was told that the housekeeping checks all rooms after customers leave and that they were in there before I rented the room. I again stated that I did not take the items and asked if he was calling me a liar. He stated that it was found missing by the housekeeping. Not only was I charged for something that I did not take but I was called a liar. The hotel is not very clean nor is it in a safe area. There were mattresses leaning on the sides of the building.
