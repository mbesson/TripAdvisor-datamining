Its last station with metro Anagnina and it can take you to the central of city. The main problem is that you cant pass zebra so quick. Terrible traffic around 18h. But friendly staff can offer you a lift to a metro station. They are very nice and they can give you a lots of informations about sight-seeing. Hotel is nice inside and you can make yourself a coffe in the morning. Some rooms includes fridges and cooking device. So, I dont see any problem, that people woudnt stay in Residence Gra 21!!!", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelos, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cResidence GRA 21\u201d", "Author": "jbrunopt", "ReviewID": "UR86806709", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel by the end of June 2009. It is a very nice hotel. Pros: The room was very good (with air conditioner, TV Satellite...) and the staff is just great. Cons: The location - it was quite hard for me to find this hotel (I went by foot to try to find this hotel). You have to follow that busy road near the Anagnina metro station. And not having a restaurant or bar is also bad, I think. If you have problems in finding the hotel you can contact the hotel staff and they may pick you at the metro station, they are very friendly!", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cGood value in Rome\u201d", "Author": "tlartist", "ReviewID": "UR7351463", "Content": "Overall I would recommend this hotel. Please consider whether the negative comments below apply to your situation. Don't want to scare you away from the place, you just need to know about these things. Reasons I liked Residence GRA: 1) value compared to other hotels in Roma (I paid 90 euro per night), 2) it was a new hotel with tile floors so no worries about walking on the floor or sleeping in the bed, 3) the owner is very involved in the hotel and was VERY nice/helpful, 4) has air conditioning with an in-room control as well as other amenities like hair dryer. Reasons I did not like Residence GRA: 1) the place is fairly hard to find, although I have to admit the owner did send me directions via internet but I was in the middle of traveling and did not see them (for sure contact the place to get written directions on how to find it), there are also posted signs for how to get to the place, but still hard to find, if I had to do over again I would take a cab with my luggage even though the place is only about a 10 minute walk from the train station, 2) the main street you have to cross is pretty hard to navigate for travelers on foot, this can not be overstated, particularly for older people, people with children, etc. I don't want to scare you away from the place, but this is definitely an issue. Options include taking a cab to/from the place or sometimes the owner said he gives rides to people. I am in decent shape and had some challenges getting across the street. Had to wait 10-15 minutes to find just the right time to sprint across about 4 lanes of traffic, 3) the metro stops running at 9PM and the place is pretty far out from the city center. No way you would want to walk from the city center to the hotel. I was told you could take the bus at night, but thankfully did not have to do this, 4) the location of the place may not be the best from a safety perspective, I read some of the other reviews and did not have a problem either, but just something to consider.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence G.R.A. 21", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d633115-Reviews-Residence_G_R_A_21-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $132*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Anagnina 21</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Grande Raccordo Anulare</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00173</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "633115", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5a/65/5a65aa8cd3f25147b171bf2471222cac1large.jpg"}}
