The rooms are very comfortable, very clean and extremely nicely furnished. Our room had a stunning bathroom, recently upgraded, and carefully designed to utilise the space adequately and well.

That was enough to do the online check in for our departure and it was the icing on the cake for us. The breakfast was a very cheerful event, as well. We are not 5 star hotel people, and probably never will be irrespective of economics. We firmly belive these small, well situated, and comfortable hotels are the best way to travel because of their (usually!) innate friendliness. This one wins hands down.

On my most recent stay in Paris, I had a free weekend prior to my flight back to Sydney & so as I was paying & travelling by myself, decided to find more modest digs for my two nights in town! After reading the reviews on this website for La Sanguine & given its location in Madeleine, I decided to give it a try. La Sanguine is certainly not five-star, but neither does it pretend to be. The rooms are very cosy & reasonably modest, but very clean & equipped with a/c & cable TV etc. I had a lower floor room (3rd floor) which was one of the larger rooms as I discovered when seeing some of the others being cleaned. My recommendation is certainly to go for the larger / bath tub lower floor rooms as they are still very compact but given the lack of an elevator in the hotel, made carrying luggage up & down to the room a little easier. The real star of the show at La Sanguine however is the service. I travel a lot & normally stay 5 star & can tell you that the quality of service is rarely, if ever, at the standard of La Sanguine. You really do feel as if you are personal house guests & are always treated with genuine warmth delivered with a smile. All the staff speak English and like nothing more than to have a chat or provide advice about activities or getting around town. The Madeleine location is also perfect for those travelling for pleasure & looking to explore either via the Metro or the 5 minute walk to Concorde / Champs Elysees etc. Like any big European city, hotel rooms are normally big on cost & small on size. La Sanguine may also be small, but absolutely makes up for it with good value & excellent people. While I'll still stay at the Hyatt Madeleine for work, I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending La Sanguine for travellers to Paris with better things to spend money on than overpriced hotel rooms!

I assume that this room was once without bath, which would have been manageable, but for two people it was too small (I literally had to lie on the bed or go in the bathroom, while my wife was getting dressed.) The view was an air shaft. We had a fourth floor room (no elevator). The fourth floor ceiling are only about 7 feet high while the lower floor seemed more reasonable. There was one very strong a/c which worked great, but it was noisy and hard to adjust in such a small room, it was great to cool down the room, but we certainly couldn't sleep with it at night. The bathroom was tiny, with a shower curtained stall shower. On the other hand, the entire hotel was incredibly clean, the staff was very nice. We had breakfast one morning, and the owners told us about the special jam and fruits. There was always someone at the desk. The hotel is a couple hundred meters from the Madelaine Metro stop, which was great, but because of 7 crosswalks took at least 5 minutes to walk to. The neighborhood is very upscale and we walked to lots of places like the Place de la Concorde, Tueleries, Orangerie, Opera, all less than 10 minutes. I feel bad writing what is a somewhat negative review, I imagine if we had gotten a bigger room, on floor 2 and 3, we would have been a lot happier, but was told on booking that they were not available. I do wonder about that, since we never saw more than a dozen others altogether during the 3 days were there. But we didn't get such a room, so I have to base my review on what we experienced. Also, according to price list, these rooms were significantly more expensive. Our only other experience in Paris was a 4 star hotel that we got at a discount which didn't have the character of this hotel, the location, the ambience, but our room was beautiful, at least 3 times the size and we paid about the same rate. Perhaps, if someone insists on a larger room on a lower floor for a lower price, I could recommend this hotel, but otherwise I could not. I wanted to take some pictures of the room, but couldn't find a place to stand far back enough in the room to take a picture.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco, ca", "Title": "\u201cJust all right for price and location\u201d", "Author": "tahiti05", "ReviewID": "UR5204976", "Content": "I agree with the previous poster that the hotel is about average and does not really merit a place in the top 10 list of paris hotels. We stayed for 3 days at the hotel and enjoyed very much the convenient location (2 min walk to Madeleine subway stop and walking distance to Champs Elysees and Place de la Concorde). The owners were generally nice but the service wasn't anything too special. Our room on the 4th floor was cramped and small (yes it is true that most Paris rooms are small) but it felt a bit like an attic room. The bathroom was decently clean but there were a lot of cracks in the tiles. The good thing is plenty of hot water, the A/C worked well and they have internet access. We also stayed one night in Hotel de Fleurie in the 6th arrondisement and although it is more expensive we loved it and recommend it over Hotel La Sanguine.", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGood but not worth a a #5 on Trip Advisor\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5144930", "Content": "I was a bit disappointed after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor.

It is walking distance to Place de la Concorde, Champs Elys\u00e9es, Louvre, Seine, and many great brasseries and restaurants. We arrived late on a Sunday night, before May Day, a holiday in Europe. We did not get a very warm reception. I mention the holiday to say that we were not greeted by the propriotors and we did not see them until the third day due to the holiday. We got a non-smoking room, number 306, and it seemed as if the previous guest had disregarded that notice. We got to open our windows, the weather was great, so the smell dissipated quickly, but it returned every time we returned to the room after being outside for a while. Mold. There was a bit in our bathroom. It was on top of the toilet tank and on both sides of the shower curtain rod, where it attaches to the wall. I maintain that I got sick because of it, but it could have been the smoke in the room. We never ate the breakfast at the hotel (it wasn't included in the price) so I can't comment on that. I can not believe Hotel La Sanguine is a top 10 hotel in Paris. It is #7 on TripAdvisor as I write this review.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel La Sanguine", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d302996-Reviews-Hotel_La_Sanguine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$113 - $185*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6 rue de Surene</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">8th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "302996", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/6c/2b/hotel-la-sanguine-thumbnail.jpg"}}
