The attitude of the staff is great. Always asking what can I do for you. We brought our grandkids with us for their 1st visit to Puerto Rico. They loved it and wanted to know if we could move to El Buen Cafe so they could come every year to visit us. It is located right on Rt 2 which makes travel to sights easy. On the west end of the island seems to be much more tourist friendly also. El Nuen cafe is and will continue to be my place to stay when in Puerto Rico.

We were given room 109 and at first we thought it was just a box spring on the floor because it was six inches off the floor and so, so, so hard! Nope, it was a mattress, still wrapped in plastic, so no only are you uncomfortable all night, every time you move it sounds like a baby diaper. We had two very flat hard pillows, no hand towels, no washclothes and 2 towels marked \"picina\" so they were pool towels to boot. The front desk said couldn't help with more pillows or towels. After we went to dinner, a new desk clerk gave us 2 very nice towels and one hand towel. The room was very clean, television had 20 channels or so, street noise, but not unbearable. If we ever returned to the area, we would stay in San Juan and drive a bit more to be comfortable for the night rather than endure that bed again. Internet not functional, and clerk said it was protected.

My husband and I just stayed there one night and I don't think a 2nd night would've been too exciting. Our room was clean and well furnished. But our windows looked out onto the parking lot. The ladies at the front desk were very very helpful with all our questions. Even though this hotel isn't on the beach it's a short walk to the ocean. Because Hatillo is on the northern rough Atlantic side of the island there are no ideal swimming beaches. However, there is an amazing rock formation which is partially submerged and you can walk on it (careful, the rocks are very sharp!). When the huge waves crash into these rocks they make huge sprays and all the water drains from rock terrace to terrace, tide pool to tide pool. Very cool to play on. El Buen Cafe the restaurant is actually 2 restaurants. One is, well, a cafe and the other is a \"fancy\" restaurant. I use that term in quotes because the food they serve sounds fancy and the prices are quite steep. However, the ambiance stinks. When we went the place was almost empty, there is old tattered carpet on the floors and the tables and chairs look like something you'd find at a diner. It really felt (and smelled) like a cheap Chinese place instead of a fancy seafood house. We went to the actual cafe the next morning and LOVED it!

We got to Hatillo around 6:30 PM, and we were given our room. We were handed our remote (apparently people walk away with the remote controls to the TVs) and were told not to use to towels to clean cars, polish shoes or color our hair (apparently that's all been done there!). We were given directions and times to the cafe that opens really early and the restaurant along with two free drink coupons. The room was big and clean. The shower had good water pressure. The room was on the first floor. That's when the BOOM BOOM sounds started. The wedding party in the meeting room in the basement shook our rooms. So right after we took a shower we asked for a change of rooms since the party was to go till midnight as per the front desk. The lady at the front desk apoligized and took us to the other wing of the parador across the road (that's where the cafe and the restaurant are). This room was slightly smaller (and cheaper - I got a refund) but seemed to be newer construction. This room was clean too... and quiet. The beds were comfortable and except for the loading dock noises early the next morning, we had a rested stay. The restaurant on the first floor -the food is good... our wait staff was a bit stand offish - seemed like they were going thru the chores. They had a singer crooning Spanish songs (sounded like my Julio Iglesias CDs I love to listen but don't understand!) Checkout was a breeze. The staff helped us with tips to get to the Caverns and Arecibo.
