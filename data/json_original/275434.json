We paid 80 USD a night (40 each because we split it) which was the same price we were considering paying for a hostel... so glad I chose here instead! Even though our room had not been refurbished yet (53) you could tell that the rest of the hotel had been/was going through refurbishment. It looked beautiful! When I booked I made sure breakfast was included, but I assumed that it would be cold, continental... boy was I surprised! The breakfast was made to order and you could chose eggs, bacon, sausage (etc.) or even a full English breakfast! The absolute best thing about this hotel is the location, less than 5 minutes to Paddington which connects to the major tube lines for attractions around London, and the neighborhood it is in felt very safe (even for two young women traveling alone). The pub close by had great food and great beer and the locals in the area as well as hotel staff were very friendly and didn't mind answering a few tourist questions. In fact, most people went out of their way to give us a hand and friendly advice.

The staff are not English but that's fine by me and were very polite and even allowed us to leave our bags in reception for 6 hours after check in. Don't hesitate to book here if it's a room you're after to sightsee, we just used the hotel for somewhere to sleep and eat breakfast which for us was spot on!

So 2 of us had to share which was OK but not what was expected and with all of our luggage and shopping the room was pretty cluttered.

There are a few parking spaces outside the entrance of the hotel but I wouldn't bank on one being free. There is an underground carpark up the road which is not cheap but is probably the most reasonable in the area.

There is attention to detail, and the heating is superb , its -6 degrees nowadays here.... brrrr..... Jan 09.

She assured us the Athena was actually three stars instead of the Gower's two. Having seen the inside of the Gower, we were only too happy to go! So to the Athena we went, where we were greeted by another monosyllabic receptionist and given the key to Room 15. I know we were only paying \u00c2\u00a355 but we expected the room to be clean and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I have attached some photos which really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it justice, it was much worse than it looks! The carpet was absolutely filthy, and had dark grey 15\" wide border of dirt around the skirting board, which blended nicely with the paint blobs and unidentifiable stains the rest of it was patterned with.... The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the net curtains looked as thought they had never been washed, and were the same dark grey as the carpet! The bed was pushed right up against the window so we had to tie the nets in a knot to stop them falling over us in the night. The bedding was actually surprisingly clean considering the rest of the room, it was just a shame the sheets had holes in them! The bathroom however, was fairly clean although the toilet had brown stains in it. We would have complained but the surly receptionist had disappeared when we went back downstairs, and to be honest from the state of the place I'm not sure they would have had anything better anyway. When we went down for breakfast in the morning we were studiously ignored by both the serving staff for about 5 minutes until we managed to corner one of them and ask where we were supposed to sit. The breakfast was ok, no complaints for the money but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back to see if we wanted tea or coffee. So a hugely disappointing experience and we were always prepared for a very basic room because of the cost but not the dirt or staff attitude. There was no 3 star rating signage anywhere on view in the Athena nor did the Gower across the road display their supposed two star rating. We have friends who run a a three star hotel and they would have their rating taken away if they had the nerve to give customers a room like this!", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Athena Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d275434-Reviews-Athena_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$116 - $443*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">110-114 Sussex Gardens</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Paddington</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 1UA</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "275434", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/3/8/0/2/162083/162083.jpg"}}
