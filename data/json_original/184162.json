Our room was smaller than at some other Best Westerns we\u2019ve stayed at but didn\u2019t feel in any way cramped, and we had everything we needed \u2013 very comfortable bed and pillows, good wifi signal, microwave and fridge (both available on request) and free underground parking (for Vancouver, that\u2019s a bit of a find). The rates are very reasonable, especially for somewhere so close to downtown. I was a little worried that being on the ground floor, our room might be noisy, but we heard no sounds from inside or outside the hotel. The room had a double door off the corridor; the space between the outer and inner doors probably absorbed any sounds from guests using the corridor. And our window was actually well above street level, providing privacy and quiet. The ground-floor rooms overlook a back street that has virtually no traffic. A continental breakfast is included. We try to eat gluten free, sometimes a challenge with hotel breakfasts, so we were pleased to find the selection included oatmeal, yogurt, egg patties/omelets, bananas and apples. Also discovered a gluten-free bakery called Mygoodness just a two-minute walk away at 235 East Broadway, and around the corner from it, the Wallflower Modern Diner at 2420 Main Street, which has gluten-free options. The Salt and Pepper Grill and Bar next door to the hotel serves tasty food and gives a 10% discount on presentation of your room key. And there are countless restaurants and coffee shops within easy walking distance. The Kingsgate Mall is just across the street from the hotel.

I tried a couple times to score a room for the 70-80 dollar range with Priceline. Then I thought about it: Yes, the 4 star hotels generally have beautiful rooms. But they are downtown and I would have to pay for parking and internet. That would bump up my daily room price to 120 dollars a night (including the taxes and fees of PL). That's 30 dollars toward a good meal in Vancouver! So, I decided to look elsewhere. This Best Western is in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood - filled with great restaurants and shops on Main, Broadway, and Kingsway. I am kind at the phase of my Vancouver traveling, that I'm not too interested in going downtown. From this hotel, you can walk Broadway and catch the 99 bus to Kits, or Granville or you can walk to the waterfront. The best perk is that it comes with free parking. The first morning, I woke up, looked out my window, and saw a classic Vancouver smash and grab-broken car window. Their parking is very secure but small. Free internet! They also have a nice free continental breakfast - my only complaint is that the coffee in the room tasted better than the coffee they served. Luckily, there is a good coffee shop on Main street just one block away. I would also suggest getting a room not on the first floor. We paid their rockbottom internet prices, so I wasn't surprised that we were on the first floor. It wasn't too bad until the Saturday night-hustle woke me up a couple of times.

The free continental breakfast was great as there was a large selection of food to choose from & it was constantly being replenished by the staff. The dining room could do with being a little bigger as it was always full but most guests were considerate enough to let you share their table & make room as soon as they'd finished. There was free wi-fi in the room and also free use of the computer & printer in the lobby. The parking garage was a little tricky to manouvre in if you had a big car (luckily Steve did all the driving) - apparently there are only 40 spaces but they have 70 rooms so they don't charge for parking as they can't guarantee a spot although we always found one and the hotel was full for a couple of nights of our stay. The hotel is away from downtown Vancouver but as we had a car we had no trouble getting around however there seemed to be plenty of buses along Kingsway which is literally steps away from the front door (if you need to park your car in Vancouver check out the 'Easy Park' website - the prices for each lot vary considerably as well as the opening times but we found them really useful.) There is a Starbucks and a Tim Hortons within 5 minutes walk of the hotel and a few cafes & restaurants although we only tried one (a Mongolian Grill - very reasonable as it was an 'all-u-can-eat' and the chef cooks the raw ingredients that you have chosen.) The gym was very small but had enough pieces of equipment in it to keep me busy for a while - bike, 2 x cross-trainers/skiers, treadmill, free weights, bench & mats. The only complaint I would have about this hotel is the lack of soundproofing between rooms - we had a young family next to us for a few days & heard every sound their 'excitable' children made all night & almost resorted to leaving our TV on to muffle the noise. The next guests left their alarm clock to go off after they'd left & that woke us up through the walls the next morning as if it was in our room! All in all we were very pleased with our stay, it was just what we wanted and was ideal for getting into town or out into the surrounding areas due to its proximity to several main routes (Kingsway, Main Street, Broadway etc.)", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fernandina Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat find (thanks to TripAdvisor)!\u201d", "Author": "Amelians", "ReviewID": "UR83354641", "Content": "It's hard to imagine a better value in pricey Vancouver.

We were able to buy a day pass for $9 Canadian and jump on the Metro (there is a bus stop within walking distance from the hotel). That bus took us all the way to Stanley Park (about a 15min ride) which is must see- we rented bicycles and rode around the perimeter of the park- beautiful! The hotel itself offered all basic amenities and although there was nothing spectacular about it, it was clean,the beds were comfortable and the staff was friendly. Yes, the breakfast room was quite small- but i must admit I was impressed by their selection of danish/muffins etc. There is a restaurant next door that offers a nice, hot alternative but not if you are in a hurry- the service in Vancouver is friendly, but slow! The underground mall next door was convenient for last minute toiletries. If you want souvenirs- go to the Sears on Robson Street- you can find some great deals on Olympic wear!

The elevators are very slow, so don't be lazy -- just take the stairs, you'll save tons of time and get some exeercise.

The reservation staff was polite. When first arriving, park on the street or in adjacent grocery parking lot, as the \"structure\" needs a room key to enter. We put \"structure\" in quotes as this includes approxiamately 10 cozy underground spaces; first come first served. Note, however, even with a 'no vacancy' situation we found a space in the evening. There is one elevator, which can prove frustrating during busy times (breakfast). The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and lovely high ceilings. The window opened, and the air conditioning was adequate. Everything smelled and looked clean and appeared well maintained. The beds were comfortable and extra pillows were provided. All in all, comfortable and adequate accomodations. The 4th floor gym/solarium had a beautiful view and basic equipment. The continental breakfast, while crowded and seemingly standard fare, was remarkably delicious. Eat at least 3 apple fritters :-). The only real drawback, which could be avoided with proper planning, was the near complete lack of food establishments within walking distance. The hotel seems to be located in the automotive district, which meant quiet streets but a paucity of places open after 8PM. The mall (if you can call it a mall) across the street consisted of an off brand grocer, drug store and a Payless Shoes. No microwave in the room meant limited options for in room dining. There is an attached restaurant which does provide room service until around 9PM. Finally, if you're looking for activities other than food, much of Vancouver closes fairly early, however this hotel has you well out of the loop.

The area does have its own appeal; nearby Main Street has many ethnic restaurants, there is a nice small neighbourhood park- Robson Park, just a few blocks away. We stay because of its proximity to a Taoist Ta'i Chi Centre nearby. Also well located if visiting a patient at nearby St. Joseph's Hospital. I have stayed a couple of times at this hotel, and it scores very high in terms of value for price. Being from just outside the Greater Vancouver area, I know of dozens of nondescript hotels that are no great value, and a dozen or so truly exceptional 5 star establishments. But the Uptown is almost unique in being a genuinely 3.5 star rated hotel that is priced like a 2 star. There are under 60 rooms, some very oddly configured because of the wedge shape of the property. Very basic check in counter, with friendly staff and free newspapers. The breakfast room is adjacent- and my advice is to skip it and eat a hot breakfast next door at the Salt and Pepper for $5.95 ,owned by the hotel operators. Remember that each BW hotel is privately under a franchise system, so there is a both a ma/pa feel and a corporate neutrality to the place. Very secure parking as noted by other reviewers and the rooms have good beds, DSL internet gratis, the usual bathroom notions and amenities found in $150 hotels, not the $89 we paid. The toilets are crammed into a little corner, but there is just enough room. Granite topped vanity. A small contemplative 'garden terrace' is off the south side of the second floor, and a modest fitness room on the third. Free ice and in-room tea/coffee. One can order room service from the Salt and Pepper. Drawbacks? The Kingsway area has car dealerships and a convergence of traffic, so there is some noise and little intrinsic beauty. But there are some nice views from the north facing rooms.

Moving on - the corridors are grim, seriously grim lighting and more like the corridors of a youth hostel. They also smelt like public lavatories. Passing the windowless breakfrast room, we made our decision to pass on the complimentary breakfast. Whist all rooms are non-smoking, this one smelt of tobacco. It was very clean however and the bed very comfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was tiny, only 1 person at a time could get in. Very early one morning I went to go into the bathroom to find the door had locked. I went to reception to report this and after tracking someone down (there was no-one at the desk), the person seemed put out and I was told that we must have locked it ourselves. Interesting considering we were outside and the lock was inside, we were also told we would have to wait until 8am until someone came to look at it. After searching around, we found we had packed a tool and we fixed it ourselves. After checking out we asked if we could store our luggage. Luggage storage is in the breakfast room - at least no-one can see it from the outside - there aren't any windows! If you want tags on your luggage you have to ask for them. We stayed out of this hotel as much as possible as it was simply too grim to spend any time in. We would definately not go back or recommend. As the location is some way out of the City, walk out of the hotel and turn right along the main road and call into the chemist in the mall which is next to the supermarker.

Booked it 14 days in advance and got about 60 CAD pernight. The room was clean and had everything you need, except for a safe to keep my passport and important documents, but that wouldnt matter much. Had everything i need in the room, tv, microwave, fridge and wireless internet. (The cable didnt work for me but the wireless was still fast). Although i am not sure if there is a microwave in every room, (I Requested for it) and they put me on the first floor, right beside the breakfast room. (Just few steps away) Room was very neatly done and very cozy, with high celings and very spaceous. I was pretty happy that they had a direct bus to UBC just half a block away, and also bus 19 goes directly to metrotown station. Walking to the skytrain isn't that bad since it only takes about 10-15mins. I am quite impressed with the service at the frontdesk as they were always friendly to guide you about the food around the area, and also the directions to places. Oh yeah, the free breakfast every morning was a bonus. Had bread, hot chocolate, cereals, juices, muffins, coffee and stuffs there. So overall, i would give this hotel a 5 star rating for the price and i would definitely recommend anyone to stay here.
