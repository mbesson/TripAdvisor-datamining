It is a little bit of a walk to any of the shops/sights but with the local weather usually pleasant this isn't much of a problem for me! The hotel bar and restaurant are basic but of excellent quality. The menu is available in English. The rooms I have stayed in are all excellent, spacious and well appointed. The cabled internet works brilliantly without any logins or fuss. Unfortunately I have occasionally found the reception and waiting staff a little less than delightful - never rude or anything just obviously busy and \"not keen\".", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cImpressive plus value\u201d", "Author": "MerrillfromPinner", "ReviewID": "UR121207203", "Content": "We are a couple in our fifties. We needed a hotel near a metro line from the airport, as we would be arriving at 11.30pm. Also we needed to continue our journey to La Poveda, which is nearly the end of line 9, so we needed an easy journey early next morning. Hotel Don Pio was almost exactly outside metro Pio Xii. Our hunger at 11.30 pm was perfectly sated with a decent bar meal, graciously served. Large and comfortable room with an opening window (a necessary requirement for us) and heating that worked well. Excellent and impressive bathroom facilities. Minuses - they only had a smoking room left (we were late) but the atmosphere was ok and we could open the window and leave it while we ate. Small minus - they only had twin adjoining beds available. Next morning, adequate breakfast, very fresh, good juice and coffee. The hotel is built round an indoor courtyard,which houses the lounge and dining room and is most beautifully furnished and maintained. Excellent value for E108 thereabouts. Impressive, and good value.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cClassy and great value!\u201d", "Author": "belotoCH", "ReviewID": "UR116813923", "Content": "The Hotel Don Pio was recommended to my husband and I by friends who live in Madrid. I knew the neighborhood from living in that area 30 years ago. Quiet and upscale area of Madrid at a very, very good rate. A four-star hotel, Don Pio is a class of its own. The old colonial decoration and construction of the hotel and rooms are as a friend puts it \"A pure example of the owners/builders whims\". Great service, all around the hotel departments and an extraordinary breakfast buffet. The housekeeping service was amazing! I left my room for a few minutes and upon my return, my room was clean and made! The only drawback to this hotel would be a not so central location from Madrid's nightlife. However, there is a metro station right across the street. There are also plenty of buses which take you to downtown Madrid, while sightseeing the streets of this elegant city. It's a good thing to go out at night but come back to a beautiful and quiet room. We loved it and we'll definitely go back there every time we visit that city!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cv.cozy hotel, everyone like a family\u201d", "Author": "sherif27", "ReviewID": "UR104226641", "Content": "ive stayed here 5 times so far for biz. wonderful hotel. the rooms are large between 35-45m, standard inroom amenities. the staff are amazing, very helpful, very kind, all have been at hotel for many years. morning breakfast is standard selection nothing exceptional but has everything one needs. free wifi throughout hotel including rooms. value for money nothing can compare. there is a huge hypermarket across st. u can get whatever u like, no hotel restrictions, theyll even help you with your drinks. metro also across st. and many nice shops, rest in area. the cons, room service isnt 24hrs, tv in room needs to be upgraded including more english channel selections.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Algiers", "Title": "\u201cQuite OK\u201d", "Author": "Rashid_DZ", "ReviewID": "UR25801563", "Content": "The Hotel is in the center of Madrid, It was very easy to book by phone, good personnel, the rooms are of excellent style, they have a beautiful restaurant (the shape, I didn't eat there).

The rooms are very large and exceptionally clean. They are air conditioned and internet accessible. The breakfast is one of the nicer buffets we've encountered in Europe: variety of breads and pastries, fresh fruit and juices, local delicacies, eggs and ham, cereal, yogurt, and churros with hot chocolate. The hotel is also fairly convenient for tourists. It's directly across the street from a metro stop and a bus stop. However, it takes about 30 minutes to get down to the main tourist attractions. We did run into a few significant bumps that would never have been so easily dismissed in the US. We requested wake up calls for two rooms on our first morning. They failed to put through the calls and so part of our group was several hours late for meetings. The hotel staff was quite unapologetic about this. Fortunately for us, there were no significant ramifications. We also had a mix up with laundry services that took more than a day to \"iron\" out. The hotel staff kept returning laundry that wasn't ours while our laundry was M.I.A. Finally, we had a huge problem with a bathroom sink that wasn't draining. It was filled with little hairs. I asked the hotel staff to take care of it while we were out and we never had another challenge. These little things were significant enough to note, but did not detract from the rest of our stay at Don Pio. We enjoyed the friendly staff and the local restaurants in a completely un-touristy neighborhood. The hotel is also about a fifteen minute taxi ride or a 20 minute subway ride from the airport.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Don Pio", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d605820-Reviews-Don_Pio-Madrid.html", "Price": "$99 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Pio XII, 25</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28016</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "605820", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2d/7d/11/la-luz-del-patio.jpg"}}
