I came back from dinner and just as I came through the front door there was \"Maegen Ibanez\" with a giant smile and the exact zippo lighter I had purchased from the Marine Corps Base for my son. What I found out was that she had gone to the base and purchased a new one just like the one that had been lost. I could go on about how clean the rooms are and that the breakfast is good and that the cookies that are baked daily are fantastic but I have to say \"Maegen Ibanez\" made my year and helped make a very special event even that much more special.

I selected this hotel from hotelplanner.com based on location, parking and price. The players and coaches were staying on the beach but the parents wanted to stay somewhere with breakfast, free parking and not too expensive. The sales manager, Kristin, and her entire staff were awesome; accommodating, friendly and attentive. They had no problem allowing a couple of us to change rooms so we could be closer the the rest of the group and allow for the kids to be more accessible to the pool and front desk area. The hotel had a nice complimentary breakfast with cereal, oatmeal, eggs (different variety each day), bread/pastries, waffles, etc. Coffee, juice and water were available throughout most of the day. They had a nice sitting area on the first floor which was perfect for parents to meet in the evenings if they didn't want to sit outside by the pool or hang out in a room. Our room was clean and comfortable, although no microwave or refrigerator. I understand you can get a fridge but would need to pay a daily fee; we had ice chests so that worked fine and each floor had an ice machine. The hotel was centrally located to the beach, Old Town, downtown, sports arena, zoo, Seaworld and freeways so we weren't far from all sorts of activities. There were also grocery stores, Target and other stores, restaurants, etc just a block or so away (also nearby is a strip club but I never felt unsafe or heard any noise). Unlike the player's hotel, Hampton Inn offered a very filling breakfast and free parking so this was a great hotel for our families and at a reasonable price!", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indio CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hampton Inn experience\u201d", "Author": "OceanBreezesSD", "ReviewID": "UR127773535", "Content": "Everything about our stay was flawless.

It's not the kind of area that I felt comfortable (or interested in) walking around.

Hotel: The breakfast was delicious, but I do wish that meat was not mixed into the hot entrees (breakfast bagels with cheese, eggs, and ham; scrambled eggs with ham).

I asked about restaurant recommendations and was given a helpful list in which the front desk person, put stars on the places that were close by and had great food. She offered me a refreshment and asked how many I needed. I was pleasantly surprised on their hospitality and left their desk with a smile on my face. When we entered the room, it was at the back of the property and it was very well decorated. There was a strange scent when I walked in, and wasn't sure what it was. I sprayed the room with my orange air freshener and it smelled a lot better. The room was large and had a small sink adjacent to the microwave and fridge. I noticed there was some white residue caked on that faucet and it looked like it might need some cleaning. I decided to just use the bathroom sink to wash my daughter's cup. Besides that the room was clean and I appreciated that they use a duvet and have a sign that they use fresh linens for every patron. The breakfast was awesome, there was fresh fruit, hot oatmeal, waffles, potatoes, turkey sausage, eggs with ham and cheese, breads and pastries. The staff was so friendly and there was a member of the management office who came by to say hello and she even cleared people's plates.

Hampton Inn was a real deal! After arriving from Los Angeles and spending the whole afternoon at the Sea World, we (myself, my wife and 14YO son) would be looking forward for a fast, efficient check in and refreshing shower. And Hampton Inn San Diego Sea World provided those. The room (double queen bed) is very spacious, complete with many cable-TV channels to select. All the beds were very comfortable with thick soft pillow. The room itself is clean with simple modern atmosphere and the (thick) door also felt very secure with cardkey entry. The thick carpet also looked and felt very clean. The bathroom is also clean, not a huge one but with adequate space for you not to feel cramped. Good showers with warm water and sufficient water pressure. Towels are provided generously and smells nice too. Wifi is available in the room, free, but somehow it felt a bit slower. I don't know why, maybe because we requested for a room far away at the back of the hotel, hoping for a calm and quiet environment. We didn't bother for this since we stayed only for one night. As we have the room which is quiet as expected, I also realise that most of the area of this hotel are also quiet. So I guess (almost) all the windows and exit doors are doing their job fine in blocking the noise from outside. Parking is also non problem. At a quick glance, you may notice that it seems all the parking spaces have been occupied, but then look carefully and closely, there are always about 3 to 4 spaces available. I noticed this, because eventhough we stayed only for one night, we did go out and returned to the hotel twice. Breakfast is a real plus. Nice large breakfast room with lots of choices of breads, waffles, pancakes, muffins and cereals with fruit juices, milk, chocolates, coffee and tea. They have eggs and even my son enjoyed very much when he made his own waffles. The surroundings. A couple reviews I read before selecting this hotel, have mentioned about the nude bar located next to the hotel. My opinion, I didn't feel the uncomfortable feeling as mentioned on those review. First, the bar does not located directly next to the hotel, and somehow it does not placed itself entirely provocating. I felt that because later in the evening, we took a walk and went to Dennys for dinner (FYI, there are many choices if ones decided to go dining outside, within walking distance). There is also a pool but we didn't have the opportunity to use it, although it looks fairly inviting. So conclusion is: (+): Check-in/out staffs, clean spacious bed room, great breakfast, quiet, comforting beds. (-) : A bit slow internet, AC a bit noisy (in my room).

Luckily, we were able to check in earlier in the day (somewhere around noon, instead of the normal three o clock check in), The staff was very accomodating checking us in early and there was no problems. Our room was on the first floor (one without a deck or balcony). After check in, we headed over to Cabrillo NM and Mission Beach. Both are highly recommended and very close to the hotel. Cabrillo is beautiful and Mission Beach was fun. Except this is where we experienced the power outage while shopping in one of the beach front stores. So since the stores closed, we just walked around on the beach picking up shells and getting some sun. After an hour of noticing the power hadn't come back on we decided to head back to the hotel. Traffic was a nightmare and it took forever. Every business had closed, and everyone was in their car trying to get home. We finally made it to the hotel with some light left in the day. The staff remained very calm and had flashlights that they were using to guide guests to their rooms since no lights were on. There was still hot coffee in the lobby and they were handing out bottled water. Information they had was passed along, including info on a local restaurant that was still open and serving food. They handled a terrible situation the best anyone could have and they need to be commended for it. Hopefully another power outage of this scale will ever happen again in San Diego, but if it does I can promise that this Hampton is well prepared to endure it. The power went out about 330 in the afternoon and came on around 330 the next morning. The rest of the trip and stay was very plesant as well. The breakfast here is one of the best I've had compared to other Hilton's and Hampton's. The staff worked very hard to keep everything stocked. The waffles are great, and the hot dishes like scrambled eggs, omlets, potatoes, meats were varied each day so that nothing became boring. Fresh fruit, juice, cearal, yogurt, bagels, etc are also provided. Lots of papers floating around and two tvs on CNN for morning news. Never did visit the pool, but it looked very nice.

They didn't even really seem busy and I was there on a weekend. Don't let this scare you away from staying here. The parking was adequate and I never had a problem. The people who can't find this hotel must be travel-challenged. It is right off the I-5/I-8 interchange ramp. There are 2 major streets (Rosecrans & Camino del Rey) paralelling this property, from either one--just take Hancock (one way) into the property and Kurtz (one way out) away from the property, no problems at all. Just pay attention to where you are going, it isn't hard. Also be aware that this isn't your typical clean bright shiny Hampton Inn. It appears to be an older hotel that was taken over by Hampton Inns. Rooms, especially the carpets and furnishings are a bit dated and worn and the interior hallways are very dimly lit in some areas. The first night I was given a terrible room location-wise. Do NOT take a room near the front or front corners of this property, the street noise is terrible all night long. Plus I was awakened by a loud train whistle many times until 2:30 AM, but the front desk claims there isn't a train nearby????? Duh, I didn't make up the train waking me up 6 times from 11 PM to 2:30 AM????? Luckily it quit after 2:30 AM. For the second night I asked to be changed and the manager was very cordial and very accommodatingly upgraded my room to one with a balcony, fridge, and microwave. This room, near the back of the property was a little better furnishings-wise than the first room, but still needed a modern makeover. The room was very large, the bed was very comfy and the TV had about 40 channels, including HBO. But this room had its problems also. Like many hotel rooms everywhere, the sink drained very slowly. The wall thermostat controlled the heating unit, but no matter how high you put the thermostat the unit blew very little heat at all and the fan at times got VERY VERY noisy. I didn't bother asking for another room, I just figured most rooms would have their problems considering the worn condition of the furnishings in the 2 rooms I had. The day I checked out I called the front desk to complain about my neighbors smoking on their balcony and how they had done that all day yesterday also. It virtually made the balcony unusable having to smell their drifting smoke smell. How can people smoke on a private attached-to-their-room balcony in a non-smoking hotel? The front desk lady said \"we can't police that, but if we smell smoke, we charge them $200 to change the drapes, etc.\" How about stopping them from smoking in a non-smoking hotel period--those are YOUR rules? The breakfast WAS typical Hampton Inn. Many choices, plus daily changes of the hot entrees. The breakfast area was large and well-stocked. The hotel seemed very busy when I was there and the area was full most times, but the overflow area always had an extra table or two. That portion of this hotel was very good. The lobby was nice and spacious, but the lobby computers were VERY slow, probably the slowest I've ever encountered in any hotel ever. Must be a very slow dial-up. Didn't use the room wifi so don't know about that speed, but the lobby computers were terribly slow. As long as you understand that this is not a typical bright shiny Hampton Inn, then you'll most likely be pleased with most things. Location and price almost balance out the property's shortcomings.

In the morning, the shuttle service was overbooked and I had to book another cab, and spend another $20.

Check in took all of about 45 seconds and the girl at check in was very friendly. We were allowed to get into the room early which allowed us to get an early start to our first day exploring. The breakfast area looked unusally large. Part of it was the back half of the main lobby. Very nice and clean. There were also large flat screen TV's mounted in both locations so you could watch the morning news, if you so desired. There were always enough tables to be seated, never having to wait. Each morning, a very well stocked breakfast buffet was set out with both hot and cold breakfast items, and several juices and coffees to choose from as well. In the evening, they set out cookies in the lobby for the guests as well. The lobby was very large with plenty of seating, along with two computers for guest use. There have tight parking spaces, which tend to fill up fast, and I believe in the summer when the hotel is full there would not be enough to accomodate all the cars. In December, that was not a problem. We always managed to park right at the front entrance every night . Nearby restaurants within walking distance are Denny's and Jackin'box and subway. Anything else you would have to drive to because the hotel in next to a freeway off ramp and not very safe to cross the road there. The four block drive to Old Town was worth the drive. Plenty of great restaurants there. We read other reviews about the Nude bar around the corner and were a little concerned. This hotel is located in a business district area so that has to be expected. We did not see any seedy people lurking about the whole time we were there. Actually we hardly saw anybody outside of the buildings when we drove by. To us it was no different than passing a large billboard advertising nude revues. It seemed to be a safe area. The location of the hotel however, was great !! Close to everything... with access to both major interstates. The only disappointing thing we encountered was that there was no microwave / mini fridge in the room.

Somehow I got a feeling that this is not the first time they are doing this although I have no way of proving this. Another big factor that made us uncomfortable was the lcoation of the hotel. It sits very next to the freeway exit ramp making it difficult to cross the road by walk. Restaurants nearby are limited to Denny's and Jackin'box and subway. To get to other restaurants that are 2-blocks away, you have to cross an adult store (open 24-hours) and a strip joint - both are right across the hotel.

Upon arriving, my family and I were impressed with the way that the Hampton Inn itself looked, but ended up being very disapointed by the end of our 4 night trip. Here, I will take a look at some of the pros and cons of staying at the Hampton Inn, San Diego (near Sea World). PROS: 1. The hotel was nicely furnished. The foyer sort of had an upscale hotel feel to it. There were lots of places to relax and a TV to watch. The rooms were decorated very nicely with dark wood headboards and had nice stonework in the showers. The comforters were these amazing pure white down comforters and they were very nice to sleep under. The hotel kitchen/breakfast area was nicely decorated and the paint on the inside and outside of the hotel as kept up. Everything looked really, really nice. 2. A complimentary breakfast was served. The hotel staff prepared brown lunch bags for \"breakfast on the go\" for hotel Guests. Inside was a muffin, apple, bottled water, breakfast bar and some other yummy goodies. The hotel also had other breakfast items available in the kitchen. There was an egg, ham and cheese dish, as well as cereal and milk. The \"breakfast on the go\" bags were served on the weekends, while the other breakfast items were served during the weekdays. 3. The staff was incredibly helpful and nice. Several staff members went out of their way to make sure that my family's needs were taken care of. Extra sheets and blankets were given quickly and there was an air of a \"can-do\" attitude from almost everyone. There is one gentleman that stood out above the rest. I cannot remember his name, but he has curly hair and it tall and was the nicest front office clerk that I've ever encountered on a hotel stay. He was very helpful--if you ever stay at the Hampton, look to him for help--he's terrific! :) 4. There are extra commodities. There is a nice pool that attracted a decent sized crowd every night. There is also a pretty nice gym near the foyer of the hotel. There is a kitchen and also plenty of places to \"lounge\" around the hotel--places to sit and read a newspaper or book. 5. Secure doors. The hotel requires that you use a key card to gain entry in and out of the hotel itself, which provides an extra measure of security. 6. Great housecleaning people. The rooms were always kept completely clean and how they keep those white comforters looking so white baffles me! :) They are really excellent at what they do! CONS: 1. Doors. The doors do not have stripping at the bottom and there is about a 1\" gap underneath each door, so lots of noise tends to come in underneath it. 2. Walls/Floors. The walls were a little thin, so you could hear conversations going on in the next room when people were talking loud. We had a family with lots of children staying in the rooms above us and you could hear them running back and forth all night on the first night that we stayed there. 3. Area. The area around the hotel is a little seedy. Once you're inside the hotel, you feel pretty safe, but outside, you feel a little vulnerable. There are some strip clubs about 1 block away (right around the corner from the Denny's) and it's lit up with big neon letters. Down the street from the hotel, the streets are not lighted very well. The gate at the back of the parking lot (around the back of the hotel) is kept open during the day until 10:00 at night. There were several times that my family went out to our cars and we saw some interesting, scruffy looking people. It made you feel like you wanted to get into your car quickly, or at least be a little more vigilent. 4. Maintenance. Perhaps the biggest inconvenience on our trip was that we had to unpack and switch rooms every single night during our stay, except for the last one. The nightmare began on the first day, when the toilet in one of our two rooms started leaking out water everywhere. Towels were put down and the front desk was called. The front desk said that the toilet could not be fixed that day because the plumber was gone. They arranged for us to have another new room. However, the new room only held one King sized bed and we had 8 people in our party. A portion of our party took the new, smaller room, while another portion, moved into the leaky toilet room and the other into the good room. (We had an elderly person traveling with us and it is easy for her to slip--the water on the floor was definitely a hazard for her). The next day, the front desk sent a plumber to fix the problem. He said that it was a minor problem with a hose and that he could fix it quickly. However, when we came back to the hotel later in the day, we discovered that the entire toilet was missing!!! There was a big hole in the ground and black stuff on the tile around it. Everytime the toilet in the next room flushed, the hole in the ground made this awful gurgling sound, threatening to spew up some concoction of toilet goo. (Thankfully, it never actually did!!) The hotel offered us yet another new hotel room and the people in the leaky toilet room moved down the hall into the new room. Thinking that our maintenance wohs were over, we breathed a sigh of relief. Only, the maintenance troubles didn't end there. On the third night, at 3:53 in the morning, both my sister and I woke up to hear a very loud and awful rattling coming from the air conditioning unit! We laughed because we found it hilarious (in a weird way), that there was a problem with every single room we'd had. I lightly hit the unit and the rattling stopped....until about an hour later when it started up again. This continued several more times, almost every hour, until I whacked it really hard and kicked it and the rattling (not the air conditioning unit) finally stopped for good. The next morning, I discovered that the shower head was also broken, roar! Needless to say, with all the switching around, the poor maintenance, damaged toilet, broken showerhead, kids running upstairs, and rattling air conditioning unit, we didn't get much sleep. I came home feeling less rested than when I'd first come to the hotel, even though I was on vacation. Our family missed out on several events and locations because we spent so much time each day, switching our items back and forth to the new hotel rooms. 5. Beds. This might just be a picky thing, but the beds were really, really soft. I have a bad back and so did another one of our travelers and it didn't do either of us any favors. If you have a bad back, this may not be the hotel for you. 6. Warm/Hot Hallways. The hallway doors leading to the pool outside were kept open during our stay, making for toasty hallways and a gigantic mosquito on the wall. OVERALL IMPRESSION: Because of the poor maintenance and the horrible lack of sleep and lost vacation time due to our room problems, I would say that I won't ever be coming back to this hotel again. My family agrees with my decision. However, if the Hampton were to up it's maintenance program and make sure that the rooms were kept in tip-top order, then I'd re-consider. Until though, we will not be returning to the Hampton by Sea World.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland", "Title": "\u201cGood mid-range hotel, not such a good location\u201d", "Author": "BayAreaTraveler2", "ReviewID": "UR8018413", "Content": "The directions to the Hampton Inn are pretty simple.

All rooms are on the interior halls. (Some, however, are right above the lobby / eating area, and would probably be too loud if you wanted to sleep in.) The room was spacious and comfortable. Everything was clean. Parking is free. The oddest thing about the room is the outlets. The receptacles were too wide for standard-issue plugs. They would fit, but loosely. This affected not only our various electronic devices, but also the property\u2019s own items. An overhead light, for example, had a hard time staying plugged in. Opening the bathroom door too quickly could cause the microwave to become unplugged (there\u2019s no door stop for the bathroom door). It does come with a microwave, a larger than typical refrigerator, and a coffee maker. The standard Hampton breakfast is provided: Almost-fresh fruit salad, cereal, bagels, marginally edible hot item, etc. It\u2019s free and nice to have, but certainly not spectacular.

I'm sure I had one at the Easton PA Hampton Inn.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bakersfield, CA", "Title": "\u201cPleasant, comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "lneath", "ReviewID": "UR4972454", "Content": "After much research and time devoted to picking the perfect spot I just went with a tried and true, Hampton. The room was exceptionally clean, large, and felt very peaceful with a balcony and tree just outside. The lobby is well kept and they were doing maintenance while we were there, a good sign of continued upkeep which shows in fresh paint etc. The BIG drawback....PARKING. We came in late and had nowhere to park. The security officer directed me to park in fron of a van, thus blocking his exit. I was hesitant and not liking the situation but did as I was assured this was what I should do or park across the street at Denny's. Well, 7:15 a.m. they called for me to move my car. I was ticked because I knew it would happen. I think they are numb as this is a HUGE problem. No parking. Other that than that glitch is was a great stay, great pool, clean room, fine breakfast and I would recommend it.", "Date": "April 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "san marcos", "Title": "\u201cGlad I Stayed\u201d", "Author": "lippshaw", "ReviewID": "UR4887078", "Content": "I was concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but I'm glad I took the chance and stayed here. This is a great hotel for those that are self-sufficient. If you need lots of pampering and a resort type atmosphere, this is not your hotel. The rooms were spacious and very clean. I had a microwave and small refrigerator in my room. The balcony overlooking the pool was a nice touch. My room did not face the interstate and train, so it was very quiet. Make sure you request a quiet room away from the train. Breakfast was standard Hampton Inn and there was no shortage of food. Parking is tight, but I was able to find a place each night I stayed. About the location. Yes, there is a strip club two blocks away; however, the only way you know it's there is if you are going there for your own entertainment. Don't let this be your deciding factor. I felt very safe here. If you are traveling through on business or a budget-minded family that would rather spend money on things other than your hotel room, stay here.

Many cars end up in street due to lack of parking. If you have a Uhaul or trailer, I recommend you go elsewhere. Expect door dents if you park in the parking lot. If you're on vacation, I would recommend elsewhere as the area around the hotel is not a relaxing atmosphere (lots of traffic and businesses, including strip joint).

I've stayed at Hampton Inns before and am not necessarily a fan, but this was fairly close to the airport and it was reasonably priced (about $100 with tax). It's not in the best neighborhood (some strip clubs and bars adjacent), but I wouldn't label it as a dangerous area. The rooms are typical - nothing fancy. My room was very clean, although the entire place, even the halls, had a funky cleaning-fluid smell. The staff I encountered were reasonably nice and helpful. My only complaint is the loud doors. A peeve of mine is that there is a certain type of hotel visitor who doesn't care when their door slams behind them. The doors in this hotel were very loud and shook the walls. It was very annoying. The hotel shuttle runs once an hour on the half-hour starting at 4:30 a.m. I used this service and was satisfied. While I probably would not stay here again, I don't want to discourage the budget-minded traveler or somebody who wants to stay close to the airport or Sea World.
