First of all, it is in a quiet,clean neighborhood, only 5 minutes on foot from St Peters Basilica, and 15' walking from Rome's city center. If you are not a \"walking\" guy you can easily take the metro line Ottaviano, just 2 minutes distance from the hotel. In this area there are plenty of trattorias, restaurants, and bars for young people. Moreover, it has the second largest market road (after Via del Corso), and you can spend a whole day shopping only in this area, if you want! As far as the room is concerned,we booked a quadruple which was very clean and cozy. You can pay an additional fee of 5 euros/person if you want to have continental breakfast from the buffet. Staff is very friendly and helpful, so don't hesitate to ask for their help in any problem you might have.

The staff spoke English and in the main were friendly and helpful. Lots of steps but there was a lift. Due to the time of year we chose to pay extra to stay here because of the air conditioning, but due to their policy of returning the key when leaving the hotel it was not possible to return after a day out to a cool room, as we could not leave the air conditioning on whilst we were out! Some of the staff were willing to let us leave the key in, others were not, which caused a few 'discussions' (!) between us and the staff and slightly tainted our experience as in the end we were not able to have the air-con on whilst away from the hotel which in the heat of a Roman summer is not ideal.

I asked the hotel to arrange for transportation from the airport to the hotel so taht we would not have to figure it out upon arrival, never having been to Rome before. We arrived in Rome after a long flight from Toronto quite tired but excited. As soon as we got out of the gates, there was a driver waiting for us holding a sign with our last name. We approached him, dragging our bags behind us. The driver did not speak English, which did not matter to us, we understood to follow him to get to our ride. The man barrelled out of the airport so fast that we had trouble keeping up to him. We didn't want to lose him in the crowd of people so we practically ran to make sure we didn't get lost. Once we got to the mini van, we piled in our things and were rushed to finish quickly. One word of advise - PUT ON YOUR SEAT BELT!! Unfortunately, we didn't. The drivers in Rome are absolutely insane. As we got closer to heavier traffic, the driver swerved, sped and braked as though we were in a Formula 500 race. At one point, he braked so suddenly that my daughter and I literally \"flew\" across the seats. I did hurt my knee, but didn't dare speak up, as the driver had at that point stopped the van and was yelling out the door at other people. Not sure exactly what had happend, but it was all very loud and heated. Finally we reached our destination, where he waited for us to retrieve our bags and then sped away to continue his race. Once at the hotel, we had to buzz to get into the building, and then up 2 flights of stairs to the reception. Yes there was a small, very old lift, but there were 3 of us and 3 sets of bags, so we opted to climb. The receptionist was lovely! She told us they had noticed that it was my husbands birthday the next day, so they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a superior room.

There is no breakfast, but two or three places close by, so not really a problem. The rooms were very clean and reasonably spacious. The shower was the smallest we encountered in our three weeks in Italy--don't drop the soap! Good value as far as Rome prices go and the desk people were always friendly and eager to help--looked up bus routings for us on their computer, recommended restaurants, made reservations at the Vatican Museums and Gardens. Overall, a good experience and good value.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cYuck-ola!\u201d", "Author": "indigo1925", "ReviewID": "UR3756676", "Content": "We arrived here and were greeted by a surley reciption who charged us over the price we thought we would have to pay. We were to stay at BBSusy where we had spent the first 3 nights of our trip (went to Umbria for the second half) but they over booked and stuck us here! The room we had was three floors down from the recption. The elevator was out of service. The room we had was tiny (which is normal) but was VERY dirty, shabby, and worn. The bathroom was scary, very tiny, very mouldy, and the shower backed up and ran all over the floor. When we pointed out big water stains all over the carpet (I'm allergic to mould) the reception guy blew us off and said that all other rooms were booked and we could not swap. Maybe that was the case, but at least admit that there was water all over the floor! The reciption that we were told was 24 hours was closed when we got up very early in the am. There was a power outage all over the country. Thank goodness we didn't allow them to keep our passports like they wanted to. I mean if they are 24 hours, why have the door locked to the reciption with out any lights or buzzer??? They also had to be reminded three times to call a cab for us for our early moring departure. All in all, good location (but a very busy loud street), but lousey service, dirty nasty rooms. I would avoid this place at all costs.", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cReservation Doesn't Guarantee Room!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3545403", "Content": "My boyfriend and I reserved a room for three nights at Hotel Florida for the end of May 2005. I reserved the room by phone and the hotel even sent me an email with our correct arrival date. After a long day of travel, we arrived at the hotel only to be told they expected us the night before and had given away our room. After showing the desk clerk the email, he said they made a mistake but there was nothing they could do. Their rooms were now fully booked!! He did however find us another room at a nearby hotel, though our first night there was spent without air-conditioning and it was very hot. So don't be sure you'll have a room at Hotel Florida, even if you have a credit card confirmed reservation and a correct email confirmation.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely Little Hotel - Lovely Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3270947", "Content": "We stayed here in March 2004 on the advice of our neighbour who knows Rome well.
