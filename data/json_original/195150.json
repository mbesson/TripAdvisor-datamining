I booked a room for 3 adults at the Bayswater Inn Hotel London. I got there to find that they had reserved me a a twin-room booking for 3 people (the room was nowhere near the advertised standard also). According to the hotel this violates health and safety law and they couldn't simply put an extra bed in the room. We had to pay for a triple room. Significantly more than the initial booking I paid for, for three adults. I could have got a better price on a triple through Trivago and laterooms (and many other sites) for many other hotels around the same distance from central London. Beware making a booking with them; if they're the cheapest, there's probably something wrong. The staff had a terrible attitude towards us when they realised their own mistake. They tried to blame the website, but they clearly didn't check the booking details before confirming it! Hence it is their fault. I still had to pay else they threatened to throw us out with no refund. The manager was very rude to me about the whole mix-up. She raised her voice at me and was extremely condescending; she made it very clear the customer is not always right and I can leave without getting my money back if I didn't like her rules. Ludicrous. Will never risk going with them again myself; If you really think the price is great, call them before committing to pay for the non-refundable deals. The room itself was very no-frills. It was noisy through the night; we could hear people above, below and around us. The mattresses are awful; I work in a prison and they're the same ones! The television is awful. Only 5 channels and the signal was so bad we could only watch BBC1 at best. The bathroom was shabby; mold growing on the sealant around the bath and sink and floor. The breakfast was a shambles. They ran out of food, cutlery and milk. The food that was there was stone cold. I was in a long queue of other customers in the same position, just wanting to get out of there with a full stomach and explore London. In the end I had cold egg on half-toasted bread, eaten with a knife and spoon!

As soon as we reached the bottom of the stairs we could smell and dirty smell that was really unpleasant. Then we got up to our room (218) on the second floor and could not get the key to open the door. No matter how much we twisted and turned it we could not get it to open, so we had to get a member of staff to help us. Once inside, the room was not up to our expectations. There were 4 girls in my group and the room consisted of 3 single beds and one camp bed where the springs had broken and the matress was torn. There was even blood and stains all over my quilt cover so obviously it had not been washed in a few years!! Then we noticed that there were paper bath mats that were competely useless and only polistirine cups to have tea/coffee etc! The room was a long, but thin rectangular shape so we had no room to move - if two of us were walking past eachother in the space one would have to stop to let the other past - it was that bad. Even the electrical plugs were awful, one of the girls in my room tried to turn her straighters on and the plug made them blow up! The hairdryer was also pathetic, if at all you are staying here, bring one of your own. In our room the fan in the bathroom was broken. We were 4 teenage girls staying in a room, we all had to shower every morning and the bathroom was all steamed up, it felt like it was around 90 degrees when it was the last persons turn to go in. At night, we ended up pushing two of the single beds together, whilst putting the camp bed matress on top in the middle and 3 of s slept in these 2 single beds - not acceptable!! I would have to say that the worst part of the hotel service was the breakfast, it was absolutely awful. The hotel advertises that it is a \"Continental Breakfast\" but I can assure you for a fact that it is far from it. All we got served was a bread roll with butter and jam. That was it. We noticed that some guests were eating bacon, eggs, toast, cereal, sausages etc, but then we found out that they had to pay for them (\u00c2\u00a32 for 3 sausages!) What a rip off!! We ended up just going hungry until we got something decent to eat at lunch time. I think the only good thing about this hotel is that there was a MacDonalds and a Tesco Express shop at the end of the road so this is the place to go if you want to have something to eat.

The hotel is appalling and it is apparent the owners have done nothing to modernise or renew in years. I can forgive the polystyrene cups, but to still use the paper bath mats is a joke. Once wet, they slip all over the floor, risking guests safety. We asked for an extra towel and used that as a bath mat. Other reviews have mentioned the unfriendly reception staff.

It sounds like a horrible place for the reviews! I had never traveled abroad before but my friends who had warned me that European hotels were not quite as plush as I might be used to. With this advice, my partner and I got just what we expected from Bayswater. The front desk clerks were always friendly to us- with the exception of the final morning where an older man behind the desk was somewhat rude to a traveler checking in. The room was very small, the sheets not at all plush or fancy, the bed is kind of like a camp bed. No extras, shampoo, etc. I wouldn't have made the tea that was in the room, but I never felt super creeped out or anything. It basically had everything we needed. We weren't there to hang out in the room anyway. There was no discernable heat or cooling in the room, but we had great weather so it didn't matter. I may not book here in the summer. The breakfast that is included is useless. We had it one morning and it was basically a roll with butter. For the rest of the trip we just went elsewhere or skipped breakfast in favor of the delicious sandwiches London has everywhere! There were a lot of young people, but my partner and I are both teachers and didn't mind that. We didn't have any trouble with them. All said, it is a budget hotel. Don't expect to be pampered, but I didn't think it was terrible or dirty or loud or any of that.

I also noticed there was only one pillow per person and no extra blankets ( which are usually found stored in the wardrobes.) The room was fairly clean but the paint job done by whoever decorated the hotel was awful\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. An example would be in the hallways and stairs ,the plug sockets had been painted around with what looked like the neatness of a yard broom.

This was a vacation trip and my girlfriends first time in London. The hotel is on a square situated around 5 minutes walk from Bayswater tube. Upon arrival we were greeted by a receptionist who rather oddly asked my friend was looking for a job!. The room was a double that had a rather hard bed and also a single bed. The bathroom was dimly lit with a shower that was in the roof of the bathroom so could not be moved around. The towels were changed each day and the bath mat was paper so if sharing it can get a little wet on the floor, but above all was cleaner than most I have stayed in. The room had a TV but not cable so only the standard 5 channels. The room had a kettle, with coffee, tea and sugar but my advice is when you get there head to the store and get some decent instant coffee and tbags! The hotels were horrible. The room was cleaned on a daily basis to a good standard. My only complaint about the room was the bins were not emptied daily. The hotel is not a quiet one and the majority of guests were between 21 and 30 and could be heard when coming back from a night in. But the loudest of all were the cleaning staff who seemed to argue constantly. Breakfast is your standard rolls, cereal, juice and coffee and if you get up around 8am then fine, otherwise there are plenty of local cafes serving far better food. In summary the hotel is a place to get your head down and sleep, not to stay too long in. But certainly better than many I have stayed in. If anything the staff's noise level lets it down.

My experience wasn't as bad as the other reviews I've read. I stayed in Room 19 with family so we had 3 single beds. Our window looked out to a wall. If I was told I was staying at a Hostel, I wouldn't have been disappointed. However, I was told this was a 3 star hotel, so I EXPECT 3 star hotel amenities. I have no idea how a hotel like the Bayswater Inn can be classified as a 3 star hotel because I've stayed in many 3 star hotels in my lifetime, and Bayswater Inn is THE WORST 3 STAR hotel I've ever stayed in. To review this hotel as a HOSTEL, I had no issues. This HOSTEL is everything I would've expected. To review this hotel as a 3 star Hotel, I have many issues. First of all, what the heck was on the beds? Some kind of plastic cover? The TV remote barely worked. The bath mat was a piece of paper with foot prints on it. There were no hand towels, just regular bath towels. The room was so small with the 3 suitcases we barely had enough room to walk around without pretending we're in an obstacle course. On top of that, there was no AC. Luckily it was cold the 3 nights we were there so AC wasn't required. As for the breakfast, I thought you at least get free eggs in a contintental breakfast. This is the only continental breakfast I've ever had where all they served were Buns, Orange Juice, Water, Jam and Butter. Everything else you had to pay for. Seriously, who did they pay off to get a 3 star rating, the nicest part of the whole complex was the freaken Lobby, the rest of the hotel was a dump. There is no way this is a 3 star hotel, NOT EVEN CLOSE. I stayed in a 3 star hotel just a week before in Dubai that after staying in Bayswater, the 3 star hotel in Dubai felt like a 5 star hotel. Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT stay in this hotel if you expect 3 star service/amenites because you will be thoroughly disappointed and feel ripped off.

The room was very small and very hot. You could hardly move yourself in there. On top of the mattress there was some kind of plastic cover. That made it rustle and in the morning you woke up totally sweaty. The bath mat was a small piece of paper to no avail. There were no handtowels, only bodytowels. One day when we had become clean towels, there were brown stains on one of them! Disgusting! If they couldn't remove the stains in the laundry, why give them to the guests? There was also a very disturbing buzzing sound from the walls. It seemed as it occurred everytime someone had been to the bathroom, and it lasted around 10-15 minutes.

It was a big joke! We never were satisfied enough so we had to buy something extra to eat in a store nearby. However, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the hotel is situated in a very nice area. Still we wouldn't recommend this hotel. It's a very low standard for being a 3 star hotel.

There are two internet terminals in the lounge (1 pound for twenty minutes). It's a smoke-free hotel, so smokers have to go outside. I used the ashtray that is mounted to the gate, but a lot of guests didn't. cig butts were cleaned off the pavement on a daily basis.

I am not usually one to write poor reviews however I can definately make an exception as i would like to warn people for their benefit. When looking for a hotel in London I thought this was the best option for me personaly as the price was low (\u00c2\u00a320.00 a night) and the reviews where adverage, however when arriving at the hotel the staff where unhelpful. But this wasnt the start of our problems. I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend and a cople of friends, as the stay was only for one night i didnt make too much of a fuss, however if i would have been there any longer this wouldnt have been the case. When booking we where told that my boyfriend and I would have a double and this wasnt the case as we where given 2 singles. After asking politely for this to be amended there was a long wait for the room to be changed. Another reason I was unsure of our room was due to the unlockable door as this made me feel unsafe. Once the room was changed I was quite happy as the room was a double and there didnt seem to be any problems (Boy was I wrong). After unpacking our bags we left the hotel for the evening. When returning to our room we where overwelmed with the worst smell you can possibly imagine, this had obviously been covered before we entered our room previously as when first arriving there was a fresh smell of air freshner. The smell was so intense I gagged and nearly vomited (I appologise for being so graffic but i need to warn you of the conditions). After explaining this to the receptionist I was given can of air freshner (barely enough for one spray of the room) and told to use this and open the window. This shocked me as the smell was clearly there to stay. Trying to make do with the smell wasnt the last our problems. The bed covers where dirty and clearly hadnt been changed. As by this point we were tired so to get some rest we slept on top of the covers as there was no way i would have subjected myself to sleeping under the covers. I stayed in the clothes i was wearing as i was concerned about the cleanlyness of the beds, however my legs wernt covered as i was wearing shorts. I was woken up at 1am to the sound of someone trying to open our bedroom door, this was alarming to think that people would try to enter your room when your sleeping. At 7am the door was opened using a key and closed again , however this could have been someone leaving as I only woke up as the door was closing. It was hard enough trying to sleep after the first time the door was trying to be opened but at this point i couldnt stay any longer. I and my boyfriend left as soon as we could, not staying for the breakfast of a bread roll and orange juce as by this point there wouldnt have been anything to keep us there. Also after leaving the hotel I noticed an awful rash had apeared on my legs overnight and was increadibly ichy and sore. This worried me as it had appeared whislt staying at Bayswater Inn hotel. Even now a couple of days after staying there the rash is still on my legs and is still causing me discomfort.

I was quite fooled by the outside of the Bayswater Inn, I really did judge the book by it's cover, I assumed it was going to be a nice, cozy hotel, even the lobby was quite nice. Than we got the key to room 24 (que the horror music). I stood for about 20 mintues waiting for the elevator to decide to come pick me up. After boarding the elevator, at my stop it made screeching noises, as if it were about to break down, luckily it did not. The rooms weren't organized in order and it seemed as though, I'd stepped into a maze. A big pink maze. After a little help from some friends we found our room was closed off to the side in a little area. After leaving the hallway (which smelled disgusting), we arrived in what I thought was going to be my favourite place at night, than we saw the blood on the sheets, the mold on the floor and the window. My ideas were changed immediately. After complaining about the sheets, we were told it's ink. Which in 16 years ink has never quite been that colour. We were left with just one towel for three girls and a faucet named TRICKS. Our facuet just barely worked it spun in circles and rarely gave out the warm or cold water I was looking for. Than we thought why not have a nice warm shower? I found my water to be scolding hot, and the bath wouldn't drain, I was having a shower with water up to my knees. And after the shower being used by three girls the PAPER mat was soaked RIGHT through, the sink was otherflowing, the bath was overflowing and the floor was soaked from the leak in the pipes.

Our trip was organized through EF Tours an acredited and very pleasing touring company. This trip was honestly the best experience that I've ever had as a 16 year-old. England certainly is a beautiful country. Although there are always reminders that perfection cannot exist, that's why swans have black spots under thier wings. For me the black spot was The Bayswater Inn. In order for my review to be understood one must believe that i hold no predujice and that my complaints are not results of high-matienence. If you are accustomed to blood on your sheets and tap fossets that do 360's then by all means enjoy your stay in the farthest thing form the lap of luxury. I'll start with the entry to the hotel where the elevator has it's own agenda and may make one wait up to 5 minutes for it to kick into gear. Some of the levels of this hotel had wood borded upon where glass should be in the elevator. Down to the basement i went with two other girls, and others from my group were scattereed throughout all floors of the hotel depite a request to be together. The basement was a maze of pink and when i found our room i turned the key to find our humble home. Yes, this time the key worked but other times the key wasn't even neccessary: jiggle the handle the right way and it was a waste to even need a key for room 24. The deadbolt was all that held my hope.The television did not work, the radio did not work, only 75% of the lights worked. And the ones that did took 3 minutes of flickering to settle into a constent glow. One of my teachers rooms had zero electricity, apparently a fuse box had to be played with in order to gain light in her room. There was blood on our blanket. Blood. Is that really easy to be overlooked? I say no. And when we brought it to the reception they claimed it wasn't blood. But as a 16 year old female i'm well aware what blood on blankets looks like. Even if it wasn't blood why were we getting stained blankets? And why were we never brought a new blanket? After 3 phone calls and a visit to the front desk? One teacher had two beds in there room and gave us the blankets off of it. One was used to give padding between the springs protruding from the mattress. The next day: the bloody blanket was back. Although sheets were not changed and a stain of chocolate became our constent companion throughout the week. The most interesting affair seemed to be when a man watched a girl in another room change through the window, until there was a man at our window. The window that didn't lock. At 3am our teachers were all up and showing teh receptionist how easy it was to get into our window from the outside. The receptionist gave my teacher a mop bucket full of rubber bands, plaster and scotch tape with a few scattered screw drivers and screws in the mess. He told my teacher he could fix it if it really bothered him. And so he did. Our teachers weren't sure of what action should be taken, should police be called? The receptionist thought not, so they weren't. But when our tour guide, who had a room at this lovely hotel but didn't saty there for obvious reasons, became aware he called the police the morning after. The next day he requested mateniance to be done on all our rooms; checking the locks on windows and such. It wasn't done. But we did find that the maids had gone through our stuff and found some of the extra towles we had hid in our suitcases. They weren't the most amiable when being asked for towels. 1 towel per person, but some of us girls liked one for our hair. Our teacher and a student stealthly borrowed some extras and the maid had found them when we had put them in our bags for the day. Our bathroom was the biggest of all the ones we saw there. European bathrooms are naturally small and i am aware of that. But the tap wasn't attachted to the sink: it did 360's, the toilet was as stubborn as the lights, and the bath tub had a draining issue. Light bulbs fell untouched from their sockets and water ran from the walls to add to the mold plastered along the floors. The lack of safety, cleanliness and the rudeness exhibited by the staff of this establishment show the standard of this hotel.

We were allocated a room on the 4th floor, the door key was very difficult to manouver and it took several minutes to open the door, as we entered we sunk into the floor as it was uneven, the bathroom was dirty very dated looked like the taps, plug hole had never been cleaned since installing. the floor tiles were grubby & the grouting was black with grime. bars on the windows which made the room even smaller than it was.The furnishings were very dated & broken nothing matched curtains were green bedding orange & red, the throw smelt stale & the cost per night \u00c2\u00a3 100. We were given polestyrene cups & plastic spoons. to drink from.

The basement is a maze, and could easily be confusing to anyone. The hotel is in nice surroundings, and first impressions of reception are great, however the corridors and rooms are in dire need or refurbishment. The bathroom was very basic, and had a very strange layout, for example the toilet roll holder being at the opposite end of the room to the toilet itself. The shower was very dangerous as it was slippery, when leaving the shower. The rooms seemed very claustraphobic, and lighting was only at one end of the room. Also, windows were very difficult to open, and there were two large, bulky iron radiators with sharp corners, my friend managed to hit his leg on it while opening the window and was left cut and bruised. These could especially be dangerous for small childern. There was small warning sign, however it was very difficult to read and was at ankle height. All in all, this hotel is not worthy of its three star status as i have been in numerous three star hotels which have much better locations, facilities and services (especially breakfast!)

We arrived at 4 a.m. (6 a.m. my own time!) so I am sure any room having a bed or a large flat surface to sleep on would have looked lovely. However, I was genuinely pleased with our twin room - in my opinion, the twin rooms are LARGE! It was also very pleasant that the windows faced the little garden in Princes Square and we could hear birds singing in the night. There was central heating that worked, too, except we turned it off for the whole time and kept a window or two open, as we are used to a colder climate. The shower was a bit tricky at first before I got how it worked. (When you turned the tap thing, you were changing the water pressure AND the temperature at the same time, so colder water = less water pressure, hot water = higher water pressure!)! I learned to turn the shower on from BEHIND the shower curtain and fix the temperature, only then did I step in! Must say, the water pressure was the best I\u00c2\u00b4ve ever experienced in Great Britain! Also there was no brist of hot water! Ok so there was only one towel each, and if you did not leave it on the floor, it was not changed. Yes and the paper \"bath mat\" was kind of funny as it did not absorb water - I know, I spilled some while on shower! I would have preferred a pump bottle of soap to the small bar soaps. Yes, they were 2 unpacked small bar soaps, and they were not changed the whole time. Oh and I noticed some really small insects in the bathroom. Very very small and thin, reddish I think. Like miniature, thin ants. But, they did ot bother us and we did not bother them. And, to tell the truth, I think complaining at the fron desk would not have helped. Just a couple of them I THINK, not like it was infested. The cleaners came in at 1 p.m. every day, it was nice to come back to a made-up room. The linens were not changed after our arrival, but we only stayed for 5 nights. Usually when I have stayed in hotels for a week, they have changed them in the middle of my stay once. The beds were large but weird - we were sleeping on the bed springs! In my country, beds consist of 2 or 3 mattresses, the top one(s) are there for the very purpose of insulating yourself from the springs. One thing I did not like was the floor to wall carpeting, which I find unhygienic as it can hide anything, and is certainly not washed as often as other floor materials (hopefully) would be. Also, the usual problems with staff in the breakfast room that spoke worse English than I did. BTW have a look at the \"Deals\" as there is a good permanent one for 4 nights incl. English Breakfast AND a visit for London Eye or Madam Tussaud\u00c2\u00b4s. We used that one, but did not want the tickets. At the time I made my reservations, it made financial sense = saving me money to take the deal and one extra night. A couple of days before we went, I noticed they had GREAT deals, just 39 \u00c2\u00a3 per night for a double or twin room! Incredible! We payed 76.5 \u00c2\u00a3 per night per room, incl. English breakfast. The staff seemed tired / fed-up / depressed / who knows what. The attitude seemed to be \"We won\u00c2\u00b4t seeing you again anyway so who cares?\". You know, sighing on your face etc, making us feel we were bothering them when we wanted our key etc. One was outright RUDE on Christmas day, but I did not complain, because 1) I am a big wussy 2) I doubt it would have helped. The most important thing for us was the closeness of the tube stations. (Hubby cannot walk very long, sadly.) Also Queensway has lots of stores and Whiteley\u00c2\u00b4s shopping centre nearby so you can buy groceries and snacks to your room. Also the wonderful Nandos restaurant is close! Queensway is very lively and feels very safe, bustling with tourists. BTW I stayed in this hotel back in the 90\u00c2\u00b4s and boy was it great then. I am not quite sure it still deserves the 3 stars it did, 2+ or 3- maybe? I think we got what we paid for.

Neither night did I manage more than 4 hours sleep (total, not continuous). The shower in the morning was great until I saw the size of the towel that was suppose to dry me! (hand towel springs to mind-spare a thought for my rugby player built South African boyfriend) On our second morning we did venture down for breakfast, I have experienced better in a \u00c2\u00a320 a night, scummy hotel by a train station! Continental breakfast-look it up! Traditionally consists of bread, pastries (croissants and danish) coffee, milk and juice. Hard bread rolls and white toast (no choice) didn't quite live up to it. Service was also appalling-not one member of staff smiled or said good morning, despite the fact we did both. A SMILE COST NOTHING! Anyway, to sum up this rant up, the hotel will be getting a complaint letter as will the site we booked it through.

The staff barely speaks English and no one is willing to answer your questions, and if we asked for something we would get a look and an attitude that we were needlessly occupying their time. The staff in the breakfast room was especially rude. The cleaning ladies WALKED INTO our room without knocking first while we were still in there changing/showering/getting ready, and one day we were still asleep and had to wake up to find strangers IN THE ROOM. This happened 2 of the 3 days we were there, and it also happened to our friends staying there.

Pubs, restaurants, supermarkets, a shopping centre, cinemas, the park and two underground stations are all within walking distance. You can also stroll through the park to the museums (Victoria & Albert, Science etc.) and end up within walking distance of Harrods. If you are into walking you could even walk through the park to Oxford Street. The Bayswater Inn was my third choice, a hotel I had stayed at before was being renovated, another didn`t take groups. After reading some of the rewievs I was a bit apprehensive but the only really negative experience we had was with the front desk. A woman who called herself the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful when two of my students asked to change their room because they had not been able to sleep all night because of a group of Spanish teenagers partying next door. Other members of staff were friendly but seemed disorganised, e. g. they couldn`t find our reservations even though we had already filled in all the forms in the morning. As other reviewers have pointed out you have to leave your luggage in the luggage room which can be accessed by anyone. On arrival the \"friendly supervisor\" even suggested leaving it in the hotel lobby! My room was a single on the first floor which had the size of a shoe box and faced a brick wall. Even though it was right next to the elevator it was quiet - the bed was a nightmare though. If I went to the hotel again I would book myself a twin at the same price as the single. None of us stayed in the basement but I had the chance to look at one of the rooms and can only underline what previous reviewers have said, it is like living in a hole. Breakfast was rolls and jam which was basically what I had expected - it is London after all. At least it was buffet style. I had stayed at a London hotel before where you got two pieces of toast and that was it. If you have not been to London before, as a rule you get much less than you pay for. Rooms are tiny. So if you are talking value for money (London style) I would say the hotel is ok. It is a sightseeing trip after all and the time you spend at the hotel is extremely limited. Still I would not recommend the hotel to individual travellers. There were three international groups there during our stay. A choir from Norway, a group a Spanish teenagers and us. Surprisingly they did not put me on the same floor as my students which I suppose also happened with the Spanish group thus the excessive noise at night (see above).

We were there for 4 nights & just got back. I am the type of traveler who has no problem staying in a 1 or 2 star hotel or even a hostel when I vacation in Europe. All I need is a safe neighborhood, a clean bed & I'm happy. This hotel was in a safe neighborhood that offered plenty of food choices & was close to public transportation.

Positives - The reception staff were pleasant to deal with. The room had the basic necessaries - heat, hot water in the shower, hair dryer, hot water maker for soup & tea, & a TV for those who need that item. They did offer a free breakfast but choices were very limited (3 types of rolls, butter & jam, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, & watered down orange juice/drink). Negatives - This establishment is old & in need of some basic TLC. It has definitely seen better days - The halls & rooms had an odor. Our beds were extremely uncomfortable - we could feel the individual springs poking through. The bathroom was very small - that was OK but I would like to have had a toilet that actually worked. It wouldn't flush unless you took the top off the tank and manually held down the bulb while flushing. I told the front desk but they never responded to my request to have it fixed. (I guess it's just easier & cheaper to pretend you will have a repairman fix it but then not follow through.) The shower stall was so small that when you went to turn around to rinse off your back you couldn't do so without bumping the on-off handle & turning off the water (we're not large people either). There was mold in the shower stall. I couldn't tell if the towels laid out for our last day were stained or possibly dirty. They needed to be replaced.

They had a bed/beds, TV, clocks, private bath/shower, desk and chair. There is nothing extravagant at all. So if you are like me and only use the hotel to sleep and shower, this is perfect. We get up early in the morning and usually do not make it back to the room until late at night. We arrived from the airport (at least a 15min drive) before check-in so they allowed us to store our luggage for free. Personnel were very friendly and attempted to assist us as much as possible.

The hotel is 2blocks from the subway, many fast food places like KFC, Pizza Hut, also there are plenty of ethnic eateries, and pubs around. There is a laundry mat one block away and a bus stop close by. You are walking distance from Marble Arch if you would like (maybe 25mins at a leisure pace and 3-5 minutes on the bus.) There were several money exchange services and a couple of stores; however we didn't go in them. The breakfast (which is my #1 negative) consisted of 3 different types of breads. A roll with poppy seed, a roll without poppy seed and another type of bread. They have 2 or 3 different type of jams to choose from and butter for the bread. Their beverage choices are orange drink (not juice) water and coffee. THAT IS ALL. When we saw what they had to offer we ordered from the restaurant menu, however that also was poor. We did not participate in breakfast anymore. When on vacation I tend to sway to establishments with a good breakfast. This was not even what I would consider continental breakfast. The second negative, well not really a negative, but unexpected, and not only at this hotel, but every hotel that we stayed in while visiting Europe, no one gives you wash rags. You get a towel and mild soap. So bring your rags! If you asked me would I stay here again, my answer would be yes. I overall enjoyed my stay here .

The beds were extremely uncomfortable and people resulted in sleeping on the floor, as this was cleaner and more comfy. The shower and toilet did not work which is very unhygienic!

When trying to explain to the staff that they had made a mistake, in broken English they firstly shouted at me, then one of our teachers, then another pupil and finally me again! The staff were extremely rude and should be sacked. On the second night at about 12:30 there were 2 drunken men shouting and vomiting everywhere, which was not dealt with. One of our group needed a camp bed and so we went down to reception and explained the situation and asked for help. This resulted in once again being shouted at and told that we could have no bed, pillows or quilt! 'Breakfast' was a joke!

I will start off with listing the \"cons\"to this l, but believe me, the \"pro's\" far outnumber them! Firstly, the staff all seem very friendly, but there is a distinct communication barrier. I would suggest, if you have the inniative to figure things out for yourself, don't even bother talking to them. I believe we only came across one lady at the reception desk who spoke passable English and she seemed to be under tremendous pressure. Secondly, our plane got in from Sydney at 5:50am, we arrived at the hotel at around 8am - only to betold check-in wasn't until 3pm. We'd been on our flight for 23 hours and we weren't up to sightseeing. There was no negotiation with regards to early check-in, so we had no alternative than to leave our luggage at the hotel and find things to do. Thirdly, the only bad thing about our room was the bed. Definately NOT a double bed. More like a king SINGLE. And the matress needed replacing at least a year ago. That's it for the bad. Now on to the good! This hotels location is phenominal! It is only a 5 mnute walk to Bayswater tube station, which is on the Circle line (a major line). If you walk 10 more minutes in the opposite direction, you'll get to Nottinghill Gate Tube Station. This one's on the Circle, Distric & Central line. You couldn't ask for a better location. Yes... the room was small, but considering we only really used it to sleep in, it didn't bother us at all. The bathroom looked brand new, and the towels and sheets where changed daily. The room also came with a hairdryer and coffee and tea facilities. The very best thing about the room was that it was WARM. We would walk around in t-shirts and shorts most of the time. The towel rack was heated, which was perfect for hanging went underwear from after washing them. You hand your key into reception when leaving the hotel. While some may not like this, we found it very convenient, as there was no fear of losing the key. The breakfast is bread rolls, with tea, coffee, orange juice and hot chocolate.

The bayswater Inn is in a rather quaint district of London in a semi middle -eastern disctric. with many shopes and restaurants to choose from one is never bored in the evenings. With a short hop skip and jump one is able to see Kensington Gardens and the palace. Being there for the week I did have the luck of seeing Prince Charles and Camilla get into their Royal Helicopter in the morning whilst alking in the park ajacent to the back area of Kensington palace. The rooms are rather nice for what one pays for at the Bayswater Inn. The staff are rather graciouse and kurt depending on who you are dealing with at differnent points of day.

One is able to see how lucky and privliged it is to stay in one of the most charming districts in all of London. Breakfst is nothing to exciting. It mostly consisted of buns with an asortment of butter and jams with orangejuice. If one is willing to go the extra mile and pay some 9 GBP, one is able to have a full english breakfast. The wait staff in the restaurant are polite enough but enlgish can be some what of a barieir. If you can try and dela with a charming young girl named Inga from Lithuania. She is rather polite and willing to help you in any means to make your stay at the bayswater better. All in all, I guess one can say that \"you do get what you pay for.\" If one is expecting more then what I have said in the above then maybe it would be wise to go to the Savoy or the Rotz, but if one is interested in the true life and atmosphere of real people who live and breath London everday.

The location is also convenient to Paddington Station (about 15-20 minutes walk) and Hyde Park / Kensington Gardens (5-10 minutes walk) When we arrived in the morning we found the lobby and staff to be pleasant enough with good security, but beyond that is where the trouble starts. For starters the luggage room was filthy, Wood chips all over the floor from the cracked and broken racks. It was obvious that it has not been cleaned in a very long time if ever. After a day on the town we returned and were given two rooms in the basement. The first was a small single. The entire room was about six feet wide by ten feet long and the temperature was about 90 degrees F. The knob on the radiator was broken so it could not be adjusted. The other room was supposed to be a double and it was fairly large with two single beds and a double bed, however the condition of the room was atrocious. The stench of old smoke permeated the room and there was graffiti on some of the walls. The double bed was pushed up against one wall that was covered with scuffs and dirt as if someone had walked on it. The carpet had numerous stains on it and appeared heavily worn. The bed linens were old and worn looking with holes in the bedspreads and there was some kind of stain on one of the sheets that appeared to have chunks of something stuck to it. The bath had cracked and broken tiles on the floor. We returned immediately to the front desk and after considerable debate with the night manager I escorted her to the rooms and pointed out all of the aforementioned flaws. It was only after this and more persistent badgering that she finally agreed to move us. The other rooms were better, but not much. They gave us a double on the second floor and another different single in the basement. The single was no bigger than the first one but had a much better temperature. The only real flaw here other than the size was that the shower head could not be adjusted and in order to get wet, one had to get very close to the shower controls which were positioned such that a slight bump would send the water temperature plummeting or soaring to the point of scalding. There were also guests in the next room who were drunk and very loud when they came in at 4:30AM. The noise continued until 7 AM when I left the room for the day. I advised the desk clerk who seemed indifferent to the problem. The double room on the second floor was much better if smaller than the one in the basement and other than the fact that everything looked old and worn there were no problems. There are two elevators in the building but one of them was broken for most of our three night stay making the walk to our rooms twice as far a it needed to be.

When they changed my rooms it wasn't any better, but it was on the ground floor, and SOO cold in the room, there was no door on the bathroom either, probably because it wasn't big enough. I finally apologized for my nuisance and offered to pay for a larger room, that I just could not do one more night without sleep. So they then put me on the 3rd floor in a double room facing the front which was much more comfortable, I've learned my lesson!!", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newtown, CT", "Title": "\u201chorrible hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3478468", "Content": "This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.

The room was small, but on the 4th Floor, so, far from the street noise, and ....close to the noise of the elevator. We could also follow all conversations of the people in the room next to us. But hey, the color TV worked well, and with the BBC or ITV (that's it) it was not to difficult to concentrate on something else. The first morning we wanted to have a shower... Surprise: there was no hot water. At the reception they explained us that there was a problem with the boilers and that 50% of the hotel was without hot water. Ok, can happen. But on the second morning: no hot water. And so on... Until the last morning. Luckily, some afternoons there'd been warm water. However, we filled out a complaint on a blank invoice given by a rude lady claiming she was \"the Manager today\". Last but not least, on the 5th day we discovered that our towels were never changed... and we had to go to reception to get a pair of fresh ones.

No bugs running around or mould on the wall The only problem was that the bed badly needed a new mattress, as it was impossible to sleep on, so we slept on top of the sheets etc, and as it was so warm in the room this was not a problem. Woke in the morning, had a tepid shower and discovered I was covered in bites of some description!!. We went to breakfast really out of curiosity, to see if the previous reviews were right, and regrettably they were. However the hotel is well located, and has a busy friendly neighbourhood.

My family (mom, aunt, and cousins, we were a group of 5 women) and I arrived after a very long overnight flight from the US at 6:30 am. We were told that our rooms (they don't have rooms to accomodate 5 people so we had two rooms) would not be ready until 3pm, my mom complained and then they said maybe by 1pm. So, we were left to wander the streets of London having had no sleep. We were told to leave our luggage in a room that resembled a chicken coop, this was a room that all of the guests had access to and therefore did not seem like a very safe place to leave any thing of value. We put our bags towards the back because it was relatively empty, but by the time we got back, the room was so full that we had to pull out a lot of other luggage just to get to our own! We got in our room at 1:30, the rest of the family did not get in until later. We were surprised by a number of things in the room... the bad: very, very small (granted, being from the US I am used to very spacious accomodations), very hot and stuffy (no ac), very hard bed, no washcloths (we had to buy our own); the good: extremely clean room and bathroom (with a clean tub), no bad smell, no bugs (even with the window open all of thge time) working window, nice size closet, not noisy, and an alarm clock. I was very relieved at how clean it was, after having read the reviews. The staff in the hotel were all from non-english speaking countries and were very hard to understand, we often just got blank stares when we asked things such as \"what time does the tube start running?\" The main concierge (the manager maybe) was extremely flirtatious, much to our aggravation. But he did confirm all of our tours for us, and made one mistake. You have turn in your key everytime you leave, maybe that is standard? I want comment on the breakfast as it is thoroughly covered here. This hotel had a wonderful location as it was just a short walk to the nearest underground (Bayswater Station). Others have said that it is in a bad neighborhood, but we did not have any probelms even when we were returning late at night. Someone on the street even volunteered to take a picture of the whole group so that I could get in the picture and didn't run off with my camera! All in all my stay in London was the best experience of my life and I can not wait to go back! Do not be afraid to ask people on the streets or in shops for directions, everyone is very accomodating! I would probably stay at Bayswater Inn again because it is inexpensive. However, if I had more money I would probably stay somewhere else.

The moment I walked into the Bayswater Inn I wanted to walk out. I was staying in London for 3 nights, while working, and I should have just bought a sleeping bag and slept under my office desk! I thought people in who worked in hospitality were meant to be hospitable. Check in was a nightmare, the 'reception manager' was having an argument with a potential guest and didnt even acknowledge that I was there, and the person who did check me in was extremely rude and was unhelpful when I had questions. I walked into my bedroom and could have cried, what a waste of money. The carpet was dirty, the room was dingy and cramped, the bathroom was a glorified cupboard and the window was non-existant! My three nights sleep would have been more beneficial if I stayed awake. The room was not sound proof and the constant banging of the front door and other guest noises kept me awake. The bed was hard and uncomfortable - it was like sleeping on gravel. I did not venture into the dining room after seeing the state of my bedroom - the kitchen cant be all that much better! The only good thing about my stay was walking out the front door for the last time. I will never walk back in there again - even if you paid me!

What kind of a friendly, hygienic, lovable image are we portraying to our foreign counterparts with a place like this? Ive lived in London while at university and now work in the city.
