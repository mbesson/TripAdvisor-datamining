The apartment was a little on the small side, but still better than a hotel room! Expected a separate bedroom, but it was a sliding door between the living room and bedroom/bath and this door could not be shut at any time because then mother-in-law could not have gone to bathroom during the night without feeling like she was invading our privacy. She was in the living room and complained of noise from the Trevi, we did not hear a thing. She also complained that the chairs were uncomfortable in the living room, but my husband and I were never there long enough to sit. She said the pull out sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable. Beautiful updated bathroom and best shower I had in 2 weeks in Italy! Great a/c, which seems to be rare to even have around Italy! It if had been more than one night in this apt with mother-in-law it would have been very uncomfortable, but for one night with that location it was perfecto! We only stayed the one night because we were catching an early flight, but wish we had stayed here our first 3 nights at the beginning of our trip. I am so glad I did not stay near the airport, this was really the best night ever in Rome. Because of the location we were able to walk around until 1:30 in the morning and have the Trevi practically to ourselves at times.

We found food rather expensive in Rome and not particularly good but on our last night we ate at \"Taverna Antonina\" on Via della Colonna Antonina, a shortish walk from the hotel, this was the best food we had in our four nights, but the little restaurant literally next door to the hotel is also quite good, especially if you don't want to walk too far!!!. Next door but one is the best ice cream parlour in Rome. Restraurants with pictures of the food they provide are best avoided!!!", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ojai, California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel & friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "OjaiTraveller1", "ReviewID": "UR100666114", "Content": "I traveled with my teenage daughter to Rome and stayed in the Relais Trevi; it was an awesome experience. The location was superb; we walked to all of the major attractions in Rome - Trevi Fountain (of course), Colliseum, Spanish Steps, even Vatican City (might be a bit far for some, but a very easy walk and you get to see the sights of the City). Gianluca was very helpful at the front counter and friendly upon our arrival. Don't be discouraged by the closed doors upon arrival, someone shows up quickly. One suggestion... we arrived from Termini on the metro (Barberini) in the rain, the hotel was difficult to find based on map quest directions. Just stay on Tritone until Panetteria (they intersect), don't try to follow the diagonal streets as directed on mapquest. We checked into our room, and left; upon our return a fresh flower arrangement awaited us! Very nice touch. Plenty of great restaurants just minutes away. Breakfast was great and overlooked the fountain. Oh, and the bed...it was super comfortable! Will definitely stay again!", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "worldrabbit", "ReviewID": "UR98505357", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in 'the blue room'.
