As others have mentioned, when we returned from a long day touring Rome, we grabbed a few mini prosecco bottles from the vending machine and say out on the roof deck. Breakfast was very good, with a wide variety of foods from meats, cereals, yogurt, eggs, breads, coffee, etc. It was $12 euros extra (which is a little steep) but for the convenience, it was fine.

We selected the hotel because it was an affordable island of modern hospitality in a city of antiquity. The hotel certainly lives up to it's reputation. It's in a convenient location, walkable from Tremini Station or the Republica subway, and after a long overnight flight and an early arrival in the city our room was ready for us at 9 AM. The rooms are very well equipped, yes slightly smaller than North american standards but very function in layout and materials. The large and very pleasant roof top deck certainly makes up for the smaller space in the rooms. Besides, who wants to spend too much time in them anyway when all of Roma is at your doorstep. People complain about the beds being hard but they were wonderful on our backs and we both slept longer and better than we had in a long time. The bathrooms were outstanding and everything worked like a charm, and if it didn't the staff were there to fix things immediately. The breakfast room of the fifth floor serves a great buffet that has something for everyone. Some say that you can eat cheaper outside the hotel and yes you can but for convenience and quality you cannot go wrong. If you're smart you can eat a big breakfast and then skip lunch and enjoy dinner so much more. The portion size in Italy means that you can hardly get to the dolce sometimes because you've eaten so much already. The staff in the hotel were all excellent during our staff and addressed any of our small issues quickly. The rooms are spotless and efficiently cleaned each day. If you like to sleep with the windows open you'll probably notice the street noise around 3 AM, then the deliver trucks and the garbage at 4 AM but it's all part of the city's life. Some people suggested that the neighbourhood is a bit seedy, but honestly it's not. There were always a few street people around especially at Termini, but we never really felt at ease. Lots of good restaurants are within two or three blocks of the hotel, the hotel can recommend a few but other are found by chance. One tip, avoid Strega. It's overpriced and a trap for tourists. Smaller is better. All in all, a great deal, great location and a bit of a look at what hotels will be like in the future.

Definitely a 4 star by European standards. It's location within walking distance of the train station means it is a bit of a walk to other parts of Rome (the Forum, Spanish Steps, etc.) but we are walkers and did not mind the exercise. A metro stop at the train station could be used. The hotel is right across from the Opera house and quite new. The furnishings are spare and modern and the mattress is very firm. If you like a soft mattress, you would not like this hotel. Among other good things, there is a lot of lighting and the bathroom countertop extends the length of the bathroom, so stuff is not dropping on the floor or into the sink. It looked as though the room had AC but the HVAC unit was not operable. (They probably turn it on only in warmer months, in spite of the balmy weather in Italy this March.) There is a small TV but no English channels, a fridge, safe, free wifi, and a small closet (our room was #422 and from the floor plans, it appears that other rooms have bigger closets.) There are also plenty of electrical outlets. The room was quiet but we are not sure what it would be like when the opera is in season. Other advantages: a washer and drier so we could clean our clothes (bring your own soap), vending machines which sell inexpensive wine and sodas (the corkscrew is nearby) and an ice machine, although the rooms have no ice buckets. The bath amenities are sparce, probably to keep their costs down. They provided kleenex, shampoo, bath gel and soap bars but no hand lotion or conditioner. We had to leave notes to get them to resupply the soap and shampoo. In a few years, they will need to spiff up the carpeting which already shows a bit of wear. The service at the front desk was excellent and cheerful. We did not have breakfast there so can make no comment other than it costs 10 euros/person.

The room was cleaned, replenished with fresh towels, and beds made every day which is rare in European hotels. \u00a0The roof-top was awesome. \u00a0There was a place for adults to relax and a fenced in swing and slide area which was perfect to let our twins burn off some energy after being in their stroller all day. \u00a0The location was great!

It's nice to be able to come back to a cool room and with two adults and two children the room can get pretty stuffy. There were great floor length windows that opened completely to a little balcony but our room was facing the street and it was impossible to sleep at night with all of the noise. People talking, cars/motorcycles, trash pick up, etc. \u00a0I got up four or five times a night to open and shut the windows because the noise was waking our children but the room would become unbearable with the windows closed. \u00a0Don't advertise AC if it's not available at the guests choosing. Breakfast seemed a little expensive (10\u20ac per person, per day) but there is a little grocery store around the corner where we picked up things and a pack of water. It's nice that there is a mini fridge in the room that is not a mini bar. It's empty and you can put your own things inside. I even brought back leftovers from dinner and reheated in the hotel microwave the next day. You can purchase plates and silverware at the front desk which we did one night when we brought pizza back for dinner.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Beach, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer H", "ReviewID": "UR126649655", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at IQ Hotel Roma.

The location was just to the west of the railway station, which proved to be handy for all sights, the colosseum, Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain all within a 15 minute walk. The Vatican is just within walking distance, around 45 minutes away, which is not a hardship as you see more of Rome that way. The rooms are smart, reasonably sized, though not large. The bathrooms are good, with a powerful shower and nice toiletries. The buffet breakfast was lovely, at 10 euros, with lots of choices, from various fresh meats and cheese, fruit, cereals, cooked breakfast, a toaster, juices, coffee, iced water, and a lovely selection of pastries and cakes - ideal to fill up on for a tiring day walking around Rome. There are also reasonably priced vending machines, with snacks and wine, Champagne, coffee, with a fridge in each room to store food or drink. There is a nice, spacious, rooftop terrace, with lots of chairs & sofas, available for guests to eat, drink and relax in. I'd recommend Strega, a traditional, reasonably cheap Italian restaurant, a couple of minutes walk away, where we ate twice. If seafood is your thing, then F.I.S.H. on Via Serpenti, is a ten minute walk away, with gorgeous food.

I asked to switch rooms instead and they obliged. - The heater didn't work in our room, which was bearable until housekeeping left our windows open all day. The guy at the reception desk kept telling us that we had to set the dial at 30. We kept telling him that it was set on 30 for 3 days.

Spanking Brand New Hotel, with the modern contemporary design as their theme. Nice big,clean and modern rooms. Was a surprised to find a new modern design hotel smack in the middle of Rome (ie old and ancient historical buildings) and surrounded by other hotels. Price wise, i think is slightly pricier as its a 4star hotel but if your looking for modern design i think thats the only few hotel with that price range(slightly higher than a 3star hotel) available. The breakfast was so-so only, but because places in Rome are actually further and due to the lack of time we didn't waste time walking around to find for breakfast. However, didn't like the fact that there they do not provide boiler/mini kettle in the rooms. They have this vending machine kiosk at every interval floor pantry where you can pay to buy a small plastic cup of hot water. I find the staff at the receptionist abit snobbish and wasnt really helpful. Wanted to seek their help to plan out our itinary as we have limited time. Needed help with the tourguide books because they were all in italian ( No more english version) which i can only make out the title and the price. I arrived at 9 am and was hoping to be able to start the morning tours ASAP. Anyway, manage to get it all sorted out in time and it was a great trip nevertheless.

The location of IQ is very close to the Termini Train Station which is very convenient if you are planning to travel to other cities in Italy.

It has a rooftop deck and vending machines for snacks, drinks, etc. We were too busy to do breakfast at the hotel but peeked in one day and found it to be very nice looking. Although breakfast is never included at the IQ, it was only 10 or 12 euro and for Rome prices that's not too bad. I would definitely recommend the IQ, the front desk was very helpful.

We even walked to the Vatican which takes about 40 mins but as it was 20 degrees C and sunny when we were there the walk was lovely. However, the main selling point for us was the rooftop terrace. We took other travellers advice and took our blanket up there one night to enjoy some Frascati al fresco. The vending machine is brilliant and so cheap too, perfect for before or after dinner. The only way this hotel could be improved is if there were onsite facilities for dinner but walking around the nearby streets looking for a good place to stop was part of the charm of our visit.

Each was quickly dealt with when we reported the problems and gradually all settled. The hotel was full, and we had a disabled visitor room as that was the only room left. Maybe it had been closed a while. We slept very comfortably in our clean and modern room. Safe provided. Others have mentioned the sensible facilities, be it vending machines down to small bottles of wine... the small gym/sauna.... washing facilities etc. But as people have mentioned, breakfast is the key. It's served on the top floor - roof terrace available in summer. Huge range of cereals, meats, cheeses, hot buffet, juices, fruit, coffee, lovely cakes. At \u20ac10 a person it's not a big hit to make your mind up on the day if you choose - but well well worth it. The subway is only a couple of blocks away so getting to the Vatican, Colosseum, Spanish Steps is easy. A main shopping street is just at the end of the block as well. All in all, very central, very clean, very polite, very quiet and very convenient. If you're tired on arrival like we were, try Bertizello for a cosy pizza or pasta.

We stayed in this hotel for four nights in March 2011.

We were slightly concerned at this, but the staff assured us that we would like the \"premium\" hotel that they were providing. As it turns out, the hotel was fantastic, and we had no further problems after this first night. The rooms weren't massive, but they were of an adequate size for what we needed them for. They were of a modern decor, and very clean and tidy each day. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was very modern also, and extremely clean. The location of the hotel is perfect, very to close to Via Nationale, which is a prime location for most sight seeing opportunities - 5-10 minute walk to Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. Due to being relocated for the first night (which was no inconvenience to us), we were upgraded to free breakfast each day for the remainder of our stay, which was a very nice touch. The breakfast is typical Continental breakfast buffet style, which was very nice. Perhaps one of the best features of this hotel, was the rooftop terrace. It has plenty of comfy chairs/sofas, and also has a vending machine stocked with very reasonably priced alcoholic/soft drinks and food, such as sandwiches and snacks.

Our room has a balcony that overlooks Teatro dell'Opera and a vending machine that sells basic necessity aroud the corner. On the first floor, there is a washer and dryer that cost 3 eur per cycle. If you have a big load, you might need two cycles for the dryer, which I did. I read the instructions closely, but somehow the second dry cycle didn't work as expected and I had to call the front desk, who sent up a grumpy porter who asked me \"Did you read the instructions?\" in a not so friendly tone. Umm, yeah I did, which is why the first dry cycle worked without a glitch. Anyway, he came back up again and loaded the machine and we are back in business.

You can get your drinks and walk out to the rooftop seating area if weather permits. It's a very cozy area to unwind and relax before dinner. We utilized the gym on the second floor once during our stay. It's very compact - 3 treadmills, several bike stations, weights and a stairmaster.

The shower was amazing, including the black currant soaps. We had everything we needed and loved the modern minimalistic feel, yet lots of room (surprisingly for Europe). We just can't stand old fashioned hotels and iQ was perfect for us. The wireless internet worked great, and we used their business center to print our tickets for the Vatican museums. It is also worth mentioning they have a vending machine that has a great selection of affordable wine, bubbles and beer. A wine opener is conveniently attached to the neighboring wall. The 10 euro breakfast deal was totally worth it. If you are to explore Rome every day, you need a good breakfast. The buffet included fruit, yogurt, cold meats, delicious pastries, eggs, cereal, milk, juices, espresso, etc. It is served on the top floor next to a very large and lovely terrace. We would make sure to fuel up every morning before heading out to walk our feet off. The location is pretty good too. You are a short walk from a metro stop, although if you like walking you can easily head to Rome's core on foot. There is a grocery store less than half a block away for all your needs. We rarely dined in the area though. The concierge recommended a restaurant when we arrived but sadly it was closed and we ended up eating at the Irish pub nearby (you'll be surprised how popular Irish pubs are in Rome... anyway the daily menu offered decent italian fare), but of course I would not recommend it unless you can't find anything else. The restaurants near the hotel always looked empty, with eager waiters trying to attract customers by the sidewalk: never a good sign. The historic areas offer lots of great cafes and pizzerias, so that's where we did most of our eating. The hotel is in a great location for shopping.

Pros: - Good location - Friendly staff (\"No's\" are delivered friendly too) - Clean rooms Cons: - Very uncomfortable, hard bed. - Crummy pillows. (Lousy bed and pillows make for a rough night's sleep. ) - Rooms are very small. - \"No\" to reasonable requests - Nickel-and-dime strategies - The Ground Floor Discount Ward - No value to the excessive prices. It's a clean 2-star hotel at a 4-5 star price. Overall, this is a nickel-and-dime you hotel that expects excessive rates and offers the minimum in return. They are somehow competing in a category to which they do not belong. That is all that needs to be said, but for more detail on our experiences, read on... - The Plastic Cup Strategy. Here's a real money-maker. You are given two flimsy plastic cups at the beginning of your stay. Subsequent flimsy plastic cups can be purchased from a vending machine for 50 cents each. Glasses will not be made available for guest use at any price. Try and buy a cocktail to use the glass in your room, or tip for the use of the glass, and you will be told \"No, that is not our concept. You must buy the plastic cup to use in your room from a vending machine on the nth floor.\" This is a real fit for a 250eu/nt hotel. (Don't wash two glasses for a customer paying hundreds of euros, or even let them buy use of the glasses from you, we must maintain focus on the 50 cent plastic cup margin.) Find other comments about the plastic cup obsession in other reviews. If I am making it sound endearing, then I am telling it wrong. - The Ground Floor Discount Ward. The ground floor rooms are offered at \"special rates\". If you book on-line or through brokers, they might be giving you the ground floor room, which are also disabled-access rooms. Why is that a negative? It shouldn't be. You should even have a little more space. What they are NOT disclosing is that the showers do not drain fast enough, and there is no containment, such that the bathroom floods after two minutes. So your choice is to turn on/off the water throughout your shower, or flood the bathroom and subsequently the adjacent carpet. I cannot imagine who would offer such a thing to their guests. Instead of correcting it, they still market the rooms as-is for a discount, without specifying the discount is for standing in a pool of water in the bathroom. That is not ok. What would you pay to stay in a room where you must turn on/off the water every 2 minutes while flooding the bathroom, standing in water at the sink and toilet, knowing that this is known by the management but they still want you to have it? It's a lousy thing to do to someone. Thankfully in our case, they changed our room begrudgingly--we would have checked out otherwise-- but imagine if the hotel is full, you are stuck with an intolerable situation. So I'm giving it 2-stars instead of 1-star for saying Yes on the most important item. We stayed because they changed our room (and I only have one day of photos with unwashed hair).

Of course, it's very modern, quite a change after the old-world charm of our other Italian stays, but the location and general efficiency made up for that, so we didn't mind. What impressed me was how handy the much-discussed vending machines were (a decent array of wines and other knick knacks, even a coffee dispensing machine) and a washing machine & dryer as well so we could catch up on our laundry. The rooftop is a good option if you don't want to go out to eat ...a guest told me he picked up wine from a well-stocked shop at the square, bought some pizza, and dined quite happily out here! The beds are firm yet comfortable, and the empty fridge means you can store your own wine/water without displacing any mini-bar stuff. We didn't have the breakfast (but heard it's good), preferring a tiny place across the square which served delicious hot croissants & coffee. The hotel staff are extremely helpful, giving directions, advice, calling cabs when needed. Housekeeping is efficient. There's a business centre where we printed out our flight boarding passes for a small fee. Useful.Also the free wi-fi. The whole self service concept around is very handy, and in these days especially, is just what many guests want - not to pay for unnecessary frills, yet have all the comforts. Termini, Rome's main station is a short walk, so my teenage son just walked down there to catch his train to the airport. There are also lots of very nice restaurants & pizzerias around, as well as some shopping. With the Opera house facing the hotel, I would have loved to have gone one evening, but this was between performances. Next time perhaps! Don't expect high luxury here, as everything is functional, yet modern and well-fitted out. If you're looking for value and a good location, then this is a good bet.

You've read much about iQ, mostly glowing praise, and mostly well-deserved. Instead of leading with the the worn-out yays, however, I'll get this review on the road with the minor niggles. Note that even these things couldn't take much lustre off the iQ, as long as it's booked at their \"50% off for 3+ nights\" rate. At full price, much of the appeal would be lost. The wi-fi was fairly wonky (unreliable) late a few nights (not necessarily a big deal) and it's also filtered within an inch of it's life, with plenty of non-adult sites on the no-no list. Not cool, iQ. The toiletries are fairly low-quality. Bring your own soap if possible. There is very little flat space in the bathroom to place a toothbrush, hair product, shaving stuff etc. This was more than annoying but less than maddening; two guests' worth of items might be quite maddening to juggle. The soundproofing is not so good-I could hear Blackberry chimes and coughs from the next room, and housekeeping sounds in that room were very loud. Plastic cups in the room! In a $200/night hotel? And along those same lines, no bottle opener (or corkscrew). The ceiling lighting (I swear I'm not making this up) popped and clicked as it cooled down. Turn off the ceiling lights well before bedtime if those types of noises would be bothersome (lost an hour's sleep myself)-housekeeping always turned them back on. The \"Do Not Disturb\" door hanger alone is a suggestion sometimes ignored by the staff; put your key in the lighting slot AND use the sign AND use the \"Do Not Disturb\" light (switch is by the bed) for full protection. That's about it for the negatives, so moving on... My \"small double\" was pretty small, but not cramped-two travellers might find it a little constricting. The iQ Roma is actually fairly basic, with few of the niceties that might be expected in a four star hotel (this is a government rating-USA guests might see \"three star\" as more accurate). While modern, still fairly new, and with a classic European vibe, the room is still very basic-bed, desk, closet, bathroom, TV, refrigerator. No iPod dock, clock radio, etc. Fourth floor rooms (street views) have balconies which is cool. Anyway, all the rest you've read (or will soon read) is pretty much true: Roof area with foosball, vending machines, friendly staff, hard bed, close to Termini, fitness center, laundry room, sauna, etc. There're restaurants close by, there's shopping, a fruit stand, a Post Office, and a McDonald's (traveler's tip: McDonald's is Italian for \"restroom here\"). I walked to many major tourist attractions in 20 minutes or less. Vatican City and Trastevere are further, but that's why there are subways and buses. With Termini nearby, all that's pretty easy to arrange. There's one USA voltage/plug shape outlet in the bathroom. Make sure the switch is set properly. I didn't have breakfast at the iQ, or turn on the TV so nothing to report on those fronts.

Breakfast was extra and nice, but we used a local shoppe for getting coffee and bread in the morning (right around the corner). Terrific gelato around the corner each evening was very nice, too. Walked to the Pantheon and took cabs to some other spots - Colliseum but could have walked (It was very hot for September).

From the train station we got lost finding the hotel, but that was lack of proper research, on the way back to the airport at the end of our stay its a total breeze, very easy walk of just a few mins. It was my husband and I (late 20's) and my parents (mid-60's), and it was great for all four of us. We received early check in for one of the rooms so we were able to store our luggage, refresh and hit the pavement. PROS: Clean, modern, new, free wifi, beautiful roofdeck, convenient to walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, other historic landmarks. Most of the hotel staff was very accommodating (they were great about calling us a taxi when we went to Via Veneto, Vatican City) and when I needed to print our train tickets they let me use the business center free of charge because the reception printer was down. We also found the vending machines to be super cheap/affordable and on almost all the floors ( this came in handy when we needed fresh water/sodas/etc.) AC was great too. We also did laundry one night in the self-service laundry - this was very helpful. CONS: There's not much happening with a 4 block radius. It's a convenient location to get to/from sites, but not if you want to walk outside your door and have plenty of restaurant options/shopping/cafes. The breakfast is not included - its 10E per person. It is worth it if you like pastries, continental style, especially considering that there aren't a ton of places to eat close by. (There are a few restaurants, don't get me wrong, it's just a limited selection) The rooms are super small. The bed is super firm. None of these things bothered us, but it's good to just be aware - it's not a bed that you are going to mind getting out of, lol. Overall, this was a great place for us to stay. We enjoyed our stay, and would stay here again if in Rome. I would recommend this hotel to others, especially if you want a clean, sleek, modern feel. The highlight of this hotel is the roofdeck. Every night we'd go up and share a bottle of wine (also cheap in the vending machines - and good too - who would have thought!?) before dinner. It was beautiful weather, comfortable couches and made for a great start to our evening. I have some pictures - I will try to post them soon.

The hotel is very near the train station so that was a good thing. There were 2 men at the reception desk and the one guy that was checking us in was beyond rude. When we were about done, we asked if there was a service that booked tours for us, and he said no you do it online. We were on the ground floor, one of two rooms. Our room was the only handicap room in the hotel, and the hotel failed to tell me that, they just said you have a ground floor room. The rooms feel a bit dark and depressing to me, the beds were hard and uncomfortable as well. I went to complain to the front desk that night to the same rude receptionist and he kept on saying well the ground floor is handicap, you booked the room. It did not say anything about handicap when booking the room, and he said there is nothing he can do and if we want we can change the room at an extra charge. I decided to sleep on it and decide in the morning, after taking a shower, I needed a new room. The floor was completely wet because there was no tub for the shower. Thankfully there was another girl at the reception that morning, and she was very helpful and said we can change our room without charge. So avoid groundfloor rooms. Our rate did not include breakfast, so we decided to try it one day, and ew, worst breakfast I had. Not work 10 euros at all. The location was good, was able to walk to most of sites.

Our only criticism of the property is that although they encourage you to bring food into your room, there is nothing there (no cups, glasses, bowls or cutlery) and you have to purchase or acquire these elsewhere if you want to eat or drink in your room.

The hotel is close to the city's limited Metro system (Repubblica Station) which will whisk you to either the Vatican or Herculaneum. We had 4 different standard rooms on two different floors in the hotel during our stay. All of the rooms were nicely equipped with comfortable (but firm) beds and equipment that was in good condition. We had plenty of space for two adults - including hanging and storage space. The room had a refrigerator and safe. The bathroom had a nice sized shower and good quality toiletries for our use. The hotel is equipped with vendor style machines for basic food items and drink including wine. A decent grocery store is located nearby for purchasing any additional food items. An ice machine is located on the top floor to fill your glass [tip: we brought a small collapsable ice chest to keep more in our room]. The hotel has coin washer and dryers - which automatically fed soap and softener. The laundry also had a iron and ironing board. Several rooms included an outdoor balcony space without any seating or furniture which would have been a nice addition. That said, the rooftop deck had plenty of comfortable seating in its shared space. We discovered that each floor was equipped with a small 'smoking' deck with chairs and sofa which I never found occupied during our stay [tip: good escape for your morning coffee]. The exercise room was well equipped with weights and cardio equipment. The hotel is a good walk from many of Rome's main attractions so we gave up on using the gym. We also discovered the many attractions near the hotel that were terrific - and a welcome short cut to the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps. Staff was extremely helpful in meeting all of our requests from additional pillows to securing a taxi [a feat more difficult than you might expect in a large city].

All staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay and the hotel and room and terrace area were spotlessly clean.

When we showered the floor was very wet, even with a plastic shower curtain which was not sufficient to stop the floor becoming dangerously slippy for able bodied people. Being on ground level and with a road adjacent to the room which throughout the night was noisy with people walking past and traffic noise, we did not sleep well.

The bed was a bit on the hard size but we were so tired from touring, it did not prevent us from sleeping. Even the baby cot was clean and acceptable to my standards. The breakfast was is not included, but when doing the math, it would've cost the same as staying at another hotel that we probably would not have loved as much as iQ. The hotel has wonderful vending machines where you could find anything from water to beer to wine, all at very affordable prices. Water only 0.50E and beer starting at I believe 3E. There was also a snack vending machine w/ sandwiches and other snacks. There are also microwaves and vending machines selling toiletries and other sundries you might have forgotten for your trip. There is a grocery store within a 2 minute walk so you can stock your cold minifridge with food. There is also a wonderful roof top patio and playground for the kids. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Rome. It is quite pricey but well worth every cent!", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "shanghai china", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "james0463", "ReviewID": "UR117730790", "Content": "After a princess cruise tour, we stayed Roma for another one night.

Otherwise the hotel was really, really great. We choose to stay in a small double room, yes it is really small, but the room was very cosy with a great bathroom with shower and good space. The best things and this is why if we ever visit Rome again we choose again IQ is the beautiful terrace with the vending machines and the one of the best breakfast I have ever eaten in my life. Before we visit Rome we believe that Rome is a large town having very long distances between the sightseeing but we were wrong. Rome is one of the best walking cities in Europe. I believe that is the best city for families with little children\u2019s. You can get to any sight that you want from the hotel in no more than an hour. Piazza di Spagna is just a 10 minute walk from the hotel and also Fontana di Trevi. Because I and my wife like to walk very much after our second day we see all the major sights of Rome so we were a little board. And there is where IQ Hotel terrace came and save our trip! After a long walk I Rome with the temperature been more than 36 Celsius (Middle July) the nights on the terrace was like an oasis for us. The vending machines with bottles of water and snacks, another one with beverages and one with free ice and coffee (You will find the cheapest bottle of water in all Rome, trust me just 50 cent a bottle). If you are thinking to book a room with breakfast or without, do not bother take the breakfast. I cannot get of my chair after eating one the most delicious and full of everything that you can imagine breakfast. It worth every cent you pay. I must not forget the excellent free Wi-Fi.

It is tucked away in the walking vicinity of the Termini Station where trains from FCO Airport and other cities arrive. It is quite a hike from Rome's main attractions (Trevi - 10/15 minute walk, Coliseum - 20/25 minute walk, Pantheon - 20 minute walk), but works if you are in the walking mood. Alternatively, there is public transportation available and it is pretty cheap (read the end of the review for the Roma Pass tips). The hotel is cute and very clean. The modern feel is great. Room was small but well structured, bathroom was big enough for two people. Yes, there was no iron in the room, but it does not seem that irons in rooms are common in Italy (we visited over 10 cities on our road trip and none of them had an iron). The shower stall was on the small side, but again it was a common problem among all the hotels that lacked bathtubs. Additionally, the bed was kinda hard to sleep on but I think it is a European thing. Facilities were great: there was a small gym with a sauna, a laundry room (6 Euros for one load of laundry) with an ironing board and the rooftop terrace was a fun place to hang out with some cold drinks from the vending machine on the 5th floor (3 Euro Smirnoff Ices). And stack up on water at that vending machine: it is 50 cents there, versus 2 or even 3 Euros outside. We were not big fans of the 10 EU breakfast, b/c mass-produced eggs and bacon were uneatable and the rest can be bought at an outside cafe for a fraction of the price (to be honest, none of Italy's hotels knew how to cook good eggs, I am pretty sure they just do it for the American tourists). Once we landed at FCO airport we got our Roma Passes on the way to the train station. 25 Euros each these cards were well worth the price. Roma Pass does not cover the 14 Euro per person cost of the train from the airport, so you will need to buy a separate ticket for it right next to the train (validate it before boarding). You can use Roma Pass to enter 2 sites for free and the rest of the locations give you a discounted price. Use it for Coliseum/Forum/Palantine to bypass the 2-hour line (just enter the group tour line at the Coliseum and head down to the Roma Pass turnstiles) and for the Vatican Museum (i think it is 12 Euros to enter). You can also use the Pass on all forms of public transportation and with this hotel's location it is easy to identify buses going to the Termini Station. The subway is kinda tiny, but definitely use it to get to the Vatican for free (note that the Vatican Museum with its magnificent Sistine Chapel is closed on Sundays). Also splurge 7EU for the ride up the St. Peter's Cathedral cupola for the best 360 degree bird-eye view of Rome.

The AC worked perfectly and the staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Everyone spoke perfect English and they were only too happy to give us instructions for using the bus, or to arrange transportation to the airport. The hotel offers a full breakfast for E10, and it is excellent. A full variety of American and European breakfast options is offered buffet style. Definitely worth it. The hotel is right across the road from the Opera House, a 2 minute walk to Via Nationale and less than a 5 minute walk to the Metro station at Piazza della Reppublica.

My husband found this hotel from trip advisor and booked it because of the wonderful reviews. We liked the modern look in the lobby, self serve laundry option, breakfast-although it is an additional cost of 10 euro per person, the rooftop lounge area, and vending machines with snacks and beverages. The location is fine if you want to use public transportation, right next to the metro station and a 5/10 minute walk to an On and Off Sightseeing bus. There is also a grocery store around the corner that you can buy sodas/water, and snacks to keep in the mini fridge. There was one man at the front desk who was particularly helpful with maps and two great restaurants. This is not a particularly romantic, warm, friendly, or comfortable hotel. The bed was very uncomfortable, the shower/tub is very tall and can be difficult to get out of because the ledge is so high. The tv is extremely small and for a hotel that caters to people that speak English, we were shocked by having only 2 English stations--CNN and BBC. When my husband asked for a code for the business center computers, they explained you had to pay to use them-which is very strange if you offer a business center. Also, there are no ice buckets? With vending machines that serve ice, you'd think the hotel would offer a bucket. Instead you can use a cup from your bathroom or cups to buy from the vending machine. People were using trashcans instead. If you are looking for a self serve hotel then this is the place for you.

My recommendations: Everyone should do a walking tour of the ancient sites with Dark Rome Tours - it was really interesting, we got to skip the lines to the colloseum and it was a good way to get all of the ancient sites visited in under 3 hours. Secondly I WOULD NOT recommend visiting the vatican unless you are very interested in religion/religious art. If you really must visit the vatican you should either start lining up at 7am or organise a guided tour in advance. Guided tours can be organised through the Vatican website and you can skip the lines - a tour really is the way to go as the Vatican is FULL of religious artefacts which have very little meaning unless they are explained to you. Thirdly I recommend visiting the area Trastevere in the evening. Trastevere is lovely and is full of cafe's and restaurants.

This is a great hotel in a great location. This hotel is modern, fresh and completely spotless. The hotel has a fantastic rooftop chill out area which is an absolute godsend after long days of sight-seeing and many miles walked. Such a nice place to chill out particularly if you are looking for a romantic break. The hotel has the most fantastic drinks vending machine situated at the roof garden available 24/7. it sells full sized bottles of wine for ony 6 euros. I couldn't believe it until I seen it either. It was so nice at night just to relax with a nice glass of wine in the warm Rome air. There is also a machine which sells tea/coffee and one selling crips chocolate etc all at very reaonable prices The hotel offers free wi-fi. You have to ask for it at reception and they will give you a code. Worked brilliantly on my smart phone so was great to be able to keep up with the news, e-mails etc also. The hotel also offers a great buffet breakfast for 10 euro a head per person per day if you choose. We used it twice. We thought it was great. You could probably get a comparable breakfast outside for about the same but if like us you don't want the hassle of hunting places down and wasting time then i recommend this. The hotel also offers a microwave area and an area where you can use the hotels washing machine, tumble dryer and iron should you need to do so. Our room size was more than adequate. I think it was a double room. ie large room with one king-sized bed. The rooms don't contain a mini-bar but do provide a mini-fridge to keep your own items cool. Believe me, you won't need a mini bar when the vending machines are so cheap and accessible 24/7. Our bathroom had a shower toilet and bidet. Again, the bathroom was totally spotless with fresh towels supplied daily. The shower was such a great easy to use powerful shower. It even had 2 shower heads, one fixed to the wall and one detachable for you to use whichever you found most comfortable. Staff were lovely and very friendly and made a point of saying hello and goodbye etc when you were coming and going and it felt a genuine greeting and not something forced on them by hotel policy or anything. They also fluent English for people like me who can't speak anything else unfortunately. Location of the hotel is perfect. It is about 10 mins walk from the Termini station. It is also ideal because it's just far enough away from all the really busy side lanes that you could potentially end up in and enough in form the main road. Everything is easily within walking distance. We even walked to the Vatican from there although this takes about 40-50 mins but worth doing because you see so so much more of the city. I think if you want to guarantee a great experience in Rome then this hotel is a total must as part of your holiday.

The hotel staff are very helpful and give you maps with all the attractions and show you the best walking route to take. The best thing about Rome is that even walking to a attration- there are always so many things to look at on the way. This hotel is also just around the corner from a main shopping street. Local resturants close and good value for money. Transfer from airport is easy, there is a metro a 10min walk from the hotel. The hotel was always clean, with housekeeping every morning fresh towels etc. The sauna is clean and new, so works well. The gym is small.... but who wants to use a gym on holiday anyway.. it seemed adequate with lots of gear & tv. Now the breakfast. Absolutely the best hotel breakfast I have ever had! Such a great variety of hot & cold foods. Including fresh fruit/breads/cheeses/meats/muselis and lovely juices and good coffee. I highly reccommend the breakfast, it is a extra 10 euros but it fills ya up for the day and is just really yummy! The hotels rooftop area is really cool, even tho it was winter when we were here we did go out there a few times. each floor has a outdoor smoking area, but there is never any smell of smoke in the halls.

It is modern in style however the quality was average with little comfort and few amenities. It felt more like a travel lodge type hotel with Ikea style and quality furnishings. In other words...cheap. The bathroom was nice but had a very small shower. I took a peak in the larger rooms and they are more spacious and probably worth the upgrade. Still nothing special. The standard king is very small and I am used to small rooms in Europe, however this room felt like a dorm room. The bed is as so many mentioned... HARD and like sleeping on a cement block. The TV is very small. There is no iron/ironing board in the room, no coffee maker. These are what I call nice to have items that make a stay much more enjoyable. The air conditioner barely cooled the room (as mentioned in previous reviews). There were no visible vents and so the room was never as cool as the hallways. The vending machines were a plus and it was nice to have them for a late night snack or a beverage. All and all I have to say this is fine if you just want a clean basic room.

We walked everywhere and if you are able, I would recommend you do so too, as you discover the hidden Rome with the lovely backstreets, they were so quiet, you wouldn't think you were in a capital city.

Several vending machines offer a wide choice of various commodities, toilet articles, snacks and sandwiches, coffee, wine, beer and non-alcoholic beverages, all at favourable prices. There is a microwave oven on the 4th floor. A particularly pleasing feature is the roof terrace, divided lightly into three spacious compartments, one part being covered under a canvas roof and with removable canvas walls as wind shelter. The terrace was enjoyed by many of the guests relaxing there with a snack and some wine after a busy day of walking and sightseeing. The hotel offers free access to sauna and gymroom and free Wi-Fi in the rooms. If you did not bring your laptop you can rent one of the PC's in the business room for a symbolic fee. Many of the historic sites of Rome are well within walking distance (0.1 - 2 km) from the hotel. To the Vatican City you may prefer to take the metro from the nearby station Repubblica. Despite its central location the immediate neighbourhood of the hotel is surprisingly quiet. For those interested in music and opera an extra bonus is the close proximity of both Teatro dell'Opera and San Paolo dentro le Mura, the latter a church only a 3 min. walk from the hotel where there are regular opera performances and concerts. Enjoy the acoustics! We spent 6 days at iQ Hotel from the end of March - early April. We enjoyed our stay very much, including the service of an attentive, very competent, friendly and helpful staff.

The service is excellent, practically all their staffs are bilingual or multilingual, so you'll be able to get assistance almost immediately. The rooms are great, comfortable with all the needed amenities. Since it's a no frills hotel, you won't find any mini bars in the room or even room service. But it's not a problem since street cafes are available next to the hotel or piazza. And they also have vending machines filled with fresh coffees (espresso, cafe latte, cappucinos etc) and snacks (inc fresh sandwiches) available at various locations. And you can even enjoy your snacks at one of the open areas (roof top garden overlooking the city and Theatre. If you're feeling like cooking your own dinner (more like instant dinners), you can use the microwave available at level 5 (i think). There's Carrefour Express behind the hotel to get your instant dinners from. And there a street vendor selling fruits and snacks just a few meters away from the hotel. There's also washing machines available at level 2 if you want to do laundry. I was only staying for a day so I did not need these services but for those staying longer, i think that's a great facility. Especially since you won't be able to see all of Rome in a day. And, another plus point, their WI-fi is free!! The expiry period is 10 days! I've been to a number of italian hotels and most will charge a fee for wi-fi or internet usage, so this is great news for me. As for it's location, it's exactly next to \"Teatro dell'Opera\" , follow the road towards the Opera House and you'll get there. The location is close to Termini Station but having said that, you might need to consider taking the bus/ taxi if you're bringing a large luggage or travelling with little kids/ elderly. You have to walk uphill from the station a fair bit before reaching the flat plains. With regards to it's location to the tourist sites, all are within walking distance. Some are closer (2-5 mins); others are approx 15-20 mins. These are walking time. Some, like the Vatican City would require the use of Metro.

With so many restaurants and cafes around, she could have just suggested that we go to some local cafe for a quick bite. Kind of makes you wonder if they have some shady deal with the Irish pub.

On the not so positive side of things, our room (410) was unbearably hot, which meant it was not a pleasant environment. It is not possible to control the heating which was at a constant 25 degrees celsius. Even with the windows open all night we could not sleep well. This is a problem the hotel seems aware of but is struggling to address. For the final night we were provided with a fan and the option to change rooms. The room we were shown had a very small bed so we did not bother. On another point I was disappointed with the size of our room (and the alternative room we were shown). Reading the reviews here it is clear that some rooms are much more spacious than the two we saw, hence the very positive reviews written about them- it is worth bearing in mind that not all the rooms are spacious. I contacted the hotel in advance as my husband is 6 foot 5, requesting a suitable room. For whatever reason we were allocated one one of the smaller rooms with two beds zipped together - leaving very little floor space. In summary the hotel did the job and was good value for Rome.

The hotel is located on a quiet street off Via Nazionale, near the Repubblica metro station and about a 10-minute walk to Termini station. The hotel is very modern in architecture (so if you're looking for a hotel with antiques, this isn't it). We walked everywhere (but the Vatican) from the hotel. It's about 15 minutes walk to the Trevi Fountain and Colosseum, 20 minutes to the Spanish Steps, and 30 minutes to Piazza Navona at a leisurely pace. The rooms are comfortably appointed and were cleaned impeccably every day -- fresh linens & towels. I'll agree with other reviews that the beds are a bit on the firm side -- but I found this to be the case throughout Europe. Our room faced the Teatro dell'Opera which was nice. The room offered a wall-mounted flat screen TV (CNN is the only English speaking channel), a desk with chair, empty mini-fridge, a safe in the closet, mini-toiletries in the bathroom. It was great to have the vending machines which had 500ml bottles of water for 50 cents -- at least half price of anywhere outside the hotel -- and pretty good espresso/cappuccino/cafe macchiato for also 50 cents. The machines on the 5th floor had half-size bottles of Prosecco for \u20ac4 right by the door to the rooftop terrace. It was great to go up there after a day of sightseeing and just unwind. As mentioned, there's a microwave available, a small 24-hour gym (for those who really need to run on the treadmill) with a small sauna, as well as a pay-as-you-go business center with printing and faxing capabilities which I didn't use as the hotel has free wireless internet throughout. Tip: if you have more than one device you want to connect at the same time, ask the front desk clerk for an extra username/password. I did not opt for the \u20ac10 breakfast buffet during our stay as we're not heavy breakfast eaters and found that we were good with a cappuccino & croissant from the local cafe/bakery -- total of \u20ac3,60 for two. The staff at the hotel were really friendly and always greeted us when we entered and left the hotel. One day during our stay it rained cats & dogs so we decided to wait it out by reading our books in the lobby lounge -- we were there for 2 hours and no one bothered us. The front desk clerk was even nice enough to call the airport shuttle service for us the day before our departure to arrange the pick-up time.

Location was excellent, walked to everywhere except the Vatican (although we did walk back from it...if your legs can endure the walking was a great way to explore the City) and the nearest metro was 2 mins away, really easy to use and only 1euro to get around. Lots of reasonable local restaurants to find just off the main road (to the left of the hotel as you come out), loved Riccis (i think was down a side street called via Geneva or something like that). The best bit though was the terrace with vending machines....so nice to grab a 5euro bottle of wine and sit out there before and after going to dinner. Its all enclosed so at night just grab the spare banket from the room, the weather was so nice we even managed to catch a bit of sun up there on our last day!

It's close to the Termini which is great if you have to catch a train to other parts of Italy and it's also close to the Republicca subway. So getting around Rome using the subway is a breeze. The hotel is not right on the main street, so you will get a quiet nights sleep but since walking is to be expected in Rome anyway, the distance to the train stations are not unreasonable. It helps saves on the cab fare. We ended up walking to the Termini to catch a train to Venice with all our luggage with no problem. We are a family of 4 and got a room that accommodated all of us in it. Both my kids got their own beds which was great and it's definitely not easy trying to get a room in Rome that will sleep 2 adults and 2 teens. The beds are definitely firm and the room is decorated in a modular style (think Ikea). However, our room did not feel cramped, it was clean and the bathroom was spacious with the basics that you'd find in a hotel like hair dryer, shampoo etc. We had a refrigerator in our room and we were directly across from the laundry room. Soap is even provided in the washing machine and there was an iron/ironing board in the there. The vending machines are definitely a convenience and very reasonable. They have vending machines for wine and beer. There was another for snack, sandwiches , soda and water. Water was 50cents a bottle-half the price of what you pay for at the store. A sundries vending machine is on another floor should you forget your toothbrush, need a shaver or batteries. It even sells umbrellas which came in handy one rainy night and it was E2.50 vs what the vendors were trying to charge us on the street (E5). There's a microwave on the same floor. There's a small complimentary gym for those who need their work out fix. Free Wifi is available throughout the hotel and in the room which was a huge bonus when we need to do a little more research on what we wanted to do the next day. The staff was friendly and helpful and happily provided us with a sewing kit when we needed one. There are lots of restaurants in the surrounding area for lunch or dinner. Breakfast was more than plentiful and reasonable. It's approximately 15- 20 minutes stroll to the Colosseum. You may want to consider a 24 hr metro card if you plan on covering a lot of ground and the card can be used on both the subways and buses. It is activated from the time that you validate the card either on the bus (a yellow machine) or the train. The IQ hotel is not a 5 star property and it it will not be the right fit for you if you're looking for luxury, robes in the room with fancy amenities and having coffee in your room balcony while overlooking the Spanish Steps. However, if you are looking for a value 4 star hotel that offers you convenience, cleanliness and comfortable place to lay your head after a long day, IQ hotel is it.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Patxy", "ReviewID": "UR98241249", "Content": "Hotel very well located, clean and tidy, staff friendly and helpful.

I love the fact that they offer so many things in vending machines, especially the fifth floor beverages. My only negative was that my room was located near a metal, outdoor staircase.

However, it really did turn out to be that good. Everything was excellent from start to finish. The staff were very cheerful and helpful. We asked slightly cheekily for as nice and quiet a room as they could find us, as it was a birthday celebration, expecting nothing to come of it, but on check in were told that they'd taken note of this and found us a really good room - which turned out to be enormous, with a nice view over the square in front. The arrangement with the vending machines selling snacks, soft drinks and beer and (very reasonably priced) wine works very well, and we felt at all times like we had all bases covered. The location of the hotel is pretty good - ten minutes walk from Stazione Termini, and pretty well located to reach everywhere else in Rome on foot.

We spoke to the management the next day and were informed that this was something to do with the heating being put on for the first time and the position of our room. The manager was brilliant and had us moved into a new room straight away and also gae us a free breakfast as an apology, we were very impressed with his dealing with this matter. However our new room was postioned on floor 2 and was by the front of the hotel, everytime someone walked past our room (on the metal grates right outside) it sounded like someone was walking on a fire escape right outside our bedroom window.

If you're into a more 'luxury' hotel with room service and the extra thrills you MIGHT get in Rome, then this is not for you. If you want something slap-bang in the middle of everything then again, you might want to consider things. But then again for all those, in Rome, you have to pay for it.. and this is why I like the IQ, it comes in a very reasonable rate for Rome. NOTE: usually I arrive into Rome Termini station from Fumicino airport. It's 14euro and saves on traffic. I exit from the station onto Via Giovanni Giolitti and there's usually cabs there waiting... but they are pirates... They always try to charge 20euro, 25 and this time I was offered 28euro!!!! to go 5mins away on a ride that should be about 8euro. I know what you're thinking, why not walk if it's so close, but you know sometimes you arrive you have suitcases to drag along bumpy Roman streets. I'd pay 10euro for a cab to drop me around the corner, feeling lazy but 28euro is taking the p*ss... My suggestions are; 1. exit out onto the front of the station and check with the cabs there 2. walk out of the station onto one of the side streets and find a hotel and ask them to order a taxi 3. Weigh up the costs of a taxi from the airport vs this aggro 4. walk from the station (as I have done), cursing the taxi guys PS they're not all like it across Rome but this part seems to be a regular occurrence", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cmodern, clean, reasonable price! love it!\u201d", "Author": "travellerr1", "ReviewID": "UR86932031", "Content": "I stayed in iQ for only one night and i wish i planned more days in this hotel!!

This is my second time to Rome and this hotel was located at a central location near Republica station (I recommend going to this one over Termini if your destination is on that metro line), Rooms were clean and there was vending machines everywhere which was convenient. The beds were a bit hard as both of us find it a bit hard to sleep through the night without tossing and turning and waking each other up. The free wireless internet was very slow and we got disconnected alot and some areas in the room the wireless would not work. We had our \"do not disturb\" sign/button on that day and we did not want our towels changed or beds made. I usually put valuables and clothing aside if I want our room cleaned. But that day we didn't feel like we needed it so I left everything laying around (including socks, undergarments). However when we came back to the hotel, our room was cleaned and beds were made. So the do not disturb sign was ignored. The other thing was we booked a private car from hotel to airport for 52 euros as our flight was on Sunday morning at 6am. We were under the impression that they will bill us when we checked out and we spent most of our cash and carried only 30 euros with us. At the time of the check out, I asked the hotel staff and t hey said we have to pay the driver directly and t he driver did not take credit card, only cash. The driver did not speak english but he drove us to three different bank machines before we could find one that worked.

For example, the hotel doesn\u2019t have a big restaurant or an expensive bar but instead an array of vending machines that provide the guests with all they need at prices that are even cheaper than the shops. There were laundry machines for a few Euros instead of an expensive laundry service. There is a fridge in the room that I was able to put drinks and light food items without being embarrassed of walking through the hotel lobby carrying plastic shopping bags. I didn't have my laptop with me although there was a free WiFi service but I was able to check my emails in the well equipped business centre for a few euros. There is a huge roof garden equipped with drinks machines of nice Italian wines and beers, snacks and sandwiches. The hotel was very modern and very nicely decorated, the room including the bathroom was spacious and comfortable and also quite which is a big plus considering being in such a noisy city like Rome. The bathroom had basic essentials like shampoo, soap, bath foam and a shower cap, anything else was available at the iQ shop across the corridor for a few coins.

We were immediately impressed with the quality not only of the hotel, room, decor etc. but also with the superb staff! The front desk staff were always friendly and willing to be as helpful as possible. The location was excellent, within walking distance (less than 10 min) to Termini, and 5 min walk to the Metro, Republicca. Located just off of Via Nazionale (major road with shops etc) the street was very quiet, and away from a lot of the hustle and bustle. We found that not many people (taxi drivers etc.) knew about the hotel yet, but we would just mention the Opera and they would immediately know where. The breakfast, though not included 10 euros, was excellent and we were sure to stock up on the fresh fruit, eggs, yogurt, juice to help us start our day. The rooftop patio was a great place to relax after a long day of sightseeing, and the very reasonable vending machines provided everything from water (50 cents!) to full bottles of wine, beer, coolers. The mini-fridge was also a great convenience to have in the room, as we went to the little grocery store behind the hotel and stocked up on snacks. IQ Hotel Roma was built with convenience, and self-service in mind. With laundry machines, free business centre/wifi, workout room, rooftop patio, ice machine, vending machines all available. We were in a double room, which was spacious enough, had a easy to use safe, flat screen tv, comfortable bed/duvet, and very clean and modern decor.

I could not be happier with the room, the quality of service, and especially the value. During August which is the height of the tourist season, we got our room for such a low price that I don't even feel right disclosing it. Then on top of that, the hotel staff were so nice to give us a free upgraded room. Our room was very large, very well accommodated, and our glass doors/windows opened right out to overlook Teatro Del Opera De Roma from a small balcony. Our breakfast, though not included in the price of the stay, was delicious. They have everything from cereal to eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, fruit, deli meats and cheeses. They also offer a very nice selection of fresh juice. We loved the red orange juice. On top of that they have an amazing coffee machine which will make anything from an espresso to American coffee, to a cappucinno, and more. Very tasty as well. They do not have room service or a restaurant or a bar on site (they do have an easy bar), but they do have some well stocked vending machines. My favorite of course was the vending machine with all of the beer and wine. You can buy a full sized 6 euro bottle of some great tasting wine (Castelli Romani), or you can buy several other wines and beers. The hotel also features a roof top terrace which is really nice for hanging out with friends or reading a book any time of day. There isn't a view from there though. The location was pretty perfect. Very close to the train station which will take you to the Vatican and several other attractions. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Colosseum, and is close to restaurants and other attractions while being just far enough away to enjoy some peace and quiet. I can't think of the name of the restaurant off of the top of my head, but if you cross the street from Teatro Del Opera and walk away from the hotel, the first restaurant on the corner is pretty delicious. I had my doubts, but my wife convinced me to eat there, and they had the best pizza I tasted in all of my stay in Italy. I would suggest getting a Roma Pass, and seeing all of the sights on foot without a tour guide. The tours tend to rush you through areas you'd prefer to spend more time in, or spend too much time in areas that seem of little importance. Plus it's immensely cheaper if you do it on your own. The Roma Pass doesn't cover the Vatican though. I suggest buying a \"skip the line\" ticket in advance online. Again, I wouldn't suggest taking the tours. Just be sure to see the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica. If you have several days in Rome, I would recommend dedicating at least one entire day, if not two, to the Vatican. Also, be sure to get the panoramic view of all of Rome via the glass elevator. I forget the name of the Palace that has it, but the hotel staff can help you find it. In conclusion, I absolutely loved this hotel, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone I know or don't know for that matter.

The metro lines will take you to points of interest in Rome (Colosseo, Spanish Steps, Vatican, etc.) We arrived from Zurich and were happy to find iQ Roma quite easily. Service at the front desk was exceptional and they were helpful at every occasion. Hotel was exceptionally clean and the large room was also immaculately clean. Sauna and fitness facilities are available free of charge to guests - a bonus if you need to work off a few pizzas and all the bread and cheese. I recommend running in the early hours through the streets of Rome over the treadmill. This allows you to appreciate the Vatican etc without the large crowds. Breakfast buffet is available upstairs for a cost of 10 euro per person. Very decent breakfast. Vending machines with drinks at very good prices. Complimentary wireless and business centre is also available. If you ask for a restaurant at the front desk, they will recommend that you go to one in particular. While we found that this restaurant was ok, we had better meals at other places - That's Amore (near the Trevi and there is also one conveniently located around the corner from iQ, though we did not try this one) and Strega (we went here twice, pizza first time was great, second time was average). If you are looking for a comfortable, clean, convenient and affordable hotel in Rome, I highly recommend iQ Roma.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSpot On!\u201d", "Author": "Veejnas", "ReviewID": "UR72973043", "Content": "Agree with all the reviews this hotel is well located, clean, had good facilites and the staff are all really nice.

The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing. Most sights are within walking distance, however, my wife has a back problem so we wanted to cut down the walking as far as possible.... and this is where the hotel came into its own. Being close to the Termini station you can easily find a bus going to the bit of the city you are interested in or jump on the metro at Termini or Repubblica. The staff were great at helping us with which bus we needed. The hotel itself is new and looks fantastic. The web site gave me the impression it might be a bit basic with few staff around to help. This wasn't the case. There were plenty of staff and they were all very helpfull. For example, initially there had been a misunderstanding about when we could check-in, but the young lady was quick to resolve the situation. All rooms have controllable air con a fridge and a TV. We booked one of the larger double rooms... and it was plenty big enough. One of the small rooms would have been fine really, however, in our larger room we had a bath rather than just a shower..... great for the wife to soak in in order to ease her back off after a long day of sightseeing. The TV was perhaps a little small for the room, but in all fairness, we weren't there to watch TV! There is a lovely terraced area at the top of the building. Perfect for drinking beers purchased from the Spa (just a short walk away). We kept our drinks (not just beer!) cool using the handy fridge in our room. There are vending machines throughout the hotel and ice machines. The vending machines are reasonably priced, except I think for the alcohol. I'd strongly advise people to purchase from the Spa. The breakfast was great, although possibly a tad overpriced at 10Euros per person per day. The business centre was very handy. Free PC's with internet connections! Also, there was a printer. Not sure if you had to pay for this though. The gym was a tad small but if you insist on doing a workout, there's certainly enough kit there for even the most hardcore gym enthusiast! If I were to go back to Rome soon, I'd definitely go back to the iQ hotel.

The location is unbeatable; across the street from the Opera palace and steps to Via Nazionale and Metro station Republica, also the Termini Train Station is a 5 minutes walk.

The hotel has a spectacular terrace, gym, sauna, children playground, breakfast zone, easy bar, laundry room (coin machines), and vending machines at very very reasonable prices for drinks, snacks, alcoholic beverages and the best coffee machine ever. The breakfast buffet is amazing, offering a great variety of fresh fruit, fresh squeezed orange juice, espresso machines with fresh ground coffee, scramble eggs, boiled eggs, bacon, sausages, hams, mortadella, salami, cheese, all sort of breads and pastries.

We stayed four nights and I'm going to give a full review as previous reviewers haven't given as much details. Firstly the location is excellent, within easy walking distance to the Termini Station and a pleasant walk to major attractions. While the hotel would be classed as being in the Termini Station area (which would be known not to be the best area), this hotel is in a very good and clean street about six blocks from Termini and we felt totally safe at all times while walking in the local area. It was right beside the Opera House and the nearest metro station is Republica, which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel. If you wish you can take the Metro to the major attractions to shorten your walk or save time but there's no need. There's a well stocked Carrefour Express supermarket in the street behind the hotel. The concept of this hotel is based on the guest being given the opportunity to avail of services themselves, without having to pay for additional staff or services which you may not require. So, to be blunt, if you are the sort of pampered hotel guest who wants to be greeted by a concierge who tips his hat at you as you enter and then valet parks your car, who wants to be able to pick up the phone and have meals and drinks delivered to your room, who wants someone to collect your laundry and return it ironed, the IQ Hotel is not for you! For those on B&B, there is a breakfast bar lounge leading to the beautiful roof garden but there is no restaurant or bar. Within the hotel there are many different vending machines which offer snacks, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks, range of coffees and toiletries plus microwaves situated at various locations. There is a business centre with seven new widescreen computers which are free to use, with a printer, so you don't have to bring your laptop to stay in touch. There is also a small but well equipped gym plus coin operated washing machine and dryer, with ironing board and iron. The hotel is no-smoking but caters for smokers by providing a small dedicated smoking outdoor balcony onto the courtyard. The rooms are modern, new (obviously!) and very clean. They are sitated either facing the front or rear of the hotel, or inwards around a hotel courtyard. Our room faced the courtyard and while we didn't have a street view, there was no noise whatsoever. There was double glazing through the hotel so I don't imagine there would be much noise anyway, as the hotel faced two quiet streets. The room had a large bathroom with excellent two-head shower, no bath. Fast wifi is available in all rooms and throughout the hotel, accessible by password provided at check-in. There is a flat-screen TV in each room, with many national channels, including English speaking BBC World and CNN. The room also has a safe and a very useful mini-fridge (not minibar). The bed was quite firm but that seems to be normal for Italian hotels. The front desk staff were always very helpful, polite, courteous and speak very good English. They will provide you with maps and advice on what to see, where to shop and eat. As with all new hotels, we had a few teething problems, mainly around regulating the air-conditioning temperature and our room not being made-up once (a mis-communication as to whether we wanted it made-up or not) but these were professionally and quickly resolved by Management when brought to their attention. We would have no hesitation in recommending the IQ hotel, on the proviso that you aren't an \"ultra-services\" orientated guest - these types of people would be more suited to staying at an over-priced, antiquated establishment elsewhere!", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "iQ Hotel Roma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1729030-Reviews-IQ_Hotel_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$166 - $310*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Firenze, 8</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1729030", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/da/6d/d7/iq-hotel-roma-exterior.jpg"}}
