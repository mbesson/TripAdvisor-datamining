I asked the front desk if he was staying again that night and he was so they offered to move me and handled it really well. As soon as I got to the next room I heard a scrapping sound from the lift (I guess it was from there). Every few minutes you could hear metal on metal. Once again I was down to the front desk, they seemed perplexed with what the noise could be and moved me again. I was a bit annoyed when I found out from someone I was travelling with the next morning that she also had to move rooms after a night because of the same metal noise, she happened to be staying on the floor above directly above me.

The location is very nice for accessing downtown and the waterfront of San Diego. Many different restaurant options were within walking distance, and I was able to get great recommendations and help from the team working there. The only small tweaks I would recommend to make the W a perfect location are: 1. The carpet and baseboards of the room did show a little wear, perhaps a coat of paint and carpet would take the hotel over the top. 2. The coffee provided with room service was not very good.

Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The HR coordinator and hotel manager should be proud of the staff. I was impressed with the lobby, very Chic. The front desk was able to get me into my room about 3 hours early and gave me a great room (for my price range). That is where they fall short. When it was originally done, I could tell the room was very fresh. However, after a couple of years, it has taken its toll. The carpet had stains, the baseboards were coming away from the wall, the walls were scuffed and needed repainting, the blinds had torn cords and the built-in furniture and bed were basically white painted plywood that needed a fresh coat of paint. The location is a little off the beaten path, but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car, they have a free service (nice touch). Also, if you are just up in your room for an hour, the valet will just leave your car out front so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely convenient to get to when you go in and out. So, the only reason the W does not get a 5 star rating is for the price that I paid, I just expected the room to be almost perfect.

Also must also extend a special thanks to Stephen at the Front Desk (Apologies should spelling be incorrect) who found me a cell charger, helped me with dinner recommendations and directions, and was courteous in our every other encounter. I also ordered room service which was delicious and arrived very quickly after I had placed my order.

Then in the morning, your housekeeping staff, disregarding the Do Not Disturb sign on our door, continued to knock several times at 9am. After a late night, this was the last thing that we wanted to deal with. When I opened the door, she said, \"Oh, sorry. When are you checking out?\" We replied that we would check out by the check out time. She persisted, asking, \"When?\". After she left our room, I then heard her do the same thing to a neighboring room, who also, incidentally, had their do not disturb sign posted. From what I heard, this man was also very displeased, and rightfully so. Is it normal practice for your staff to badger your guests out of the hotel? After paying $160 for a night, I would expect a much better experience than the one that I received.

There seems to bit of construction in progress on their second floor and their spa was either difficult for me to locate or temporarily out of service due to that construction (though I never got around to asking the front desk staff). Since my last visit to the area, it appears The Restaurant has slightly relocated and/or scaled down in size, leaving its former dining room as an odd open area with no clear use (and no direct connection to the outdoor patio). Hopefully that area of the hotel is in line for a future refurb/remodel, as it appeared to be a sort of dead space with no obvious function, other than possibly functioning as an overflow room of some sort. The family and I enjoyed our \"Fantastic Suite\" on the top floor of the hotel. Though the room did have a few problems, most were remedied quickly by staff: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The shower drain did not work. The front desk was notified and it was fixed promptly. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The bathtub's drain switch was stuck in the \"drain\" position and we were unable to switch it into the \"closed\" position. Again, staff addressed the issue very promptly. :-) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As this was the top floor of the hotel, I'm not sure what was directly above us, but the bedroom portion of the suite (Room 1905) suffered from the frequent sound of pipes banging overhead. The issue was reported to the front desk but was not remedied, though I did not ask to be relocated and in all fairness, it sounded to my untrained ear like a problem that could not be easily fixed. The sleep sounds programmed into the bedside iHome radio helped mask some of the noise, however. The suite itself appeared to be comprised of two standard rooms connected with a sliding door (though two never-removed doorstops imply that it used to be a swinging door or was simply two adjoining rooms) with one room converted into a parlor / living room. The 1 3/4 bath setup was great for our needs as my daughter bathed in the tub located off the living room while my wife and I liked the simplicity of the bedroom's glass-walled shower. (The pass-through hole in the glass was a convenient way to turn on the shower from the outside without getting wet in the process, and surprisingly let very little water out.) It's been a while since my last stay at a W, so I don't know if the guest information book that most hotels have in each room was missing in our room or the lack of such a book is part of their Whatever/Whenever service. Staff was very accommodating during our three-night stay, from addressing our repair requests, to answering questions about their complimentary car service, to simply holding open the front door. For a W property, I would have liked to see a little more polish on facility upkeep as the banging pipes issue could easily be a major concern for anyone who is not used to background noise when sleeping, and my family and I did notice little bits of litter (the errant gum wrapper, straw, etc.) in the various hallways of the hotel. Despite its little deficiencies, the W's very rail-friendly location and off-the-beaten-path vibe keep this hotel on my short list of places to stay next time I'm in town.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cBest staff EVER!\u201d", "Author": "heathersuzanne", "ReviewID": "UR121904548", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

Being a relatively cold December week (mid 50's), the rooftop bar and lobby bar were not all that busy, and noise was not a problem. The rooms are interesting. I really liked the window seat even if my view was of the parking lot and the occasional trolley going by. The bed was very comfortable. I do agree that the somewhat strange shower, while very nice, ends up soaking the whole bathroom. Also, other than the window seat and a desk chair, there was no other seating in my room. I did have a minor problem with my remote not working, but it was quickly replaced even around 10 o'clock at night.

Chalk board to play with, large window seating to enjoy a view I wasn't familiar with, and the most comfortable bed. We got dressed and headed to the bar. Their signature drinks sounded great so we asked them to line them up and sampled. My thoughts below. *House Sangria w/cinnamon - Nice, juicy & refreshing. Tastes like Christmas. *Grand Marnier Cooler (grand marnier, canton ginger liqueur, fresh orange) - Very refreshing and dangerous. You forget it has alcohol. *Pink Ryno (bulleit rye, sweet tea vodka, fresh orange, fresh strawberry, stirrings blood orange bitters) - Sweet & carmely. Almost like an Arnold Palmer. *Stargazer (Svedka cherry vodka,, stirrings peach liqueur, fresh limes, cranberry juice, soda water) - Tart wake up drink. *Cucumber Mojito (Effen cucumber vanilla vodka, elderflower liqueur, fresh muddled cucumbers & lemons, mint, soda, spirits) - Refreshing and aromatic. I would say this is a salad in a glass. lol *Ginger Mojito (Bacardi limon, ginger beer, mint, lime, simple syrup) - A more traditional Majito with ginger spice. *Starburst (Svedka vanilla, watermelon pucker, sweet & sour) - This drink takes me back. Tastes exactly like a pink starburst candy. Amazing! *Berry Delicious (Svedka raspberry, muddled fresh blackberries, soda, sprite) - Similar to a flat cherry rum & coke. *Nobletini (Smirnoff strawberry, orange liqueur, raspberry liqueur, lemonade) - Tart and ritzy! *Hibiscus Royale (Chandon rose champagne, sweet Australian hibiscus flower, syrup essence) - Lovely if you LOVE champagne! Which I do! The edible hibiscus flower is amazing!! We hung out at the beach. This is a rooftop beach in the city. Fun to take your shoes off and walk in the sand while enjoying an amazing San Diego sunset. For dinner we ate early and enjoyed a romantic meal.

On the way out they offered directions and free bottles of water for our trip. I really felt like I was living the high life for a modest nightly price, though the parking fee ($35 a night I believe) is a little steep. The actual room was clean and aesthetically pleasing -- nice bedding, modern design, novelty clocks and other doodads, a long bay window with cushioning for people who like to curl up with a book, great Bliss toiletries, a large flat screen and, my personal favorite, a full size chalk board for the kid in all of us. The location was pretty good, although very close to the prison which was a bit unsettling.

I found this a rather strange design as the rooftop Sand Bar would have made a great location for a slightly larger pool. Sand Bar is good for chilling out during the day but due to surrounding skyscrapers doesn't get much sun past around 3:30pm (in October) and the bar didn't appear to open until around 1pm.. I was also slightly disappointed that during a one week stay there were at least two nights when we couldn't use sand Bar in the evening as they had been reserved for corporate functions. Location wise you couldn't ask for a better hotel as it is a 15 minute drive from the airport, an enjoyable 15 minute walk from 5th and 6th Street where all the bars, restaurants, clubs, and shopping are and I have to admit I fell in love with San Diego.

I was more than impressed. The amenities in this hotel are second to none. The website's description of the \"Beach\" rooftop lounge was an understatement! The ambiance was PERFECT for my husband and I to enjoy some intimate, yet radiant time together. Also, the heated lamps and fire pits were awesome. Oh, and they honored our request for a \"cool corner\" room - the room definitely lives up to its name! The views were great, and the beautiful bathroom was truly an eye-catcher! After the wedding we had a champagne toast at the Veranda bar. The server and manager on duty were more than helpful with honoring our request for specific champagne that was not chilled at the time.

The pseudo rooftop bar is a cute, unique take on something that is highly sought in downtown San Diego, where the outdoors and nearby club surroundings almost demand a relaxed bar that keeps up the chi chi atmosphere. The sand and driftwood stool were a good choice. - Price. Very affordable, especially for a W. Neutral - Location. It's good for a business location as it's near the commercial part of downtown. It's only okay for vacationers being a little too far from the heart of the gas lamp district. - Staff. Some of the staff was excellent, namely the front desk, bar staff and cleaning/maintenance crew. Some of the other staff was rude and not very useful. The valet's were impolite, a friend of the valet verbally attacked my friend to the point where I was hoping to see him elsewhere on our travels so I could request that he back up his threats and finally, I question the security given the fact that two fights apparently occurred in the hotel during our stay. Maybe it was an off week but I can only go on my personal experience. Negatives - Concierge. The \"Whatever\" desk was aptly named as they consistently gave us whatever instead of what we asked for.

I got the \"Wonderful room\" and had a view of the ocean. It was a partial oceanview because there was a building right in front of the hotel, but it was far and the view was still something that I enjoyed. The gym isn't big at all. In fact, it is a tiny room, but I had a nice workout. Next to the gym, there's the pool. A tiny one with a few lounge chairs. There were two people when I went there and the weather was nice, so I enjoyed a little time there as well. I also went to the Beach bar, but not at night. I went when there just to check it out. I bet it can be fun at night, but didn't bother to go. I traveled by myself to go to a concert and watch one of my favorite bands play. The venue was 4th and B, so the hotel was close and convenient. Now, I was a little disappointed by the concierge service. The lady there was a bit rude when I asked her about their car service to see if they can get me to the concert venue. She said I had to make a reservation or wait for the next car available. I was fine with it, but the way she responded sounded like she was annoyed, and to be honest, I didn't want to deal with a person like that, so I took a cab. It was great because the cab was available when I needed it, the driver was courteous and he picked me up after the concert. About the noise outside, well... it is downtown and when the sun goes down, its nightlife becomes alive! The first night I could hear a live band performing somewhere outside. It ended at around midnight, I think. I fell asleep. The second night, the night I went to the concert, I came back to my hotel room at around 12:30am. There was a party going on next to my room! The people were too loud. I dialed once the front desk, but they didn't answered. The party finally ended at 4:30am. I know so because that's when I finally could sleep. I guess I could have call the front desk more times until someone responded and ask them if they could tell this people to lower the volume or something, but I didn't do it, and honestly, even though I couldn't sleep, I wasn't surprised it happened. I read the reviews and took my chances, so if you are reading this and you want a good night sleep, then beware this could happen to you. It is a matter of how important it is to you to get a good night sleep with no noise. Another thing I noticed, is that at first my room looked clean, but then I noticed food crumbs on the bench next to the window (yikes,) and the next morning the housekeeper didn't take all the trash from the bathroom. That might not be a big deal, but still, it is nice to walk into a clean bathroom after the housekeeping service. I didn't pay too much for my stay. I would probably stay there again if I go to another concert or want to stay downtown just because it is convenient, I liked the rooms, the gym, the little pool, and because it is a nice hotel for a short stay.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGoing Far & Beyond the Call of Service\u201d", "Author": "matthew f", "ReviewID": "UR118005770", "Content": "I recently stayed at the W San Diego for a two-day business conference and my experience far exceeded my expectations.

It was our choice hotel and we booked it over a month in advance. I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest and although I don't have platinum status or anything, I figured that since it was our engagement trip that maybe the front desk employee would have atleast said congrats, but no....let me start from the beginning. We pulled up in our rental car and the parking options were either valet (w/in and out privileges), nearby garages or street parking, so we did the valet option--no complaints there. When I booked w/Starwood, the reservations agent put a note in that it was our engagement trip. I didn't expect a room upgrade or anything, though a congratulations would have been nice. Upon check-in, the front desk woman gave me our room card and I asked if she saw my note. She said she saw it (no congrats on our day old engagement), but they were completely booked. And that was it. Hey Starwood, maybe throw a complimentary glass of champagne to your SPG guests if they just got engaged. It happens only once! Anyway, moving on.... The room was nicely decorated complete with a chill window seat. The bathroom had Bliss products and the whole setup was appealing. Everything in the room was overpriced from the $5 bottle of water to the whole room service menu, but that was expected. Whenever we had a question, the employees in the lobby, er i mean \"Living Room\" (part of their lingo, valet is \"wheels,\" the gym is \"sweat\"...yea I'm serious. In the W info guide in the room, there was a whole key to decode the W jargon) were nowhere to be found. If we did happen to find an employee who seemed willing to help us, he/she was totally pretentious. Whatever happened to customer service? All in all, the hotel gets an average rating from me, which is surprising because every other Starwood property I've stayed at has been well above average. It's pretty and all, but the staff needs a refresher course on how to be customer friendly. Take your business elsewhere.

The W San Diego is generally on par with what I've come to expect from W; very nice and stylish, but its own \"hipness\" will be its downfall. Also, let me say this first: This is NOT a family hotel. This place is meant for singles and couples. It is definitely marketed towards a younger set. If you come here expecting it to be super family-oriented, then you're in for a rude awakening, and have only yourself to blame if you're disappointed. The staff at the front desk was helpful, as always. Very friendly and warm without being disingenuous. I didn't use the concierge service at all, but there was always someone at the front desk when I was in the lobby at 6 am to head to my conference. Regardless of the time of day, service was attentive and hospitable. Plus, I like the Granny Smith's they always have sitting out. As other guests have noted, the \"Living Room\" bar, located in the lobby, can be a bit loud if you're walking through the lobby during happy hour. Though, being 30, I didn't find it anywhere near as intrusive as some of the other posters have. Maybe I'm just \"hipper\"? But the lobby is well-appointed and has lots of couches and chairs if you want to use the free WiFi. And the drinks at the bar are not too expensive given the bar's locale and location within the hotel. And they were decently strong. The rooms seem to be a bit on the smallish side. They were deep enough (from door to window), but the distance between the bed and the desk at the foot of the bed was minimal. If I was sitting at the desk checking email, nobody would have been able to walk around me. Plus, I would have to push the chair back under the desk to do anything in the room aside from walk to the bathroom. I found that annoying. I was on the 12th floor and didn't notice any music from either the Living Room bar, nor from the roof-top pool. However, it should be noted that I did not stay during a weekend, so that may account for the quiet. But, I used to live in San Diego and have been to the club/bar on the roof, and can see how it could be bothersome. The mattresses, as is the W trademark, were incredibly comfortable. The housekeeping service was great, and I really enjoy the toiletries The W provides. The bathroom was immaculate, and I really like the all-white theme. It makes it seem very clean and pristine. Plus, in a place like San Diego where it's seemingly perpetually warm, having a cool bathroom is a bonus. I also liked the iPod/iPhone clock-radio connectivity. I used the valet service at all hours of the day/night, and found it to be quick and friendly. Plus, none of the valets complained when my shoddy rental car continually set off its own alarm. My main complaint with the hotel is that, while the glossy, white wood furniture was very sleek when it was first installed, it's showing signs of wear. That style of hip, happening furniture needs constant upkeep. Many areas of the desk and headboard had chips or looked dirty. If the brand is going to decorate with such a stark minimalist design, as is their style, then they need to be prepared to raise maintenance levels to compensate. I just don't think that's happening here. Wireless/Wired Internet is outrageously expensive. This concept still boggles the mind; how can a 2-star affair like Super 8 or Motel 6 have free WiFi, but the Starwood chains charge upwards of $15 for internet? Internet has almost achieved status as a necessity for life, much like electricity and water. The rate for 24 hours of Internet is ludicrous and appears to be merely a money-making scheme. Shame on Starwood for perpetuating this. In all, I really enjoyed my stay, and the location is unbeatable for access to the 5, the Gaslamp, or any major areas of San Diego. Next time I may try the Westin just to see, but I'd still stay at the W again.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cReunion with friends!\u201d", "Author": "sleeslee84", "ReviewID": "UR115667852", "Content": "Absolutely a wonderful place for breakfast and bloody-marys!

We decided to check out the beach bar & gym, both were nice and yes the pool is pretty small but still ok.

For dinner, we spoke to the concierge who really had no clue....actually anytime we spoke with him, he seemed to give us the \"same suggestions\"....most of the time, I researched on my BB and told him the spot and how to get there. I even had to mostly set up our trip to La Jolla, he had no clue about the area. I think he def. needs more training, he was a sweetie but really needed to delve more into his work. When we got back from dinner, we also realized we have not seen the housecleaner but figured it was the changing of the rooms, wrong, we had to actually call when the 2nd day she didn't show up. They wanted to send her up at 10:30pm but I just asked for more towels, in the 5 days we stayed here, we had housecleaning twice. The hotel is in the downtown area of a city, lots of city life so if you are looking for more of a beach experience, this is not for you, I def. will not.The area is ok & yes there are some \"wishy washy\" folks but they leave you alone and mostly we felt safe anywhere we walked and we walked everywhere. The location to the Gaslamp Quarter is great but better suited to visitors looking to party. We were looking more for the coast and beach areas, for that you should stay in La Jolla or Coronado and pay the extra, it would be well worth it just for the location. The area gets you where ever you need to go though, plenty of cabs, buses and ferrys to take you around but that adds costs so as I said, if you are not looking to party and are looking for a quiet trip, go elsewhere. On the last day, I had to give them feedback because I just was SO disappointed and we spoke with a few employees explaining all the above and how they should smile more, extend their help more. I even told one of them, they should speak to the W in Washington (service there is to die for) and ask how to improve things. I told them I felt like we were staying at a Holiday Inn rather than a W Hotel, the rooms, the service are not 5 STAR. BTW, there is a Holiday that faces the ocean and looked terrific, you may want to check it out. My friend stayed there, it was a few hundred dollars cheaper and she liked it, not love but liked it. If I could tell TA members anything, is do not stay here, listen to the reviews...they were all dead on.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "huntingtinton beach", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "meowable", "ReviewID": "UR113095614", "Content": "lovely entrance - fun bar to socialize - bedding is wonderful - nice addition of the coffee makers in room - cool showers", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cW for WASTE - TIME and MOney\u201d", "Author": "Mu_L_11", "ReviewID": "UR111881704", "Content": "We \"briefly\" stayed at W San Diego to celebrate my husband's 30 birthday.

I was able to secure a military rate of $131, which was great. When we pulled up the valet whisked my car away and was very friendly. The girl at the front desk was also super friendly and helpful. The decor is obviously meant to be chic, and while some may say they're trying too hard, I think they're trying just hard enough and succeeding. The \"living room\" (lobby) was nicely laid out during the day, and was a fairly busy semi-club later that night with lighting effects and club music. Here is where one needs to begin managing expectations. Do not bring your 90 year old mother or 6 month old child to a hotel whose thing is being young and hip, and which comes with loud music and late night revelers. Use ear plugs if you're on a lower floor and are sensitive to noise. The room was spacious and fun. The clock had an iPod dock and the window had a nice bench one could lay on. The TV was flat and big and the wall had a chalk board my wife and I doodled on. The bathroom was nice enough, but (one almost meaningless gripe was that) the toilet paper holder was in a super annoying spot behind you. We hung out at the Beach joint for an hour or so before dinner and it was cool. It was fairly empty so we got a seat on the bench and enjoyed a few drinks before the sun dipped behind the buildings. We did not hit it up late night so this may be an unfair assessment, but I can see it being a drunk-girl-in-high-heels disaster as folks try to navigate through a crowd and around furniture pieces in several inches of sand. The hotel is not quite in the middle of Gaslamp. My wife and I are from New York and have no problem walking numerous blocks to get somewhere - one Manhattan block between avenues is like four SD blocks so it's not that big a deal, but here again, expect a walk, or call a cab. Overall we enjoyed our night. The rate was great, the locations was good enough, the room was fun, and the couple of folks we interacted with were very friendly. Also, I appreciate when managers respond to Trip Advisor posts, which the W seems to.

We appreciate a contemporary aesthetic, but too often at the W it's poorly executed. Some things were extremely inconvenient and not up to the standards of even a 2-star property. And for whatever reason the W tends to nickel and dime us for basic services that in our opinion should be considered part of the stay. It's one of the things my wife and I joke about--what charge could they dream up to hit us with this time? The room itself was not \"Wonderful\". The bathroom was nice, but the furniture looked like they bought an old hotel and just painted all the old furniture white. C'mon, guys, you're supposedly a 4-star hotel. However, the most annoying thing about this hotel is the lack of a coffee pot in the room. They have coffee, but you have to get dressed, go downstairs to the lobby, and get it yourself. Either that, or you have to order a $20 pot delivered to your room. This is the first hotel I've ever been to that did not have a coffee pot in-room. From the lowliest Holiday Inn to all the way up to the Hotel Setai you can get that. I'm still baffled by this decision. Service is sometimes delivered well, and friendly people on the staff do exist, but about half the time it seems the staff is too bothered to do anything for you. I had to check with the front desk several times regarding a FedEx package I was receiving there. When I finally received it they charged me $18 on my final bill for the privilege of them handing it to me. Seriously? We just died laughing because it was too predictable and completely W-ridiculous. These are the types of things that are extremely annoying that other hotels would never dream of charging for. Also there was no one to help us with a cab at the valet station as we were leaving. I had to go in search of anyone--no concierge, no front desk, no bellman.

I honestly can't go on and on about it or it's amenities because we really only used it to sleep at night. BUT... the sleep was great. Because we were on Michigan time, our first night we accidentally fell asleep by 630pm. It was a night of complete and total uninterrupted sleep and the black out curtains were a nice touch. We were on the 14th floor and didn't have any noise from the Beach bar or hall ways. In the day sometimes you could hear through the walls but it was never actually disturbing. The lighting in the room was a little on the dim side which wasn't the best for getting ready. House Keeping came everyday and always refreshed our toiletries with the Bliss products. We LOVED those. Although one day we're pretty sure they folded up our dirty wet towels from the floor and put them back on the shelf. One great thing I can say....the Acura service.... SO convenient. We used it twice and it really saves time from walking and money from cab fare. Definitely utilize that amenity! LOCATION: I've read a lot of mixed reviews about the location. Honestly I thought it was in a great spot. Yes, there are quite a few bail bonds lining the street and you're only blocks away from a jail/prison but we NEVER EVER felt unsafe. I also read there are a ton of bums. Yes there were a handful here and there but it wasn't like you had to step over them to get to your destination. You mind your business they mind theirs. We basically walked to most places. Seaport Village is a 10minute walk (Coronado island ferry, Top of the market fish market, little shops and restaurants, museum etc) Little Italy-10/15 min walk GasLamp- We took the Acura there and a Pedicab back after the bar. Pedicab guy originally told us 40$ but a friend got him down to 20$. It was a 10min drive by car. Old Town was a 12-15$ cab ride We took the bus to the San Diego zoo. $2.25 a person one way. Not bad at all. (side note, I'm not a usual public bus taker...and the atmosphere is what you expect a public bus in a major city to be)But it's SUPER CHEAP and a 30 minute ride. There wasn't much as far as breakfast places. We ate twice at Grand Central and once in Little Italy at a Trattoria. It was Amazing. I think it was one of the only places open for breakfast in Little Italy. I do have one complaint. We did order room serivce one morning. My order was not difficult by any means but it was comletely screwed up. I double of things that I only asked for 1 of and 1 of what I ordered 2 of and one whole entree was missing, and I was charged for the double items I didn't order! When I realized it, I called and let them know I was not trying to be difficult,the food we actually did get was good but just didn't want to pay for the extra stuff. The woman I spoke with said \"No problem, I'll let my manager know and have it taken care of\". I said \"Thanks\" and forgot about it. The day of check out we received a reciept with all the items still on it stating I would be charged that amount. When we checked out I once again had to bring it to their attention. His reaction was polite, and slyly asked me \"What do I think would be fair to do about the situation\" In the end he took a portion of the charge off the bill but at that point I almost feel it should have been completely comped.

The immediate area surrounding the hotel was less than desirable (a county jail and huge homeless population right on the next block) and the hotel was located further out of the gaslamp district than expected eliminating the ability to walk anywhere. Yet they charge $32 a night for parking. No wonder the hotel offers a complimentary Acura MDX to use if guests are travelling within 10 miles of the hotel. The valet and bell staff were exceptional. They provided top class service and addressed us by name on a daily basis. However, the front desk staff made a huge mistake upon check-in. The staff member gave us keys to the wrong room, which was already occupied by another guest. Luckily that guest was not in the room and the bellhop had accompanied us to the room with our luggage and quickly made a phone call to the front desk and took us to the correct room and got us new keycards. We were on the 4th floor and we could hear the noise from the street all day/night. Did I mention there is a bus stop/station right next to the hotel? The room itself was on the small side and the bathroom was a complete joke. The bathroom was clearly designed for aesthetics and not for functionality. There was no bathtub and no shower door which made bathing a toddler a real challenge.

Trash like cigarette butts and napkins were flying into the pool. For such a small hotel, the elevators took forever.

According to the reservation, $200 is charged if a guest smokes in the room but I asked how this could apply to me since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smoke. Then the girl said yes, that is the charge, you smoked in your room. First she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why I was charged but after I mentioned the latter the computer in front of her apparently said there was a smoking charge. I then spoke to a manager named Bernard, who besides being extremely rude, asked me if I perhaps remembered smoking in the room even after I told him at the beginning of the conversation I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smoke and this charge is impossible. At the end of the conversation Bernard refused to refund the false charge. Bernard may have lost SPG my business, I refuse to be called a liar and furthermore hate those, like Bernard and the W San Diego, that lie, cheat, and steal.

This hotel is obviously going for the \"hip/trendy\" style, it's evident from the moment you walk in. Some in our group were turned off by the fru-fru and excessive feng shui. I didn't mind it too much, although sometimes it seemed a little contrived or forced. The particulars: Great check in/check out, concierge and front desk service. Also attentive bartenders. Female employees very easy on the eyes. Acura seemingly sponsors this hotel. Convenient Acura SUV's available free of charge to take you within a 10 mile radius, that was great. Need to fill out an Acura survey in order to ride, and Need to take cab's back to the hotel. Acura sales literature located throughout room as well. No jacuzzi and the pool is really puny. I passed on going swimming because of this. Good location for hotel. Bed was extremely comfortable as were pillows. Unfortunately the view to the east is of a correctional facilitiy / jail, so stay away from that side.. Street noise and sirens at night easily invade the room, even on the upper floors, so having earplugs would help. Room size was good. Way too much water pressure in the shower caused water to fly onto room carpet OUTSIDE of bathroom. Really cool 2nd floor rooftop beach bar and relaxation area. Take advantage of the 4-7pm happy hour as the drinks are outrageously priced otherwise. $14 for a basic cocktail???

We paid through priceline but she honored my starwood preferred gold member status and upgraded our room to a partial view of the bay. The maid service is exceptional. The bad: (1) elevator access. You always have to put your card in the reader slot in the elevator to get to your floor which makes for a cumbersome experience when your hands are full as ours often were. (2) No in-room cofffee which may seem trivial to some but a lifeline for me. The W offers coffee downstairs next to the lobby but they only had 1 pot and it was frequently empty which made for a very frustrating experience. (3) The \"club\" atmosphere with trance music being blasted in the lobby in the late afternoons and into the evenings was really annoying and made for a very loud hotel experience (I slept with ear plugs). (4) The rooms while clean and decorated elaborately in the same Blue/IKEA/funk complete with a chalk board and chalk, are small with limited shelf/drawer space and there is NO bathtub - shower only (and shower has no door). (5) There is no privacy in bathroom due to the apparently Asian inspired sliding bathroom door that really only blocks the opening to the bathroom, it actually does not close off the bathroom. (6) NO jacuzzi and a very, very small pool. (7) The gym was nice actually (with a variety of equipment) but with slatted doors it was open to the outside and an exhaust smell would come into the gym making it as though you were working out on the street next to a running diesel truck. (8) Location: next to a rather seedy section of down town, it was a good hike to the gas lamp district (Little Italy was closer) through vagrants and scary looking people and, with trains running through the night blaring their whistles, again, ear plugs are a must. (9) No onsite parking - you must use valet and at a whopping $32 per day, it really adds up. Good side- you can come and go as you like with no additional fee but the valets wanted tips each time they got your car for you. (10) the non front desk staff was rude and absolutely lacked elevator ettiquete. Other than the front desk who's sole job it is to greet and be courtious to guests, the rest of the staff we encountered were rude. As an example, one staff member actually brushed me out of the way so that she could get onto the elevator. I yielded to her and actually apologized, she however completely ignored me, pushed her way past me and jumped onto the elevator. We received similar treatment from other personnel. I gave it an average rating as you could definitely do worse and as an alleged 4 star hotel, it IS nice but it is just not my style with the loud club music, the rude staff and in short, the focus on a narrow niche market really missed its mark with me.

But we got a great deal on the hotel online, so I thought we'd try it. We couldn't have been more pleased. It's located just outside of the Gaslamp district (within walking distance but away from the crowd and noise), and there was none of the loud booming music I've come to associate with W hotels from experiences at their bars in other cities. The staff was courteous and very responsive to requests. The room had a whimsical decor, with a chalkboard in the room, colorful pillows, and a great bathroom design. There was a small fitness center on the second floor (downer is there were only two elliptical machines, but I didn't have to wait long for one to free up). The hotel also had a cool \"beach\" area on the second floor with sand and pool chairs and a bar, and a nice little pool. Unfortunately we were so busy with life outside of the hotel we didn't get to spend any time there. But it was fun to know it was there in case the weather hadn't been so great or we hadn't felt up to going out. One thing that could have made it better would have been if it were a little closer in to the Gaslamp area - it could be a pretty long walk depending on which area we wanted to get to. But then again, we're from the east coast, so we're used to walking everywhere. I'm sure a lot of people just drive, in which case it is a very short hop. The one other downer is that they only have valet parking at the hotel, which seemed priced quite high at over $30/night. I'm sure that we could have found a better parking deal if we had hunted around a bit, but since we got such a good deal on the hotel, we just ate the parking fee.

My stay was for one night the day after Comic-Con ended and was able to use a corporate rate to get a decent price. The hotel is fairly easy to get to, only a few blocks away from Broadway and also close to the trolley. I ventured out at night in the surrounding area and I felt safe. The Gaslamp Quarter is a 10 minute walk away, although you do have to pass a few courthouses and the bus station to get there. I checked in a few hours early and was able to get settled into a room right away. If you book a room on the penthouse floor, try to ask for a room that is not next to the suite. During the day it was easy to hear music playing from the suite room. Fortunately the people staying there were quiet during the night. I found the bathroom setup to be a little strange with no door to the shower, which allowed for a little bit of water to accumulate on the floor. The towels were very soft and comfortable. I did not spend too much time in the room and I have no complaints about the bed. I did like the banquet at the window which gave me a view to the north. I found the door to the room to be very heavy and it slammed every time it was closed. Also, the Do Not Disturb sign is on a long piece of string and can easily get caught in the door, resulting in housekeeping not seeing it. The housekeeper was very friendly and apologized. I ate breakfast in the restaurant and ordered the french toast which was very tasty. The hotel also features a bar on the second/third floor complete with sand. This area was very nice to relax in for a few hours during the late afternoon. I was not hassled at all when I did not order any food or drink, which was a pleasant surprise.

There was a window bench, fun decor (I agree with the poor cleaning mentioned in other posts though). Then I decided I wanted to go somewhere, so I dialed \"Whatever Whenever\". Well apparently the highly proclaimed Acura works fewer hours than the average Scottsdale housewife. Oh, and whenever (wherever) I tried to arrange for the car during business hours it was always booked. Then there was the Valet staff. When there was more than one task, eg assisting a Coolio wannabe out of his C class and hailing a cab for a hotel guest (who would have preferred an Acura) they couldn't handle the pressure. Overall I thought this hotel was overly consumed with making as many words as possible start with \"W\" and having the elevator mats greet according to the current time of day (they were changed for morning afternoon and evening) that they lose sight of old fashioned customer service and hospitality.

It used to be very techno-modern with subdued lighting. The concierge is right inside the doorway which was confusing for the front desk. Luckily, I knew where the front desk was. The property still has a basket of green apples at the checking and Ashley was extremely friendly and welcomed me back as if I were a close family member returning from Iraq. Wow!

And, the Front Desk immediately offered to bring me a pot of tea with 'all the trimmings' - to my room, free of charge. When I 'thought' my room charges were a bit 'off', they immediately adjusted my bill to reflect what I presumed was the correct estimation - no questions asked.

Rooftop sounds way cooler than \"outdoor 2nd floor pool\", but might be considered a little misleading. - There was black hair in my sink. - The ipod dock didn't work- I could hear music when I had my ear pressed to the speakers, but cranking the volume all the way up didn't get the volume to reach the other side of my room. - Windows in my room were filthy. - There was a waterfall when you walked up the stairs to the beach- at first I thought this was really cool. The I realized it was from the crew washing soot off the building from a fire they had last year. The W didn't cover the area where the water came streaming down.... the did put towels on the floor so people didn't track water into the ulta-hip lobby. Hopefully they don't reuse those towels... - The Acura free ride anywhere you want is not usually available anytime you really want to use it. - The treadmill that I used in the morning to work out was already warmed up. There was sweat everywhere on it. You might find this appealing... I did not. - I checked in for a meeting and they remembered to tell me that I had a welcome packet waiting for me, but forgot to give it to me. I assumed they meant it was waiting in my room, but they actually meant it was waiting with them. When I called and asked, they did bring it up to my room.

We've had some problems when we've waited until the last minute before but not this time. The W San Diego is a lovely hotel with everything we needed to have a wonderful vacation. We arrived very early but our room was ready so we were able to check in. Considering we left home to catch our flight at 4 a.m. that was greatly appreciated. We stayed in a standard room with a king bed - it was very clean and comfortable and I don't recall having a better nights' sleep than here. I was a little worried when we first came in and saw the lounge area - a couple of reviews I'd read had said it got loud but it was never an issue for us. The pool is heated and open 24 hours, which was nice, and it seems well maintained but it was fairly small. For the two of us, that really wasn't a problem and we only encountered other guests there once. The concierge and desk staff were all very friendly and we got some really good dinner recommendations in the area - definitely appreciated. The only minus, which really isn't that much of a minus, is that the hotel is a little out of the way for someone who might want to be closer to the action, such as in the Gaslamp Quarter. That said, it is a very quick walk to the trolley station as well as to a number of bus stops and Little Italy is only a quick walk away. Of course, the best part is the Karl Strauss Brewery that is right around the corner so a big thumbs up for that. In general, there are plenty of places close by for a meal and any kind of food one might be looking for. We did have to walk to get places once in a while but it was worth it. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the W San Diego and I think we definitely got our money's worth.

I know times are tough in CA and so feel some ambivalence about offering bad reviews. I also know this hotel - among many in San Diego- went bankrupt last year. So this review is directed to the Starwood upper management of W and not necessarily to the W San Diego staff. I have stayed in a number of Ws and try to choose one when on travel. This is my perspective. The W SD already had a number of things going against it. Not located in Little Italy, GSL or waterfront but in an area next to the Jail, Bailbondsmen and office bldgs so not walk-friendly or pleasant. They also seem to be undergoing renovations as one side of the bldg is covered over in plastic with wndows on the west side shrouded in plastic. The \"beach\" is not pleasant as this deck level has a perfect view of all of the plasic. Also, their supplies of appliances for the room seem to be limited since they can't supply functioning coffee makers in the rooms ('ve now waited two days for one) and the iron is malfunctioning. Oh, and the room is surprisingly small (though fairly well appointed). The staff are pleasant enough. But the overall experience so far is not W quality. Word of advice to W management: you no longer corner the market on hip hotels so a W property poorly maiintained even under bankruptcy has long term consequences for guests thinking about hotels in the future.

I did not receive an email with the new reservation information. My big mistake for not following up on this.

They did provide a room after a discussion with the current manager, but at the upgraded price of the 19th floor penthouse room; being on the 5th floor, not upgraded (at least as far as I can tell by the room itself). The room was OK, but not a 200 USD quality. The carpet was stained (though it did not seem to be a undefined type of stain). The shower curtain had the pinkish hue at the bottom seam; you know, the type you get when a object in a humid environment is not clean regularly. There was a 'cat kibble' on the floor next to the entrance to the bathroom. I did not see a sign stating that 'to save water and the environment, please place this placard on the bed to show that the sheets do not need to be changed'; they were not changed.

Melissa Humble is the consumate hostess, greeting my colleagues and me by name as we arrive in the lobby each night. Melissa is always ready with suggestions for restaurants, activities, and consistently finds ways to improve my stay each and every visit. The rooms are always clean, fresh, and fully stocked. I'm continually impressed with the housekeeping staff and their attention to detail in the rooms. It's the attitude of staff and their enthusiam for providing First Class Service for every guest, new or returning, that make the W San Diego feel like home.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a weekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "NYCVoyageuse", "ReviewID": "UR58335017", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to San Diego from the East Coast for Labor Day.

The W is a reasonable walk (~15 minutes) from the convention center, closer than some of the discount chain motels I was looking at. The neighborhood is not as chic as the hotel itself, mostly office buildings and parking lots (reminds me of downtown Hartford) but it's not far from the Horton Plaza and beyond that is the Gaslamp. This was my first time in a W hotel, it's basically targeted to younger travelers, typically in the elevators were groups of twentysomethings in town for a wedding or bachelor/ette party. This could have made for poor sleeping, fortunately I didn't hear any wild parties or anything aside from the TV next door (though I should note I am a heavy sleeper). My room was on the 17th floor - very comfortable bed, one of the nicer hotel bathrooms I've seen, everything was clean and the furniture and decor had a modern chic to it (even if upon closer examination you could tell they were closer to the level of Ikea than something you'd see advertised in the New Yorker). Downstairs by the reception is a bar and seating area that are good for meeting friends. I didn't try the (small) pool but did use the gym, which was more or less your typical gym for business travelers. Next door is a brew pub to grab a pint, and if you're hungry for some cheap but tasty Mexican grub, I recommend Taco express which is one block north on State Street. The staff was very helpful and friendly, but the one drawback I would point out is the $12.95 daily charge for wireless access, and the wireless speed was not up to par for the purposes of VPN use or video streaming. Since I stayed five nights, I skipped the hotel wireless after the second day and managed to limit my wi-fi use to the conference and coffee shops. Overall, I had a comfortable stay, and would book again - as long as I could expense it. If I were paying out of my own pocket for more than a night or two I might be more inclined to bargain hunt more aggressively. On the other hand, if I ever had the occasion to organize a guys night out in San Diego the W would be the first place I'd look - and that's more or less what this hotel is aiming for.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso, Texas", "Title": "\u201cW is for Wow\u201d", "Author": "Dpqt83", "ReviewID": "UR57726284", "Content": "loved it amazing, service, ambience and would love to live at the hotel", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCalifornia the way it should be, a perfect hotel for San Diego Sightseeing.\u201d", "Author": "solohobo", "ReviewID": "UR57489042", "Content": "I just returned for a 3 night weekend stay here with a 45 person family wedding party from Midwest and Eastcoast, and it was really nice, relaxing, hip, trendy and well managed.

I've had good, great and mediocre experiences with the W brand, so I was careful in making my decision on how I felt about this location. Arriving at night into San Diego, I found that the hotel was easy to locate, housed in an attractive older building close to the Little Italy area of town. Attached to the older building is a tower that houses all the rooms. Once I was checked in, I eagerly headed up to my room to see what they had in store for me, as I've grown accustomed to the uniqueness of each W. Sure enough, this W had a distinct blue and white color scheme, with a blackboard and chalk on the wall, and a wonderful lounging couch that was embedded into the wall right by the window. Also, I was happy to find that this W provided each room with a really cool coffee maker, with pods of coffee, decaf and tea. In addition to the cool factor, this was Diedrich coffee. For those who don't know, there are other coffee companies out there beyond Starbucks, and Diedrich is one of them. So I was a happy camper at this point. I wandered on down to the old building section to explore, and found Rice - a restaurant, which seemed to be very good looking, but also very empty - and it seemed to stay empty through out the week, so I never ate there. I'm not big into empty restaurants. Going on up to the second floor, I found a well equipped gym, a spa, and on the other side, a beach - complete with sand and a bar, but without any water or waves. But that was alright because the feel was better than anything that other hotels offer - open rooftop, sand in your toes, a fire pit, loungy chaises, and a bar. Since I was here on work, I couldn't hang out a lot, but I did have to stay an additional week. Much to my disappointment, a convention had descended into town and all the hotel rates were in Mars or Jupiter, and there'd be no way I could expense that. So, sadly, I prepared to stay in some other part of town, and I told this to Melissa, at the front desk. I didn't really bother to look into hotels, as I felt that anything besides the W in San Diego would be just another hotel. Suddenly, on Friday, after I'd left for my weekend, I got a call from someone at the hotel, and they had me back the following week at the same rate as I'd had on the first week, so I didn't have to stay at any other hotel. This was, thanks to Melissa, AWESOME. So next time you're there, be sure to let Melissa know that she's awesome, and maybe she'll share some of that awesomeness with you too. To balance out my review, I have to point out a few things that irked me about the hotel. To be clear, nothing was wrong with the hotel, but as is the case with people, when something's really nice, it surely could be nicer ... The bed, which is always awesome, wasn't as awesome as I'd have expected. They must've got these beds from a different supplier or something. They didn't have drinking glasses in the room. They did have plastic cups. Which wasn't cool. I'd have expected a nice glass ... if I'd decided to get a scotch from the mini bar, I'd have had to drink it in a plastic cup. How un-W! So that's really not a complaint at all.

The gentleman at the bar a few feet away said he could not help us. We stayed at the front desk trying to find someone to help us for at least 7-8 minutes until finally someone came out of the back room, looking like we just woke him up from a deep sleep. After that, check in was fine, and we went to our room. The room was pretty standard, except for the chalk board on the wall. I know then W is trendy, but a chalkboard on the wall? We spent most of the 2 days outside the room. Valet parking is extremely expensive and street parking there is horrible. There is metered parking but you have to get up at 8am to feed the meter the next morning, and then every 2 hours after that. Also, it seems this area is a main hangout for the homeless population in San Diego. One of the nights we literally had to walk through bodies to get to the hotel. Another pet peeve of mine was that the door man was too busy talking to one of his coworkers to open the door when we went out. He had his hand on it, but was not paying attention to those going in and out, so we pushed the other door open.

After telling the front desk staff that the amount doesn't appear on their web page they could have cared less. The girl told me that I can park on the street (just so I move my car by a certain time each day except for Sunday etc...) Well I looked for a parking spot the second night I was there and the closest thing I could find had homeless people (and a lot of them) sleeping 5 feet away. I didn't even want to get out of the car. Now, if I would have booked a hotel for say $45 a night, I might expect something like that, but no, this was not that type of hotel. Now, where I come from (Las Vegas born and raised), we don't let a hotel build unless there is enough parking ON SITE to accommodate EVERYONE. It may be a parking garage, but you WILL find parking. How can a hotel build without enough parking? If that is the problem of course. I think they just want to earn just a bit more per night than they advertise. The manager was summoned when I told him the fee was not advertised on the Hotel's website and he told me basically take-it-or-leave-it. When we checked into our room, we found that about an hour later, he sent some sort of gift basket up with a note stating that he had spoken to his congressional representative and miraculously had his boss call the \"parking company's\" boss and they worked it out where I only had to pay one night parking. Now I would expect this fee if in NY or SF or someplace with a huge amount of high density, but SD? If you're gonna do this, put it on your website. And, 7 months later, guess what, it's still not on their \"announcements\" page. The fees for pets and smoking and late check out are there, but nothing about parking. Sooo, as you can tell, this tainted our stay from the beginning and unfortunately made for a bad stay in a beautiful hotel.

In this economy, I've seen other hotels cut back on service and little details that make a difference, but not this one, and for that I give them huge props. Shout out to Melissa H at the front desk and Michael O in the Spa, but really everyone we talked to was great. Not sure where some people get the idea that W hotels have snobby attitude? If you are elite in the SPG program, this hotel again shines in terms of recognizing and treating Gold and Platinum members. There are few suites in this hotel, but an upgrade to a Kool Corner is appreciated. These are great rooms, with a good set-up of space, views and a cool bathroom, complete with seperate tub. The white wood blinds are a nice touch, and give the hotel a modern yet comfortable feel. So does the stuffed beach ball pillow on the bed. Late check-out as SPG elite was happily given, unlike some SPG properties that grumble or ask you to \"check back day of departure\". I felt the desk staff were genuine in terms of offering help & suggestions, rather than going through the motions of standard check-in. The Acura guy was always available, and seemed almost dissapointed that we never used the service as we had rides from friends or were going to places within walking distance. It's a great service that helps set the W apart from generic hotels. If I had to quibble about anything it's the pool is a bit small, and set-in among parts of the hotel walls so it's not all sunny, nor lots of room to sit. The \"beach\" is kind of adjacent upstairs from the pool and does have more room to catch some sun, but too bad they can't combine that with the pool.

Last year I had a very nice stay, however it has gone down hill from there. I stayed here for one night and will have to return for another two nights next week because of it being our preferred corporate hotel. I was supposed to spend 6 nights there total, but was able to cut it short. The hotel is located on B Street which is a short walk to little italy and a short walk to the gaslamp quarter. It is also about a mile away from the I-5 interstate which made its location ideal. The hotel does not have a large drop area in the front of the hotel which made it difficult to unload. With that being said, I had been traveling for over two weeks and had two suitcases, some other bags and a computer bag....So I definitely could have used assitance with my luggage. Unfortunately there was no one there to greet me and assist me. I unloaded all my bags myself and packed the luggage cart and wheeled it in to the lobby when finally someone helped me. Not what I expected from the W. Checking Josh Goldberg was very helpful and he later assisted me when leaving early, He was very polite, understanding and competent. The hotel has valet parking for $32 per night. A rip off, there is a parking lot across the street which I think is $15 a day. The room I had was nothing special. Bathroom is small, room is just average size. There is a desk with internet but no outlets nearby to plug in my laptop...not well designed. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. I left for the work day at 730am and returned to my hotel around 2pm. My room was still dirty and had not been cleaned by the housekeeping staff. This annoyed me because I wanted to return to a clean room with clean towels etc.... The hotel has a small pool and gym. Sufficient for a business hotel, but if your on vacation in San Diego and want to lay poolside, your going to want to stay at a different hotel. The restaurant Rice is ok. I had a very good ceviche and a decent steak. It is not a bad food option for business travelers as every table there was a table of 1 including myself. I would rather check out the Gaslamp Quarter. Overall I will not stay at this hotel again after my stay this upcoming week. The hotel is operating in bankruptcy and it shows. The service has diminshed significantly. I will check out the US Grant Hotel next time in San Diego. The Westin Gaslamp is also a solid hotel choice.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, Ca", "Title": "\u201cSexy style and luxury... and pricey drinks!\u201d", "Author": "stacygirl_2000", "ReviewID": "UR46228676", "Content": "I LOVE the W.

Upon arriving the staff was extremely helpful and cheerful. The disaster started once my family and I were trying to leave. Because our train did not leave until 4pm, we checked out of our room at 12pm and left them with the baggage department at the hotel so that we could enjoy San Diego for the afternoon and then come back to pick them up before our train departed. We handed our three bags to a staff member and received three tags. When we returned at 315 to collect our bags, we handed the three tags to the staff member who returned with only two bags. Naturally, the missing bag was the one with my work laptop. Despite numerous efforts of the staff members to locate the lost bag they could not find it. I myself went into the poorly organized luggage room and could not locate it. We spent half an hour trying to find the lost luggage and had to leave so that we could catch our train. What is particularly interesting about this situation is that there was a gentlemen in front of me who was going through the exact same problem and had to leave as well to catch the 4pm train. He was missing a bag with his laptop as well. I gave the hotel my information and left on the train. That night I called the hotel to see if there was an update and was advised to file a police report. For the first three days the management staff was excellent about updating me with news on this situation but then they seriously dropped the ball after that. It has been a week since this incident has happened and I have not heard from management in three days on how they plan to fix this.

We can see that some people would absolutely LOVE this place. We were not two of those people, but we got an excellent priceline name your own price, which made it worth it to us. More detail: we are a couple, aged 49 and 40, professional, not stuffy, but neither of us drinks or parties much. (If you like the idea of drinking so much you end up spending $800 a night on a bar tab with a couple of friends, this is the place for you! Each of the three mornings we ate in the restaurant, EACH of the parties around us talked of nothing else but their drinking, how to get more drinks, where to go for drinks, how much they spent on drinks, what their favorite drink is, etc.) If you like Very Loud music--club music--you will love the beach and the bar at night. We wore earplugs and still it was louder than Burning Man. (If you have been there, you know what we mean.) Others there seemed to be enjoying it, though. We thought the design of the hotel was impressive--more my husband's style than mine (it is very modern and masculine--that is, hard surfaces, chrome, glass, monochromatic with a splash of blue). I felt uncomfortable walking across the lobby--it just feels empty, and I don't mean that literally--and, as others have mentioned, Very Uncomfortable in the elevators. They are very dim, chrome, claustrophobic, and you need to insert a key in order for them to work, so you are standing there with the door closed waiting to do that in this strange metal container. We liked our room; yes, we also got water all over the floor in the bathroom while taking a shower no matter what we did, and thought it strange that there was no bathtub. But again, it seems the W was built for masculine men and women who probably don't like to take baths. :0) The soaps, etc., were replenished (Bliss) and we loved them. We had a great housekeeper. The room was spotless. Anything above the 4th floor and on the opposite side of the hotel from the beach is quiet; our room was quiet with windows that open a little for air. We thought Rice had really good food, and enjoyed the happy hour 1/2 price food in the bar during the weekday afternoons (the cheese plate was excellent, as were the fries). The playful names of dishes on the menu were a nice touch. The gym and pool are ridiculously small, though, for a 4 star hotel. I've stayed in some hotels where the hot tub is as big as this pool. None of this is the current management's fault--most of our complaints are really design issues, but they do have a big impact when you are staying somewhere for several nights on vacation.

It was very, very far from perfect. I encountered many maintainence and cleanliness issues during my 4-night stay at the W. The staff put on a show of caring about these issues, but I did not feel that they were being genuine. Here's what they did right... - The hotel is very hip and trendy. They obviously put a lot of thought and effort into the decor. But, they will need to renovate every few years to keep up with the super-trendiness. - The location is good. You are within walking distance of pretty much everything in downtown San Diego. The only time I used a cab was to get to and from the airport. Apparently, they have a car service??? I was not made aware of this during my stay. - Room service was friendly and prompt, but a little on the pricey side. But, hey, it's room service. It's a luxury. Here's what they did wrong... - I had a huge issue with the cleanliness of my room (too disgusting to mention here) during my first night. I can deal with a lot of things, but this was truly gross. I asked to be moved to a different room, but they said they were full. They promised to change the bedding and sanitize the room. They also promised to add 5000 Starwood points to my account. When I returned to my room later in the day, the bedding had indeed been changed, the carpet seemed to have been cleaned, and there was a bottle of wine with an apology note on my desk. But, as of today, they still have not added the points to my account. This whole ordeal made me take a closer look at everything in my room and I noticed a lot of things that were wrong. - The cordless phone and one of my bedside lamps did not work. I told management about it and they were fixed. - The backsplash on the bathroom sink remained dirty for my entire stay. - One of the slats on the window blinds was broken. - I had a rug in the bathroom for the first day. This was taken away and not replaced for the rest of my stay. - I had to ask for washcloths on the second day. There were none left by the maid. - There was one bar of soap that I transferred between the sink and the shower for my entire stay. - Cigarette burns on the carpet of a non-smoking room. - The toilet would run intermittently throughout the day and night. - There is no door on the shower. The setup looks cool, but it's not practical. I had to wipe a puddle of water off the floor after every shower. - I was overcharged for a beer I ordered with my room service meal. - There is no newspaper. I actually enjoy reading the USA Today that most hotels provide free of charge. - There was a moldy smell in the hallway. It must have been in my room too. I didn't notice it while I was there, but my clothes all smelled like it when I got home and unpacked. - The pool and gym are teeny-tiny. - The side of my nightstand had some kind of grime crusted on one corner. I realize that some of my complaints are nit-picky, and most of these are things that I would normally overlook. But... When you're paying what amounts to be a car payment for each night, every detail should be attended to. Granted, most of these issues probably could have been handled with a phone call to the front desk. But, frankly, I just didn't want to deal with the elitist attitude I got from some of the FOH staff. I am in the service industry (restaurants, not hotels) and I would not have tolerated any of this from my staff. Of course, the initial blame should land upon the staff who fail to do their jobs correctly. But, ultimately, it is management's fault for letting things go.

We had to yell at check-in because of the music in the lobby. I left my car with the valet because there apparently is no lot in the building. They parked it outside across the street, which I could have done myself and saved the $33/day. There were several bottles of wine in the room, along with a welcome card and a list of the prices of all the snack goodies. So is the big bottle of wine free or not? It wasn't clear, so we called the desk and they didn't know either. Turns out it was meant to be free but it remained unconsumed. I like the cool way they change the mat in the elevator to say \"good morning\" or \"good afternoon\", but I would have been more impressed if the wattage of the elevator lights had been sufficient to read the elevator signs. If they're going to spend the big bucks for LED's better be sure they illuminate the area. You have to use your room key to push a button to go to your room, but it's so dim you can't easily see where to put your key in time to prevent the elevator from going off on another call. I imagine that the lights are so dim that they violate safety code. While San Diego is trying desperately to conserve water, the showers at the W allow you to control only the temperature, not the flow. Do you want that 50 GPM shower water hot or cold? If San Diego runs out of water, I know who to blame. Then there's the matter of wi-fi. They charge a lot for in-room access, which is inexcusable for a modern hotel, especially for SPG members, but it is free in the lobby, which no one tells you. The pool is too small to turn around, so I wonder why they bothered. The clock in the room is analog, which I guess is supposed to be retro-cool, but at night it was not legible. I can't recall seeing an analog clock in the last 20 years. Finally while I'm griping, I have to note that on our first day the room was not cleaned until sometime after 4pm.

My criticism of the hotel is as follows: 1. The lighting (lobby, elevator, room) is dim everywhere; 2. The hotel room was small, the bathroom was really not up to the standard of a nice hotel, and the room was showing signs of wear (chipped paint, spots on walls and carpet, dirty room service menu); 3. The walls to the hotel were very thin and you could here everything from the next door room, thankfully we were on a corner and had only one shared wall; 4. The hotel turns into a nightclub, at least on Saturday, and besides having to walk back through the lobby with men ogling my rather pretty (in my humble opinion) teenager girls, the thump thump thump of the blaring music kept us up late into the night - and our room was on the 13th floor.

The lobby is very modern and chic, but the internet was average at best. Worse still, the rooms only offered wired internet. Why do hotels still insist on charging for internet!?!?!?!?!? I know it is a huge revenue stream, but c'mon, it's robbery! Believe it or not, the wi-fi I stole from the rooftop \"Beach\" bar was better than anything else I had encountered in the property. It was, however, a nice touch for the managers to roll out the Wii system for happy hour in the lobby. We did breakfast in the restaurant a few times and suffered through very slow service. The food was excellent, and our server tried his best, but the wait killed the experience. On our last night, we came back to the hotel and attended a party hosted by some of our colleagues. The W staff was attentive and entertaining, and they did a great job transforming the venue into a very upscale night club. Overall, the W is a great brand that caters to a young, affluent crowd.

The restaurant is excellent and there is a night-club in the building which had very classy clientele and appeared to be very popular. I arrived at the check-in area which shares space with a bar with very loud music (on a Friday night). The check-in took about 40 minutes. The staff seemed to take an enormous amount of time with each guest as they chatted away while other people were standing in line. Rooms were not ready even at 6pm. There were a few disgruntled travelers waiting for a room and becoming short with the staff. The loud music also made it very difficult to communicate with the reception staff. It was very important that I had 4pm late-checkout the next day and I was told it was no problem because there were plenty of rooms. However, the next day, I was disturbed no less than 5 times via door knocks and phone calls as to why I hadn't checked out. Check-out took about 20 minutes because the receptionist could not work out how to add a mini-bar charge to the bill. Eventually she disappeared into the back-office and 10 minutes later another appeared and I had to start all over again; the first one decided it was simply too hard and gave up! The second receptionist apologised and said #1 should never have been at the front-desk because she was not trained. The hotel has a 'hip' and 'anything is ok' attitude but they really should just hide their beads and get the job done rather than trying to live up to a 'fun' brand. Even the 'concierge' couldn't seem to arrange a taxi, and instead stood on the corner trying to wave one over. I ended up doing it myself.

Instead of cool and cutting-edge, it now feels dated and in need of refreshing. To start with the positive, all of the staff have been courteous and professional. It's unfortunate that their politeness is not enough to make this hotel a worthwhile place to stay. The hotel did not honor my request of a high-floor room far from the elevator (even though it was made both through my travel agent at the time of booking and AGAIN with a same-day call the morning of check-in). Instead, I was placed on the fourth floor in the room ADJACENT to the elevator, low enough that I could hear the constant music playing in the lobby. When I complained, I was told the only other available room in the whole hotel was a smoking room. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but when I was dispatched to this room, I was appalled. The room smelled as though 50 people had been chain-smoking in their all night long. There were burns on the carpet and duvet, in addition to chipped paint on the desk and black scuff marks all over the wall. The room was so filthy I wouldn't have taken off my shoes, never mind slept in the bed. Another call, this time to the manager. Finally, I was place in a room on a high floor, and while it's fine, it's absolutely NOT worth the price. The music that blasts from the lobby 24/7, the pitch-black elevators that are reminiscent of an 80's strip club, and the trying-too-hard-to-be-trendy-but-not-trying-at-all-to-comfortable rooms make this a hotel best enjoyed by those under 25.

Before arrival, saw that I'd been upgraded to a Cool Corner Room (on account of SPG status). This was a welcome upgrade as I'd stayed in a Wonderful Room before and they are, to say the least, quite cramped. Cool Corner Rooms are a great deal more spacious - both the room itself and the bathroom (which has ample counter/sink space, a large soaking tub and a large walk-in shower, Bliss bath products that they restocked daily). I did arrive a couple of hours early and so my room wasn't ready. They did offer a Wonderful Room that was available but I chose to wait an hour or so for the Cool Corner to be ready. Lobby isn't a bad place to sit back and chill and wait. The lobby was being remodeled and so the entrance in to the property had been moved over a bit on B Street. Some signs of the remodel around (curtained-off areas, different layout) but they've done a fairly good job of making it as subtle as possible and even possibly undetectable to someone not already familiar with the property. Bit of a bonus, IMHO, to the remodel is that the lobby bar wasn't around. Returning to your hotel to a packed, club-like atmosphere in the lobby with a bunch of hipsters boozing it up all loud and rowdy can get quite old, especially when you're in town on business. And so I liked returning to and leaving from a quieter, more subdued lobby. As for the Cool Corner Rooms (beyond the bathroom), there is a well-stocked minibar, LCD TV with a decent channel selection and quite the expansive PPV selection, good workspace/desk, DVD player, iPod docking station (which also comes in handy for charging your iPhone!), a lounger and ottoman, and very comfy bed with pillows I can't help but want to steal everytime I stay at a W. I do wish the chair at the desk was more comfy than stylish as the lack of wireless in the room (though there is wired high speed internet for about $13/day) confines you to the desk when working and the chair gets old fast. There is plenty of space to spread out and let all your stuff spread out, as well (a few more drawers would help, though, as I like to unpack everything when I check in to a room rather than live out of my suitcase. There are a number of drawers around, but spread out and in the nightstands or bottom of the closet, rather than a single, well-placed dresser). Valet service was decently prompt when I'd call down ahead of time to have my car brought up (though one time, the call didn't do much good and I had to remind the valet once downstairs). Room service was prompt and tasty. Maid service was good, as well. Very helpful staff, from check-in to check-out and at all times in between. I guess I'm old at heart because, though well within the W's target age demographic, I like my hotel to be relaxed and chill rather than rowdy and crazy. W's are known for lively bar scenes in the lobby and I usually just put up with that because I'm fond of the other aspects of the hotels. So this trip was particularly nice for me on account of the lack of the lobby bar due to the remodel. Though there is still the bar on the 2nd floor and you can expect, if getting in to the elevator at night, to have to put up with a few seconds of drunk and annoying people sharing the elevator with you as they go to and from the bar. Can't win em all :) All in all, though, a nice property and very convenient to airport and good parts of town (though this can be said for most places in SD proper).

After I fought my way through the people to get to the elevators and finally figured out that I needed to use my key card to access any floor above 3, my frustration continued because I could hear the music up the entire elevator ride through floor 13. I was very relieved when I got out of the elevator and the music had finally faded. The size of my room wasn't anything spectacular, but the beds were wonderful!!! I hadn't had that nice of a sleep in months! My most favoriate part of the hotel, though, were the unique decorations and sundries. As I unpacked my bags and checked out the room, my mood quickly shifted from frustration and wanting to run to happiness and wanting to see what other cute things they could think of. The lighting was a bit to get used to, but every where you looked, the W thought of some cute way to \"tag\" items. An example was the little pencil on the night stand -- it said something like, 'Write down your idea.' Kind of corny, but different which made me smile constantly. The staff were also incredible! One of the ladies in our meeting rode up the elevator with one of the staff; they had a small conversation about the lady's recent cold still lingering; and the staff member sent her up some soup on the house. What an awesome touch! That's the Ritz example of empowerment for the customer!!! All the small unique touches turned me into a huge fan of this hotel!!

I guess, if you think hip means a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd twenty-somethings. We did not get it. To us it just came across as a bad Club.

In daytime, can walk to places \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good 4-5 blocks to Gaslamp or Bay. Little Italy close (but we did not go). At night, not really unsafe, but pretty dead in area.

Rooms: SUCH comfy beds, great music (a free CD that you get to keep is a nice touch), and excellent products by Bliss. I also like that you have to use your hotel key to access the hotel floors. Very clean all around. Windows open just a bit for a nice breeze at night. Very quiet. Food: We sat at the pool and ordered food from the downstairs bar/restaurant. Veggie quesadillas and mint julips! Sounds like a gross combination, but separetly, they were wonderful. Scene: Beach Bar is super fun, as is the lobby bar area. You don't need to leave the hotel for nightlife. Great brew pub right around the corner- I think it's called Carl Strauss- if you like sports and beers. Cons- No auxilary i pod connection to the clock radios. Also, if you want to hit the gas lamp district, you have to take a cab. TIP- if you go out prior to 8PM, there is a possibility that you will be able to take the \"house\" towncar. It's free, but give Tim (the driver) a big tip! He is wonderful.

It sparked my interest after seeing the hotel being featured on the Travel Channel's 'Great Hotels'. I was drawn by the beachy theme & fun, bright colors watching the show, & the real thing was just as great! The hotel itself was a little obscure to find as the building itself isn't too tall, & parking is hard to find (there is valet parking @ the hotel entrance, & parking for a fixed daily fee in the periphery of the building). The check-in was easy, and a bellman helped us with our bags as we entered the disco mirrored elevator, that can only be used with a hotel room key. We had a Wonderful Room on the hotel's top floor, so our views were lovely. I thought the most interesting parts of the room included the chalkboard on the wall area (my bf & i wrote love notes to each other in) & the modern design of the restroom. The shower had a clear glass partition that was engiously designed to be just open enough not to spill water everywhere. But the absolute BEST thing about the room was the BED!!! It was one of the most comfortable beds you could ever sleep on! In fact, the day after, my bf & i even overslept past our already late checkout @ 2 pm (we had the 'Feel the Wuv' package), just because the bed eases you to sleep in a matter of seconds! We also explored other aspects of the hotel. We ate dinner @ Rice, their restaurant. And since it was a weekday (Wednesday), we were one of the first to be seated, and for a long while, were the only customers in the place! The food was great though!!! I would definitely recommend the Braised Kobe Short Ribs for you meat eaters out there!!! And the pricing wasn't too bad at all for a 4 star hotel, at less than $30 per entree. And the most awesome part of dinner were our free desserts from our super nice waitress. I had mentioned on our reservation that it was our 2 year anniversary, so they made our desserts complimentary!!! We decided to try 2 things (try the Really Good Freakin' Chocolate Cake <- that's what it's actually called!), & were happily surprised to see that BOTH were free!!! We then checked out the rooftop bar, Beach, the same night, & had fun listening to good contemporary pop music while sitting next to the bonfire, or cuddling in your very own cabana. Our romance package came with champagne, & it was delivered to our room with chocolate covered strawberries & 2 bottles of champagne on ice! The following day, we had a run in their treadmills equipped with mini tvs & headsets while you exercise (with complimentary water & towels), & this gym overlooked the very cute pool (that was only 4 1/2\" at its deepest, but that didn't stop us from swimming in it : ). Then we had a couple of treatments at their Away Spa at a very special half-off rate (Feel the Wuv), & we both had a fantastic, very relaxing time. My boyfriend had the Muscle Massage metro man service, as i had the Sweet Temptation body treatment. They even offer you a private room with tea & magazines while waiting for your appointment. Both 60 treatments cost less than 1 regular spa treatment at less than $130! The front desk was also very helpful. We got extra toiletries (their Bliss products are awesome!), & they suggested a cute French cafe for lunch just a short couple blocks away from the hotel that also had a nice bakery. Overall, our stay at the W San Diego was very pleasant. Just make sure to check-in with a credit card that has a high balance (over $700 for a less than $400 room), & prepare to pay outrageous fees for valet parking ($28 for an overnight stay), but besides those negatives, this boutique hotel is an overall nice stay for a short getaway.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cA Cool, Fun, Hip and Young Hotel\u201d", "Author": "thekld", "ReviewID": "UR8697355", "Content": "I stay in a lot of Starwoods because I think they have one of the best rewards programs.

This is a given in all Ws which, I believe, all use the \"Hevenly Bed.\" I love this bed, it is pillowed topped and has nice linens and a huge (and heavy) down comforter. It is so comfortable. I was so impressed with this bed the first time I stayed at a W in 2002 that I actually bought one. So its nice to have the same bed in the hotel that I enjoy every night at home. 2. The room. My room was bright and airry with beatiful blue-and-tan color scheme. Very beachy in apparence. It had a beautiful widndow seat covered in cool and funky pillows with wooden shutters and a great view of the city. I especially liked the pillow that looked like a beach ball but complimented the color scheme of the room. 3. The lobby and bar. Its huge and very inviting. Its also very fun, lots of cozy couch and seats to sit in and enjoy the music, and the whole club-like bar scene that goes on in this lobby. Very fun, enegetic and young but also very loud. The second floor overlooking the lobby also has cool places to sit and hang out and people-watch the entire lobby while enjoying a cocktail. 4. The bar on the second floor. Its outside, it has a beach theme with sand, fire pits and cabanas. Very cool evening scene. Lots of fun, friendly wait staff and a really nice place to hang and enjoy a drink or three. NEUTRALS: 1. The bell staff and front desk was average, no one really stood out they kind of just did their job. 2. Location. If your going to stay in San Diego to visit the Gaslamp District at night this hotel is a bit of a walk to the main drag of bars and restaurants. 3. Price. I believe I paid $229/night booked through spg.com. While this is a little on the high side I felt it was worth it. NEGATIVES: 1. The elevators. Extremely SLOW! Maybe I'm impatient but waiting two or three minutes for an elevator to show up on your floor is excessive. 2.

One of the worst experiences ever, especially considering this is supposed to be a renowned, botique hotel. First discovered that you can't self-park; good thing is that there is valet, which is free. Arrived at the hotel at 2:30pm, told our 2 rooms were not available yet, would only be a \"few\" minutes & that they would call us when they were ready. A \"few\" minutes turned into 3 hours!! Every half hour, we would check in at the front desk (we spent our time waiting at the bar) and were told that the rooms were not ready yet. After much prodding, first we were told that that the hotel was overbooked because of rooms booked thru Expedia & that the people who had booked for 2 nights (Saturday thru Monday) were only supposed to be there 1 night, while the hotel itself booked those \"available rooms\" to people who called the hotel directly. Then, we were told the rooms were not ready yet because they were still being cleaned. We were offered a couple of \"free drink\" tickets for the bar to compensate for the wait. They finally gave us $50 off per room. I also found it odd that since the W hotel is part of the Starwood chain hotels, that they did not offer to check with another Starwood hotel, like the Westin to see if they could accomodate us. After talking with a few people, I also found out that the people in the hotel lobby which was literally crowded (could barely find an empty seat) was filled with people because they were also waiting for their rooms. While at the bar, we also ordered some appetizers, which arrived 45 minutes later because 30 minutes after we first ordered, the bartender told us that the kitchen \"accidentally\" did not put in the order; our compensation...a free drink. The rooms themselves were so small; dorm room-style, actually. Floors in both rooms were smelly & damp, like they just steam-cleaned the carpets or something. The windowsill couch had stains on them. When we called for 4 extra towels and a white bedsheet (not the itchy beige blanket), it took 1 hour to arrive and we only got 2 towels and the itchy blanket of course. Apparently the hotel did not have \"any runners\" available that day and the manager was doing all the runs, which I find extremely ridiculous because 1) this is supposed to be a high-end hotel where you expect excellent customer service; 2) I find it odd that a hotel does not have anyone working in the housekeeping department at that time; 3) it was a weekend and especially Labor Day weekend, a holiday weekend, where you expect hotels are usually busy especially in a popular city like San Diego. So, more excuses there. We did receive complimentary cookies and milk with a note apologizing us for not being able to book the 2 rooms next to each other or at least on the same floor (1 room was on the 13th floor, the other on the 12th), unfortunately only 1 room got these cookies, the other room \"lucked out.\" I will definitely warn people to stay away from the W unless there are no other nice hotels to stay at and they don't mind waiting for hours to get something.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Segundo, California", "Title": "\u201cParty Hotel\u201d", "Author": "11Alexander", "ReviewID": "UR8655494", "Content": "PLUS: Ask for Matthew the Concierge, he is the main reason I would return to this hotel.

One of the first things you're likely to notice as you drive over from the airport is that you're only a block away from the courthouse and county jail. Some of the streets along the way to the Gaslamp district are lined with Bail Bond shops (and drunk / cracked out homeless people). The safest way to get to Gaslamp is to walk down the street from the W is on State Street and then make a left at Broadway. As many of the other reviews have noted, the W is absolutely not for everyone (specifically, families with kids of any age, people over 40, etc.). The average age of the staff appears to be in the mid-20's, and I believe this is the clientele the W is catering to: young people with massive disposable incomes. If you fit in the demographic though, you're very likely to love the stylish decor. The lobby has a 2 - 3 story atrium overlooking a bar area that gets cleared out weekend nights for DJ's to spin music. The \"Beach\" rooftop bar is accessible from the 2nd floor. The elevators are surprisingly dark, lit only by some dim LED lights. We were given a room on the 13th floor (nope, we weren't superstitious). No room upgrade or anything extra for having a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold card (and we arrived at 1 or 2 p.m.; maybe this W doesn't care about loyal SPG customers?). We were able to get a slightly later checkout set for 2:30 p.m., though. The room itself was very stylish. A huge king bed with soft (350-thread count) sheets. A ledge in front of the window has a day bed/cushion where one can lounge there and read or do whatever. The downside to our room was that the carpet appears to have seen better days (definite stains and wear & tear), and the in-room air conditioning unit was really good at keeping one wall cool, but the rest of the room felt stuffy or warmer. The bathroom shower has a European-style window covering half the shower area, with a porthole in the middle so water can still spew out onto the floor depending on how close you are to the shower nozzle. The shower knob controls only the temperature, not the flow of the water. As another review noted, the toilet paper holder is not next to you, it'll be a twist and a reach behind you. Instead of some art or print, I liked the chalk board in the room. Perhaps this room was designed to host weddings and bachelorette parties. Combined internet / local and long distance calls are $25... a rip off, when compared to Marriott's typical $10 all inclusive rate at their resorts and hotels. Internet access (by itself) is $13 for 24 hours. Parking is $28 per day now. If everything you're doing is within San Diego, forget the car and take a cab to & from the airport and around town (or bicycle cab, they hang out in front of the entrance, too). You'll save quite a bit of dollars that way. The attached restaurant, Rice, serves very delicious dinners, but just as in the hotel lobby, there's ubiquitous stylish music in the restaurant as well. We were seated right underneath a speaker so that was a wee bit distracting. Overall, I thought this was a very unique & stylish place to stay, I'm glad I did it this one time, but I don't think I would stay here again. but if you're not doing Priceline or some other super deal, hold onto your wallet, this place is likely to drain a lot of cash. For our two day stay, plus parking and one night's dinner at RICE, my bottom line bill was just over $750.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa Monica", "Title": "\u201cCold\" not \"Cool\u201d", "Author": "TravelforFun28", "ReviewID": "UR8233951", "Content": "I have stayed at most of the W properties in the US and I have to say that the W San Diego was by far the most disapointing.

I know what the W is known for and won't comment on that. Unfortunately, the W San Diego did not meet my expectations of a hotel in general. These were my problems: ROOM I didn't receive my comp upgrade because I'm an SPG Gold member...but i didn't really expect it since I arrived at 7pm. We arrived in our non-smoking room only to find it reeking of smoke. Yes I'm one of those sensitive people who get instant headaches from smoke smell. After a long drive in traffic form LA, the migraine started. We were told the smoking rooms are only on level 5. That's nce and all but I'm not imagining this. The Whatever/Whenever girl came upstairs and said she thought it was ridiculous and she's a smoker. The offered to ionize the room to get rid of the smell (30minutes) or wait for a clean room. We tried the ionize first since they couldn't give us a time frame for a clean room. it didn't work. They had also cleaned a room I suppoe in that 30 minutes because we were moved to another room. Smelled great. We go out to the club, come back, ROOM REEKS OF SMOKE. We thought we were going crazy. The W couldn't move us at 2am and we didn't want to since we had unpacked everything. They could only offer us a candle. So my morning was miserable because I had the headache from smoke, the fragrant candle, and the wine I drank the night before. They didn't have any tylenol on hand but they would get it for a $12 fee plus the tylenol cost. i decided to let it heal naturally. They finally moved us the next day to another room. This one was good to go and we remained there for the rest of the weekend. The shower drained clogged as well but we were tired or the issues. we could not be in the room until 3pm. which leads me to what we did during the late morning and afternoon. POOL I foolishly booked a hotel with intentions to bask in the sun by the pool when the hotel website never showed a direct image of the pool area. The pool is ridiculously small. There were only 7 lounge chairs. We took sick pleasure in watching guests come into the pool area and look puzzled...bewildered. it was really funny because we did the same thing. Of course all the chairs were taken because there are only 7. They try and trick you too by putting tall mirrors on the adjacent wall so it looks like there are 2 mini pools. It was also funny to see people walk that way and realize the people they see were themselves. This was all funny because we did the same thing :) The poolside service was slow and we needed to remind the server that we wanted menus, that we ordered food, that we needed water. I don't know why she just didn't right stuff down. There were some annoying kids in the pool too...it was extra annoying since you couldn't slink away to a corner of the ppol and be to yourself. The pool was too small. Annoying kids....not hotels fault...small pool...hotel's fault. So we left the pool to go get a quickie massage. SPA Very small as well...don't expect a great spa experience. My girl Jennifer/Jessica was very relaxing...which was good since I needed it. But again...don't expect more than a nice treatment...no real amenities here. Did we eat at the W? yes we did FOOD 1) Rice was great on decor. we had breakfast. It was pricey but that's typical of a hotel. I enjoyed it but my order was messed up the first go round. I don't know why waiters like to test themselves by not writing things down. But i really did like my breakfast. 2) poolside food was good. we had the kobe mini burgers and they were great. the sexy fries...not so much...skip those unless you need the kill a fry urge. the chicken wings were ok...but im not a big fan of sweet flavors...but my friends liked them. we had an issue getting our dessert. it wasn't on the pool menu but they said we could have whatever whenever from the regular menu...guess that's not really true. the pool girl kept coming back and saying \"let me check on it\" an hour later when we needed to leave for our massages, she said the cook never started it. ????? very strange...i don't know how she didn't realize this. 3) in room dining was ok. the best thing was teh banana creme brulee. the grilled cheese with tomato and basil wasn't melted. the crab snadwich was good. too much bread though. 4) bar drinks were good. they carry Effen black cherry vodka which is a good vodka. I mix it with diet coke. We tried the Kiss N Fly and Porn Star...both pleasant. I preferred the Kiss N Fly. The GOODS All this being said...this is how the W compensated for their shortcomings: 1) sweet bellman (Welcome Ambassador) Eric. He was there for all our room changes, check in, and check out. He might have requested that so we saw a friendly face. But I'm glad he got our tip money. 2) they W comped us one night (as they should have). we didn't ask for it. they gave it when we needed to change rooms for the 3rd time. but if they didn't, i was gonna ask. 3) the pool girl gave us 2 free drinks for the dessert issue 4) the W gave us 3 free drinks the first night while we waited to have our room ionized. 5) they smiled through every issue even though it felt like they wanted us to go back home.

It is not in the middle of really anything else, although it is convenient walking distance to Horton Plaza and the Gaslamp District. It is also minutes away from the freeway (5). Although the motif is perhaps getting a little dated, it is a trendy hotel, like the other W's. It is well done and not simply an old Holiday Inn that has been fixed up with some funky linens and lighting. Starwood has a whole range of other properties designed for families and more conventional business travelers - stay at them if you don't like loud music (in the lobby) or the fact that the hotel plays up this \"nightclub\" atmosphere. Like other W's, the hotel is very nicely done. Bliss products in the bathrooms and an attentive staff. I've stayed in both the standard and the corner rooms - the corner rooms are great with a bigger bathroom and a soaking tub. During my recent stay I had several interactions with the staff and they were very positive. The thing I like about the W is that it is close enough to everything in downtown without being too close to the other convention hotels. It is a bit of an oasis from the typical big property. Given the proximity to the freeway, you can be in Coronado in 10 minutes and Mexico in 15. The food is excellent and Beach is a great bar (although it gets a bit crowded Friday and Saturday nights).

As a frequent traveler, I take hotel stays very seriously and I have high expectations, especially for 4 and 5 star hotels which charge over $300/night. We should have known what we were in for when we arrived at the valet and there was nobody there. Finally after driving in circles around the property we spotted someone and flagged him down. Once inside the hotel, we thought it was decent, your typical hipster hotel ala the Standard or Viceroy hotels in LA. Since I have stayed at the W before in other cities I assumed we would have a pleasant stay. Wow was I wrong. We were told the rooms were not ready and we should sit in the \"living room\" and have a drink (it was after 3 oclock - check in time). We complied and waited for almost an hour. I finally had to go say something to the girl at the desk. She could care less as she just said \"well sorry\" and giggled. I was appalled. They didn't even TRY to offer us a cocktail or something to appease us. Finally a very rude man came up and handed us a key without an apology for the wait. Not even a word spoken other than \"here.\" He didn't even have the decency to show us to the elevator. When we got in our room it reeked of smoke and the bedding was severly stained. We had a lovely view of a bum haven and noticed that the valet parks the cars in an uncovered, unsecured lot across the street.....for $26! The cocktail waitress told us that the in-house restaurant Rice and the rooftop bar Beach were the hot spots in the city and we should make plans to spend the evening in the hotel, so we did. We made reservations for 8:15 at Rice and set out for a walk around town (the only time during this trip without complaints....we were far away from the W). We came back to the hotel in hopes of getting ready for the evening. The shower was freezing cold. No hot water. We got ready and went to Rice. We were promptly seated though we had already order drinks in the lounge. We informed the hostess that we had ordered drinks so that she could alert the cocktail waitress. She never did and it took the poor waitress 20 minutes to locate us. We waited about 40 minutes from the time we were seated and never were approached by a waiter. I finally had to flag one down to REQUEST service. He was very apologetic and passed the blame onto the hostess. The food was so-so. Certainly nothing to rave about and most definitely nothing worth waiting 45 minutes for a waiter to serve us. After dinner we went up to the Beach bar. It was definitely NOT a hot scene. More remniscent of a high school kegger. We decided to call it a night. The next morning our bill was slipped under the door. Somehow on the bill was both our dinner charge and another charge for $133 from Rice. We had to call and haggle it out with the concierge. What a wake up call! We decided at that point to call our trip short and get out of there as soon as possible. Of course the valet took forever to retrieve our car...and we drove away from the W as fast as possible. I can say wholeheartedly that I will never stay at this hotel again and would never recommend it to friends. You'd probably have better luck at the Motel 6.

The immediate area around the W was also safe, but about two to three blocks east on B and C Street is the city jail/courthouse, with 24 hour bail bondsmen offices and some unsavory characters hanging around, including some homeless sleeping on the sidewalk. While we were not approached by anyone, we did step pretty quickly for the last couple blocks back from the Gaslamp Quarter. When I mentioned it to the doorman, he gave us a safer walking route to the Gaslamp area for the next night.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "holatamara", "ReviewID": "UR7372433", "Content": "The hotel was perfect for a conference visit.

First and foremost, it's important that you know what you're getting when you book a stay at a W hotel. This is not the Hyatt Regency. If you are looking for quiet, dimly lit oak bars, antique looking room furnishings or for anything conservative, you should look elsewhere. The W is all about being trendy from the lobby bar to the rooms to the staff. You're going to get bright, vibrant colors (in the San Diego W, it's a blue and yellow color scheme). If you have a problem with techno music, rock music or rap music, look elsewhere. If seeing people consume alcohol is an issue for you, look elsewhere. The W caters to a mostly hip, upscale crowd, business travelers and the like. Hotel: Many have said they had trouble with parking here but I had no issues. Hotel is all valet (maybe it wasn't in the past). You drive up, you get out, you hand the guy your keys, he hands you a ticket and you're done. Easy. Took me 30 seconds from driving up to having my bags out of the car and on my way. Decour is ultra-modern. Bright colors. Trendy lounge/bar on the first floor that shares space with the lobby. On weekend nights it will be crowded with well dressed hipsters drinking martinis. Gym and small pool on the 2nd floor. A few free weights but mostly cardio machines. The tredmills, bikes and elipticals all had in-console TVs and radios (and some of them even worked). Staff: If the cool college kids who live down the street bother you, so will the staff. I found them all nice and very helpful. When I called down for my car it never took more than 15 minutes for it to arrive. Room service was fast and polite. After being on the road for business for nearly two months straight, I didn't feel like leaving the room one night and the room servince menu didn't have what I wanted, so I called Whatever/Whenever and had them go pick me up some Thai food from a place a few blocks away. Had my food in 40 minutes (shorter than the room service wait on a Friday night) for a couple of extra bucks. Room: Great. A little small but that's typical with W rooms. Well decorated in bright blues and yellows. 36\" flat panel TV. DVD player in room if you brought movies with you or you can check them out from the hotel library. Excellent toiletries. Cant beat the lemon/sage body wash and lotion. Restaraunt/Bar: Three, three, three bars! Lounge bar is attached to the lobby and has a few stools and lots of couch/lounge space with games like chess, checkers, etc. This place is pretty popular and expensive. Magnet bar is down the hall and worth checking out. Beach bar is up from the pool on the 2nd floor past the pool and has a sand floor, fire pit, hanging chairs, and palm trees. It is usually packed in good weather. Was little chilly during my stay and I found the beach bar to have the funnest people and best bartenders in the hotel. Other: The W is not cheap. I travel for work, so I don't care because it all gets expensed. You are going to get hit up for everything here. Bottle of Voss water? Paying. Parking? 25 bucks a night. Internet access? 12 bucks a day. Pack of M&Ms from the mini-bar? 4 bucks. Be smart. Clean everything out of the mini-bar, stack it on top, and fill it with your own snacks and drinks. When you leave, put their stuff back in.

You're paying a lot per room, but absolutely nothing is included in that. They charge you for Internet access, water, snacks, even a first-aid kit. I don't expect everything to be given away, but to me when you're at a posh hotel, they should provide some things free of charge. It's just not classy to nickel and dime you for everything. I also found the service atrocious. My Internet connection wasn't working with their system and someone on the phone just kept telling me, \"go to Turbonet, go to Turbonet\" even though that wasn't useful and didn't work. The hair dryers in our rooms were horrible, literally the lowest end, smallest hair dryer you could imagine. What really killed me though was going to the restaurant, Rice, for breakfast.

Negatives - unbelieveably complicated thermostats that reset themselves in the middle of the night and can't be controlled manually by anyone with less than a PhD in electronics, not enough working machines in the \"gym\", a missed wake-up call, having to consistently wait 10-15 rings for someone to answer the whatever/whenever line.

Room service was prompt --- the food was presented nicely and was good but not excellent --- just what I would expect from room service --- although I found the menu to be a little limited. I did eat at Rice one morning for breakfast and my food was very good and very plentiful plus the service was appropriately friendly. I did not take time to enjoy the lobby (the Living Room), the bar (Magnet) or the outdoor space (Beach). I did peek in at the pool which is laughably small --- more like a plunge pool than anything else. The gym (Sweat) seemed well equipped as well. I did stop by Beach (with the warm sand floor) on Sunday evening after the race but did not stay as I didn't feel particularly comfortable alone but would definitely return with my spouse. Perhaps, the trendiness has died down, but I never experienced any overwhelming crowds. The location, for me, was ideal. Easy in/easy out for the airport and for the other locations I visited during my long weekend. I did not find the neighborhood to be unsafe or unsavory. It is a very short walk to the Horton Plaza, to the trolley stations and to the waterfront. For what it is worth, I did spend some time with friends who were staying at the Sheraton Marina and found that location, while convenient, was far from relaxing. I was much happier with my hotel selection. My one regret was on the morning of my check out as I truly was disappointed to be leaving and returning home to Boston.

We've both stayed in a lot of hotels, and I've stayed in 3 different W's. This was by far my favorite of those 3 W hotels and one of my most favorite hotels in general. I feel many of the negative reviews here are off-base, I'll explain further at the end of this review. First off, W hotels are modern-chic hotels with tasteful decorations, large lobby areas, luxurious rooms with extra comfortable bedding, and signature bars/restaurants. The San Diego location is no exception. The oversized multi-story lobby area is shared with a small bar and has lots of comfortable seating, and during the day projectors play different soothing scenes on the wall above the bar. The hotel is centrally situated a few blocks from the restaurant-filled \"Gaslamp district\" in one direction, a few blocks from the waterfront in another, and about 12 blocks from the highway in a third direction. Besides the Gaslamp area and the restaurants in the hotel, there are several small eateries in the area immediately around the hotel. The colors and decor of W San Diego are marine-themed and the bed and bedding were as comfortable as every other W I've been in. Luxurious fluffy down pillows, comforters, etc. A very nice bathroom, electronics, and furniture completed the effect. A small chalk board is a cute touch, and their loungey theme CD playing in the room when we walked in was also very nice. The multiple bars and lounges in the hotel are popular; we arrived on a Saturday night and the lobby lounge was full of beautiful lounge-goers drinking expensive cocktails. We felt underdressed and dirty in the travel garb we had been wearing for the last 8 hours but quickly showered and changed and joined the beautiful people for dinner and drinks ourselves. Service was impeccable. Very fast check-in, nice staff, polite and helpful valets and bartenders. The airy fitness center has an opening to the outside overlooking the pool and is available 24 hours. The latency of the in-room internet connection was very good as was its speed. Now, to address the complaints that make for the see-saw rating on this hotel. I feel some people don't bother to read what W is about before staying here, and expect red-suited bellhops and obsequious doormen for this price range. However, this hotel is catering to the clientele that doesn't want all of that, and instead wants fashionable, chic, modern, efficient, and beautiful. W hotels including this one are NOT old-style hotels with fawning staff and floral bedspreads. For that sort of ambience, look elsewhere. If \"hip\" is something you want to replace, rather than be, this isn't the hotel for you. A number of people have complained about lack of food in the immediate vicinity; these people apparently didn't go outside the hotel. There were at least 5 eateries within 1.5 blocks of the hotel, including Thai, and two deli/coffee-shops. The north end of the Gaslamp district is maybe a 10 minute walk away if you move slowly. The hotel's area is choice: not so close to the action as to be noisy, but close enough to get there quickly. All of the staff we dealt with were helpful, efficient, and pleasant. Absolutely no complaints from our stay. Minor quibbles with the hotel: - Really expensive valet parking ($35 a day or so), but it does give you in and out as often as you want. All the major downtown hotels in S.D. charge like this, so this isn't W's fault. There's cheaper self-park nearby, IF you plan to come and go only once a day. - Expensive food and drink. Not at all unexpected in a mainline hotel, and the drinks were normally priced for a lounge environment so not a quibble as much as an observation. - Restaurant food was good but uneven, some dishes were stand-out, others were pretty but uninspired. Not surprising in trendy restaurants, but be prepared. Breakfast was very substantial and very good.

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. Before I left I got e-mails both from the spa and the concierge asking if I needed anything, which I appreciated. The service at the hotel was just so-so. Check in was perfect. I didn't have to wait and the man at the front desk was great at highlighting the hotel amenities and verifying my personal preferences. However, other service was spotty. My second night I got a couple drinks in the Living Room while doing work and I practically had to get up and grab the waitress to come over. She also snatched my menu off the table, without asking, which bothered me since I had not closed out my bill and wanted another drink. VERY different from experiences I have had at Four Seasons' Bristol Lounge in Boston where the servers are excellent at making genuine small talk and meeting your every wish. There our waiter consistantly brought us an array of munchies as well as chocolate covered strawberries on the house. Nothing of the sort happened at the W. I also go no newspaper the second two days of my trip, which bothered me since the man at the front desk confirmed my newspaper preferences my first day. The survice was okay at rice. The waiter was prompt and made good recommendations, but there was nothing special about it. I guess that is my consensus. The service was good, but not excellent. However, I still had a great time because service isn't the be all and end all of vacations for me. Most importantly I wanted to enjoy the premise and especially my room which I did. The beds were heavenly, the ample desk space was perfect for a business traveller, and the atmosphere overall was pleasant. I also loved the Bliss products!! Everytime they were replenished daily I snatched them up to take them home!! My room was on the 7th floor at the end of the hallway and was very quiet. There was a bit of noise from one neighbor on my second night, but it wasn't any louder than what I would expect at the hotel. The thing that suprised me most about the hotel was that there was no hot tub! I was really looking forward to a relaxing soak after a long day of work. The pool however was great! There was no one in it when I went and it was suprisingly warm. I found the location to be fine. Is it surrouned by haute shops and flashy restaurants, no. But I wouldn't say it's in a bad neighborhood either. I'm a 20-something petite female and felt perfectly comfortable walking to the harbor and the Gaslight District. In fact I found a lot of shopping and restaurants close by. If you're used to city living or city traveling I don't think you'll find the short walks a problem. I also wasn't surprised by the price of the food, etc. When you stay at a hotel in this range I think it's to be expected. For example, the $9 Voss water is priced comparably in the restaurants I've been to in Boston (it's $5.50 a bottle at rice). It's more expensive to begin with than Evian or other brands. Room service is expensive wherever you go. I also found the food in rice to be appropriately priced. My Swordfish was just okay, but my organic mixed greens salad with manchego, dried strawberries, and pistachos was delish!

It was truly unlike any other hotel stay I'd ever experienced. It's one thing to stay in a nice hotel with an aiming-to-please concierge and staff, but if you couple that with some incredible nightlife at the hotel on top of the wonderful decor in the rooms, then, well, you've got a happening place. Such is the W in San Diego. One quick caveat to the previous reviewers who characterized the area as \"dead\" after working hours--this is not the case at all. The Gaslamp district is just six blocks away, which is either a ten to fifteen minute walk or a $4 cab ride. It's not like you're having to drive to La Jolla (twelve miles north) to find something to do. Sometimes it seems that people expect several restaurants, bars & shops within one block of a hotel. A tad bit unreasonable, eh? Also unreasonable: the previous reviewer who said that the exterior of the hotel was \"blah.\" First of all, who cares? And second of all, it was not \"blah.\" How many other hotels have a fifteen-story waterfall projected on the side of the building? At any rate, the hotel staff was amazing. With the exception of a phantom $23 minibar purchase (which was taken care of immediately) and a slight miscommunication with the hotel lining us up a ride to the airport, everything else was spot on. Do keep in mind that I'm part of the younger crowd, and that is what the W is angling for with their business plan. The interior is very modern and sleek, as are the rooms. The focal point of the rooms is a room-length desk (odd, but it works). The beds are extremely comfortable--down-filled pillowtop mattresses, fluffy pillows, soft sheets, the works. The most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in, bar none. The W Hotel also has a \"Whatever, Whenever\" service (just push the red button on the phone) that will pretty much get you \"whatever, whenever.\" Need a shaving kit at 4:00 a.m.? No problem. Want room service at any hour of the day or night? No problem. Need a reservation at a local restaurant, or need help in finding one? No problem. Need tickets to a local show or concert? No problem. The concierge guys (especially Chuck, who did an excellent job in securing us reservations), will go out of their way to find you what you need. One final thing to remember is that the hotel, on Friday & Saturday nights, essentially turns into a nightclub. The lobby, known as the \"Living Room,\" turns into a dance club complete with DJ (there's a bar at one end, opposite the front door). It was kind of odd on Friday night to watch people trying to check in amid the chaos of the dance club atmosphere. If you are a hotel \"resident,\" they will give you a wristband so that you don't have to stand in line to get up to the second-floor rooftop Beach bar. Beach is outside and is complete with sand and a copper fire pit and private cabanas. We spent a lot of time up there, just hanging out. We did not get around to checking out the restaurant Rice or the other bar in the hotel, Magnet. All in all, it was a great trip, and I'd definitely stay at the W San Diego again. Just keep in mind that it skews towards the younger crowd, although even though the lobby may be a raging dance club, you wouldn't know it in the rooms--completely silent.

The W Hotel in San Diego is, by far, one of the worst I've experienced in terms of service, atmosphere & curb appeal. First, the outside of the hotel, in the middle of a not so great location, is terrible. Ugly stucco colors on the high-rise portion which is attached to an older brick warehouse structure that houses the restaurant and snobby beach bar. The hotel is surrounded by nothing but low-rise office structures, parking lots and boarded up houses. Second, the beach bar, which is touted as a \"roof top\" bar is very misleading. It's on the third floor of the warehouse building, not the roof of the hotel - it offers no views what so ever, of dowtown, the ocean or neighborhood - nothing. And, the crowd that patronizes the bars, restaurant and living room in San Diego have a very over-inflated sense of self. Rude, katty, obnoxious, wanna-be twenty something girls with their fake sunglasses, fake purses and fake breasts throwing tantrums, chatting loudly on cell phones & playing the \"look at her, he said/she said\" gossip game. The crowd tends to be very clique-ish with many of the nicer, more friendly and social hanging out in the downstairs magnet bar (these are usually people waiting to be seated for dinner at the Rice restaurant.) Finally, the service was horrific, and something I find untolerable for a place I'm paying $250 a night to stay at. All the in room materials marketing their \"Whatever Whenever\" service was ironic to me. I called to reserve a table at Rice for three people and they were unable to accommodate me - question, shouldn't guests shelling at out money at the hotel be given preferential treatment when dining at the hotel's own restaurant? Not here. We instead ate at Region which was a phenomenal restaurant up in Hillcrest, about a $6.00 cab ride. Bartenders were unattentive, apparently concerned more with scoring phone numbers & dates than tips from their customers. The sand up at beach bar was a nice touch until you get upstairs to your room and find that it has followed you - it's messy and gets all over the floor, in the shower and in the sheets on the bed. Not very comfortable to sleep in. On a final note, the guest services people have been well trained, but not in guest accommodation. They're robots spouting the pre-determined corporate responses when dealing with customer inquiries & concerns. This didn't make my stay enjoyable, it only infuriated me more and hence, we checked out two days early and stayed at a new B&B up the street in Bankers Hill. The nicest staff member at the W we encountered was the valet who was remembered with a generous tip!

Let me start off with the good...my husband and I loved the decor of the hotel, we loved our room (Kool Korner) and bathroom and we didn't mind the nightclub in the lobby. We had no trouble getting from outside to the elevators and we had no problem with the noise or the people. The only thing we didn't love about the hotel is the service. We arrived at 3:30 (30 mins. after check-in) and were told out room wasn't ready. The woman at the front counter checked our luggage (one piece) and asked for our cell phone number. She said would call us when our room was ready. In the meantime, she said we could a drink at the bar and our room would be ready shortly. We ended paying for our own drinks and after an hour of waiting for our room (we wouldn't have went up and checked on the room earlier but we were trying not to get worked up over it) my husband finally checked on it. The same girl was working at the counter and said our room was ready. She didn't apologize for not calling nor did she apologize us waiting so long for the room. She did tell us though that our luggage would be sent up to our room. We got into our room (loved it!) and then proceeded to wait another hour for our luggage to come up. We ended up calling the front desk trying to locate our luggage. The gentleman that answered the phone apologized profusely and said he would send it right up. We waited another hour and my husband finally had to go downstairs and get our luggage himself. Since the front desk manager wasn't around (go figure) some other supervisor apologized and said he would have front desk manager credit us $50. It turns out, our luggage was in the closet next to the front desk and sitting right there in the front for anyone who opened the closet doors. Before we left, we filled out our comment card and took the review online. You would think after taking both of those surveys, someone would have contacted us and apologized again but no. I finally ended up emailing Starwood about a month later complaining about the service. I did get a call a few days later and the employee and I played phone tag for a few weeks. The one thing that upset me was that whenever I left him a voicemail, it took him 3, sometimes 7, days to get back to me. When my last voice mail was never answered, I emailed Starwood again. This time the gentleman I was playing phone tag with emailed me and actually had the gall to tell me there was some confusion as to who called who last. He did apologize again and said that he would credit our SPG account 10,000 pts. which is good for one night free. I know, some of you are probably wondering why we waited around for an hour each time something was going wrong. The reason why we waited is because we do not like to be the people breathing down the employee's necks (even when we pay $350/night) and we really do not normally complain about anything. We are pretty mellow, go with the flow people. I guess we learned our lesson. I think what also made me frustrated with everything is that this was the only trip my husband and I could afford after buying our first house last summer. And look how it turned out! I do also have to say that we were given a 4pm check-out but that was before everything started happening and I specifically asked for it. I would have to say that if the girl we encountered at the front desk took care of us better, we probably would not have been as upset as we were.

The food and drinks are extremely overpriced and marginal, unless you don't mind paying $10 per drink in a plastic cup! The staff (very rude) did not care that we were hotel guests (for 5 nights) we still had to wait in line with all the outsiders to get into the bar, unless we were on their \"VIP\" list or had a wristband on. The lines and crowds outside the hotel were obnoxious. You can't even hangout in the lobby-it is also roped off & used as a nightclub. They will not allow you to enter the pool and fitness area after 8pm on weekends due to access for VIPs to the beach bar. I wish I would have checked out the same day and left to Coronado!

Don't even think of having breakfast in the hotel unless you want food that is inferior to McDonald's. The room had one chair which was plastic with casters and was very uncomfortable.

To make matters worse, the downstairs bar is not conducive to large crowds. In fact, a majority of the people (about 80%) were packed like sardines waiting to get to the upstairs bar. Finally we were upstairs at 12:25! Now we spent a total of 3 hours in two separate lines. I think the W could profit more by people buying drinks not waiting in lines.

First, the positives: the location is great; the place is very stylish; the staff is eager to please; the bars (both lobby and the \"beach\") are usually busy with a youngish good-looking crowd; great beds; DVD and CD players in rooms. The Negatives: Tiny rooms, small \"valet only\" parking lot; bad heating/cooling system; staff can be annoyingly cloying; tiny, open-air gym; tiny pool; ridiculously expensive. If you have been to a W Hotel before you know the formula; I will not belabor the point. Suffice it to say that when the main consideration is style, other things suffer. The parking situation is terrible. There is not enough room for all the cars when the place gets busy, and the \"valet only\" nature means that you cannot just go down to your car to recieve an item; you must have the valet go get your car for you because you are not allowed in the lot. There are no overnight lots that I could find in the immediate vicinity, so this is a pain. There is plenty of staff, perhaps too many, and they are so in your face with their pleasantness and eagerness that it is a little over the top in my opinion; my girlfriend and I were constantly rolling our eyes at their false attempts at camraderie. Undoubtedly, some people like this treatment - to each his own. The rooms, unless you pay big bucks for a corner King, are New York sized (read: tiny). Ditto the pool and the gym. Also, the gym is completely open to the elements: when it is cold or rainy or windy (yes, these things happen in SD!), so are you. The CD player in my room was not up to snuff like the one at W Seattle, but I love the DVD player in every room. As for the heat and air-con unit: this thing was rattling all night even though we had it off. And we could hear everything the people in a neighboring room said through the shared ducting system. Yikes. My main issue with this place is the price. The rooms are costly, and so is every little thing there.
