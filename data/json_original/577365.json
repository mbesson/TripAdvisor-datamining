The price however, very much reflected the service. It was dank, disgusting and not fit for humans to be in. The room was cramped and had a carpet about a centimetre thick with dirt. The room had a fire door with the mechanism held together with string and electrical tape. The walls were dirty and there was exposed pipes all over the place. The beds were some of the worst I've ever slept in, four inch thick mattresses with springs sticking out all over the place. The only plus point of the whole trip was that it had clean sheets. The bathrooms were the worst bit. Every surface is covered in mould. The showers - if they work at all - trickle out dirty water that makes your hair feel squeaky and weird. The ceilings in the TIIINY bathrooms are just covered, completely covered in aggressive mould. One of the bathrooms had a pipe burst at the back and there was faeces and urine all over the floor. There was also always like an inch of water on the floor and they reeked of dampness and excrement. The owners are lazy idiots too. We reported the state of the shower rooms to them and they were short and unhelpful with us, despite my emotional state. My advice is DO NOT STAY HERE. Go to the Bayswater instead, which is the same price4 roughly, but much, much cleaner and more professional. What this felt like was a building for storing people in the worst conditions. There are also huge rooms with supposed \"facilities\" which are totally empty. Do not be fooled by what the owners claim to have. There are no toilets worth using, no cooking facilities and the whole place is disgusting.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat price for location\u201d", "Author": "platos33", "ReviewID": "UR81287012", "Content": "My Mother and I stayed here for 2 1/2 weeks and we found it to be a good location (near Paddington, Royal Oak tube around the corner and red bus across road), was close to shops and cafes nearby 5-10 min walk. The room itself was a bit unclean and it looked like the bathroom floor hadn't been mopped in a while, but apart from that the room was quiet and had a microwave and fridge which we used often. Only other downside was for the first week we had hot water whenever we wanted, but during the second week the hot water would come and go and would have to wait for it to return (which was annoying at 11pm at night after a long day). Had to pay for wifi in the room, but found it cheap enough for 1 pound per hour. For the price we paid it was good value, would stay there again, but then again we used it as a base for our day trips in and out of London.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevilla", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hostel in London\u201d", "Author": "jmrt_86", "ReviewID": "UR76493063", "Content": "Hi, I'm spanish and I had to go to London for study english for a month.

Some were better than others I must confess, but overall it wget in a hotas pleasant, warm and friendly. I found the staff particularly friendly and at times quite patient with visitor. At the end of the day It is a HOSTEL, NOT a hotel; therfore it is in a different comparison category. For the price you pay, you get the basics; nothing more. To expect the same service you would in a hotel is stupid. However basic things like hot water and proper showers should be expected. If you expect it to be a very cheap hotel, then you will have a terrible stay. If you see it as a backpackers type hostel, then you will have a better stay. As I said, I had a good time there and i would go back to stay there. I found the staff very friendly and polite, although some patience is needed at times with the levels of English; bearing in mind most of the staff are volunteers and are over here trying to improve their English.

We saw the pictures on hostelworld.com and decided it looked nice. When we arrived at the Torquay House, we were surprised to see the neighborhood it was in... and upon entering we had to pay the whole sum up front, without even seeing the room. When we got to the room it was freezing cold and the heat didn't work. There were no towels, no soap, and no toilet paper in the room and the whole room was dirty (in the picture you can see the spots on the walls). Furthermore, the neighborhood seemed so unsafe that we didn't feel comfortable walking back at night. Once in our room, we were cold the whole night and woken up numerous times because the sounds from the halls were so loud and the beds (which were essentially futons) were so squeaky. The shower only has warm water (it was not hot) for a few hours everyday and we had to hold the shower head for the entire shower because the hook did not work. In the morning they advertise a continental breakfast which was nothing more than bread (the toaster didn't work) and warm milk, and there was not enough seating for everyone. We were so unhappy and didn't feel unsafe that we decided to leave after one night even though we had paid for three and they would not give us a refund. (We figured out why they make you pay the full price up front). Do not be fooled by the attractive price tag because we ended up paying more anyway since we left for another hotel.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Torquay House", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d577365-Reviews-Torquay_House-London_England.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 Torquay Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 5EJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "577365", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/ec/91/the-front-of-torquay.jpg"}}
