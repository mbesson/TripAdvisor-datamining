This one is very nice and new, and has their wonderful pillow top beds with great pillows, nice 32 inch flat screen TV. It is very well furnished and spotlessly clean. My room was on the side facing the freeway, but with the thick walls I really couldn't hear a thing from the road. Check in was quick and efficient. The rooms are nice and spacious, great soft chair to sit in and watch some games on TV, nice desk and chair. Breakfast is typical continental breakfast - same as most La Quintas. The only real drawback for visitors to San Diego is that the location is about 20 minutes (north) from most of San Diego. If you are doing things in the northern SD area, it should be great for you. Overall, nice, quiet, clean, and comfortable. The staff is very nice and very helpful.

The room was very clean and newly renovated. It was not perfect, I had not frig or microwave. The continental breakfast was not the best. There is an I-Hop, Starbucks, and Mexican Restaurant right there. But I would hope that the LQ would improve their coffee so folks won't have to walk to Star-bucks. The staff was nice and friendly. It was also dog friendly. YES, I would stay there again. It was centrally located to all the places I needed to be in San Diego, Poway and Rancho Bernard. The town is very easy to get around.

The stay at LaQuinta started off badly when we went to check in and were told that they didn't have the room that we reserved available. They set us up with another room not of equal value until the type of room that we reserved originally would become available. A few nights passed by and my wife and I needed to go do laundry since this hotel doesn't have a laundry facility on site for guest use. After returning from doing laundry she stepped onto the elevator first when the ceiling of it came crashing down onto her. We made the front desk aware of it and an out of order sign was placed on the elevator. Two days later we still had heard nothing from the manager about what was going to be done to take care of it. We did hear from the front desk during that time, but only to tell us that we needed to move rooms because our room had leaky pipes that were letting water drip down into the front desk area. They relocated us and after a total of 3 days from when the elevator ceiling crashed, and I had still not heard from the manager I called LaQuinta's customer service number. They took down all of the information and said they would be in contact with the hotel. 2 days after I called customer service we received a letter from the manager that was left for us at the front desk. They basically just gave us 1 complimentary night and told us to rent a movie that would be comped and gave us a pack of \"delicious\" popcorn to enjoy with our movie. This could easily be a lawsuit for this LaQuinta yet they only comped 1 night with a movie and popcorn. When this happened I ended up looking for another hotel even though I was supposed to be at LaQuinta for 12 more days. I found Residence Inn which is pet friendly and only 1 exit south from where the LaQuinta from hell was. Not only was it pet friendly, but much nicer and with much better amenities. Not only is it pet friendly as well, but there is also not pet poop all over the grounds. We did get a first floor room at Residence Inn though since you never know when an elevator ceiling is going to fall. Do yourself a favor and don't stay here, just go 1 more exit south. It is a world of difference. Not only would I not recommend this hotel to a friend, but I also would not recommend this hotel to an enemy.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRoom ok, bathroom was terrible.\u201d", "Author": "bibi9333", "ReviewID": "UR99141465", "Content": "We stayed here one night and were satisfied with the room but the bathroom was disgusting.

She said she had a room with two doubles. I'm a big guy, that's not working. I said I wanted a refund and would find another hotel. Y'know, if people would just own up and apologize then things would be cool. But when there isn't any consideration for my inconvenience caused by them, then I'd rather not deal with them.
