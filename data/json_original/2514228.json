Love this hotel for its position to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, just minutes away on foot. It is only a short walk from Baywater Tube and is set in the tranquil Kensington Garden Square. We had a lovely, if some what cold walk across the park to The Royal Albert Hall to see Totem,Cirque to Soleil but incorporated a visit before hand to The Victoria and Albert Museum, just down the road in Kensington High St. There are plenty of places to eat in the vicinity. On a Sunday morning you are on the north side of Hyde Park, where artists display their work to sell along the railings from 10am onwards each week. The hotel we found clean and extremely warm during our stay. Very warm bedroom, we had 3 beds in ours so probably slightly on the larger side compared to standard double rooms. May find tight for space if staying for a week or more but how much time do you spend in a room when there is so much on the doorstep to see, Continental breakfast, usual selection of rolls, toast, cheese and ham, cereals etc. Dining room busy at 9.30am but like us, most people having a later breakfast. We would definitely stay here again as the position of it is perfect. You can have a nice long walk, half an hour approximately, depending on your speed, down to Hyde Park Corner and then into Oxford Street to do some shopping.

The Phoenix has a cottage feel to it and many of the original features of the building have been maintained inc. many of the fire places, dado rail etc. With several very comfortable seating areas adjacent to the lobby and good internet access, the hotel has huge appeal to the business and leisure traveller alike and yet, thankfully lacks the oppressive hustle and bustle of modern hotels. The rooms are very cosy and comfortable and have all the facilities one could wish for. Add to this the helpful, well mannered and courteous staff at the hotel and in my opinion, this is a very special hotel and the ideal choice for a stay close to London's theatres or if you just want to \"take the air\" in Hyde Park.

Don't stay here if you are expecting luxury, American-style room sizes, or high-end amenities. That's not the purpose of the Phoenix. For what it is, the hotel does a very good job. I was booked in a single room (twin bed, small desk, wardrobe, nightstand, luggage stand, and a compact bathroom). The room size was small, as expected - this is an older building, and the room was pretty standard for a European single hotel room. The room was clean when I arrived, though a little worn (some scuffs on trim, somewhat worn carpet). The bed was surprisingly comfortable, with a comfortable duvet and pillows. The free wireless worked fine, and the flatscreen TV received basic cable (no Sky, for example). The bathroom was very small, with a new looking toilet and sink, but no counter space (pedestal sink and a high shelf over toilet). Shower was small but good water pressure and plenty of hot water. All looked clean at arrival and was cleaned daily. Hotel lobby is basic, but fine to hang out in if you wanted a change from your room. It was, however, unreasonably hot for almost my entire time there. Breakfast room was clean and pleasant looking, not overly fancy. Continental breakfast was pastries, breads, yogurt, cereals, some fruit, etc. Given that it was a continental, it was plentiful and good. So, what didn't I like? In mid-November, my room was bizarrely hot. I kept the heat off, window open and a fan in the window the entire time to make it bearable. I can't imagine what it would be like in summer - and would think twice abt staying there. There is only one lift (elevator). It operates very slowly, so getting in/out of the hotel around breakfast or check-in time takes several minutes. But again, not atypical for a smaller European hotel. Neighborhood is a highlight. Bayswater tube is about 3 mins, and Queensway is another 3 beyond that. Queensway (the street) is not glamourous, but has a number of food options, convenience stores like Tesco, etc. I'd recommend the Prince Edward pub a few blocks away (turn left out the front door, walk about two blocks, it'll be on your right on a corner).

My son had stayed here ten years ago, but still, I searched extensively and booked this one through Hotels.com at a very fair price for London. We were very happy in this little hotel in a very eclectic and very diversified ethnic, living, breathing neighborhood with a mall right at the corner to the NE, with drug stores and groceries nearby. The area is compact and chock full of reasonably priced restaurants of every nationality. We felt very safe here, but you have to be of open mind and be comfortable with the unfamiliar. If you are intolerant of other cultures and ways, why travel at all, really? In fact, I have NO idea why the reviews on this hotel are, at times, all over the map. Maybe the rooms vary greatly, but they were mostly quite similar on our floor. The elevator was small, but always worked and only at check out did we have to wait a bit, and only because I am in a wheelchair. The hotel itself, like many budget, or NOT, hotels in central London, is small with small rooms and without air conditioning. But it is well kept and on our visit the staff was wonderful. We were there the week of April 3rd for 7 days, were celebrating my 60th birthday, and they even gave me a card and a lovely box of Marks & Spencer chocolates. A very nice memory, indeed. The desk people were always smiling and very helpful. Every single one of them! We will certainly recommend them to our friends. We had a very adequate room on the front side, third floor, and had no issues. Everything worked, the bath was updated and had a tub with shower with loads of hot water and a great shower head. The beds were very comfy, not too soft or hard, and it was kept very clean and tidy. The housekeeping staff was friendly and always had a smile. We kept the windows open at all times and were comfortable with the fan they provided. There was a bit of noise from the young people in the little park across the street at night who would get off work and visit a bit, but not an issue if you have Mack's earplugs and run the fan. I would be reluctant in the summer on the sunny south side of the building, and possibly even on the north side, as we were. It was warm for early April in London as we only had one day of rain and it was devinely sunny and warm the rest of the week. The room stayed warm on the cool, rainy day. Our bath amenities were always replenished and tea and yummy biscuits (cookies) were always left next to the water kettle with cups and saucers. The complimentary breakfast was not bad and they at least tried to provide you with an assortment of cereals, breads, fruit, ham and cheese, and if you want a full English breakfast, you may order it for and additional cost. We found the freebie held us quite well until lunch while on tours. The juices were not very good, seemed watered down, and the OJ was bitter, so you may want to opt for tea or coffee. Located just a few blocks north of Kensington Gardens, north of Bayswater road and just west of Queensway, you have access to two Tube stations and several bus routes all just a few minutes walk away. One bus line across the street takes you to the Natural Science museum and a block from the V& A. The buses on Bayswater road take you into various parts of central London. And don't forget the bus routes to the north on Westbourne Grove Road. Learn the routes before you go and you will have a lot more fun. And really, if you are up to walking through lovely Hyde Park, you are almost a straight shot from the V&A, Buckingham Place, Piccadilly, Green Park, and so on. You can even rent a bike to make your trek. But if you buy an Oyster Card for transport you can get to practically any area quickly and for a song. Much cheaper than buying individual fares. Just keep it topped off and away you go. And all that talk about traffic being such a nightmare is very exaggerated if you are on the buses or using the Tube. Yes, they are gearing up for the Olympics and there is construction all around central London, but the delays were minimal and things keep moving even at rush hours. Remember though, if you rent a car the Congestion Zone rules are strictly photo enforced in the very central part of London and it works! We never needed a cab. A good bet for the money and if you want the Savoy or Brown's, go there instead! Personally, I would rather spend my money on the fabulous shows and tours available. Leed's Castle and Canterbury Cathedral, for example. Mind your manners and always be polite and you will fall totally in love with this most wonderful city.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, comfortable and secure\u201d", "Author": "HookedOnTravel255103", "ReviewID": "UR114724317", "Content": "Third time I've stayed at this hotel, great location minutes walk to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and five mins walk to Kensington and Hyde Parks.

We had 2 doubles and a single room, and it wasnt that cheap - our double cost \u00a3260 for two nights. On arrival, reception was poorly staffed but we were given our key and told our rooms were on the first floor. The two double rooms were small, and i mean small with just enough space to lay a suitcase on one side of the bed. The wardrobes were an adequate size but were clearly cheap DYI flat packs as they shook as you opened them. The beds - unconfortable mattresses but pillows were firm and okay. In the room that I stayed in, the bathroom stunk, it clearly had lack of air filteration, there was no bath, only a shower (although it was a very good shower). There was a small (1inch) step into the bathroom which was a very real tripping issue. My grandmothers single room, was actually a double, however the bed was shoved into a corner so only one side had access. - of about 18inches. This room did have a bath, however you couldnt open the bathroom door fully as the bed was in the way. My grandmother also struggled for space and had to park her walking stroller behind the door when in the room - nothing like a fire hazard. Not only this but the plug for her kettle was under a desk - again not easily accessible due to the small room/big bed issue. So she had to bend down to try and get to it. The hotel did not have a full english buffest breakfast choice. It was mainly continental. On our first morning, the 5 of us went down to breakfast which is served in the basement of the hotel in a VERY crowded space. the tables are all crammed together and there are cheap and nasty paper tablecloths. i wasnt sure whether it was a 'seat yourself' or 'be seated' affair so tried to find a waitress who looked bemused at my request for a 5 person table. We all squeezed in though. The food itself was a choice of toast, croissants, bread rolls, cereal, a bit of fruit, ham and cheese. I had a bread roll and some ham and cheese, the bread was stale, the ham was fatty and the cheese was at room temperature and just quite rancid. I had orange juice - allegedly pure but remarkably watery... I didnt bother with breakfast on the second morning... I thought it couldnt get any worse.... The hotel only had one lift, and it was quite small - I'd say fitting 4 people and a small amount of luggage at a squeeze. So on leaving my grandmother got in the lift on her own as there were already two people in it and we said we'd meet her in reception. The lift got stuck so she rang the lift alarm. The receptionist came over and was not sure what to do, she rang the lift company who said they would come over. She got a 'key' from her desk and tried to open the lift door but it was clear that she had no training or knowledge of what to do with this key. What appeared to be the hotel manager, came swandering over, he looked as if he couldnt care less and went back to his office. the receptionist asked a few of the room maids if they knew how to open the lift, and after some jiggling the door opened, and had to be held back whilst my grandmother and the other two hostages got out. My grandmother was shaking like a leaf, and i had to ask someone to get her a chair and some water... we got a bit of a half hearted apology and then all the staff went back to their jobs like nothing was ever happened. and the best bit.... during this ordeal, the receptionist said - 'this thing happened yesterday, the lifts been doing it recently' - im sorry but im sure thats were a little thing called maintenence comes in?

It's location was great (right around the corner from Bayswater tube stop) but other than that it was fairly awful. The desk staff were the most unhappy group of people I have ever encountered. Not once did any of them smile at me. The staff that worked the continental breakfast was pleasant but had a very hard time keeping the buffet stocked and the tables cleared. The hotel was WARM. Ridiculously warm. You broke into a sweat as soon as you entered the lobby and the rooms were no better. The heat was off but it didn't matter. The windows only opened maybe 3 inches so that offered no respite. There was a fan in the closet, but in order to plug it in you had to move the desk to get to the plug, and even then I don't think you could have both the TV and fan plugged in at the same time. My bed was slanted so that I constantly felt like I was going to roll onto the floor. The shelf in the bathroom was also tilted so that if you put anything on there, it was likely to fall off, and, if you forgot to close the lid on the toilet, fall straight into the toilet (which you couldn't sit on without knocking the toilet paper off the holder). The showers were nice. Small, but I expected that. The noise from outside made sleeping next to impossible; maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't need to keep my window open (I was in room 319) but I did need the window open to try to alleviate SOME of the warmth. You also had to pay 1.50 for a 1/2 hour of internet access (I instead went to Whiteley's and paid 2 for internet access with a code that I could come back and reuse until my 2 hours were up). I usually stay at the Henry VIII Hotel which is a couple blocks away, but unfortunately they were booked.

The room and the bathroom were extremely clean. The room could use a bit of an update, but for the price I didn't mind. I just needed a place to sleep after spending all day sightseeing. Breakfast was served every morning. My room with Expedia included a continental breakfast which was enough to start the day. Choices included: tea or coffee, toast, croissants, jams and jellies, meat slices and cheese, fresh fruit and juices. For an extra price, you can get an English breakfast. The location was amazing. I took the Heathrow Connect into Paddington Station for 7.90 GBP. The price is more than 1/2 the price of the Heathrow Express. I decided to travel into the city by the Heathrow Connect because I did not want to lug my luggage up or down the stairs in the 2 nearby Tube stations to the hotel. The walk from Paddington was about 15 minutes - all level and easily done with a wheeled suitcase. The neighborhood was perfect. Looking on the map, it seems to straddle the border of Notting Hill and Bayswater. Lots of good ethnic restaurants in all directions. Down at the corner you will find Whiteley's shopping center. Good restaurants on the 3rd floor. There is a Marks & Spencer on the first floor that has an outstanding food section. So if you want to load up on gourmet sandwiches, drinks, baked goods, etc., for a trip, try here first. In addition, this location of Marks & Spencer also had a clothing section. So if your luggage doesn't show up with you, you can always buy something to tide you over. The staff at the hotel were always extremely helpful. The housekeeping staff is very hard working.

The Best Western Phoenix foot the bill sufficiently. I was glad that I was able to view photos of my single room online before I went to get an idea of just how small it was going to be: twin bed, desk, chair, small tv, armoire. No hotel parties here! The twin bed was okay...I could tell that it had been used more as a place to sit and watch the tv than a place to sleep and I ended up flipping the mattress myself so I wouldnt feel as if I was going to slide off onto the floor. I was honestly so tired after my travels everyday, that the mattress was incidental. Just like so many other reviews here have mentioned, the bathroom was tiny! The bowl of the sink was an average size which made me squeeze around it to get in to the shower; water pressure was good, towels were replaced everyday, although I thought it strange that I didnt have my wash cloth replaced everyday. I had to have someone come up and explain that one shower knob was a thermostat and one was on/off. They were very kind in explaining, as I am sure they have quite a few confused tourists! Wish there wouldve been a towel bar/shelf in the shower. I kept the shower gel/shampoo they provided on top of the shower door. Also, the small glass shelf above the sink was adequate, although I bumped my forehead on it a couple times while rinsing off my face. Ouch! Continental breakfast was satisfying, with various cold cereals, meats, cheeses, breads, etc. Thought it odd that I had to wait to be seated when there were plenty of seats, but perhaps they wanted to give this experience a more restaurant touch. The breakfast was one of the chosing factors in staying here, and it did the job to keep me sated for the morning portion of my London touring. The location of the hotel was excellent; very quiet street. I had nice view of trees (a small park?) from my window. The Bayswater Tube station was only a few minute walk and Kensington Gardens was also a quick walk of a couple blocks. The area around the corner was a bustling area of restaurants (fast food and otherwise), and shops that were very convenient. Was nice to spend one pound for an hour at an internet cafe, (instead of hauling my laptop with me) then get a snack on the way out of this small convenience store to take back to the hotel later at night. Complaints? Well, the lift for all 4 floors was slow and small, so I would sometimes take the back firestairs which were right outside my room. I also thought that hallways and lift were unbelievably warm (lots of halogen bulbs). I suppose that London tends to be cool/cold and this mightve felt nice is it wasnt early June. I guess the place could use an update for the rooms, but thats is incidental. Staff and service was excellent. Called down to front desk to get an ironing board and iron and on another occasion needed another box of tissue.(nothing like traveling while sick! Bleh!)

We were (are at the time of this review) stuck in London and lost our reservation at the Sheraton. On a combination business trip/vacation with the family. Did not have high expectations based on the price. London is an expensive town and if you are on a budget the Phoenix is good. We did move to another hotel due to the concern related to personal belongings noted below \u2013 got tired of carrying around all of my work equipment (laptop/documents, etc) every time we left the room. The majority of our costs are covered by my work. If I were paying out of pocket for everything we would have stayed at the Phoenix. Positives: \u2022The hotel is in a good location \u2022Room was clean \u2022The room with the loft area was a nice way to separate everyone for a little privacy \u2022Laundry mat very close by \u2022Bar in the lobby \u2022Free wifi (very slow, but free) \u2022Quaint and with character Negatives: \u2022Staff were clearly stressed due to the volume of people - not horrible service, but not great. Called the front desk 3 times and no one ever answered. Walked downstairs and there were always 2 clerks sitting there. \u2022Electricity for half of the room went out in the evening and had no lights in the bathroom (no windows) until the next morning. \u2022No security for your belongings at all - nothing in the room and the doors have a single standard key (not electronic). Baggage storage area (pre check in) was open and I could have easily had my pick of luggage the number of times I went in and out. \u2022Little bit of a walk to the tube - especially with young children. \u2022No heat or AC to speak of and the building is stuffy - would think twice in the summer. Summary: If you have a tight budget this hotel will work. I mentioned security above only in reference to belongings \u2013 did not see any personal safety issues. Probably best for travelers who don\u2019t mind a Hostel like feel for their stay and don\u2019t have a lot of items to worry about.

I had a good trip, and compared to other hotels I've stayed in in London, the service was okay, the location was good, and rooms were as small as elsewhere in this pricecategory in London. However, there were some details which could have been better.... Reservations: Booked a package through a travel agency, so nothing special, but reservation was confirmed instantly. Location: het hotel is located in Bayswater, just off the larger street there with a lot of restaurants, fastfoodservice and small shops. It is a 3 minute walk from Bayswater tube station to the hotel, so excellent as well. Check-in/service/front desk: friendly personnel but average service at check-in. We asked for a twin room, but they asked us if we wanted to be \"upgraded\" to 2 single rooms located close to each other, but we declined this offer. They had all their twin rooms booked. However, there was no problem when we declined, we still got a twin room. For other questions the staff was helpful and tried their best. For example, when we had to print our boarding passes, it was no problem using the office computer, and the staff answered questions about shops and all. Room: we got a small twin room on the ground floor. The view was a wall, but I didn't come to London for my roomview, so wasn't bothered by it. As said the room was small, but I guess comparable in size with other hotel rooms in London in the same price range. But on the other hand, there were some details (or lack thereof) which could have given the room a boost. For example, there were no hooks on the wall to put a coat or clothing on. There was a closet, but that was set in the corner and it wasn't easliy opened or accessed. There were some free power outlets, but they were located behind the desk low to the ground, which asked for moving the desk in the small room, go on your knees and crawl under the desk to acces them....could have been better! the decor was a bit dated but okay. There was a watercooker and all there, as well as a tv. Overall, the room was average, but with minor changes could have been much better. If the lay-out or the furniture would have been designed to fit the room, it would have been an uprgrade for the room. I have stayed in small rooms before, but there the desk, closet and stuff was specially designed which made the room look bigger and nicer. There were 2 boxsprings, which I slept quite well on, but my friend didn't but I guess that is a personal taste thing! Temperature was good! Bathroom: clean, great shower, enough towels and apart from no space to put your toiletry bag (which wasn't that big a problem) no comments. Breakfast: average, but well maintained and friendly staff. There was bread (for toasting as well as rolls), croissants, meat, cheese, cereal, jam, chocopaste, and juices. For a small amount you could order eggs or an english breakfast. No frills in the breakfast room. Other amenities: there was a small bar in the lobby area, didn't use it but looked okay. Regarding the menu, it also served small \"snacks\" such as muffins. There were quite some seats in the lobby and it was decorated good. In the lobby was 1 computer with internet. The internet could be used for a small fee, speed was good. Overall: a great located hotel, with average, small rooms. It is comparable to other London hotels in the same price range, but with a good location. There were some minor points which were not that good, but mainly in the room amenities.

It is also known as the The Tube. 2. We purchased a ticket from the person at the counter for 4 Pounds to get to the Bayswater station 3. You will be getting on the Picadilly Line at Heathrow. You will get off at the Earl's Court station. 4. At the Earl's Court station, you will take the District Line to the Bayswater station. You will want a District Line train that is going to Edgware Road. 5. When you leave the Bayswater station, you will be on Queensway Road. Take a left. 6. You will walk about a block or so to Porchester Gardens Road. Take a left. At this intersection, there is a Whiteley's on the other side of the street. 7.

The Ritz it isn't, but I wasn't expecting it to be, and it really was the perfect hotel for everything I needed in London. I was a female (mostly solo) traveller, and felt perfectly comfortable using this hotel as my base (though to be fair I wasn't out until the very wee hours). It's right near a busy and bustling street that has everything you need, but just off it which eliminates noise or any other concerns. There are two tube stations within just a few minutes walking distance, which was my mode of transportation outside of my own two feet, which allowed access to everywhere in London. Kensington Park is only a few minutes walk as well. Technically I did walk from the hotel to venues like Harrods and even Buckingham Palace, but unless you have a lot of time and energy you will probably be using public transportation to get to any of the main touristy things. The room itself was small, but no more so than any other place I'd stayed in Europe. There was plenty of room for the stand to put my luggage on, and to maneouver around it as well. The bed was perfectly clean and comfortable. The bedding etc was older, but not worn or threadbare. The bathroom was a perfectly adequate size, and very well kept. The one downside to the room and the surrounding hallways was the lack of air conditioning, however I had no problems just by using the little fan that they provided and keeping my window open (and I don't tolerate excessive heat for sleeping well). The one thing that was mildly annoying was the bulky keys/key chains, however with my large purse it wasn't an issue. I ended up using the available computer in the lobby area most evenings to keep in contact with people back home. One of the internet cafes would have been cheaper, but for the convenience at night it wasn't a bad price. Outside of one evening when a large group was taking turns, there were no issues when I wanted to use it. The small bar was very quiet and sedate even at night (pro or con depending on how you look at it). The staff were fine, though not overly helpful. I wasn't impressed with two of them - however it never detracted from my stay. They were kind enough to store my luggage in their back room the last day as I didn't fly out until later, and it was there and as left when I returned. The breakfast that was included with the site I booked through was adequate, but not memorable. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The one downside was the lack of A/C, but never to an extent even in the middle of summer that I had any problems. It was also (relatively) close to the train station, however you certainly couldn't handle it walking with significant luggage - it was convenient walking there for my day trip out of the city, however for taking the Heathrow express from Paddington to the airport I did cave and take a cab there as the metro was simply too much of a hassle with luggage and walking was a little far.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cSome flaws, but a descent experience\u201d", "Author": "SigurdJarlson", "ReviewID": "UR26474977", "Content": "I stayed here for six nights.

A couple of negatives were the one very small elevator that seemed to have a mind of its own, the inside temperature of our room (it was always very warm and you can only open the windows about 7-8 inches), and the difficult time you have getting ice (you go to the bar and get a small cup filled). The biggest positive of this place is its location. It is very close to two tube stops (Bayswater and Queensway), which makes it very easy to get to many attractions such as the houses of parliment, big ben, the london eye, Thames River cruises, the Tate Modern, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, London Bridge, St. Paul's Cathedral, and more (you can get to most of these through the Bayswater stop on the \"Circle Line\" tube line). The hotel is also within walking distance to the Notting Hill area and Kensington Park and Palace. The Bayswater area also has many nice and reasonably priced ethnic restaurants and there is a shopping center just down the street where you can buy food, wine, beer (that's why we were looking for ice), snacks, and more. In all, I would stay there again and I recommend this place to anyone who values price and convenience over elegance and prestige.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cgood location, fair price\u201d", "Author": "sopaul", "ReviewID": "UR20821249", "Content": "I stayed there 2 nights in september in a single room, as I wanted to visit London : perfect location, you have shops and restaurants just around the corner, and the tube is only 200 m away.

The building is a terrace house and the interior design is plushy, so don\u00b4t expect a modern/puristic styled place. Room: small but still reasonably sized (was able to move without hitting the furniture, no need to walk sideways).The room was furnished with a bed (clean sheets, good mattress), a desk with a chair and small tv on top, a small wardrobe and a tiny bench for luggage. There was also a hot water kettle for preparing tea/coffee. The bathroom though was very tiny (ca. 2.50 m x 1.50 m), and was equipped with a shower cubicle, toilet and a mini sink. It was ok for me as I\u00b4m just 5.5 ft. (1.65 m), but tall or big folks, think twice. The overall cleanness of the rooms was good. Breakfast: buffet: rolls, croissants, sausage, cheese, m\u00fcsli, joghurt, marmelade, jam, coffee/tea. Quality I\u00b4d say, was average. Staff: friendly, had no problems with any of them. Location: In Bayswater, you can walk to Paddington Station for airport connection (Heathrow Express, ca. 20 minutes walk), there are 2 Underground Stations near the hotel and it is a 3 minutes walks to Bayswater Road where buses go directly to Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus and Victoria Station. The area is very tourist-friendly with many restaurants, money exchange, ticket shops, small supermarkets etc. nearby. To sum it up I\u00b4d say the Best Western Phoenix Hotel Bayswater is one of the better hotels of this price category though it doesn\u00b4t compare to the Best Western Hotels I stayed in in the States (might be interesting to know for people from the US).

Don't do it. We were scheduled to have a one-night stay at the Phoenix on our way back from Paris, and, based on the reviews written here, this looked like a pretty good hotel value. I can tell you it is not. The gory details follow below. Upon our Saturday night arrival, we were given a \"ground floor\" room (G-10, if I recall) that, when we opened the door, was notable for three things - (1) the worn, 1980's era 'Kansas motel' decor (including a bedspread that was clearly 15+ years old); (2) a wide open window, and (3) a horrible mildew smell that pervaded the room and made it smell like a crypt. Upon seeing this, we went back to the desk and asked to be switched to the other room. The woman at the front desk appeared irritated and told us there were no other rooms, but, after asking her to see the room roster she had in her hand, she conceded she had one other room. She then led us to another room (this time the 'basement' level) that may well have had the same mildew smell but for the acrid smell of cigarette smoke that had leeched into every square inch of the room. (Hoping to have us accept the room, she helpfully added \"it has a flat screen!!!). We told her this was also unacceptable since we had booked non-smoking. Although she was clearly irritated, we returned to the front desk and asked to be switched to one of the upstairs rooms (of a guest that had not checked in yet.) She begrudgingly relented and pushed a key at us (the hotel does not have modern hotel locks or any modern conveniences - e.g. refrigerator, iron, safe) and sent us to the second floor. When we got there, we found the same decor as the previous two rooms, with a tiny TV (10\" max) shoved in the corner of a worn out desk. (The TV had a melted lower corner, to boot). A small wardrobe and luggage rack were provided for clothes storage, but the remaining luggage had to end up on the desk. The shower and bathroom were clean (thankfully) but incredibly small (think medium closet size). One interesting feature was that the faucet had no mixing of hot and cold water (both came out of the same faucet as separate streams a few millimeters from each other). For electrics, only one outlet was readily available in the room to plug things in, so we couldn't power up anything other than one at a time. We put our things down, cleaned up for a bit, and went out to meet friends for dinner. When we returned, just out of curiosity, I pulled back the bed to see the sheets beneath the bedspread. The first thing I noticed were the multiple (7+) stains on the underside of the spread, including 3 that appeared to be old blood. The sheets were no better - although the sheets were made, there were hairs (not ours!) all over the sheets and pillowcases, making it appear that the bed had been slept in and then made. We called the night clerk (different than the first woman) and he agreed to get us new sheets and pillowcases but insisted on asking us \"are you sure you didn't sleep in the bed yet?\" (!!!) Shortly thereafter, we got the sheets, made the bed by putting the new sheets over the old sheets and the new pillowcases over the old pillowcases (I did not want to see what the mattresses and pillowcases looked like after seeing the underside of the bedspread), and slept a very uncomfortable 5 1/2 hours in a room with no air conditioning. The only pros, as I see it, of this hotel are the proximity to the Bayswater tube (about 1 1/2 blocks), free wi fi (you have to get a code from the front desk) and the good (included) continental breakfast. This hotel does not live up to the Best Western standard by any means, and do not be fooled by the name when you book. Also, someone here mentioned proximity to Paddington Station.

You got it. Sorry in advance ;) I am a frequent visitor to the UK, but generally stay with friends or relatives. This particular time I was by myself and decided to take advantage of London by picking a place in the city core. After reading multiple reviews about the average 3 star in London, I was prepared for the worst - I know that hotels in Europe aren't generally at the same standard as our Canadian hotels, particularly when booking a single room. First: Gatwick Airport to London Not as awful as I anticipated. If flying into Gatwick, pre-book tickets on the \"Gatwick Express train,\" which are available online. You can print the tickets and, if you are travelling overseas, save the trouble of waiting in a long line after an exhausting trans-atlantic flight. A round-trip pass costs approximately $60.00 (CAD) when booking through expedia, though it's roughly the same when converted from pounds if purchased online through the gatwick express site - and well worth the money - it saves you a world of transportation headache. The train takes approximately 30 minutes and runs every 15. It was quick and easy - far easier than the bus. The GE comes into Victoria station. Here, I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing a travel pass for the tubes - if you're a tourist, stick with zones 1-2 - any guidebook should really tell you that anyway. You can purchase the pass for approx. 24.50 pounds per week - otherwise it's 4 pounds from Victoria to Bayswater (where you get off for the Phoenix Hotel), and then if you decide to travel the tubes later you'll have to pay the full amount for the week pass. Just a tip. I accidentally paid the extra, obviously. Live and learn. The Hotel: It's approximately a 5 minute walk from Bayswater, which is about all I could handle after trudging through Gatwick and Victoria with my massive suitcase (don't worry, no big hills to attack - but there are no elevators in the tube stations and LOTS of stairs, so if you are tubing it, make sure you have a lightweight suitcase). Mapquest the directions as they are easier to follow than my instructions. The location is very ideal for anyone interested in tourism. The Bayswater tube is extremely close to all the tourist attractions in central london, and makes it very convenient when coming back to the hotel during a late night. Check-in was completely easy. Very pleasant lady at the desk. The decor was modern, clean and fresh! Adjacent to the reception area is a bar that doesn't seem to keep any particular set hours, but it's a pleasant enough area to sit and have a glass of wine when it is open. The only problem with this area is that the only internet station is set up directly across from the bar and in plain view of all the \"Lager Louts\" that had no problem harrassing me when I was trying to check my emails. As a lone girl in a foreign city, I was fairly uncomfortable to say the least. It happened on more than one occasion so my suggestion to the hotel would be to move it to a less conspicuous area. And maybe add another computer - it was really hard to get in any time as someone was always there before I could sneak in! The room itself - #114 - GREAT. Honest. Yes, there was a single bed - a twin size. Super small by North American hotel standards. But hey, I was alone and it was actually VERY comfortable. The bed was actually on an elevated platform with a staircase leading up to it, so I felt as though I had my own private loft! There is a small bathroom with a shower only (no bathtub), again, no biggie. Always clean as a whistle though and nice, modern decor. There is a desk area below the platform with the television, which was quite small and had the usual London total of four stations. Getting satelite would be a very nice customer service addition, in my opinion. However, most people aren't there to watch tv. Right? Room got HOT. I was there during a freak heat wave in the beginning of may - 25-28 degrees every day for a week, so to be fair, I don't think the hotel anticipated it lasting and if they had central AC, it didn't appear to be utilized. I asked for a fan, which was brought promptly and advertised as available in \"limited quantities\" (note to people who may be there in the summer - check in and get a fan asap) and kept it on me while sleeping and it was completely fine. There is a small safe available for free at the reception desk - use it for your passports! Safety: I generally felt safe in the hotel and relatively safe around it. I had a few late nights and the side road leading to the hotel later on in the evening is a little sketchy, but there always appears to be a gaggle of touristy-looking people meandering around at all hours of the day and night so it felt safe enough. Be on your guard generally in London, though. Breakfast: Very nice indeed! I never ate in the main room myself but usually went downstairs to grab some fruit and a bit of cereal to take up to my room with me. I asked for coffee and they brought it out to me in a full decanter on a tray - terrific service and the coffee wasn't bad - this became my morning routine! That's really all I can tell you about the hotel. It was a really nice surprise considering all the horror stories I had heard of here and from others. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to singles. Now note - I DID look into a room with a double bed. It was VERY cramped looking and I probably would not have been as satisfied. If I go back with my boyfriend I am honestly not sure I would book there as it looked really small for two people. However, I only got a peek or two, so if travelling in a pair, then get your info from someone else who booked a double at the Phoenix. I tried to make this review as general as possible but I am personally recommending this hotel to individuals who are travelling alone and need a single room. NOTE: This hotel was not wheel-chair accessible. Long-winded, I know, but I have tried to be as thorough as possible. Book, go, have a blast!

To be fair the hotel is clean and quite modern except for the lack of air conditioning which some of you may question as it was Feb, however, the weather was quite mild and the room was stifling. If my stay was taken in the summer then it would have been unbearable. I did seek the use of a fan, however, the hotel staff did not seem that bothered and did not provide one in the end. My colleague in another room did help out in the end. My room was a single room and it was on two levels, strange eh? The room was quite spacious for a single room and the bathroom was very clean with the shower being very hot when needed. The only problem I had was with the bed being very very uncomfortable and the tv being on the lower level away from the bed. This may seem daft but you were given a tiny chair to sit in front of it which can be very annoying after a while. The breakfast was very good with a very large selection overall. You can even upgrade to a full english breakfast for \u00a36.50. Unfortunately I will not be choosing the hotel for the reasons stated above but the hotel is located in a great area with many pubs, shops and restaurants.

Outside looked very clean and inside, the reception and bar areas were lovely decorated and smelt lovely. No mustiness here. Was very nervous entering the bedroom, but need not have worried. Had booked a triple room, was big enough for our needs, after all we had come to see London, not laze around a hotel and its facilities for 4 days. There are plenty of other hotels for that type of holiday. It had 2 twin beds and then had a 3rd bed on a raised level - which our son was absolutely delighted with, claimed it was the coolest hotel room ever - and he had his own TV as well. The TV had the 5 English channels and Sky News which was sufficient. The room also had internet access. No problem here either. Just had to get a password and username from Reception and it worked perfectly for the whole time there. Our bathroom was spotlessly clean and beautifully tiled. A great relief after looking at some of the photos on this site of some of the hotels around. Plenty of hot water, clean towels, soap, shampoo, shower gel etc. For breakfast you had a good choice of cereals, toast, rolls, croissants, ham, cheese, fruit, yoghurts, juices, tea & coffee. There was cooked breakfasts at an additional cost, but while we were there, I certainly didn't see many people ordering them. Everyone seemed happy enough with what was on offer. We were nearly last into the Dining Room some mornings and there was loads of everything still available to eat. The hotel itself is in a quiet square just off Queensway. It's hard to believe that you are so close to the main street when you're actually inside the hotel. There are 2 tube stations nearby, Queensway on the Central line and Bayswater on the Circle/District line. On the morning we checked out, there was no problem leaving our cases, heading off and picking them up again later for the journey home.

Manager offered me a single room to stay for a night untill our second quad was ready- free of charge. The single room was small, but in UK terms, larger than I ever seen! I mean, traditionally, english BnBs are beehives; rooms have enough space just to sleep and get changed. This single room was larger than any other room I stayed in London and with a wonderfull view over the park across the street. The quad rooms, were \"family\" rooms; two single beds standing aside and two more single beds up 6 steps with their own TV and window- it was so lovely! Both rooms were spotless. The stuff is unbelievably hellpfull, even with people not speaking english, and they can recommend places to see and eat; their idea of eating at \"Bella Italia\" just around the corner, across the tube station was very good- real italian food in reasonable prices. Ask for the \"espresso menu\". Breakfast was the classic continental breakfast; coffee, tea, hot chocolate, nuttela, marmalade, slices of bread you can toast, rolls, cheese, ham, flakes, musli, youghurt and fruit- I found it more than satisfying. Location is... well, even if it is your first in London and you are blindfolded, you can't miss it; so close to the tube and bus stops, with supermarkets, pharmacies, clean restaurants from italian to morrocan to greek to indian just a few minutes walk away from it and a shopping center at the corner! I stayed before in the same area, but I was foolish enough not to book in Phoenix the first time... I unquestionably recommend this hotel to anyone.

Don\u2019t rely on the Best Western reputation here. The Phoenix isn\u2019t up to that brand's standards. As every reviewer notes, the rooms are tiny. That\u2019s not surprising in London, but it makes it important to use the space efficiently. The Phoenix flunks that test. For example, it wouldn\u2019t be very costly to provide flat-panel, wall-mount TVs instead of the clunkers that take up half of the precious desktop, the only flat surface in the room. (And that only get a few channels, surely a disservice to the many non-English-speaking guests that the hotel hosts.) Most of the remaining desktop is taken up by a tea/coffee service. I didn't bring my laptop, preferring to shell out 50 pence per 30 minutes at a neighborhood cybercafe. I don't know where I would've put my laptop if I had brought it. Another example: closet space consisted of a standing wardrobe, about 3 feet wide and with cheap sliding doors that kept straying off their tracks. With so little clearance, hinged doors or pocket doors would have been much smarter. It contained only 4 hangers, inadequate for a scheduled 8-night stay. When I asked for more, the front desk grudgingly brought up 2 more. What is it with the clocks? Like travelbug, I found that mine needed a new battery. (Which the housekeeping staff provided, upon request\u2026.but why did we have to ask?) Maybe they figure the clock is invisible from the bed anyway, so who cares? Again, dumb design. (Memo: wear a watch in bed.) The room was very warm, even in October. I left the window wide open and tolerated the street noise. And the mosquitos. Yes, in October! (No screens. Dangerous, if you're traveling with young children.) The hotel encourages guests to reuse bath towels instead of requesting fresh ones every day. That's environmentally commendable (and I complied), but it would be pleasanter if there were more than a single narrow rod on which to hang used towels. \u201cTravelbug\u201d will be impressed to hear that my flimsy plastic bathroom glass was, indeed, replaced once during my stay. D\u00e9cor was borderline shabby. Cleanliness and repair were marginal. The bathroom\u2019s noisy exhaust fan, maddeningly, stays on long after the light is turned off. The one lift is inadequate. The breakfast room is unpleasantly crowded. The interior of the hotel is non-smoking, a plus. A consequence, though, is that smokers are almost always huddled on the entrance steps, so you enter the lobby through a cloud of tobacco smoke. The overwhelming impression is that the Phoenix is squeezing every pence out of this property, and dares its guests to ask for better treatment. I\u2019m not some yahoo who\u2019s never visited London before; this is my tenth trip or so. I stayed for 8 nights at the Phoenix only because I had prepaid through a booking service (big mistake) and dreaded the hassle of demanding a change.

The Phoenix Hotel was booked for us through a travel agent using Delta Vacations. Out of all the walking and touring that we accomplished, I saw few other hotels as close and convenient to things as was the Phoenix, except those very costly hotels. The rooms were clean and in good repair. I was a bit skeptical after some reviews I had read, but we found everything to be great. Yes, the rooms were a bit small but not to the point of being uncomfortable. Yes, I can see why a few people complained about the heat, because our room had a small steam radiator that I could not turn off. Nonetheless, it wasn't that hot and as others have said, I simply opened the windows. I read somewhere of a complaint of street noise keeping them awake when the windows were open, but I had no problems. If you insist on sleeping in total silence, then save your foam earplugs from the airlines, and sleep with them in. We all found the continental breakfast to be good, and helped start each day out right, as we trekked throughout London and returned to the hotel exhausted each day.

We thoroughly enjoyed being just 2-3 minutes walk from the Bayswater Tub Station where one can catch the Circle Line (Yellow) or District Line (Green). Just another \u00bd block further was the Queensway Station (Red Line). The convenience of the tub stations was outstanding, and we simply purchased four 1-day passes every day. Oddly enough, it was cheaper to buy each day than to bay a multi-day pass. HINT: Take a Taxi from the Train Station to the hotel. I found it much easier than fighting the crowds on the Tube Line, while dragging suitcases. (It was 10 pounds from Victoria Station to the Hotel). There were an unbelievable number of places to eat and drink nearby the Phoenix Hotel (on the same street as the Tube Lines) and then even more places to dine about 1 block further. AND, one of the most enjoyable days (but quite long) that we spent in London was walking from our Hotel, through nearby Kensington Park, past Kensington Palace, down to Hyde Park Corner, to Buckingham Palace, and on to Westminster Abbey. A tremendous about of walking, but the point is.... If you stay at the Phoenix Hotel, don't forget to stroll through Kensington Park.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashbourne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSardines On Toast\u201d", "Author": "Where to go nextt", "ReviewID": "UR7277523", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel late evening after booking through Hotels Com earlier that day, to be told there were no rooms available .

Best Western refused to subsidise the difference, though eventually offered a room descibed as a double yet only used for single occupancy, their only concession was free breakfast. Well at 11pm tired and desperate to secure a bed we elected to stay. Probably a mistake the room offered 124 was just able to accomodate a queen size bed and there was a large mount of damp evident on the walls. The next day we were given room 211 seemingly standard fare , but this was only marginally bigger and so warm that we sought soft drinks at 4am. Breakfast was good in terms of food , but the tables so close and so packed it was uncomfortable . All in all despite a further 10% discount due to my protestations I left the hotel thinking it was quite terrible and not what Best western would be proud of. the plus side was location and the bathrooms which were good.

The area is safe and there are lots of Internet cafes around should you choose to leave your computer at home but need to check your e-mail (don't use the hotel's computer , there are many cheaper options just down the street near Bayswater station). Here is our only complaint: Our plane was leaving on Sunday morning and we had to be at Gatwick by 8:00 am due to all of the extra security at check-in. The subway starts late on Sundays, so we had to get a taxi to Victoria to get a train to Gatwick. We asked the people on desk if we could order a taxi in the morning but they suggested that it be ordered on Saturday night. When the cab showed up on Sunday morning, it was a minicab and the driver charged \u00a314. When we questioned the fare, the driver said \"Victoria Station is not that close.\" Victoria station is in fact 3.5 miles or 5.5 kilometres from the hotel. To give you an idea of a realistic fare, a black cab would have cost less than \u00a38.00. Mini cabs are supposed to be cheaper than black cabs. It's really unfortunate that the hotel chose to phone a company that would rip off their guests because it was our last experience related to the hotel and it left us with a sick, disappointed feeling.

The room faced the street which meant that you could hear the people coming back from the pubs, but it was not too bad. The walls though were very thin. Perhaps my neighbours were just very loud, but it sounded like they were in my room. The bathroom was small but okay and there were coffee and tea making facilities. The only thing I missed was a safe (there is one in the earl's court hotel). The hotel could do with some modern decoration I thought, but it didn't bother me. I liked the layout. In some (budget) hotels you get lost easily because of all the corridors, but in this hotel it's very easy to find your room.

We chose the Best Western Phoenix because of all the other wonderful comments I read about it in the Trip Advisor and we certainly were not disappointed! It is very similar to our Best Westerns in the States - not super fancy, but not a Motel 6 standard either. We stayed there for 8 days in mid-April. We had 4 single beds which was great for my 13 yr old son, 15 yr old daughter, my husband and myself. We had enough room to put our \u201cjumbo expandable\u201d suitcases, (5 total because we were there for 2 \u00bd weeks and I wasn\u2018t washing) , on the floor and still have room to walk around without tripping on them! I was very pleased with the bathroom too! I was able to stand with my arms extended, spin around and not smack into a wall - which if you\u2019ve ever been to an English standard room this is very uncommon! There was plenty of room to relax without getting into each others hair! The other recommendations are correct in the multitude of restaurants and a Mall with in walking distance as well as the Bayswater Tube Station which is on the Circle Line - a main line to all tourist spots. There is an internet Caf\u00e9 on the 3rd floor dirt cheap - 1 pound for 1 hour! The staff was exceptionally kind and went out of their way to make sure we had fresh wash clothes (which they call \u201cface clothes\u201d) each day. That is not a traditional custom for England, but we requested it and they were very happy to oblige! They were also wonderful in getting us a great deal with a cab service for just 1 large van to the train station for 4 people and 5 suitcases for the second part of our vacation into Somerset, Devon and Wales for another week. We made the mistake of staying at a different hotel when we returned to London that was close to Victoria Station for our Gatwick Express Train ride back to the airport the following day. We stayed at \u201cThe Sydney Hotel - Victoria\u201d and it was just horrible! The room was very cramped, unknown stains on the floor and I could literally go to the bathroom and brush my teeth at the same time! We were SO glad that we had our first 8 days in the Best Western Phoenix and would gladly go back there again on our next visit because they made our stay an awesome one! In fact, the only thing I could fault them on is that the basement dining area is too warm, but you go in have nice quick continental breakfast then you are out and on your way again - still SO well worth the money!! A tip when out touring London - make sure to have change (20p and 50p) for the bathrooms - they charge to use the toilets and the attendants usually don\u2019t have change.

The hotel had a closet where we could store our luggage, used the restrooms (very clean) to wash up, then headed out to sightsee. The location was perfect for us, a brisk 5-7 min walk to the Bayswater station. There were all kinds of not too expensive restaurants, a grocery store (Tesco) where we picked up milk for my son, water, sandwiches for lunches on the go, fresh fruit etc. A Boots, Marks and Spencer, a laundromat, a film and photo shop (where we downloaded photo images on to CDs--kinda expensive anywhere, so carry sufficient memory), as well as several souvenir shops selling the usual post cards, shot glasses and T shirts--all within easy walking distance. When we returned in the evening from a full day of sightseeing or day trip outside London it was very easy to drop into one of the many restaurants for dinner then walk 2-3 mins to the hotel.

You are only a 5 minute walk to the tube (Bayswater - Circle Line) and can be to Westminster in 10 minutes. You are also remarkably close to Paddington Station if you are taking the Heathrow Express. It was only a 10 minute walk from the Hotel to the station. The rooms were modest and some how we lucked out by getting a triple suite instead of a twin room. We had a room and a loft were the 3rd twin was stationed. The room was clean which was all I was looking for a place to shower and sleep. While it could use a little sprucing up, the accomodations were fine for us. The bathroom was a nice size. They had a change on the door for security and I have to say the room was very warm and we needed the window open the entire stay. Breakfast was continental and was ok enough to get you going in the morning without having to spend money. By far the best part of this hotel is the location. Queensway is home to a variety of ethnic restaurants. There was chinese, indian, thai, pubs, italian, fast food and cafes. You name it and it was there. It definately made eating at night easy. There is also a mall about 150 yds from the hotel. They have restaurants on the 3rd floor as well. I will give you our best secret. It is called Marks and Spencer. If you are looking for a quick snack, water, soda or anything to eat in your room, head there. We purchased 2 L bottles of water there for 60p and if you simply want a sandwich you can get them for 1.60 - 2.00 pound. They were great and above all help save a few bucks for dinner. My other advice if you are going is to get a tourist tube card. It can save you alot of money everyday if you use the tube. My last piece of advice would be if you are a student or have students, take you student ID, you can save a lot of money by showing it at all the attractions.

The personnel was rather friendly and helpful, though none of them was English; actually, some of them had little knowledge of the language. The continental breakfast (choice of cereals, yogurt, croissants, fresh bread, toasts, jam, cheese, ham) is fully satisfactory and is included in the price, while full English breakfast can be had for \u00a36.50.

Unlike in many other cities abroad, in London the major problem with hotels of this category (3 stars or below) is the relative size and cleanness of the rooms compared to the price charged. If you're expecting amenities and spaciousness here (as I read in some previous comments), make peace with the idea that you will have to spend at least (!) twice as much. Personally, this time my need was to have just a clean, convenient, comfortable place to sleep and possibly have breakfast while leaving my belongings safely kept during my stay, because I would have to spend all day and evenings out and about in town. Room: Single. It was small but bigger than most you'd find in similar hotels: the space was used rationally so it didn't give me the beehive impression of some unpleasant experiences of the past. The bed was comfortable, clean linens and covers, two pillows... no bedbugs! The room and the bathroom were spotless. Curtains and carpet clean too. The shower was working properly (with good pressure) and of normal continental size. Security: Chain locks on the door and safe boxes downstairs. Breakfast: Good. Offered all the basics: juices, milk and yogurt, choice of cereals, cheese and ham, jams and honey, breads and croissants. English breakfast option upon request (not included in buffet). I'd suggest not showing up at the last minute or you'll most probably have to queue up, the room will be crowded and the staff busier. The breakfast room, may have small iron bars at the windows (as someone pointed out) but at least this one has good natural light... breakfast rooms of other 3 stars hotels were in basements lacking windows and fresh air altogether. Location&Transport: Extremely convenient. I needed to be flexible and independent in order to meet different people in different parts of town and indeed it was never a problem. Besides the tube, look into buses on both ends of Queensway so you'll enjoy additional sights of the city. Note that Queensway tube station is closed until May 06. When I'm flying to&from Heathrow, I personally prefer taking the Express (15 min only vs almost an hour by tube). Paddinton-Hotel: you can either walk (15min), grab a black cab (5\u00a3), or take one of the many buses (one bus stop journey).

The space given to us as a double-room was exactly the size of an almost double bed. You open the door and actually step on the bed, there was no more available space even to stand and get dressed. The restaurant was down at the lower basement with some windows protected by iron bars and we had to wait for almost half an hour in the queue in order to be seated and have breakfast, if someone can call breakfast the poorest buffet i've ever seen. We certainly felt like prisoners going from the cell (- so called room) to the dinning area (- so called restaurant) to have our portion of bread and water (- so called breakfast).

It probably had my expectations higher. I got to the Phoenix and realized the location just wasn't as great. I preferred being in the west end. With the Phoenix you had to take the tube to get pretty much everywhere. One of my biggest problems with the location was that I wanted to go to a club or bar in Leicester Square at night however because the tube stops running at around midnight I would have to find a taxi and pay a lot or take the bus back. I couldn't just walk back in less than 5 minutes like I could at the Charing Cross. Otherwise the location was fine because the tube got you anywhere. As for the room, I got a single room. It was small, but that's fine, I was a solo traveler so I didn't need huge. The bed wasn't great, just average. The room was on the warm side even with the window open. It was pretty clean though. The free breakfast was average...better than nothing as it had breads with all sorts of spreads, cereal, coffee, ham, and some fruit. One thing I noticed is that all the staff was foreign whereas at the Thistle many were British. So some couldn't speak english well. The lady at checkin was rude. So service wasn't great. However, I only paid about $150 for two nights here.

Breakfast was the classic continental breakfast; coffee, tea, hot chocolate, nuttela, marmalade, slices of bread you can toast, rolls, cheese, ham, flakes, musli, youghurt and fruit- I found it more than satisfying.

We were using several kinds of 800 number phone cards, and had to pay an additional $100 in calls when checking out. They charge a very high price for internet access in the public lobby. $3.00 for 20 minutes is not a good deal. They claim to have \"satellite TV\", but the TV's in both rooms only received 7 channels each, while the TV in the pub got several hundred channels.
