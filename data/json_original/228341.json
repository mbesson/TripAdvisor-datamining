Take the U2-line that goes between Pankow and Ruhleben, if you come from Alexanderplatz it's only a few stops. Very nice neighborhood! This was the first time I took my mother with me on a short trip, so we chose a hotel that would satisfy both needs. The room is spacious and well-cleaned. We stayed in a room with shared kitchenette, don't know if it's like that in every room, but we were very pleased with the accommodation. The fact that the subway is so close makes it easy to reach different parts of the city. I've been to Berlin earlier when i interrailed last summer, that time we chose the hostel called 36rooms in Kreuzberg (which by the way is ''the'' place to choose if you want a cheap hostel with friendly atmosphere) so I wanted to show her a little bit of Kreuzberg. I think xberg is the best part of the city when it comes to food, atmosphere and shops..well almost anything! Back to the hotel; the room has a large wardrobe, comfy beds, TV with lots of channels to choose from, a minibar (with 2 free beers and 2 free bottles of water) and not a sign of dirt or whatsoever. I give this hotel 5/5, but we didn't spend the 16e (!) on breakfast, with that amount you expect something special but I've heard that it doesn't stand up to the 16e-standards... haha! PS. if you like sushi, try the restaurant that can be find on Dircksen str., next to the Alexa -shopping mall.

The room, while it was very small (just like most European hotels), had everything I needed in a hotel spending most of my day sight seeing in Berlin. The bed was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom/shower space was great and very comfortable for an American who is used to having much more space in a hotel shower. The shower stall was fully inclosed (not usually the case for a lot of European hotel showers/bathtubs). The room included a great closet space for clothes with a safe to keep valuables as well as a comfortable desk area to sit down and review some work emails on the laptop.

Rather than move me to a room with functioning equipment, he simply said, 'maybe it is best to put it outside the window. It is quite cold out, so that should work.' #2 - Lack of follow-up After replacing the refrigerator in the morning (a half hour task) when it would have been simpler to move me, they did not check to see if it was working later. Unfortunately, neither did I, but I am the customer. My food spoiled. #3 - television went on the blink. after waiting half an hour for them to come up, they went through the same swapping gear derby, only to find it did not work, but was rather a problem with their server downstairs. #4 - the washers and dryers for customers They weren't working, so I had to hump my clothes to their sister property across the road. not a far walk, but still, unprofessional To to all that off, their 'double bed' was two twin beds shoved together.

As our son is living in Berlin he recommended the Dreag Henriette as it was the closest hotel to his apartment.

It is certainly value for money and compares well with UK hotel prices. The Hotel is not the Ritz but is comfortable, extremely clean, excellent breakfast, good and attentive service and staff speak enough English to understand and be understood. The only adverse comment I can make is that the coffee and tea supplies in the room were not replenished without asking and unfortunately there was not enough information about the room facilities and how to use them. Staff were frindly but not pushy, a good point. Bearing in mind the closeness to the U-bahn, twenty yards would be too far, the hotel suddenly becomes very accessible and convenient to all central points. Two stops to Alexanderplatz and Berlin becomes a smaller city.

However, it is just at a subway station which makes it a good point to discover the rest of the city (Berlin has one of the best public transport system I ever experienced). The staff is quite nice, but they did not anticipate our needs. Arriving late in the evening, our room was very hot due to an external temperature of 30C all day long and we realised that there was no fixed A/C unit available. However, the next day they came to fit in a mobile A/C unit which changed a lot the comfort. Otherwise, I found both the room and the bathroom a bit small for this category of hotel, but everything was new, very clean, soundproof and operational. Breakfast was good. The decoration is very much on the conservative side with a lot of very ugly and cheap looking paintings. But it still was a good value at 93 \u20ac per night for 2 with breakfast", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "runcible", "ReviewID": "UR6704547", "Content": "The hotel is of modest size, spotlessly clean, with courteous and efficient reception staff. My room was more than adequate, with a mini-bar, small kitchen area (microwave, sink, one or two stovetop burners, cookware), a well-appointed bathroom, and even a tiny balcony. And it was quiet. When I wanted to make a drink in my room I was unable to find ice, and was surprised that the front desk could not provide any. Since the Henriette does not have a regular bar it was suggested that I go to the bar at the related Derag Grosser Kurfuerst directly across the street. This minor inconvenience I simply note, since it did not detract from my comfortable stay at the Henriette. When I arrived in Berlin I took the S-Bahn from Schonfeld train station (the Hauptbahnhof having been temporarily knocked out by the big storm) to Alexanderplatz then, not really knowing exactly where I was, I took a short taxi ride to the my hotel. It turns out that the Derag Henriette is located just a few yards from an U-Bahn stop, and only a few blocks from Unter Den Linden. It was a pleasant walk to the Berliner Dom, and thence to the Brandenburg Gate, and I suppose it would have been not a bad walk back to Alexanderplatz, had I wanted to do that.", "Date": "January 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading Berkshire", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Situation\u201d", "Author": "bbhmg", "ReviewID": "UR6366837", "Content": "I have stayed in Berlin many times but on this occasion needed an hotel which was \"Central\"... We use Easyjet to fly so this hotel came up on their website and after reading the description of the facilities, I decided to take the family for the Christmas Markets weekend.. Our main disappointment was that the hotel did not help us with a smoking room with bath as requested via the Easyjet site and reception categorically told us that Easyjet had not passed on our requests... Yet the hotel were able to supply us with a third request from the same e-mail which was for adjoining rooms for my family. Otherwise it is an ideal jumping off point for all of Berlin since it is next to a U-Bahn which took us everywhere we wanted. The rooms were nice an warm and we slept well before going down for a great selection off the breakfast bar Across the road is the brother hotel (The Kurfurster) which had quality restaurant , fitness center and a bar which makes a change from the Henriette..........

I got an apartment overlooking the river which was very spacious and very clean with fab bathroom (I mean REALLY good!) and loads of wardrobe space - it also had a desk, chair and table. The hotel itself is not too big with only 54 rooms which means that the 'bar' downstairs is just a small area in reception where the receptionist can get you a beer - but i wasnt planning on hanging around in the hotel much. One thing that I really loved about this hotel was how near it was to the UBahn! -the entrance is literally outside the hotel and its the U2 line as well (markisches museum) which gets you anywhere you need to go. What is also cool is that just up the road (300m?) there is a Spar supermarket with everything you need (beware of German opening times though -til 8 at the latest and not at all on sundays). Its true there is not much to do immediately outside but its only 15mins walk to Alexanderplatz and Museumsinsel is close too. I did visit Kudamm etc but find the old East is much more to my taste - and a damn site more interesting to boot! So if youre looking for a bit of quality at a good price but arent the kind to hang around and eat/drink in the hotel then this place is ideal - get yourself a good city map and off you go!!", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Find\u201d", "Author": "Bequia1", "ReviewID": "UR2806722", "Content": "I had wanted to find a nice, somewhat affordable hotel in Berlin for a recent trip, and wasn't at all sure where to go. All I knew was that I wanted to stay in East Berlin. I stumbled on the Hotel Henriette in a guide book, and it ended up being a very good choice. It's not as \"drop dead\" spectacular as some of the new modern chain hotels in Postdamerplatz, but it was certainly more intimate, and the staff took good care of me. Although the surrounding area may feel a bit out of the way, the hotel is actually in a very central location, on the Spee River virtually across from the \"Museum Island\" with its many museums and the Berliner Dom. The hotel itself is relatively small and modern (and as yet undiscovered by Americans), but it fits with the look and feel of the eastern half of the city. My room had built-in furniture (a bit like a ship) and was on the somewhat small side, like most European hotel rooms, but it was very comfortable and had tons of drawer space and all modern amenities. It also faced the river; a nice bonus (I suggest requesting a river view). The hotel has a nice restaurant and bar, and offers an excellent free breakfast. The staff were courteous and helpful. I would recommend the Hotel Henriette to anyone looking for a bit of (affordable) calm in the midst of this sprawling, ever-changing city.", "Date": "November 4, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Derag Hotel Henriette", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d228341-Reviews-Derag_Hotel_Henriette-Berlin.html", "Price": "$71 - $181*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Neue Rossstrasse 13</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10179</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228341", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7a/59/7a59d94ca0f6dbb85d4b9d2bfc94dcea8large.jpg"}}
