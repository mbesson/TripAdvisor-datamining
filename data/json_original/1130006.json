You get away from the crazy crowds, go up in the hills, stay in a perfectly appointed cabin (carved doors, four-post bed, outdoor bathroom), eat meals far superior to most in Bali (try the tofu especially), walk on peaceful paths, and hike through gorgeous rice paddies and countryside with nice staff as guides.
