However, it succeeds masterfully in its attempt to provide an eclectic, distinctive, and memorable stay in Paris. I'll confess that the same sense of curiosity that initially drew me to the Seven also led me to room-hop during my stay, because I wanted to sample a few different room styles. I spent time in the Close to the Stars room, the Levitation Bath room, and finally the 007 Suite. In each case, the attention to detail is striking. Each room has a distinct personality and uses, among other things, innovative lighting to deliver the goods. Very little is left to chance; the bath fixtures are premium quality; the bed, linens, and bath products are excellent; and the window treatments are stylish, elegant, and effective, blocking nearly all daylight from intruding on the light show inside. Note, please, fellow travelers, that this is a boutique hotel. In Paris. If you are new to either setting, you might be taken off guard by the relatively small size of the rooms, the lobby, the bar, etc. Do not despair. This is absolutely typical of both this hotel type and the city itself. If you want a larger room or a full-service property with a fitness center or other amenities, then select a property that will accommodate those needs. But by all means, do not knock the Seven for what it is not, when what it IS is so wonderful. A large part of what makes it so great is the execution. Great service, a personable and pleasant staff, and impeccable attention paid to delivering an enjoyable guest experience work together to take a stylish offering, and to give it life and pump its soul full of delightful personality. They didn't miss a beat at any level of client interaction. The surrounding neighborhood is safe and quiet. Basic amenities such as 24-hour grocery stores, caf\u00e9s, bakeries, restaurants, etc., are all very conveniently located (typical of Paris), and I enjoyed a number of great meals just a short walk away (look into Le Languedoc, L'Hydrophobe, and Le Tourbillon if you wish to follow in my footsteps). However, there is not nearly as much going on at Rue Berthollet as there would be if you were near, say, Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 or Rue Saint-Germain. But what the neighborhood may lack in character, Seven Hotel Paris more than makes up for.

Having paid \u20ac333 a night, I expected to check-in to my room at the universal time of 14:00. Eventually, we were allowed to check-in to our room, which was indeed ready! Our bedroom was very chic in design but very small and the shower leaked. The hotel stairwells are very tight and dark and finding a way past the cleaners and their trolleys can be a challenge although there is a lift to bypass this issue if you are that way inclined! The big issue as far as my wife and I were concerned was the lack of communal space for a hotel that charges such a premium. There is a small bar and a breakfast room in the basement but that is pretty much it - no lounge, no garden and no communal seating areas dotted around the hotel. The breakfast is good, lots of choice but I guess I'd expect that given the price. Overall, it's OK as a boutique hotel but I would say that it is design over substance and pretty much in-practical in layout and the facilities and the location certainly do not warrant the high price.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cUnique Experience\u201d", "Author": "erinsny", "ReviewID": "UR122820387", "Content": "If you're okay with trying something different, the Seven Hotel Paris is a great choice!

What i must say is that i recommend this place for young people, i can't imagine my parents in the suite sublime for example.(could be possible but a little strange i guess)This is only my personal opinion and i no way a negative point about the place. Its a young,fashion and glamourous place to stay. The only negative point maybe if you are with your car its a little hard to park, i would be great if the hotel had some parking space available for there costumers. You have to find a parking space in the streets nearby witch is not always easy (plus you have to pay) We where lucky it was weekend so it was free. But this is only a little detail no big deal. About the location i can't really express my self because we never stayed near the hotel and when we left we took the car or a taxi. Anyway i give this hotel a 9/10.

We wanted a different experience from the traditional hotels, and this place was recommended by a friend. Also we have a small, very lively... child and at some better traditional hotels, this is not always easy. First, the hotel service at reception and the bar is very kind, professional and helpful. The bartender is a pleasant american chap and we enjoyed hanging out there. i did not agree with all his cocktail mixes, but that was absolutely ok. We did not take breakfast here as we went to the French local bistros around. However, in light of the very positive reviews, it should be pointed out that this hotel caters to a very specific clientele (we are early thirties but felt a bit \"old\"). It is supposed to be hip, trendy and in a way it is. There is nothing really wrong with this. The reason we struggled were two-fold: 1. The rooms suffer from the typical French problem of size: Very small and dark, small windows. The lightening is somewhat cool, but the effects cannot unfold. It is all too cramped. You just cant move around, no storage space or anything. No table, nowhere to sit. Also there are no restaurant facilities and the area has charme, but is a bit rough and does not offer many good restaurants. 2. The biggest issue: The location is far away from the center of town and transportation is not that simple, takes a lot of time. It is located on the subway lines to comparatively rather problematic areas of Paris. The scene on these trains is very different from what you see in the traditional \"better\" central areas of Paris. Especially late in the evening female travellers should be aware. I had no issues, but my wife was not comfortable. In conclusion, unless you are looking for this grungy designer style cozy experience in an off-beat area, you get better value elsehwhere.

Instead of this, we found only a handheld shower, which only made it possible to take a short, cold ( no heating in the bathroom) rince with the little handheld stream. After this prehistoric activity, the whole bathroom floor was soaked, as well as a part of the carpet in the bedroom! I am sorry to write such negative review about this part.

What I liked the least was the wc, located in a separate cublicle really claustrophobic and small (but it could be regarded as a part of the room design...). All in all, a memorable experience that I definitely recommend for a special occasion (not for a long stay). True, it comes at a price, but if you think about it, hotel rooms in Paris tend to be expensive while smallish, worn and without character.

There's the blue lighting in the rooms, rooms doors change colour constantly (colour changing led's). There are places that have done the gimmich tastefully. Here it's just tacky. Location Hotel 7 is located in a rather lively part of Paris. Seven is however on a quiet side street in an old renovated building. This part of Paris is relatively poorly serviced by the M\u00e9tro. The one of closest M\u00e9tro stations in some 800 metres from the hotel. It's not far but in central Paris where you have a metro station in nearly every block this part of the city is not your ideal location if you want to use the public transportation (other than bus) to get around. Hotel From the outside hotel 7 looks promising. When you enter the lobby the tackiness hits you on the face. The lobby area is crammed with odd looking chairs, a plethora of different kinds of lamps, a 3D TV. There's a as well a small bar/caf\u00e9 on the ground floor. They've put a consirable amount of money on the decor - however, at least in my opinion, overdoing it so that it's become tacky. Room I was staying in a \"levitation room\". First when you enter the floor you have the room doors that look like they've been made out of plastic. The coluor changing lighting just adds to cheap look. Once you enter your room you are likely to blinded ... well.... the darkness of the room. Windows are cover bu heavy curtains that are closed even during day time. And once you find how to switch on the lights you are surrounded by the blue led lights: floor, walls, ceiling. The room is normal size in Parisian standards. Else where you might have a bathroom the same size as the whole room. Summary Definately not worh the price I paid: 247 eur per night. At 120 EUR hotel 7 could be ok. But with it's rather remote location and the tacky interior I do not think hotel 7 deserved to be as high up on the Tripadvisor list as it current is. I have seen hundred and hundred of hotels and unfortunately hotel 7 deserves a position below 100 of all the hotels I've been to. There can be cheap hotels that get my full points.

Part of the appeal is the intimate size and situated on Rue Berthollet just off the beaten path, but very close to the bustling area of Notre Dame (10-15min walk). We stayed in the Levitation room. The room was small but perfect for a couple, not cramped. A romantic and sexy feel to the room, different lighting options, amazing shower! great coffee, large flatscreen TV. The levitating bed is very high off the ground but extremely comfortable, we almost wasted an entire day in Paris because we slept in until mid afternoon without waking up once. The service is fantastic, the reception is very helpful with recommendations, item requests are brought to the room quickly and with a smile, and the bar in the lobby has delicious cocktails and a very quiet yet hip vibe. A short (12 min) walk around the corner is a spectacular French restaurant called La Closerie des Lilas, if you're looking for a traditional french meal in a classy and historical atmosphere go here; Hemingway, Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali, amongst so many others have been patrons here. Overall we had a great stay at Seven and will definitely be coming back, next time we'll try and splurge on one of the more interesting suites, 007, On/Off etc...

Everyone I met was exceptionally nice and conversational. This made a positive impression on me because the staff went above and beyond to make the experience personalized - I got shown directly to my room, they explained the hotel features thoroughly, they asked me if I needed a cab etc, I've never had this level of genuine attentiveness at any other 4 or 5 star hotel. Just perfect. This consistent attention to detail is also shown in every inch of the hotel. The on / off suite is like something out of a dream, which incidentally is their motto! - beautiful all white Barcelona chairs, bedding with wrap around drapery, glass incased artistic displays with vintage French novels, miniature antiques and doodads, creative drawings and quotes etched on the glass. The detail and quality is just incredible. There is a bottle of Taittinger champagne in the room, along with a well stocked minibar of high quality products, an iPod radio, a large flatscreen TV, a safe, a big modern bathroom with a large bathtub and mood lighting, designer bath products and bathrobes, a soft quilted carpet, luxury high thread count sheets and the pillows and bed that will make you feel like you are floating on a cloud. It is heaven. The reception area, bar, hallways, entrance, hotel facade etc all display the hip, funky, modern and creative designs that this hotel is known for. Coming from New York and traveling worldwide for consulting work fairly regularly, I've had the chance to stay at similar hotels like the Standard in New York and St. Martins Lane in London. However, I must say Seven Hotel is redefining this niche market, and I sincerely believe that they offer a better value proposition for what you pay for. For example, you can get a designer suite with unrivaled creative detail at Seven Hotel for the same price you would pay for a very small room at St. Martins Lane in London. Excellent value for the price. I highly recommend Seven Hotel to other business travelers or other people that want a memorable funky, hip, modern hotel experience when they visit Paris. This is the only place I will stay at when I'm in Paris now.

I loved the website and think if anything, the hotel was more impressive in the flesh. The best thing about the Seven is the location as you are well away from the hussle and bustle but within walking distance of it. Notre Dame is only 25 mins away and the Metro about 15 mins. Our favourite local area was Rue Mouffetard which is packed with market stalls, deli's, cafe's, bars restaurants and bistro's as well as lots of lovely little shops. The hotel is clean and stylish and the quality of the fittings, bedding etc was very good. I would say that for a four star though it is lacking a few little extras such as bath robes, film channels on tv (hey we were on holiday without kids for the first time in a very long time!) and good quality loo roll!!!! The was a total lack of any information about the hotel and it's facilities in the room, a little booklet would have been great. On the first night we got a fantastic restaurant recommendation and map from the Mexican lady on reception who was extremely helpful, we weren't so lucky the next night when we asked for help from other staff. e did also managed to get locked out in -2 degrees after a late night back from a club and there is no telephone number on the outside of the building......be warned! To be fair it was about 5.30am and someone did show up after about 20 mins of knocking!

On arrival in the afternoon we were made very welcome by the front desk staff Bruno & Colombe who also confirmed our pre booked dinner reservation via the internet through them for the restaurant La Cordonnerie. They also provided us with a map of the metro and directions for later that evening. As we were running slightly behind schedule we enquired with Bruno if it was possible to book a champagne river boat trip for early evening. Unfortunately the one we had seen advertised was fully booked. Nevertheless it was no problem for him to ring around and managed to book us on cruise for early Saturday evening instead and again provided us with info & directions to get us there swiftly. We were booked into the Absolute levitation room which was modern and looked amazing with all the special lighting effects. The power shower was fantastic and looked great behind the glass panels at the top of the bed (only one reservation regarding the shower the glass/ceramic floor laths could have had spacers fit to allow the water to drain better also be careful as they can become quite slippery). Apart from that the whole bathroom unit looked to be of very good quality. The bed was very comfortable and as it was raised up off the floor we could make use of the space to store our luggage as there was only an open style unit to hang clothes in, to keep the room looking minimalistic and airy. The bar area is very impressive visually with glass balls suspended from the ceiling and a 3D screen with bursting 7 logo bubbles. We had breakfast on the last morning - a very good selection of yogurts, fruits, cereals, croissants, pastries and breads. The Hotel is in a good location, if you take the road diagonally to the left of the hotel approximately 10 min walk to Rue Mouffetard where you will find a good selection of restaurants.

We spent 7 nights in the Black Diamond Suite in the Hotel Seven. We had a really enjoyable stay, and the staff (Love and Graciella) were so lovely. They both spoke great English. Our flite was cancelled en route to Paris, so we ended up checking in a day late. I did give the hotel 1 day notice, and they were able to refund 50% of that night's stay. I was disappointed it was not the entire nite stay, since they were not even at full capacity. However, I will not hold this against them. The hotel, especially this room was VERY Expensive. I beleive you can find something less expensive. Or book yourself a regular room here, as the suites are not worth it. Our room was dark. SO very dark.(ie; the black suite) It was trendy and cool for the first day, then it was plain annoying that we couldn't see a thing. Even in the shower it was hard to read the products. The bed was pretty comfortable and the shower head pressure was great. We very much enjoyed our stay here, but I think for the price it wasn't completely worth it. We were never told their was breakfast available in the hotel, I literally found out the day we were leaving. It's not visible (as its in the basement) but I really wish we had known from the start that they did serve breakfast. There was also a fire alarm at night, but we were never told what the issue was. The plus's: this is on a very quiet street with bakery, pharmacie and metro nearby. The bed is comfortable, and the shower pressure is great. If you are looking for a low key, quiet, friendly hotel , this is a great bet. The downside: is definitely the cleaning staff (she arrived after 4pm each day) and after 5 days straight of asking for more handsoap, I gave up. She never did bring it, and never refreshed our other toiletries the entire time. We also very rarely got coffee refreshed in the room. I also really don't beleive she changed the sheets. We had trouble communicating with her. As a former hotel burglary victim. I was probably most upset that the safe is NOT nailed to anything. You can literally just walk out with it.

(Parking costs are at 3.90 EUR/hour but have a max of approx 25.50 EUR/day (which I consider to be very cheap for a big city)) * the room smelled a bit funny (damp) * the nespresso machine hadn't been cleaned and had an old coffee cup stuck in the cup holder * the room was quite small which makes it less ideal for longer stays Conclusion: The hotel is so different and spectaculair compared to other hotels that you easily will forgive and forget any of the downsides. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to have a romantic night in a trendy hotel.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWOW - fantastic hotel, amazing room, great staff!\u201d", "Author": "mills9321", "ReviewID": "UR76451454", "Content": "The hotel was nothing short of just plain amazing. The room was fantastic, I haven't seen anything quite like it. On top of the brilliant room there were some great extras, espresso machine, ipod dock and I loved the many different options for lighting and even smell of the room. The location was great, 10 minute walk and you would be standing next to Notre Dame. The staff in the hotel were lovely, we arrived early and were able to check in, on the day of departure we were able to safely leave our bags until later that day. They always made you feel welcome and answered any questions we had with ease. The hotel is costly but I have no regrets about paying for such a brilliant room. The room was a nice size and didn't feel too small. If you are looking for a place to stay that will make your weekend in Paris that little bit more special then this is the place.

When I go on holiday I expect myself and my children to feel safe and my belongings to be safe in my room. I expect the hotel staff to understand what to do when there is an emergency fire alarm and to be able to pay my bill efficiently. These are minimum requirements.....I booked this hotel as the rooms looked amazing and we wanted somewhere really special and memorable for our once in a life time family trip to Paris. We left feeling exhausted, disappointed and sad , here's why. 1. fire alarm went off 3 times we were in the hotel. First time we were terrified and evacuated down the emergency fire escape which has very narrow treads. I cut the backs of my heels and my elder son nearly fell. We arrived in the lobby with the other guests and the staff were dealing with a checkout and ignored all the people standing around in various states of undress. We asked what was happening and they continued to ignore us until I started SHOUTING! They then told us it was \" a test. I told them that if it was a test, they needed to explain that to guests before hand and not have them crashing down stairs in their pyjamas. Very poor. I told them that the next time an alarm went off now nobody would take the alarm seriously! My husband went to find out what happened later only to be told that it was not a test, but someone's hairdryer setting the smoke alarm off. The second time was during the day with someone smoking in the room. The third time was at 12.50 am. We were all asleep and my husband called to check with reception what we should do. We all came downstairs, in pyjamas again some people in towels only to be told that it was a false alarm in someone's room due to smoking. We asked who it was and were told that they were still in their room - great we said, why do they get to stay in their rooms when we all have to evacuate? By the time I got to sleep it was 2.30 am and I woke up again it 5.30 worrying about the bill - see payment point later - so 3 hours sleep had. 2. room keys didn't work - we had massive problems with our room key every day we returned - we would traipse up stairs only to find our key didn't work and have to go all they way back to reception to have them revalidated 3. security - we had a lap top, a Wii, a set of golf clubs, a portable DVD player and 4 suitcases with us - we returned one day to find our sons' room door completely open - the air con engineers had been in to fix it, but no one had bothered to lock the door again! luckily none of our possessions were missing. 4. security - room safe was not bolted down and could be tucked under your arm and walked off with . . . . 5.aircon - worked intermittently - sometimes freezing, sometimes not at all. When reported to staff, were told there was nothing they could do about it ..hello are they marketing themselves as a 4 star hotel or what? 6. Payment problems - this was quite shocking. There is only one payment point in the hotel in reception which is very small and queues would form. I decided to pay the night before we left, as we had tickets for Versailles early the next day and needed a speedy getaway - Payment wouldn't go through and I was told quite rudely that \"there was a problem with my card\" . I called my bank First Direct, who told me that they were not even receiving a request for payment to decline and that there was a problem with the terminal in the hotel. I told them this but they denied that it was a problem from their end and didn't check their equipment. We were left worrying how we would pay the bill as we couldn't take out \u00a31000 in cash in time. Next morning, same problem - I explained what the bank had said, they called First Direct and had them tell them the same thing - check your terminal - we tried 4 other cards, my husbands debit and credit cards too - nothing worked. Eventually they agreed to call and report their terminal - this was now 8 oclock - and we needed to go. Eventually they put the payment through verbally, but when I checked with First Direct, payment had been requested twice. Note: (I had asked for a discount on the last night as I had only had 3 hours sleep due to fire alarm etc - 50% off both rooms). My bank explained that one had debited but the other was \"pending\" meaning we couldn't draw against that amount - \u00a3850 !!!. I explained that they needed to call and cancel the other request for payment, which they did, but the amount remained \"pending \" for a further week. Horrendous as we had a further 10 days in France. 7.Breakfast was great first day, other days, no pain o choclat or apple pastries, no OJ - nothing extra brought even though it was 9 am and breakfast didn't stop until 11 am. 8. good things - beds are very comfortable and showers great - very trendy interior which was already showing signs of wear and tear after a month. 9. electrical sockets in bed heads came out of their housing when you pulled your plugs out. 10. no english speaking TV of any description - hello 4 star?? 11. local area - street run down with boarded up shops and derelict restaurants 12. staff are young and very sweet but are struggling with day to day operational problems of monumental proportions. My advice to hotel seven?close temporarily and sort yourselves out - you are damaging your reputation and repeat custom by such poor service. My advice to other potential guests, don't bother - great marketing and beds that's all.

The hotel was superb. Although not yet finished ( can't wait to see it when it is) we were not disturbed in any way by builders or workmen, in fact it was very peaceful, rooms were quiet and tranquil, and we were at the front of the hotel, no traffic noise either. We had a 'standard' ( I'd call it plush) ) Levitation room and it was amazing, glass, double, powerful shower (bliss) with lights that changed colour, the comfiest 'levitating' bed in the world, soft linen, and fantastic air conditioning. It was particularly hot and sticky in Paris when we visited and so lovely to return to a cool room. We were mesmerised by the twinkly lights on the painted ceiling, very relaxing. The lighting effects in the rooms were amazing, very different to the norm.The reviewer who said you wouldn't want to leave your room was right, they are fantastic. And a bonus of an espresso machine in the room too, a rare occurence in Europe! I cannot recommend this hotel and it's wonderful staff enough, nothing was too much trouble for them, they were very helpful and welcoming and I wish them every success.
