I would absolutely recommend this hotel. I loved everything about it. Its not a 5 star hotel, so dont complain if you get what you pay for. It was our first time in Madrid and this hotel was great for first timers! The staff at desk are soooooooooo helpful. We asked them everything from tours to extra pillows. They were always willing to assist and help out anyway they could without anything in return. The hotel is 30 minutes away from airport(approx 30 euro). We learned the train system(metro) immediately to save money because the taxis are so expensive. The station nearest to us was Alvarado, which was good to walk in daytime. Not safe at night. The hotel is near EVERYTHING! The taxis are right across the street waiting if you ever need them. The metro is close, the bus is closer. All major avenues with shops, supermarket and main places to eat are right around the corner. The hotel itself has a nice kitchen area with all the necessary things to prepare a meal. Refrigerator and small freezer. Make sure to bring dishwasher fluid and sponge, to wash dishes.The air conditioner worked perfectly. The bed was a little hard but Ive had worse. We asked for an extra pillow because it was just not comfortable and were given it in minutes. Bring your own iron because you have to wait to borrow theirs and they wait to give it to others who need it. It was a very low quality iron but it did the job. The housekeepers were wonderful. I never used the room service but it is available. Wifi was GREAT! Good service and was only $20 euros for the whole 8 days! So happy about that as we Skyped our 3 yr old back home frequently. The walls are extremely thin so if youre a light sleeper this will be an issue with neighbors making noise. I felt extremely safe here and did not use the room safe because I felt it wasnt needed. We just had airport safe locks on our luggage and that was sufficient. I loved my stay here and would absolutely stay here again if I ever come back. I would also recommend this hotel to family and friends.

When I arrived, I noticed that, even though it is near Nuevos Ministerios train station, I wouldn't dare walk to the station from that place at 5,30 in the morning. If you have to take an early train, and you are a woman alone, I would recommend something else. In fact, I decided to take a taxi from the hotel to the airport because they have a fixed price : 30 euros. The receptionists are quite attentive and friendly. The apartments are also nice. They are spacious and comfortable. The problems are that the bathroom, although clean, would need renovation and there's a smell in the apartment which is not pleasant at all. If you open some of the wardrobes, you can smell a funny curry smell. I don't know if the reason for that was that the people in the apartment the night before had cooked curry, but it should be 'cleaned' before allowing another client in. the kitchen is nice, and it has the necessary things to cook.

We stayed there for almost a week last summmer and enjoyed Madrid and everything it has to offer. Spain is one of our favorite trip destinations and although Barcelona is in our opinion a nicer city, Madrid as the country's capital city has a lot to offer. We use public trasportation when in Spain because taxis are too expensive and public transportation is really easy to follow. We also walk a lot so we get to our hotel rooms very tired and ready for a good night rest. The Apartments Plaza Basilica has comfortabel beds, appropriate room size for a European hotel and friendly helpful staff eager to help guests. The rooms comes with a small kitchen and a small refrigerator to store a snack or a yogurt for breakfast, or a fruit and cheese at night, which is very nice when you don't want to get out at night and walk some more looking for something to eat. The hotel is also very well located and we could easily get to the metro stations to get to the attractions we wanted to visit. We love that we could go to a flamenco show at night and returned in the metro and walking to our hotel. We watched little Tv but we used it to unwind after an exciting day, we could find some english channels (mainly news) but we got a good laugh at watching shows like \"Friends\" in spanish :) The hotel is very well worth the money and exchange credits we used for staying there it is a good value. Over all it was a great experience and we would definitely stay at the Apartamentos Plaza Basilica again if we return to Madrid which we intend to.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cGood location but poor sound insulation\u201d", "Author": "hankn", "ReviewID": "UR54984326", "Content": "The hotel rooms are spacious. The bathroom has large towels as well as soaps and shampoos even though it is an \"apartment hotel\". The room has a safe which doesn't need to be paid for. The kitchen has a fridge, 2 burner hob, dishes, glasses, silverware but is missing a microwave and most importantly a hot water urn. There is no way to make a cup of coffee in your room in the morning, unless you take a pot (remember - no kettle), heat up the water in the pot and carefully pour it into your glass. For 10Euro per room they could have easily added a hot water kettle. We had asked for a non-smoking room, but rooms designated as non-smoking is only a recommendation since every room has an ash-tray. The first room we got stank of smoke so we asked to switch rooms. The next room we got was better. This room faces the street. The windows in the living room are double paned glass but the window in the bedroom is single pane glass. Go figure. Even in the living area, the road noise penetrates the room as if the windows were open. So if you are a light sleeper make sure to not get a street facing room. Wireless internet access is available in the room at a rate of 6Euro/hr or 12Euro/24hr. The speed is lousy and there were multiple disconnects of the system for when I was using it.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cSort of like a Motel 6 in a nice neighborhood.\u201d", "Author": "Skimeup", "ReviewID": "UR30319248", "Content": "This is really an apartment hotel which I obtained through Royal Holiday timeshare, and I stayed in a one bedroom suite for four days in April It smelled of smoke though I requested a nonsmoking room. The door lock tumbler fell into a position that wouldn't admit a key so that entailed some involvement with management. Though that only occurred one time, it is indicative of the general state of repair of the place. A maid broke a light and simply couldn't figure out how to replace it - causing the place to be even more poorly lit. While there was a kitchen there was no coffee pot or toaster - and the place just didn't feel very clean to me. The safe didn't work. The bathroom had a bidet - a nice touch except that it took away any area for a countertop where one could put cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. The area to the east is fairly sleezy but the area to the west is a shopping and business area - two or three banks on each street. The best subways would be Cuatro Caminos or Nuevos Ministerios. If you are coming from the airport, take NM - it is about four easy blocks to the hotel. A bit shorter via CC but the transfer takes so much time it is not worth it. Avoid Alvarado Metro stop, especially at night. A bit closer but the walk to the hotel takes you through the sleazier part of town. I felt quite safe coming back at night using NM stop on Metro. There are some restaurants nearby but I didn't eat much there - the Metro is quite convenient to get to the museums and the center of town where it is more fun to eat.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful time at Apartamentos Plaza Basilica!\u201d", "Author": "Lucinarei", "ReviewID": "UR3231065", "Content": "We just returned from a week in Madrid, where we spent 4 nights at the Apartamentos Plaza Basilica. The place was wonderful and we couldn't have been happier! ROOM: The room was huge (especially for Europe!), and had a bedroom, a bathroom, and a sitting area complete with kitchenette. Everything was neat and clean. The bedroom offered two twin beds (which we pushed together with no problem), a nice sized closet and a safe. The bathroom had a toilet, a HUGE bathtub/shower (with excellent water pressure!), a large sink, and a bidet. The sitting room had a couch, several chairs, several tables, a desk, and a TV. The TV had Spanish channels, a French channel, a German channel, and the European edition of CNN (in English). The kitchenette had a mini-refrigerator (complete with mini-bar items such as juice and soda), a \"stove\" with 2 hot-plate type burners, and shelves in which to store food and utensils. They also supplied 6 glasses and plates for your use. If you wish to use the kitchenette, be sure to bring napkins and dishwashing liquid- it's very helpful. LOCATION: It's location is perfect; there are restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping places nearby. The Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is a short 10 minute walk away. There are several bus stops in the area, as well as Metro stations, but be aware that the Windsor Building fire caused many changes in the service around the area. STAFF: The front desk staff was always friendly and corteous- able to answer any question about the area and/or restaurants. Most of the front desk staff speak very good english, although there were one or two for whom it was easier to speak spanish. They will happily change money for you at the front desk. The cleaning staff are very friendly and will always greet you with a cheerful 'buenos dias' or 'hola'! NOISE: The only problems we found were with noise levels, both inside and outside. There were a few noisy neighbors on our floor, and the walls seemed a tad thin at times. On Friday and Saturday night, the street outside was full of people walking to and from nightclubs- and being a little loud while doing it. I clearly heard many conversations while I was trying to sleep. Weeknights seemed fine. RECOMMENDATION: Overall, we loved the Apartmentos Plaza Basilica and would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of staying there.
