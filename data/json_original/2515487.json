I took the chance and I do not regret. The hotel has a great location and is within walking distance from very good restaurants, shops, and attractions, just as the Petco Park and the Horton Mall. There is a lovely park just in front of the hotel and I spent part of my Sunday there watching the dogs play. Despite some warnings on security in some neighborhoods in San Diego, I felt quite confident walking during the night in the nearby streets. The property itself is quite charming for a business hotel. People at frontdesk is very friendly and willing to help, as well as the bellboys. I received some UPS packages and the hotel personnel was very helpful in warning me and to take the boxes to my apartment. The apartment was huge and very bright. Despite the existence of a railtrack just a few yards from the hotel, I did not hear a sound coming from the trains (however, I must admit that the offer of earplugs in the bedroom were quite scaring). I read some reviews of people complaining about the noise but it did not annoy me (my room was located in the 11th floor, if I am not mistaken). The only suggestion that I would add was the unavailability of wifi internet in the bedrooms. There's only wired service which may make things a little bit harsh for someone who's sharing the room with a roommate, just I was. We needed to work on presentations and do research during the evening and it created some odd situations. There's wireless internet at the lobby, though. I did attend to the gym a few times. It is quite small, but very functional - the only downside was that there was only one treadmill working during my stay (I was at the gym 4 times); the other was under maintenaince.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDespite price low quality\u201d", "Author": "Charl3s", "ReviewID": "UR127733559", "Content": "Went for a couple of nights to San Diego. This hotel is wonderfully located in the Gaslamp Quarter of SD. However, there are tracks for railway and cablecars nearby.

The aircon made funny noises during the night, so I switched it off and kept it running throughout the day. The cleanlyness of the room, and particularly the bathroom could have been better. The internet via cable in the rooms was relatively slow, while the WiFi in the lobby was fast and efficient. The gym is small but ok for a hotel of that size. The equipment seemed to be in order.

The toilet had stains and the tub had stains as well. The towels were a shade yellow NOT white. Since the room was big, I was like just two days I can manage. Then I opened a draw and found a half eaten chocolate wrapper & a wrapper with chocolate crumbs on it tucked into the San Diego info booklet that was provided in the room. THAT was the last straw. I called the hotel desk and asked for a cleaner room - I specifically said I did not care about noises or size I just need it CLEAN. The lady at the desk was courteous and accommodated my request immediately. A bellhop came to our room in the next 5 mins with the keys to our new room and offered to assist with the baggage. (Nice touch) Checked into the second room at 10 in the night and found out that the thermostat was broken. I called reception again with this and they offered to send an engineer . We waited for 40 mins for the engineer but a nice security guard turned up saying the engineer had left and if we were specific (????) about the thermostat we can have a room change. After 7 hours of walking in Sea World we did not have the energy to shift yet again and ended up spending the night in a room with no ventilation. Day 2: I went to the reception desk at 9 in the morning and there was another nice receptionist who listened to me patiently and assured me the problem will be fixed. When I returned to the hotel at 11 that night.. the thermostat was set at 40F. When I tried making it warmer I found it was NOT FIXED. Just tweaked to JUST work at 40F. It was so frustrating I almost cried. This time I did call them at 11 that night and requested a room change. Again.. there were courteous. helpful and apologized for the noisy room in advance and we moved into a corner noisy room which had a view.. the yellow towels , the stained carpet and the dirty bathroom counter with some hair (yhewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww) So yeah.. Pros: 1. Excellent customer service and very very helpful concierge desk services - gave us valuable suggestions for things to do at Safari park. Cons: 1. I could go on and go about the HORRIBLE broken down shabby infrastructure and I would never stop. 2. Desperately needs a revamp.Dirty dirty dirty. 3.

Nothing stood out to me as being superb but it worked out for what we needed. The big plus for this hotel is the location! It is right in the middle of the gaslamp district and within walking distance to everything. Just a quick walk across the street to get to the convention center and then over the stairs and back down them to get to the Harbor Drive walking/jogging/biking trail that goes all the way to the airport along the bay. I highly recommend a stroll up the trail for restaurants and attractions like the USS Midway and ferry over to Coronado Island. I used the trail for a running path and it was great! I also got the schedule for the ferry from the concierge at the hotel and took a day trip over to Coronado Island. I walked across the island, but it is almost 3 miles across, so if you aren't used to walking that long or don't have the time, I recommend other means of transportation. The concierge was also great for restaurant recommendations and we enjoyed everywhere they sent us. We also walked up to Little Italy one day for a great meal at Trattoria Fantastico (50% off bottles of wine on Tuesdays!). It is quite a walk up to Little Italy as well, but worth it.

I was on business and came with a co-worker so we shared a room. We loved walking the marina and there were tons of great restaurants to enjoy. That's pretty much all the positive I have to say which isn't really about the hotel at all but the location. There are a lot of homeless camping out at night right outside the hotel. There was some San Diego police biking the area, so it was relatively safe, just didn't make for great ambiance. For a Hilton, I expected better. The rooms were nice with exception to two things that became annoying. The lack of electrical outlets in convenient locations in the room (next to a bed for your phone charger, or next to a mirror for your hair appliances for instance). The full length mirror was on a wall next to the bed. So technically it was not full length at all and therefore useless. My co-worker and I laughed that there were two perfectly suited locations for the mirror but they chose the wall next to the bed. To their credit, there is free cable internet in each room. But the cable is visibly strung in the hallways at the ceiling. It looks so haphazard and cheezy I forgot I was in a Hilton. It looks like some guy came in and drilled a hole in the hallway ceilings and ran cable, well, actually that's exactly what happened. My scary moment came when I arrived at my room before my co-worker and got ready for bed. I was asleep for about an hour when she came in. I sat up to greet her, and to my horror there was a stranger standing in my room. Once I sat up and got a handle on the situation, I was shocked to learn that our room key was given out in error for a bachelorette party. I had the girl call the front desk immediately to stop any more keys being given out to our room and to get the right information for the party. An apology was made but the damage was already done with my mistrust of the front desk staff being able to manage important security details of guests.

(note: this is an edited version of my review, the original was malformed due to my copy/paste error\u2026) Location: Wonderful location right in the middle of Gaslamp area but one is still able to get a getaway from the hustle since the hotel is next to a rather large park, location is especially convenient for car since very quick access to the Harbor Drive (e.g. from the airport). Countless bars, restaurants and shops right in the immediate neighborhood, quite decent deli/supermarket across the K street. Room: I received a large room in the 10th floor, certainly more than big enough for a single traveller. Bathroom was a little bit on the small side, though. D\u00e9cor was rather traditional but not too old fashioned. Room was in very good shape, no signs of usage, stains etc anywhere. Two LCD TVs, safe, good desk for working. Only minor problem was that there\u2019s no Wi-Fi provided in the room and the LAN access had some issues too. Etc: Unlike some reviewers I did not have any issues with train/tram noise despite the room facing the ocean i.e. the railway. Don\u2019t know whether I just got lucky, room in 10th floor made the difference or don\u2019t care that much for city noise but I had no use whatsoever for the earplugs provided.

There was some porcelain damage to the tub that could have easily been fixed but was left ugly and staring at me when I took a shower. There were a few places in the shower that had black mold between the tiles. Again, another easy fix that was overlooked. The room and bathroom seemed fairly clean but the shower had black hair on the walls left behind from a previous guest. Ewww, The door to the bathroom had a broken closer at the top that just hung out dirty, rusted and useless. I'm not quite sure why it was there in the first place because even without it, the door would only stay in the closed position. Parking has gone up to $40 and for the money, I thought that the attendants were a little rude.(for $40 bucks you can open and close the door for me) So Hilton Gaslamp could have been good but it was just OK.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location for Convention Centre\u201d", "Author": "rd4boy", "ReviewID": "UR123769568", "Content": "Stayed for conference at Convention Centre December 2011.

I was on the 10th floor of the hotel (I paid $5 per night for a room on a higher floor) and did not hear the tram but unfortunately the Coaster train was not able to pass through without repeated sounding of its horn which could be heard clearly on the 10th floor. I suspect that most hotels near the rail track including the Hyatt and Marriott would similarly suffer. As for the Hotel itself, we were very well attended to on arrival and the receptionist even arranged for a room fridge to be provided. The room was well-appointed and sufficiently spacious.

However, when I checked in, I was told that I had a room with one king bed. I'm not a picky traveler, and I usually just go with the flow. But I had reserved two beds (for quite a bit of money) very far in advance and was not okay with being given a room different from what I reserved.

It being New Years Eve, they were unable to provide us with a room with two double beds (as all rooms of that type were sold out). It was explained to us that since we had booked through a booking site, they couldn't refund us any money. It did take some time, but we were finally were told that there was a room available with a king size bed and a pull out couch bed. Obviously pull-out beds aren't very comfortable, but this was an upgraded room with a view and our options were limited. I was content at this point.

Bottom line, as a full scale Hilton property, it is missing the extras I've come to expect. The good: 1. Nice location in gas lamp quarter. 2. Very polite hotel staff The issues to fix: 1. Staying with my wife and two daughters--twice in the first three nights I've had to ask for extra towels (total of 4). 2. First night had to ask for extra sheets for the couch. Very surprised that in a suite the couch is NOT a sofabed. Didn't expect that, probably should not have assumed so. 3. Maid service appears to be ok, but for the first 2 days, a water glass my daughter used was left on the table full and remained so, with the \"Hilton\" cover on it, after the housekeeping was finished. Not replaced with a clean glass. Now it has become an experiment to see if it will last the third day. 4. Typically at Hilton's there are robes in the rooms for use. Not here. 5. Very slow service at breakfast--had to ask each day for extra coffee and waited usually 10-15 minutes for the bill, which was slow considering the restaurant was only 1/3 full. 6. Bathroom shower head--VERY dirty, caked with hard water deposits. Either replace or clean. 7. Wireless internet access only available in the lobby. Free internet hotel wide, but what if not travelling with a laptop? Bottom line--Being SPG Gold and Hilton Gold, I spend enough nights at hotels to know that it's the little things which set a hotel apart. While I appreciate the location, the lack of attention to details has me concerned.

Since this is a loft, the windows went up 2 stories and the only way to lower top the shades was through a motor. I couldn't find the switch so I called down to the front desk. I was informed that the motor was broken and wouldn't be replaced for another week. So there was no way to lower the shades. Why wasn't I informed of this when I checked in. How could they be utilitizing a room that the shades can't close. I asked to be given another room, but they told me the hotel was full. I asked what other compensation could they offer.

The front desk (before we were able to say anything) gave us a voucher for $20 each and told us to enjoy a drink at the New Leaf restaurant located in the lobby. AND, whatever we don't use, will be credited to our final bill. That's phenomenal customer service. We received a call around 6ish that our room was ready so we checked in. The room: We had a king bed non-smoking room. This room was huge! Came fully appointed with coffee, tea, free internet, flat panel tv, phone, alarm clock, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap. There also was a desk, in-room safe and lounge chair. The bed was very comfortable. Food: We didn't order any room service, however did eat at the New Leaf restaurant in the lobby a couple times. Service was very good, and the food was good too. The little things: Since the train is located very close to the hotel, they had ear plugs (for free) incase the \"urban\" sounds were a distraction. The front desk was always friendly. The bell hop who helped us load our rental car. My other half picked up a bunch of collector items at Comic-Con and the guy(forgot his name) safely and respectfully helped us load the car with our lugguage and Comic-Con items. Last minute late checkout: we barely got any rest during Comic-con and needed a later check out which they gave us without hesitation or extra charge. We would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great restaurant, great, great great.\u201d", "Author": "ColleenBoston", "ReviewID": "UR116117109", "Content": "The location of this lovely hotel puts it right over the top.

I'm in the Hilton Honors program and frequently stay at Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood and the like, and I can say without reservation that the Gaslamp was the best Hilton I've ever stayed at. Reasons: - The front desk staff was friendly, helpful, and just generally professionally awesome. - Hotel lobby and public areas have been recently renovated and is very clean and well furnished with simple, fresh/modern stuff. - The room and its furnishings, decor, and amenities are in great condition. - Bed / mattress was very comfortable, no potholes. Linens were crisp and new and weren't 50%+ polyester. - My room had a sliding glass door out to a tiny balcony, which I recommend as the clean sea breeze was very nice. I think this might be an upgrade, but if it's just $10 - $20 a night, it's worth it. - Room service food was a cut above average Hilton fare. Pricey, but if you chose the healthy options, very tasty and well prepared. They always got every order right and delivered it in under 30 mins. - It was a two minute walk across the railroad tracks to the convention center. Couldn't be easier, conventioneers! - Plus, if you're at the conference and need to have a meeting but don't have space, you can walk back to the hotel restaurant \"New Leaf\" and meet there, and wine and dine your prey. Food is good here, too. - Right around the corner is the best restaurant district in downtown San Diego. You have dozens of great choices of all types of food and classes of service, and the places are lively and fun to spend time at in the evenings. You can also walk to the movie theater in just a few blocks, and there was lots of good shopping options for those who like that sort of thing. This downtown area vibes as super safe, vibrant, and economically healthy. - It was very easy to get a cab right outside the hotel, even during the convention. A few nits: - When I got to the room there was no mini-fridge. When I called they brought one up right away, but instead of putting it into the furniture that was intended to house it, they stuck it on the floor next to the TV. It worked fine but didn't exactly complement the decor. It was kinda noisy, too. - There is no wifi in the hotel - you have to use the cable at the desk. And it's only 3 feet long. So if you're working all day or want to surf at night, you can't do it on the bed unless you call and ask for a longer cable, which I did. The maintenance guy who brought did so quickly but was surly in the extreme, and it was 40 feet long. Bring your own. - Some folks will be bothered by the horn on the Amtrak train that runs alongside the hotel. You know who you are: you should probably stay elsewhere. Overall, I'm giving a super strong recommendation for this hotel, especially for business travelers.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Grove, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location!\u201d", "Author": "hockeyduck30", "ReviewID": "UR115432403", "Content": "The Hilton Gaslamp was the perfect hotel for my week long stay in San Diego.

The location cannot be beat. It is directly across the street from the Convention Center and directly at the entrance of the Gaslamp District; an easy walk to Petco Park and next to the Hard Rock Hotel. This area is party central. First tip: skip the valet parking that is offered for $30+ per night. We parked in a garage at G Street that charges $3 per night on weeknights; $9 per night on weekend nights, plus $1 per hour after 3:00am. Total tab each day was usually $10 for us. Second tip: Weekday happy hour is a great warm up for the night. Excellent complimentary buffet and happy hour drink specials. Children were welcomed in the bar area, but there is also plenty of adjacent lounge space where you can take your food and beverage. This is important because there is often a long wait for dinner at any number of the area restaurants. Third tip: Understand that you are staying in a downtown, urban location with people who want to be in a downtown, urban location. You will hear noise from the railroad tracks and you will know if the people in the room next to you are having an argument. In our case, the people next door were incredibly intoxicated, loud and unruly. They were quickly ejected by the hotel staff (who also comped us for the night because our room was next door). The next morning, I saw housekeeping cleared two empty 32 oz. bottles of Jack Daniels from their room (to give you an indicator). I don't complain about much, but this complaint justified and was ably handled. Next - there is a laundromat about 5 blocks up the street. There were two college basketball team managers doing their laundry there in the morning, so I felt it was a safe, comfortable choice - although obviously there were many \"lower caste\" users in the area. Many would disagree with me here, but with airlines charging $50 RT to bring anything more than carryon, I thought $6 for doing my laundry was a better value on a two-week trip. Finally, the staff are hit or miss. The hotel has excellent, 5-star quality staff and apathetic, 1-star quality staff. They are pretty easy to tell by their smile (or lack of). Hint: Guests do not exist to provide staff with tips; staff is there to provide guests with excellent service - at which point those who are 5-star will receive generous tips... I have a couple of quick notes after reading previous reviews. First, everything in the downtown area is relatively close and is easily walkable. There is a Hilton Bayfront that is right around the corner for those looking for a more quiet experience and want to stay in the Hilton family and also a Doubletree nearby. That said, all the hotels in this district are within 8 blocks of each other, so there's no reason to pay much more for any one hotel compared to another. Also, be prepared to see homeless people on every block in this area. They are part of the scenery, but not often in your face.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt", "Title": "\u201cWhen they hand you in the ear plug upon check in, you know you are not in the right place...\u201d", "Author": "lmaolol", "ReviewID": "UR91893984", "Content": "very loud... do not expect to be able to sleep well regardless of where they put you up - main building has the incredibly loud train running right in front of it, the supposed \"suites\" in the back are somewhat larger than the other rooms, however, they are facing the Hard Rock, where parties and incredibly loud music runs till 2 a.m. The water in the pool is ice cold.

Our 3rd floor was right above the hotel entrance and the dog park, and it was generally very pleasant with the sliding door open unless someone was smking down below. The trolley and rairoad tracks are very close, but I didn't find the noise to be a problem at all, maybe because I've always liked trains, but also because the louder freight and Coaster trains are only a few times per day. We used the fitness center and pool most evenings. The fitness center is OK for our needs, but doesn't have much in the way of weight training equipment. The pool and hot tub were comfortable and a great place to relax after a cardio workout. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant a few times. The buffet is fairly expensive, but I found the quesadilla to be big enough for two to share, and the low-carb omelet is also big enough to share.

My wife booked a \"romance\" package, which consisted if the usual amenities (bottle of champagne, free breakfast, etc.) in one of their \"loft\" rooms, which was located in an adjacent building connected to the main hotel via outdoor terrace. This property is literally located in the heart of the Gaslamp District, and is within walking distance of just about anything \"tourist-y.\" The location would be great for a baseball fan, as it is within walking distance of Petco Park, or for a conventioneer, as it is also steps away from the monolithic San Diego Convention Center and feet away from the light rail/trolley line (and evidently a switching line for the Santa Fe Railroad as well). The physical property is very much the hip, modern, urban design that is popular in downtown redevelopment projects and is very tastefully done. The property sits in a sort of cul-de-sac, so it is fairly easy to find. Seeing the hotel as we drove up to it, I thought that we had found the ideal location. Unfortunately, this is also where our frustration with the level of guest service started. We arrived at the hotel about 1pm and were informed that our room was \"not ready.\" Ok, that is acceptable. We were also asked for our phone number and that we would be contacted when the room opened, which was to be in one hour...as check-in time was 3pm, I could see this as a plausible scenario..perhaps the hotel was sold out and they simply weren't ready, which is a relatively poor excuse but it could happen. One hour elapsed. Nothing. We had walked around the Gaslamp District and grabbed a bite to eat. We parked our rental car in a metered stall just outside the hotel, so we had to consider that our meter time was not unlimited and we were parked in a two-hour maximum stall. Having not been called yet, we stopped by at 2pm (the promised time), and were told by a differet front desk agent that the room still was not ready, but that housekeeping had been given a \"rush\" order to turn the room around. Ok, now what? As an aside, we overheard another guest next to us trying to check in also, and they were given the same lip service as we were..they were not as understanding as we were. Well, we decided to drive up and down Harbor Drive as we were pretty bored and getting more frustrated. So, we stall and stall and now 3pm comes...still nothing from the hotel. Finally, at 3:30pm, we get a call that the room is ready. We pulled our vehicle up to the valet stand and tell the attendant we only want to check in, which he was nice enough to hold our keys while we did this. (By the way, valet is the only option the hotel allows, and is $35/nt. There are a few public parking garages in the immediate area that are half that price (but with no in/out privileges), so we decided to stash the car in a public garage two blocks over for $18/night and just walk around the Gaslamp District...it worked for us. So we complete the check-in process and make our way to our \"loft\" room. As cool as these higher-priced rooms are. they're not easy to get to, and there are no automatic doors into the area where the rooms are that stay open to allow you to wheel your luggage in. After getting into the room, we wanted to walk around some more, but realized that our \"romance package\" amenities had not even been mentioned to us at check-in or delivered to our room. My wife called the front desk and asked about it, to which the front desk agent stated that they would send someone immediately...waited about one hour...nothing. I called and asked where our stuff was...15 minutes later it shows up. Finally, now we are set, but lost the Hilton \"mo-jo\" we experienced in the Hilton family properties we stayed at throughout coastal California. We certainy did not feel like valued overnight guests at a cost of $250. As a Hilton HHonors member, I chose nothing but Hilton family properties for our entire California honeymoon (Downtown San Francisco - Hilton, Monterey-Hilton Garden Inn, San Luis Obispo-Embassy Suites, Los Angeles-Hilton, San Diego-Hilton) because I am used to their normally great service...and the Hilton Gaslamp was the most expensive one out of all of them, and also the most disappointing in terms of service. Granted, nothing that happened was earth-shattering, but it was enough to make me publicly say that I would not stay here again. Even if I weren't an HHonors member, I would have the same commentary. There is another Hilton property, a beautiful new high-rise, just south of the Convention Center on the waterfront. Not as cool-looking, but certainly another (and possibly better) option. Heck, there is a Hard Rock Hotel next to the Hilton Gaslamp that I would try as well next time around.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "mokate17", "Title": "\u201cJust don't stay here\u201d", "Author": "mokate17", "ReviewID": "UR58150427", "Content": "This hotel is literally about 50 yards from the major CSX train tracks.

As far as the hotel itself goes, I only have 3 minor complaints: 1) Parking is really expensive ($35/day), though cheaper parking exists for like $15 nearby. Still, you are getting almost no discount as a guest. Anyone can walk in off the street and get a rate of $12 per 8 hours for parking there. 2) The bathroom door auto-closes. What could possibly be the reason for installing a device to do this? 3) Would not recommend restaurant for breakfast. It was overpriced and the service was lousy. The room itself is nice. The property itself is also good, and the location is excellent. There's just one real \"gotcha\" that you have to watch out for: It's RIGHT NEXT TO a very noisy train! The train itself wouldn't be so bad, but the conductor blows the horn a ridiculous number of times on each pass. He has no consideration for the time of night, and it appears he doesn't blow the horn just to warn nearby cars or pedestrians. He just likes blowing it, and he does so often. If you are a light sleeper, you will DEFINITELY be woken up at all times of the night and morning by this train. If you are not a light sleeper, you will still probably wake up a few times from it. If you have sleep issues, you definitely should stay away from this hotel and any hotels close to it. I considered changing rooms, but I came to realize that the train's horn was so loud that it would not help. Something to think about if you're going to book here. The Gaslamp district is very nice. Lots of places to eat there, very safe, and 2 blocks from Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres. I took a very nice 2-hour tour there for $9, where they even gave me a free SD Padres cap.

It's directly across from the San Diego Convention Center and there are 2 trolley stops within 1 minute walking. The hotel boasts an earthtone atmosphere and welcomes guests with open arms. There was a manager's reception with complimentary hos d'oeuvres and reduced adult drink specials. The manager's reception was on a Thursday night and I didn't see it any other night of the weekend but really wasn't looking for it. I am upset with the Hilton brand of hotel because I had emailed Hilton through the HHonors desk and I received a response indicating that my concerns had been passed along to the Hilton San Diego Gaslamp management. Apparently, my email from corporate to office was never passed along to the hotel or the hotel management ignored my email. There are a few discrepancies on the website that I pointed out but apparently nobody cares. There are 3 train tracks directly in front of the hotel. Upon check-in, I specifically requested that I would prefer a room not facing the tracks and I was reassured that I would not be able to hear the trains from room 528. The minute I opened the door to my guest room, I could hear the train. I tried to switch rooms but nothing else available. Well, that's fine, I can deal with the trains at all hours of the day and night. I also requested that I not be placed any where near the ice machine/vending area. I was placed directly across the hall from the ice/vending area. I would close the door to the vending area daily and housekeeping would open it. The door was so loud that I finally left the door open. The hotel should invest in automatic door closers that GENTLY close the door to the vending area. Housekeeping was great and prompt and the room was cleaned upon request. There is no mini-bar in the guest rooms even though the website clearly indicates a mini-bar is present. The hotel guidebook placed in the room even explains how to operate the mini-bar but...there is no mini-bar. I, for one, have no problems paying the exorbitant prices for mini-bar drinks because when I am thirsty, I am going to drink. The New Leaf restaurant has a wonderful breakfast buffet and patrons may order from the menu as well. The breakfast food is very good and reasonably priced. There are many many staff members working in the restaurant during breakfast. However, the night staff member, Michael, has to run the whole show by himself. Not only is he the bartender, he is also the server and the wait was 40 minutes from the time the steak was ordered until it was delivered. The menu located outside The New Leaf restaurant indicates that a NY Strip steak is available...however... it's not. The hotel does not focus on details and that disturbs me. But, it's personal preference. The hotel room was fine. The rooms are smaller but normal for California. The rooms are nicely appointed and lighting is VERY good for a hotel. The bed is comfortable but the pillows are simply awful. I am not sure why hotels think everyone wants super fluffy pillows?!? Hotels should invest in posturepedic pillows or make them available upon request. The guest rooms feature what appears to be a 42 inch flat screen LCD television. The only drawback is the hotel does NOT offer ANY stations/channels in HD broadcast. I would prefer a normal TV with standard definition versus a LCD flat panel without HD. The TV features typical hotel programming with one of those funny remotes that do everything except allow you to simply turn up the volume and/or change the channel. The bathroom is nicely appointed and has automatic lights. The automatic light engages when the guest enters to the bathroom but stays on for 20 minutes and I find this wasteful. Shower pressure is fine. Crabtree and Evelyn products are available for your disposal. All in all, this hotel is very nice and well appointed.

We had faxed the hotel several weeks prior to our arrival and asked if we could have an early check in for the above reason. After a short $10 cab ride from the port, we arrived at the hotel around 9.15am. There were no bellmen outside, so we took our cases inside ourselves. The check in guy \"Ricky\" could not have been more friendly and helpful. We had booked our room on points and as we were Diamond Hilton Honors members, we were upgraded to a loft suite and were given comlimentary water and chocolate. Although again with no bellman, we got our own cases our room, perhaps the bellmen were on break. Our room was very nice, modern, big bathroom, plenty of pillows and a really soft and comfortable bed. There was also a writing desk with free internet access, although \"hi-speed\" would not have been a correct description, but it was free. In the lobby was an airline check in terminal. I used this to check in or uor flight the next day and although slow, it served it's purpose and eventually spat out our bording passes. Our room had a large flat pannel tv with plenty of channels to choose from. There was an easy chair and footstool. The footstool looked like it had coffee stains on it and also one of the \"Clean\" towels had brown stains, but I don't think that was coffee. We decided that as we had the day to ourselves, that we would visit the San Diego Zoo, again that was only a short $12 cab ride away. We spend a great couple of hours there. The animals, including the Giant Panda's all seem so well looked after. When we returned to the Hilton, bellmen were everywhere The hotel is very central and right on the edge of the Gasslamp quarter which is packed with bars, nightclubs and restaurants. On the weekend it can get a bit rowdy. We ventured out and ate at one of the many Indian restaurants in the area, we had a couple of beers in one of the Irish bars and listened to a live band. As Hilton Honors Diamond members, breakfast was free and we were given vouchers which even incuded gratuity, that was nice. The breakfast was a full buffet with hot and cold foods and an egg station were you could get eggs or an omelete to order. As much juice and coffee as you wanted, plenty of fruit, health drinks, etc. Full marks for the breakfast, the only minus was the serving staff talking and laughing at the tops of their voices whenever there were more that 2 of them together, I could not tell you what they were discussing as I do not speak Spannish, although they all found it very entertaining. This was very distracting when trying to enjoy a quiet breakfast and also made it difficult to get their attention for a coffee refil. Across the road from the Hilton is a deli, where you can stock up on supplies from soda and beer to breads and salads. We bought a large fresh and very tasty tuna salad for just $6 The next day we called down to have our luggage collected and within 10 mins there was a bellman who took our luggage right to the taxi, ceckout was a breeze.

The heated pool area was kind of small, but it was good for the kids. The Jacuzzi only seats 4, however the temperature was just right. It was great to come back after a day of sightseeing and going to the pool. For the gold Hilton Honor members, there are no executive floor lounges, however they do provide you with breakfast coupons to be used in the in-house restaurant. The service staff was great. They were friendly and efficient. It is a standard breakfast buffet with an omelet station. The food quality was good and fresh. I\u2019m a starbucks drinker and the coffee wasn\u2019t bad. It was freshly brewed. The fresh squeezed orange juice was also very good. I think the normal price for the breakfast buffet is $12.95. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with my stay at the Hilton. The location was perfect. It is within walking distance to most of downtown. The staff was courteous and professional.

The hotel is split into two parts - the main hotel or The Lofts, accessed by a private elevator. I was staying in The Lofts, amazing rooms, and upgraded to one with a whirlpool bath. Large oversized rooms await for you in The Lofts, very comfortable king bed, large lounge area, 42\" plasma, games station, fridge for your goodies, coffee machine, and then separate bath and separate shower room with window into the lounge area. Staff really great and accomodating, very present and willing to help. Pool area is small, and can be noisy as it overlooks the tram and amtrak railway so you do get the clanging of the railway crossing bell and the sound of the trains horn.

First, the room they gave us was nice at first glance but upon closer scrutiny there were minor problems like the shower head was defective, the toilet had a leak, and the knob in one of the lampshades was missing. Second the location was right in front of the tracks so if you are a light sleeper then better bring some earplugs. Third we stayed for 6 days and upon checking in I requested for a fridge since I had my family with me. They told me that they will bring it to my room as soon as it becomes available. It never came although the rooms next to us received theirs even if I came earlier. I know what I am talking about because I saw the refrigerators out side the rooms near us. Lastly there were 3 occassions that I had to call the cleaning ladies attention with regards to our daily supply of toiletries which she forgot. I have been using Hotwire for the past couple of years and never has this happened to me. I was always treated as if I was a regular paying guest. Anyway as I've said, this is not a complaint just an observation. If someone asks me if I would like to stay again at the Hilton Gaslamp I would definitely say yes.

This was in contrast to the Hilton Bayfront, newer, that required traversing through the Convention Center at night with what seemed to be questionable people hanging out. The room was nice. It had a good flat panel TV but running in analogue. One TV movie costs $14 rental and could have been found for 99c at the Redbox rental. The view was very nice and I plan to post photos taken from our windows. The Commuter Trains ran directly outside and presented little more noise that the SF Cable Cars. The worst noise came when a Truck was blocking the tracks and one of the Red Cars repeatedly released the attack of his horn for what seemed to be a very long time.

For breakfast I can definitely recommend The Cheese Shop! They have a full breakfast menu all day, and it's less than a 5 minutes walk.

I'd like to start by telling people to take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. The hotel is very nice and the service is great. If you think the trains will bother you, all you have to do is ask them if you can stay on the quiet side. We got an incredible rate through Priceline and within a day I called and asked about getting a king bed and a room on the quiet side. When we showed up that morning, it was all taken care of and the room was perfect. The rooms have plenty of space and we had something similar to a 42 inch flat screen in our room. The temperature was always spot on and there were no \"sensors\" or anything hitting us as walked around in the dark. The sensor that turns on the lights in the bathroom was actually a nice plus. The beds were large and very nice. The maid service was perfect and smiling and our rooms were clean when we got back daily and they always had extra towels and things if we asked. We also had FREE high speed internet in our room to plug into our laptop. A great thing these days. Considering we didn't plan on eating or being in our room alot because we were going to Coronado, the Zoo, La Jolla, Old Town, Balboa Park, etc there was no need to eat in the restaurant downstairs. This hotel is in one of the best restaurant districts in town and there are streets of places to eat within a one minute walk. There is no reason to use that restaurant. The Concierge there was one of the friendliest people and he set us up with zoo tickets and had daily ideas for where we could eat. The staff was just as friendly at the front desk. It took us maybe 10 minutes to get to either Balboa Park/The Zoo and Coronado. Seaport Village is down the street. Little Italy is 5 minutes away and Old Town maybe 15 minutes. La Jolla and Mission Beach are about 15-20. The only negative I could come up with would be parking and it is overblown. It is $32 to valet every night but there are 2-3 lots with cheaper rates and with in and out pricing if you are on the move.(one lot was $5 weekdays in and out and if you stayed overnight $10...so the total would be $15...more on weekends.) They are within blocks. We mostly used the meters and after 6 you were set. You just have to read when they street sweep. Even on the weekends we mostly found places. But you have to realize where the area is and what is around. So it did not bother us. Overall this place was a perfect location, was extremely nice, had a great staff and was a place I'd recommend to anyone. We travel alot and I've learned that you have to take the negatives and put them into perspective when it comes to your needs. If you are looking for a nice 4 star place, with a great location and in the middle of many places to eat and go out to...this is it.

Other than that no complaints. The bed was comfy and the furniture was in good shape. The lobby and restaurant however were another story. The restaurant has a unique configuration. It appears that the architect or designer tried to make it like living room furniture and that is just not comfortable for restaurant dining. Not to mention the poor service. The food was cold and when part of my mother's order did not arrive the server said \" Oh I just put it on her plate.\" That meant my plate. Ummm...eww.

They called back and said that they didn't have any on site but had sent someone across the street to get him some! The Advil showed up less than 10 min. later! I was very impressed!

Everything you need is within walking distance, so no need for a rental car or taxis, once you arrive. Despite being in an active area, we found our room to be quiet. Some previous reviewers have mentioned noise from the nearby train tracks, but we didn't have a problem - the light-rail trolley isn't noisy at all, and the Amtrak train only came by once a day during the daytime. The hotel has a stylish, modern, boutique feel. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The restaurant doubles as a sophisticated little bar in the evening (nothing loud or crazy). Our room was well maintained and very comfortable. The lighting was a bit quirky, with VERY tall bedside lamps that were difficult to turn off or on while lying in bed. The bathroom light operated by a motion sensor, so it came on as soon as I entered, even in the middle of the night, before I could close the door (so the light shone out into the bedroom itself, waking my wife).

I booked several months in advance for a King Terrace Loft Suite in the 5th avenue section, yet when I arrived, the hotel staff placed me in a downgraded King deluxe guest room (essentially with a bed, a TV, a bathroom, and a little chair in the corner). I called the front desk to figure out what happened, and the young lady stated that I was, in fact, staying in a King suite. I had to explain to her that this room was indeed NOT a suite and not the King Terrace Loft Suite that I specifically booked and paid for. Well, this was 11pm at this time, and of course, there was no King Terrace Loft Suite available in the hotel. However, the staff did anticipate that some guests would check out and \"free up\" one of those rooms tomorrow - that my \"chances were very good\" that I'd get transferred the following day. I'm a reasonable guy, but I had a tired wife an 18 month-old child. We slept in this small room and were transferred to the suite that we actually booked the following day. Overall, it seemed like the staff was doing this begrudgingly, and that I was getting some special favor despite me showing them a printout of my reservation stating what I had booked. There was a very helpful young lady the following day at the desk who apologized for the mishap and gave us a voucher for a free breakfast at the New Leaf (delicious). The King Terrace Loft Suite was a beautiful, spacious room with contemporary colors and a splendid bed. The view was not great - it overlooked the Hard Rock Hotel across the street that was being built & had pretty noise construction.. not the fault of the Hilton. The bathroom was gorgeous with plentiful, high quality toiletries, a jacuzzi tub, and a large glass shower. However, the next day, my laptop's CPU had this weird meltdown - frying the internal circuitry while it was plugged into the hotel's outlet. I have no idea if this was related to the outlets there, but Apple's repair department said they'd only seen this particular crash about 2-3 times before. I would've chalked this up as a coincidence without laying any blame on the Hilton.. but on the same day, my plug-in clock/ambient noise maker froze and would not turn back on - never happened before or since. A few hours later, we smelled a terrible burning coming from the bathroom, only to find one of the wall lamps smoking. The hotel staff sent up a repairman a few hours later to take care of it. I really didn't think the room was safe from an electrical standpoint.. imagine that? Location is very centrally located - parking deck right down the sidewalk which was inexpensive and next to Petco Park. There is no need to pay the exorbitant valet fees, which are approaching $40/night. The gorgeous convention center is literally 1 block away.. overall, this is a pretty nice hotel in a fabulous city. The stay, however, could've been better - but for the most part, it was enjoyable. My advice to hotel management would be to explain to the front desk workers about the definition of a suite, and to never change a guest's previously booked room unless it's an upgrade. These types of things are enough to make me think twice in my future trips to San Diego about whether to spend them at this particular Hilton.

Its also right at the start of blocks upon blocks of restaurants, shops, bars, etc. We couldn't have asked for a better location. The room was good. We stayed on the side overlooking the lofts. We looked down onto a cement courtyard. Not very interesting. Noise was never a problem for us, and we stayed through the weekend. We were also in the room right next to the elevator shaft, and we never heard that either. My only complaint is the shower. The first couple of days the drain was slow, but the water did go down. Then one day, the drain wasn't working, or it was very slow. I played with plug in the shower drain, but didn't really want to touch it because it was rusty around the edges. By the end of my shower, I was standing in 2 inches of water. The next day, the drain was back to what it had been. Never enough to complain, but annoying. And with how nice the rest of the hotel and room were, I wasn't impressed with the shower. Like I said, it was rusty around the drain, and the metal disk between the shower head and shower wall had fallen off so that it was hanging around the neck of the shower head. And it seems like a lot of hotel bathrooms, there wasn't a fan in there. So we dealt with steamy mirrors every morning. And the lighting wasn't great. Hard to put make up on in the morning.

There was some big event half of the week that used the patio and everyone was all dressed up so everytime you left the room or tried to go to your room you felt like you are interupting something. And don't expect your room to be cleaned until REALLY LATE or REALLY EARLY. I bet you the cleaning cart stayed in our hallway at least 6 hours everyday ( and we only had about 10 rooms). We gave up on it after the 3rd day. The room service was okay just really expensive. The sports bar down the street is AMAZING!

We arrived early in the day (around 12 Noon) and had already planned on waiting for a room on an upper floor (thanks to Trip Advisor). The desk clerk actually gave us that option, before we even asked. It was worth the wait for a 12th floor room facing the Convention Center - great sunset view and high enough to avoid the train noise. The room was average size with interesting decor, a great desk, huge windows and a very comfortable bed. No refrigerator but they offered to bring us one when I asked. Good lighting in the bathroom, plenty of hot water and soft, fluffy towels. The housekeeping service was excellent the entire week. We did not have time to use the spa but I did get a tour. The first impression is not great because the entrance leads right into the hair salon which is busy, noisy and too brightly lit but once you get back into the spa, it becomes much quieter and everything was spotlessly clean. The one major negative we found was the price of the mandatory valet parking - $30 per day! I understand this is a city hotel but this seemed higher than any of the nearby properties.

The hotel is updated and very modern looking. The front desk was just wonderful. They were great from check in until we said our farewells on Friday. We had a beautiful room on the 9th floor on the corner (meaning we had a window on each wall) that overlooked the conv. center. The pool area may look small but it was perfect for the amount of people that used it. The fitness center was updated with all new equipment and was good for the amount you might need to do on vacation. The location was key for this hotel. Anyone that is attending a Padre game or wants a place that is close to shopping and restaurants this is the place to be. The tram picks up right in front of the hotel also. Some things I have read are very true like Parking cost and noise. Let me explain a few things. There is a parkade parking ramp on the corner of 6th and k (about a two block walk) that is much cheaper than the valet parking at the hotel (which is 30.00 a night) The cost at the parkade is either $8.00 overnight on a non event night and $12.00 on event nights. This option worked well for us as we would leave in the morning and come back later in the day. If you need to come and go many times you might want to do the valet parking as that is unlimited come and go options. The next thing is the noise. Yes the train and tram go past many times and you can hear the crossing things ding and the noise of the tram also. I got numb to it, and it really did not bother me. My husband is a lighter sleeper and it did wake him up during the night. My answer to this is, if you are staying at a downtown hotel you should expect noise in any city. Just be aware that it might be a factor if you are a light sleeper. I do not take these into account when I rate this hotel as like I said I expect to pay for parking and to have noise when staying downtown. The location is right next to the Gaslamp District. You easily can walk out your door and dine at the most casual to your nicest steak and seafood type place. With outside seating this area is beautiful. There is all types of food to choose from also. I booked this hotel thru priceline and I am so glad this is the one that met my match. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that might be going on vacation or has a event at the convention center (right across the street). A big thank you to all the people who worked at the hotel from the front desk to the maids that brought us towels after we forgot to take our DND sign off the door and did not get maid service that day.

Front desk was exceptional! Always friendly, courteous and willing to go the extra mile. When I've stayed at hotels before and they knew that I purchased the room through a discounter (priceline, hotwire, etc) I would receive nominal service and probably a nominal room too. Not the case with this hotel! My entire family stayed for a mini-reunion (we had kids all the way through my parents who are in their 70s). The only thing I would say otherwise is that this hotel is probably geared more towards the business traveler or the adult who is looking to stay in the midst of the vibrant downtown scene. Not too much for my niece & nephew who are both under 6. Pool is ok, but small and not much of a \"playzone.\" Lastly - the day spa that's attached to the hotel, Artesia Day Spa is absolutely awful. I booked a massage for my sis-in-law to surprise her for her birthday (which was the day we arrived). The first person who booked my appointment was friendly. However, when I called on the day of the appt to inquire about pushing back my sister's appt since we were delayed in our travel plans, the receptionist took that as me cancelling my appointment and didn't even call to confirm. So when my sister and I showed up (on time since we rushed to the hotel!) at the spa, we were met with the rudest employee who told her that her appointment was cancelled and there was nothing to do they could do about it. However, the masseus that was going to be assigned to my sister was standing right there (they were looking at her to see if she'd stay and the masseus walked out the front door). Then when we asked if there were any other appointments available during our brief stay, we were met with a stern no. When I left the spa and went back to call from my room to speak with a manager, the receptionist told me that she didn't know who the manager was and that managers had weird schedules - in other words, she knew it was me trying to speak with someone higher than her.

Another plus is that the hotel is very close to both the gaslamp restaurants, convention center, and the Trolley - prime location. Some things to consider if you want a room here: Parking can be extremely expensive everywhere in the Gaslamp - the area is deliberately not car-friendly. On a Saturday night, just use the hotel valet service. Be careful because they charge up to $30 a night - but the service is really nice if you take your car out all the time. Best bet is to be dropped off or find another way here and forget the car. The room furnishings are adequate, although people who pay over $200 a night may find themselves wanting better quality. Trains and Trolleys pass by the convention center side, but with windows closed it's not a big deal at night. I thought the bed was wonderful - I had trouble getting to my conference sessions :-) Service in the lobby restaurant is great, although the food is pretty basic fare.

While there was nothing significantly wrong with the suite, it certainly wasn't worth the amount we paid. Essentially all we got for the money was some extra (empty) square footage and a bedroom door. The suite's furnishings were very middle-of-the-road standard-issue Hilton stuff. Not awful, but not particularly comfortable, and certainly not luxurious. The bedroom, while fairly good-sized, was furnished with only a king sized bed, two nightstands and an armoire containing an old, rather small television. The bedroom had plenty of space for at least a chair, or possibly even a love seat, but there was nowhere to sit down except on the bed. The living room was furnished with a love seat (hard/uncomfortable), one upholstered chair, a small desk and another armoire containing an old, smallish TV. While both armoires had a space for a minibar, neither actually contained a minibar. At this price point, I would expect a minibar, as well as a reasonable-sized flatscreen tv. Positives: the hotel's location is convenient to the Gaslamp area. The bed met the new Hilton standards and was very comfortable, with nice quality sheets and a duvet. The lobby bar servers were pleasant (though if the hotel wants to be \"hip,\" as its literature claims it is, it needs to ditch the very unhip music in the bar!) The Hilton does have a \"hotel within a hotel\" called the Enclave, which sounds like it's trying to compete with W and similar hotels. We could have stayed there for only a little more money. Perhaps we should have. The problem is that the Enclave rooms, while large, are apparently all \"loft style\" (i.e. one continuous space) so that wouldn't have worked for our needs.

Therefore, there is a clean, soft cotton sheet on the top of the comforter too, so you never have to touch any part of the bed that isn't brand new clean for you! The bed is a pillow-top and the mattress pad also has a pillow-top. Finally, there are five down pillows on a king size bed. The location of the hotel is great. We had dinner and drinks in the lively Gaslamp quarter; we walked to and from dinner and the bars. Petco Park is about 3 blocks away and we almost made it to a game. The area is very alive when the Padres are in town; also, with at least three universities around, the spring break night life was vibrant. The Gaslamp entertains a predominately young crowd, but we never felt out of place there. Every morning we ran down to the harbor from the Hilton and there is so much activity along the marina, with many shops and restauants. Again this area is not even a mile from the Hilton. The service at the Gaslamp Hilton was perfect. The staff was helpful with giving directions and gave great advice about restaurants and places to go. We had a great dinner at the Strip Club (steak house, not girls), and a wonderful breakfast at Club 222, both in the Gaslamp. I would definitely stay here again, but I would ask for a room far far far away from the train; I didn't think it would bother me, but it did. And, I will try to avoid the $30 per 24 hour garage, which we couldn't avoid one day.

The restaurants in the area are pricey for what they are but not outrageous. If you have a car and want to eat at good more moderate restaurants where you are not paying so much for location drive up 5th avenue away from the hotel and the water until you come a few blocks to the end of 5th Avenue which would be University Avenue. There are many very good moderate restaurants over there. We stayed in the 5th Avenue Lofts part of the hotel which was different and fun. It had a modern feel and was not a typical hotel. The hotel is small and had the feel of a boutique hotel rather than a large Hilton which was great. Pool was very tasteful as were the seating areas and the gym was adequate. Room service was prompt and pretty good for a chain hotel. Staff was very polite and considerate. Our climate control was not working properly. They offered to move us which we declined as it was not a big deal but they did comp our breakfasts during our entire stay which was great of them. Also the room was not made up when we returned one day at 5pm. In response to our phone call they made it up immediately, apologized that the housekeepers were behind and sent us a complimentary cheese plate. Yes there is noise from the nearby trains. It did not bother us and did not seem to be a problem at night but one could request a quiet room. Hotel parking is very pricey and we parked at a garage a block away for half the price. Also from 6pm Sat through Mon morning you can park on the street without feeding the meter which we also did. The arm chair in the room was alittle worn but nothing major.

However, my husband didn't sleep as well and still heard the trains throughout the night. The room was very quiet otherwise. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we have no regrets. The view from our room and the friendly staff are what made it most enjoyable. We were celebrating our anniversary and I would have like a little more luxury, but it was fine for the price we paid on priceline. I would say it is a very nice three star hotel rather than a four star though. Local attractions tips: Almost all the attractions in San Diego have a web site... including the Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village and the USS Midway. Use a search engine and get information before visiting. The Gaslamp Quarter site has restaurant descriptions, prices and menus... very helpful. Tips: If you are a Hilton Hhonors member, you will not receive points when booking through a third party, such as priceline.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cNice; really nice.

When I directed them to their corporate web site, and again inquired the next day, they gave me four or five brouchures about San Diego I could have picked up anywhere.

Price aside, you are in the heart of the Gaslamp district, excellent if you want to experience the nightlife or a Padres game. Petco is only 3 short blocks away, although I didn't attend a game. The rooms themselves are fairly standard for what you would expect from a 3 or 4 star hotel. The beds were excellent, but the size of the rooms and bathroom are what you what you would expect from a inner city hotel. Standard size. Hotel is on the \"hip\" side with their furnishings and artwork. Lobby is nice, didn't really interact with the staff although the maid was thankful for the tip we left. I appreciate when the maid is thankful for tips you leave. Valet was good, although keep in mind that parking is $24 a day. An alternative after you've dropped off your belongings is to park at the 6th Avenue Parkade which services the ballpark. Its two short blocks away. Its city owned and its $13 a day, although you don't have in and out priviledges and if there's a game on you have to pay $10 event fee. We missed going in during game times so I don't know if its more if you leave it overnight. They do at night have $1 per hour charge with a $6 maximum and its a little convoluted after that but it was only $13 and $8 the two times we left it overnight there. Best to search the Gaslamp district site and call the parking garage if you are thinking of parking there. Didn't have any problems with the trains which pass by about 40 feet from the hotel. The trolleys make little noise but the freight trains make noise but it didn't wake me. Noise from the hallway was much more distracting which was considerably louder. (think people coming back from the nightlife from Gaslamp) Hotel is also about 300 feet from the convention center and about 6 blocks to Seaport village, which heightens its location rating.

The room lacked many advertised amenities. No Robe, no Frette linens. The continental breakfast featured unripe and unedible fruit.

I'd never heard such a thing, and later, having seen amazing reviews of the Hotel Estancia in La Jolla (I'll be reviewing that also), decided to reduce my reservation at Hilton Gaslamp to 1 night and book 2 nights at Estancia. Thank goodness. The location is convenient to the Gaslamp area, and right near a trolley stop. The decor is really nice and stylishly minimalist, yet light and airy. The bed was comfortable, and a man at the front desk recommended a great Mexican restaurant on Coronado (Miguel's Cocina, if you're interested), for which we were very grateful. Other than that, we had some definite problems. 1) I requested turndown (they asked what time, I said before 7, no problem, ma'am). Never showed up. 2) I asked for a feather pillow, but they said they were all out (okay, I admit this is a small thing) 3) We showed up at the executive lounge for breakfast about 10 minutes after the official opening time. The hostess had CNN blasting from the TV while she worked with the door open, so loudly we could hear it from the elevators, despite the fact there must be some people still asleep at 6:10am. The hostess was making a terrible racket, tossing cutlery into cutlery drawers, and clanging cups and bowls onto the shelves. She looked at us and continued at it. I said good morning to her, and then after a few seconds, she replied. After that, she didn't say a word to us, just kept loading and unloading extremely loud tableware and juice bottles not more than a few feet away from us. - it was like we were eating next to a metal/glass recycling truck. I didn't notice her greet subsequent guests, either. Evidently she wasn't happy in her work. 4) I was lucky to get a bath in the evening, because from the late evening onwards, there was absolutely no hot water. When we checked out at 1PM, my husband still hadn't been able to take a shower -Worst of all, when my husband called to inquire about the hot water, and later when we checked out, there was no concern or apology on the part of the staff for the lack of hot water. 5) While my husband was checking us out, I started to roll out the luggage to the car. Two valets stood there and watched me roll the luggage (1 trip for each piece) from the lobby, then just as my husband arrived, stepped forward to help. Not that I couldn't handle the luggage, but an earlier offer would have been standard at other hotels. I guess what I'm trying to say is, each of these factors in itself might not be enough to keep me away from the hotel, but taken together, I think I'd rather go back to the Estancia, or try someplace new.

We've stayed at the Hyatt and Marriott before, and they are very nice, but for price and amenities, the Hilton Gaslamp can't be beat.", "Date": "November 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat San Diego Choice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2818004", "Content": "The Hilton Gaslamp in San Diego is the perfect hotel to suit all of my business needs.

Friendly staff were very helpful from check in to the concierge who went out of her way to find great restaurants and shops. The feel of the hotel is very modern and the decor is great. We enjoyed the Enclave - a hotel within a hotel which was a 5 star experience. You can't go wrong at this property. We were planning to stay at another property and a friend encouraged us to try this hotel. We switched our reservation and are glad we did!
