Everything from the Ritz to Motel 6. I know what people look for in a hotel. My family and I were looking for clearn, affordable and safe while we visited my dad in South San Diego. We knew we would not spend time at the hotel, so we decided to not spend too much money but wanted something clean and decent. This hotel had good customer service. The lady at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was decent. That is about the extent of the positive. Now for the real problems: Our kitchenette sink was clogged when we arrived. The room smelled bad. The furniture and carpet was dingy. The manager who came into my room to unclog the sink, left a 12 inch knife ( very sharp) right on the bathroom sink area that my two year old found and handed to me!!!! This was that straw that broke the camels back and mine! I was shocked. His reaction? \"oh. I forgot the knife\" oooops! Then, I called down for a roll a way bed since the couch was so smelly and dirty for my three year old and he said, \"sure no problem\". I only found out later that he would charge me for this without informing me of the price or the fact that there was a charge in the first place. His explanation? \" this is not a cheap motel maam\" Only cheap hotels don't charge for roll a way beds. What? made no sense to me at all. When I saw the knife, I should have just grabbed my family and ran for the hills. The location stinks too! You are surrounded by industrial toxins and huge trucks in line to cross the border. It is way out of the way from anything remotely interesting....( except for Mexico) if you you happen to have your passport with you. The only reason I gave this hotel any credit at all was their nice front desk lady and the comfy bed in the room.

The staff were really friendly, although the woman on the front desk gave us some embarrassing advice regarding a nearby restaurant: she told us it was too far to walk with our luggage (four 'long' blocks) and called us a cab; turns out it was literally around the corner and resulted in a very annoyed cab driver (who'd taken the job after his colleague didn't bother showing up at all) and us over-tipping in embarrassment. The only other complaint we had was that the walls in our room were extremely thin. We could hear people snoring in the next suite along!

This is not near downtown San Diego. If you want to walk there it is not going to happen (hence my 4 star and not 5 for location). That said I did not need to get there and had some business in the south east area of San Diego. This is the most friendly Comfort Suites I have stayed at. The gentleman checking me in was very friendly. Very talkative though checking me in and really seemed to care that everything was OK with my stay. He even gave me two bottles of water. I had never been to Tijuana and since it was just 4PM and I have nothing to do that night I asked him for directions and advice. He had lived there and gave me some great places to eat and directions on where to park and walk across the border. Fantastic first impression. When I got back the bed was very comfortable. Great pillow top in this hotel. I hate lousy hotel beds and when spending under $100 for a hotel/motel you dont expect the best but this was the best bed I had been on in a hotel (and I spend 30 nights per year on average in them) The rooms had a fridge and were spotless. I know where I am staying next time I am in town. Next morning I enjoyed their breakfast and found my renal car had battery problems. There were 3 people working there in the morning and after calling Budget (and getting a 2 hour quote on time) I asked the front desk if he could help. He did have cables at the front desk and had me on my way in under 3 minutes. It is easy to find faults when you travel and at times I do. I wrote this because when a property vastly exceeds your expectations they deserve praise. I wish I remembered the name of who checked me in but this guy should train every hotel worker. I was amazed at how friendly all the staff was, how clean my room was. It was nice and large with a great bed. What more could one ask for about $70 in San Diego. I am coming back for sure.

Nothing we could find that was closer was any cheaper and most of those places didn't have the best reviews. I'm glad we booked here. Yes, it's close to the border; yes, it's 22+ miles to the Gaslamp District, SeaWorld and the zoo and 27 miles to La Jolla. But if you have a car, it's an easy drive (we had NO traffic issues at all -- maybe a fluke because of the holiday) and the reward is a clean room that seems to have been recently updated. The beds were firm (and appeared to be new), the sheets were clean and actually fit the beds (amazed at how many places use flat sheets in place of fitted these days -- at least in the less expensive chains). The comforter looked like a real comforter and they even had a bed skirt. They clearly post signs (on the bed and in the bathroom) saying they are trying to conserve water/resources and only change linens every 3 days (unless you request otherwise). I think they had just steam cleaned the carpets, too -- our carpet was slightly damp and smelled of floral cleaner the first night, but fine by the morning after we ran the AC overnight. We had no problems with any of the staff (all were courteous, smiling and willing to help when we had questions) and there were signs of them constantly trying to maintain things while we were there (we saw pool cleaners, they were painting the entry driveway and saw cleaning and breakfast staff all the time). The only thing I can think that wasn't way above average was the TV -- the signal was bad, but we weren't there to watch TV, so we didn't even mention it till we left (so they could possibly fix it before another guest stayed in the room). So... all in all, we were extremely pleased with our stay and would stay there again in a heartbeat.
