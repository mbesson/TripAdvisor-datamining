Yes, ok, the area is going through some regeneration, and there's little to do there locally, but we felt safe there and were actively going out and about both day and night. The hotel staff were excellent and extremely helpful, offering some great recommendations that enhanced our holiday. The apartment was clean and a good size - ours had been recently modernised and offered more value for money than expected. It was also well-equipped with a kitchen, washer and drier (which was utilised a fair bit). I slept on the sofa bed (comfortable enough for a sofa bed - and was clearly in its prime of life) whilst my friends had the proper bed. Air con in both the lounge and bedroom, and a patio that overlooked nothing of great interest but was useful extra space. The breakfasts (which were included) helped set us up for that day (toast, cerials, fruit, yogurt, tea, coffee). It felt like we were staying in a self catering apartment with the added bonus of a breakfast and staff until 7pm-ish during weekdays, earlier at the weekends. If you're wanting somewhere that's good value, close to great transport links (10 min walk to Central Station, major bus stops and the tram), clean, friendly with breakfast included, and not bothered about being a tiny bit off the beat and track, then this is well worth booking. The money we saved booking here was well used doing exciting things in the city (which was SO expensive!) I'd happily stay here again. TIP: as beach_buoy said, the three of us got better value getting a taxi to the airport than the train. Also, lots of taxi drivers were unsure where the hotel was located, if you're getting a taxi to the hotel it's worth making a note of the main roads that it sits next to to make sure you have a straightforward journey back.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunlop", "Title": "\u201cGood apartment in a rundown location\u201d", "Author": "rspatrick1107", "ReviewID": "UR125682668", "Content": "As soon as we pulled up to the property we knew we had made a bad choice.

The management thought of everything: dishwashing soap, sponges, dishtowels, utensils and dishes, laundry detergent and chairs and table on the balcony. The apartment is also well-designed, with the kitchen by the balcony for ventilation, rather than by the entrance. As for the location: it is a good 10 minute walk to the main road (Broadway) or Central station, and the surrounding streets are deserted at night; on the other hand, the area seems more residential than unsafe. Now for the ratings climbing: the Waldorf has a few extras that might boost up its ratings. It serves breakfast in its caf\u00c3\u00a9. It has a (tiny) swimming pool and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (chairs) on its roof. It has a fitness room (closed for renovation). It has an elevator and in-building parking.

Here is my honest review; we booked here as we were in Sydney at the same time as a major event so other accom prices were through the roof. The units are located on a very busy road & the windows are not at all sound proof, luckily we had asked for a room away from street traffic noise, but even being on the 3rd floor and at the end of the building traffic noise inside room was still really loud. The units are good if you just want the basics & nothing extra. The bed was not that comfortable, we have slept on better. The bathroom was very very basic, the shower was really small you would not want to be over 6ft tall or you would not fit. The rooms are basic, the kitchen facilities are good but don't expect to be able to cook up a meal as untensils & cooking equipment is minimum. The roof top pool area was poorly maintained as there were tiles that were loose & unsafe, the BBQ's area rusted out & I wouldn't like to cook on them. The fencing aroung the roof top area is at a very unsafe height & can easy climbed over to fall to street below. The Gynasium is very poor, not at all what they advertise. Car parking is a bit of a joke as they advertise free parking but they only have about 5 spare spaces so make sure you get in quick. The people checking in after us missed out on parking & when they questioned this at reception, the staff acted as if they were surprised by the actual lack of amount of parking. Overall the location is quite good to the Broadway district, but is a bit of a hike to get to Darling Harbour. To top it all off after getting back to our rooms after a long day at sporting championships our room had not even been serviced, beds not made, bathroom not cleaned & towels not replaced. After a long day competing one of the thing syou lookforward to is a bed that has been made, considering you are paying a price for it, unfortunatley we didn't know when we booked that the rooms don't get serviced. The Rooms are ok, but nothing reallt they are nothing special.

I found my stay enjoyable all up. Arrivied to find that I'd been upgraded to a 1 bedroom unit from a Studio unit, which was a pleasant suprise. The room was spacious and clean, with a washing machine and dryer, which I put to use as my motorcycling cloths had done the whole 'wet' to 'sweat' route on my trip. Especially liked the secure parking - motorcycles seem a tempting target for thieves. If I was going to get picky, a scrubbing brush could have been used to get the dirty from around the base of the shower stall on the outside, but I've seen the same in other hotels that cost more and often deliver the same or less. I have no problem with the room not being serviced each day. I don't change my sheets and towels each day at home either, but I suppose I could have washed them and put them through the dryer if I had wanted! There are at least 3 restaurants within a few minutes walk in Cleavland St. The delights of Broadway and King St Newtown are only a 20 to 30 minute walk away.

This time I had to spend 3 weeks and rented a car so I have tried South Sydney Apartment Hotel. I got a spacious 1 bedroom apartment with a balcony & free security car parking. The complex is in a great location -near the area in Broadway that I worked for this period and I actually walked to work each day. The apartment was fully fitted & equipped with full kitchen & laudry and with high speed internet service at nominal weekly charge. The apartment was cleaned weekly which include linen change and the cleaning standard was good ( I am quite insisting in this area). The gym was closed- which was a pity but the pool on the roof was quite nice ( not Olympic size pool but ok). The complex is security complex and the reception staff ( which closed after 2200) was helpfull and polite. There was free light breakfast which taking into consideration that we are not in the Waldorf Astoria was good. Over all it is a place great for extended stay and travellers who seek good value ,clean and fully equipped accommodation of reasonable size rather than hotel room!!!. I did not like the decor in the room but I guess it is a matter of test.

We had a studio apartment on the 3rd floor. I called the hotel directly and got a rate of $125 per night, which was cheaper than was available online. The room itself was basic, but it had a washer/dryer/dishwasher and balcony. My only complaint about the room is that the bed was somewhat uncomfortable. It's fine for a week, but I wouldn't want to sleep on it for much longer than that. Also, the bathroom did not have an exhaust fan which was annoying. The location was great as we had a car. It is a 10 min walk to central station, but the area is quite and there were some shady characters hanging around late at night. By far the best aspect was the FREE onsite PARKING. Parking this close to the city costs a fortune everywhere else in Sydney. The apartment complex is a mix of apartments owned and operated by Waldorf and others which are privately owned. Although the Waldorf rooms are non smoking, the private residents are free to smoke. For the first few days our floor smelled quite strongly of cigarette smoke. I spoke with the desk and they offered to move us to another floor. They also called the other Waldorf guests on the floor and reminded them not to smoke. We were going to move, but after a call from the front desk the smoke was no longer a problem. The staff were very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay. The internet connection is dirt cheap. We were online several times each day and the bill at the end of our stay was under $10 (it's charged at 15c per MB). There is also a complementary breakfast. Overall I would definitely recommend the Waldorf South Sydney. For $125 per night with free parking and cheap internet, 10 mins walk from central station, you can't go wrong.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keighley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOk if all you want is a base\u201d", "Author": "cardwellt", "ReviewID": "UR10423965", "Content": "We rented a one bedroom apartment for two weeks. We arrived at 8.30am on the Monday morning and were pleasantly surprised to find our room was ready for us (officially check in was 2pm). Room was reasonably well equiped with dishwasher, washer drier safe etc. Our only niggles were that there were no coat hangers(!) and no clothes airer so you had to use the drier (seemed daft when temperature outside was in the mid 20s) Breakfast was sufficent - toast cereal and juice and was served from 7am till 10pm Monday to Sat and from 8am till 11am on Sunday and bank hollidays. We didn't come across any restaurants in the immediate location but it is only a short walk to the central/haymarkets area where there are loads of chinese restaurants, or if you walk down abercrombie street then turn left up broadway there are a few there (including a german restaurant and nandos), A little bit further up this road there is the broadway shopping centre. This is a new place so may not be on your map. This has a food court with a very good pizza/pasta place in it which is open late. Also in this shopping centre there is a large Coles supermarket, a K-mart and a cinema. Back to the accomodation - another slight niggle we had was that our room was not cleaned at all in the 2 weeks we were there. We saw the maids going round so not sure if this was just an oversight or not. However if you ask at reception they have spares of everything. We had no problems with noise on any night. All in all we were reasonably happy with the accomation for what we had paid. However we personally would probably pay slightly more and stay nearer to Circular Quay if we ever went back there,", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul / Perth", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place, Good People\u201d", "Author": "JosephBloggs", "ReviewID": "UR8500370", "Content": "I stayed at the Waldorf for 6 nights in a one-bedroom apartment.

Complimentary breakfast was very nice as there were no eating establishments near by -- a problem for dinner when we didn't want to cook. Laundry in-room was wonderful. Staff was superb. As much as we like the facility, we didn't like the location. We were dependent on the train which was a long hike from the apartment. It's a 10 minute walk at a brisk, heart pumping pace. Also, many of the buildings between the apartments and the train station are abandon, with broken windows and rubbish. It made the walk a little scary. Perhaps once the college restarted in February, there would be more activity. I noticed some of the building looked like dorms and one eating establishment looked like it was preparing to reopen -- with the start of school.If you have a car, this would be a better location. It seems that Saturday night's are party night at the Waldorf. It was very noisy, people running and shouting through the halls, as well from the roof top pool area. With cement buildings next door, the sound reverberated and intensified. I don't know if people from the Y-Sydney (across the street) invade the property on Saturday night or what. We complained to the front desk at 1:30 am, but the party didn't wrap up until around 3 am. Needless, to say, it was a sleepless night which affected our next day of sightseeing.
