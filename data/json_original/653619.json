We were travelling for the \"Sydney Resolution NYE Concert\". This was a delightful surprise! We didn't need too much for this 3 day trip, cause it was already costing us a fortune. The location was fine for our needs and we enjoyed the long walks as opposed to the expensive taxi option. The room was modern, clean and tidy (my only preference would be for a bigger, more lit up bathroom!) and there are plenty of trendy shops and cafes to visit along Crown Street. They provided a common area where you could help yourself to coffee and breakfast in your own time and everyday our room was cleaned. You would think being inside the same building as a pub and restaurant, opposite a busy intersection you would struggle to hear yourself think, but surprisingly we had no problems in the time we were there (from Friday to Sunday- their busiest times). It wasn't the fanciest hotel we have stayed at, but certainly met our needs and for this whirlwind trip. If I wanted to save money by staying away from the shops in the city and relax more, I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGlorified Pub Accommodation\u201d", "Author": "TripTaker2407", "ReviewID": "UR119975384", "Content": "We stayed here for a few days in October 2011. First surprise was when the cab pulled up at a pub. We weren't sure if we were at the right place as there was not one sign indicating that accommodation was available. We made ourselves known at the bar and the manager then showed us upstairs to the accommodation, which is several levels above the pub. To be fair, we didn't hear any noise from the pub below, but what did wake us up every morning was the communal breakfast table being outside our door. Everyone eats together - cereal, pastries, toast - like in a hostel. The table and chairs are plastic and the latter can be audibly heard scraping against the floor. A floor mat certainly wouldn't go astray. The room itself is nice enough, but I noticed our sheets were stained and had holes, albeit small. The shower is great, but there is only a tiny basin below the cabinet (watch your head when brushing your teeth) and not an inch of bench space. All in all, a very mediocre visit. Worthy of 2.5-3 stars, but certainly not 4.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201csurprising and good\u201d", "Author": "BusinessExpert", "ReviewID": "UR94723923", "Content": "I am a regular traveler for work and have stayed in hundreds of hotels. First surprise was when the cab pulled up and it was a pub. I dragged my bags in and ask is the Crown Hotel with accommodation? The positive bar staff got the manager who took me up stairs. The halls are dark and then suddenly lit up by sensor lights... seemed a bit odd. Got to the room it was clean and tidy with reasonably appointed furniture etc. The light and fittings including one chair are all plastic and sort of has that this is also a brothel! THe maanger mentioned the pub ran 24hours a day and being on a busy intersection I was concerned about the noise and was surprised just how quite it was- it was a thusday night which may have helped. The are has a wide range of restaurants etc, half I am surprised have a licence to run the others are very classy (odd mix all in one street). There is also Coles supermarket across the road.

The room was a perfect size for the two of us, the decor was fantastic, and we love Surry Hills! If you are a bit of a snob when it comes to hotels, I wouldn't reccommend it as there's no silver service here. It's very casual, and that's actually what we liked about it. Our room was facing Crown Street, so the noise of the traffic wasn't the most pleasant and the blinds don't do much to keep the sun out.. so if you're jetlagged and desperate for an un-disturbed sleep, bring some earplugs and an eyemask! We liked that we could grab a drink from the downstairs bar and take it up to our room, as all the bottle shops in the area had closed. If you want a trendy, casual, spacious and modern room in Surry Hills, you can't complain too much about Crown...especially for $120, bargain!!

Bit noisy (its a pub on Crown St - so that's OK, goes with the territory). The shower flatters to deceive though looks like something out someone's palace, but you have to run around to get wet there is so little water coming out. Not exactly \"bargain\" either, you can get a room in a decent chain hotel for pretty much the same rate.

After I de-grimed myself I was able to appreciate the size of the room and it's appointments. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The daily breakfast was to my liking but I could see how travellers from the US might think it's skimpy. I enjoyed the coffee machine once I learned how to use it and didn't mind sharing the space with other travellers. The only drawback that I could think of was that there wasn't a hotel staff member there at all times but anyone at the pub below was at your service and were very friendly with us. I was a bit worried about staying above a pub but our room was extremely quiet at night and we had no trouble sleeping. The location is great.

The Surrey Hills neighborhood is a great place to stay with its laid-back vibe and trendy restaurants and boutiques.

Therein lies the challenge with the property. The accommodations are located directly above the Dome nightclub which is open nightly from 9pm to 2am.
