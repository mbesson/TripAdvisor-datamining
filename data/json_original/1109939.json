The staff are nice and very friendly and they will do their best to accommodate your needs. The WIFI access is good however, you do have to pay extra. The location is also great, next to the metro and easy access onto Shiekh Zayed Road. The rooms are also a good size, I stayed in a one bedroom apartment which had a good sized bedroom and living room area, kitchen and two bathrooms. I have to say that overall I found the apartment a bit dated, the room itself was very dark as there was no natural light, the furniture was not great, very dark and rather old. The apartment was never really clean properly either, there was dust on all the furniture and the curtains were filthy with stains all over them. The kitchen was okay but there was very few utensils. Twice in the bathroom there was a coakroach running up the wall (eeek!). Although I didn't have a bad stay, I dont think I would stay here again...", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cWe live here and......\u201d", "Author": "worldwanderer_9", "ReviewID": "UR124881443", "Content": "They are great apartments and very good value for Dubai. Fully equipped kitchen, very comfy beds, an individual wifi hub in every apartment, not bad TV channels with good TVs. There is not a lot of difference between deluxe and standard. In standard maybe the furniture is older. In some apartments there are two bathrooms. Large living room, good wardrobes space in the bedroom, We have been living here for two months and will stay for a year. the staff are very helpful and friendly. The manager will give a very good monthly rate. Can highly recommend these apartments. They are a 2 minute walk from the Metro.

However, it was sorted out while I went out to dinner and I was accomodated. The rooms are large apart-hotel type rooms with a two TVs, a kitchen, a large bed, a sitting room etc. Iron & Ironing board available, wifi (not free) and the bathroom was decent. The shower pressure and temperature was dodgy as was the overall decor of the room. However, it did its job. I was there for a brief weekend and I did not spend a hole lot of time there. The staff were very friendly and efficient (despite the initial issue with the booking). I did not eat there and it did not look like many people do but it seems to have a full restaurant service. Location: I do not know Dubai that well but will be as descriptive as possible: It is a five minute taxi journey or a 5 minute metro ride to the Dubai Marina. On the other hand, it is approximately 10-15 minutes in a taxi to the CBD i.e. where the Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall are etc. The access to the Metro has to be a plus if you are not prepared to use taxis all the time (right beside the Internet City Metro), however, there is not a whole lot to do in the area which is called \"Dubai Internet City\". It was approximately 60 D's from the airport, which works out at about \u00a312. My overall opinion of this place can be summed up as follows: If you are a business traveller and the company is paying for you: Don't go here. If you are a tourist and you are not too fussed on your accomodation but like a clean, safe and handy hotel, then this place is not too bad. I'd recommend it on that basis.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha, Qatar", "Title": "\u201cExtremely unprofessional, no respect for customer.\u201d", "Author": "Muhammad A", "ReviewID": "UR121612175", "Content": "Extremely unprofessional, no respect for customer.

If you have a transportation like car or free taxi, i strongly recommend the apartments. After i stay there, i have visited dubai in June 2009 and also stayed there with my own expense. The rates are favorable, place is comfortable. Internet is not free but you can find some free networks around the building.

However, I am staying here for 6 weeks and 4 weeks in I think I can give a balanced view of the hotel apartments and address some of the concerns about the rooms. First, yes agreed you can get better but for the price you pay you will only get similar if not worse. True the rooms are darker than some but not overly dark \u2013 we are not talking black walls here. I don\u2019t have a problem with the natural light levels in the room. They are tolerable. Facilities are plastic, again true however who really cares about having a plastic kettle. It is not the end of the world. Since being here I have had not one issue with the internet and I have been using it every evening. I have not been downloading films etc just general browsing and email. One small point on the noise \u2013 yes there is other building work going on but this is Dubai it is the building capital of the world. If you want to be in a noise free area then unfortunately you are going to need to pay more per night than this place. Again it is not overly noisy and only starts at about 7-8am. Right the good and the bad and the average Good \u2013 Staff. The staff is excellent, on my arrival they went to the petrol station and got me a coke and some milk (as it was late). They have responded to my every whim \u2013 taxi ordering, replacement items in the room etc. The maid has even been cleaning my plates etc. The location is great right on the main highway through Dubai \u2013 the marina 10mins, beach 10min the madinat 10mins (all in taxi of course) and all the other major shopping centres are near by. The apartments \u2013 they really are ok \u2013 yes not five star but you are not paying five star prices. I spent 3 months looking at apartments for a six week stay and this one was the best value with all factors taken. I looked at some other apartment hotels and they were over \u00a350 a night more expensive. UK plugs in every room other than the kitchen \u2013 winner Average \u2013 breakfast \u2013 you get some pastries, coffee cereal the normal basics. They also do takeaway and you can negotiate breakfast in the price. Lifts \u2013 quite slow D\u00e9cor \u2013 It\u2019s a bit basic \u2013 no carpet anywhere in the rooms all tiled. Reasonable selection of TV channels including movies and sports. BAD \u2013 I really don\u2019t think, for the price I paid and in comparison to other stays I have had in Dubai anything that is really bad with the place. Of course if you are on your Honeymoon, with 4 kids or want total luxury this is not the place for you.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, UAE", "Title": "\u201cDark rooms\u201d", "Author": "pemaki", "ReviewID": "UR19829320", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 weeks (booked initially for 4).
