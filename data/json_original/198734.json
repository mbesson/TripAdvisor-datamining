I booked it after looking through the website and reading reviews. When looking at the website, I chose the Standard Double room with \"Windows open to view of the city\". (highlighted in bold).

When I got there, I was given a room in the back, windows opened to the side of the backyard, with view over a dilapidated bamboo awning seemingly trying to cover a series of air conditioners. Not what I expected. Aside from that, the tub shower screen wasn't fixed and water was going all over the floor when I showered. I went downstairs and complained, the lady said that I actually got a better deal than what I booked for, and that was an upgrade. No more rooms were available and wouldn't move me. I went back to my room, got my laptop, pulled the reservation, went back down and showed her the picture and the description that I saw when I booked the room. She smiled and said, well, you know about pictures right? They are old and not always representing actuality. As for the view of the city,... she nodded and said, you are right, I'll move you but only tomorrow since nothing else is available. I was annoyed that I had to go through this and fight back. The next day I got a different room. It was better, but know that there is no actual \"View of the city\" since the building is surrounded by other buildings. GoogleEarth it and you'll know. The top floors might have a better view, but nothing for the first 3 floors. Aside from that, the staff was great, even that lady at the reception turned out to be very kind. My fellow travelers were all happy with their rooms. Breakfast buffet is amazing and service was fantastic. Location is also very good.

You begin your day there with breakfast (included). After a day exploring the city, rest up and start your evening with a cocktail and snacks sitting on a plush chair or comfortable padded bench. The courtard is open to the street through a gate and is accessible to the public, so a large percentage of the patrons are residents beginning their evenings out too. At the end of the evening you can return again to the courtyard for a grappa or other digestif along with other well-dressed Romans doing the same. Also, many other amenities of the hotel are also included. Along with the breakfast there is free wireless internet throughout, and the hotel also provides bicycles which can be used for rides along the Tiber or in the park of nearby Villa Borgese. These turn out to be services uncommon in other Rome hotels (more on this later). Now the awful thing - On the first night we arrived (Saturday), after being awake for some 30 hours, we were given the only ground-floor room in the hotel. This room has a window that is right on the courtyard, _and_ a door onto a landing that is in turn open to the courtyard and is the passageway for the entire building. This might be the worst-placed hotel room I've ever stayed in, and should never have been anything other than storage, let alone classifed \"deluxe\". Certainly the 50 people chattering away in the courtyard 2 meters from your bed or dragging their luggage over the stairs directly in front of your door assume so. And did I mention there is a sound-system playing music too? We were promised a room change for the following day but immediately started researching other hotels just in case that didn't materialize. The room change was delivered so we didn't evacuate immediately, but we still began to investigate switching to another hotel for the second week of our stay because we were willing to spend more for a more comfortable room. As many other reviews have said, the rooms are frumpy, mostly dark, and the beds are quite mediocre. Bathrooms are by no means fancy but adequate. Our shower/tub had two draining modes: Slow, and slightly less slow. And here's the surprising thing - After visiting half-a-dozen other hotels we decided to stay with the Locarno for the full two weeks. We concluded that the amenities and character were too hard to replace, even though we were willing to pay 100 EUR more a night. Any alternatives would have meant sacrificing that courtyard and being surrounded by hotel guests exclusively rather than integrating with the neighborhood. Not to mention that most hotels charged for internet and breakfast too. So understand the tradeoffs and make sure you don't get room 501.

Ambiance of lobby and bar, dining room and courtyard was attractive. Breakfast buffet was good and had a nice variety. Air conditioning worked. Minuses--MANY!

One of the most disturbing things we encountered during our stay was the disposition of the staff throughout the hotel. With the exception of one female desk clerk and one female bartender, everyone we encountered looked unfriendly, unapproachable and were unwilling to help when we asked any sort of question. The male front desk clerk was so unfriendly and rude every day, it is incredible that he still is employed. The wait staff had to be prompted to wait on people.

I chose this hotel because I was able to find a good last minute deal and having experience with Italian hotels its 4 star status would at least be a 2-3 star in other countries. Arrival & Location: The check in was friendly and efficient and the location is wonderful. Its right near the piazza del popolo and it's a bit away from the hustle and bustle of the main streets. We felt that the area was safe and we were able to walk to any tourist attraction from here. The room: At first we were disappointed to find out that we were in the building across since the rooms on the website are clearly from the main building. The room we had was not very modern and a bit dark but it was clean and comfortable, we had everything we needed including air conditioning. The bathroom could use some work, the shower/bath was leaky and the tiles were old and didn't feel that clean even if they were. Dining: The breakfast on the terrace is a wonderful way to start the morning and the selection at the buffet was perfect (croissants, eggs, cake, bacon, several types of juice, cold cuts, cheese, fruit, fruit salad & yogurt). We didn't have dinner here but did have a quick lunch one day and a light snack with cocktails on another. There are better places in Rome to have lunch/dinner and I wouldn't recommend having a full meal here but the starters and cold dishes are a nice addition to afternoon cocktails before going out for a real dinner. Other: We were able to get wireless everywhere in the hotel including in our room in the building across the street\u2026 those who couldn't connect, the name of the network was different but if you ask the front desk they can help. Summary: It's a nice place to stay if you are not going to spend your days at your hotel. Don't expect a 4 star room\u2026 the room is perfect for people who would like a clean, safe and decently priced place to sleep, wake up, have a nice breakfast and head out to discover Rome then come back for a cocktail, quick shower and back out for night time discovery!

The room was quite warm so we needed to open the window, but then couldn't sleep because of the noise. So it was a double edge sword. The rooms were clean.

And by the 5 th day we could barely deal with eating the same thing again. However the cappuccino was AMAZING! The one downfall was the elevator. It could only fit about 3 people at a time and If you had luggage, you are lucky to fit yourself in. After walking the streets of Rome all day, the last thing you want to do it trek up stairs.

The bathroom was lovely and our towels got changed daily. Any one moans about the tiredness of the hotel should really understand this is Rome so if you want a modern Holiday Inn go to the US where nothing is more than 10 years old!!!! The breakfast was amazing. we had choice of bacon, eggs, tomatos, pastries, lovely juice and coffee even champayne for your Mimosa, a reat start to the day and we did not have to eat again till about 3pm. The hotel is in an excellent location so close to all the sites and we managed to walk to all of them with no problem. The staff behind the desk were really helpful and gave us a great map to use around the city. The drinks in the bar (vodka and coke 16 euro's) were very pricey so we just stayed away.

I was a bit concerned due to several of this site's recent reviews, but as I was only staying for two nights I decided to give it a try. My experience: 1. Yes, the furnishings in the main building are dated. They were all art deco, so I would have been disappointed if they were newer. The floor of our room was made of a beautiful herringbone pattern. Our wallpaper was fabric, a nice touch. 2. One smallish TV in the corner of the room. We never turned it on (a bit pointless when on vacation in Rome, in this person's opinion). 3. We had both thin towels (my preferred type) and very thick towels (my husband's preferred type) in the bathroom. Our bathroom was very clean. A few chipped tiles, but no trouble with that. The shower was a bit small, but suitable. 4. We stayed in a standard double on the third floor of the main building. The room was quite roomy for Europe and the windows kept all noise out from he street. We heard no noise from other rooms, although we did see guests entering the rooms next to us. 5. The staff was friendly and helpful. I do not speak much Italian, but I made an effort, which seemed to make the staff more eager to help. Service in the bar is typical of what I experienced in Rome, in that you need to get the attention of the staff to place an order. This is also how the locals in the bar ordered. 6. Breakfast was very good, with excellent espresso drinks made to order along with ample bread and fruit offerings. The bartenders make excellent and creative cocktails. After a long day of sightseeing, the bar are provided a terrific setting to unwind. 7. An earlier review spoke of an elevator. I've included a picture of the absolutely charming cage-type elevator. The stairs that wrapped around the elevator are wide and carpeted. The elevator was slow, but worked just fine. Our stay was very enjoyable and we slept soundly. The location was excellent and the staff very helpful. I plan to stay again in the future. Very charming and an excellent value.

The air conditioning didn't work at all and the internet was non existant. And we were there for 5 nights.

The rooms were clean with high ceilings and quaint shutters on the windows. Those who complain about the noise level must have been staying in the bar, because i'm a light sleeper and did not experience any noise disruption despite being in a 1st floor room directly next to the stairwell and lift, and in close proximity to the bar and reception. The road was noisy, but simply closing the window blocked this out. The bar also seemed to be empty by about 11:30-midnight. The bathroom was tiny, but unless you're planning on spending your holiday in it, its not a problem. Service wise, we only found one member of staff who spoke fluent English. This was a bit frustrating as our Italian is terrible, but when in Italy what do you expect? The language barrier did not stop us from getting what we wanted once we'd worked out how to say our room number and order coffee. The service was more abrupt than what we have grown to expect in the UK/USA, but that is not exclusive to the hotel. We found that service across Rome (especially when you are a couple in their mid-twenties) can be rather negligent and prickly at best. The Romans tend to give better service to those over 30 and especially when they can smell the euros! The location of the hotel was perfect as it was easy to walk everywhere. The Piazza Del Poppolo is a beautiful stop for people watching and really only a stone's throw away, as is the Villa Borghese. Only 20 mins to the Vatican (go on a weds morning for the papal address at about 10:30 - its free and a different experience), 20 mins to the Trevi fountain, 10 mins to the Spanish Steps and Pantheon and about 40 mins to the Colosseum. Don't bother with a bus tour. Save your money and do it on foot. Dinner is an all evening event in Rome, so don't mistake slow waiters for bad service. That's just how the Romans do it. Try one of the little Osterias or Trattorias in the side streets near the Spanish steps, as many of them are quite quaint and cosy. Splash out on a Ristorante if you're feeling flush.

Eventually they found us two rooms in the Locarno - the twin room was OK but was in need of a refurb. The double room contained a bed which was not even 3/4 size and an even smaller bathroom. We complained to reception and requested that the manager speak to us about it and offer some form of reduction - we never saw the manager! On check out we were advised that he had agreed a \u20ac20 per room reduction for the total stay- not a lot when the total cost was \u20ac450 - and was not available to discuss it with us.

We understood that the Locarno was a four star hotel and we were staying in one of the best rooms. Sadly the hotel and the staff fell short of our expectations and tarnished what we had hoped would be a memorable trip. We fell impotent to get a satisfactory solution. What was most frustrating was that every time we raised an issue, staff either ignored us or pretended they would do something and then just forget or choose not to deal with it. All our efforts to speak to the manager were thwarted \u2013 she was always out and when staff promised she would be around to talk to she managed to be absent yet again.

Of course, she didn\u2019t and only finally responded when I had to resort to sending her another email outlining our concerns. Specific Complaints Included BATHROOM. The shower curtain in the bathroom was about a foot too short for the bath.

Staff told us that the beds were new and would get softer in time \u2013 not time enough for our visit!

The air conditioning only worked on one speed and thewas not powerful enough to cool the room at night while the top of the wardrobe was thick with dust. All inexcusable!

I've stayed at the Hotel Locarno twice in the past five years and generally had a good stay. The hotel itself is beautiful, if a little worn, but the rooftop terrace and the courtyard are lovely. The breakfast is generous and the location couldn't be better for exploring Rome or shopping. But the property seems to be in decline, despite all of the write-ups it keeps getting in the travel magazines. The elevator in the older building seems scarier than its been in the past. Could be because the wood floor appears to be breaking up and there are definitely soft spots in it. During our stay, the air conditioning didn't work. We had to open the window of our first-floor room at night to get a breeze, even though that also let in a lot of noise from the street below. We were offered no compensation or even an apology from the mostly female front desk staff, who were collectively a surly bunch. One morning, when turning my key in and asking about a taxi, one of the women at the front desk said abruptly that she couldn't understand me, turned on her heel and stalked off. The other lady at the desk looked somewhat apologetic and told me that \"You're accent is hard.\" I'm from Indiana. A Midwestern accent is hard? Moving on...avoid Room 113 whatever you do. The bathroom smells terrible. We didn't want to investigate too closely, but the problem appears to be that there's absolutely no ventilation in the room. I think there's some sort of mold issue. Finally, if you're tired and think to yourself, \"I'll just go grab a bite to eat at one of the restaurants across the street,\" be wary. We ate at the restaurant down the street (not the one directly across from the restaurant) and when we got our bill, the waiter short-changed us by 10 euros.

The journey by car and eurostar was approx the same length of time, except we would have felt utterly ripped off had we heeded the advice given by Locarno. I chose Hotel Locarno because they had been featured in Hip Hotels, so I would like to caution any one booking this hotel under the notion that it could be considered hip in any sense. The hotel was filled with retirees (mostly American), and we were the only travelers under the age of 50. We popped out to Capri for an overnight trip, and on our pre-booked return to Locarno, were upgraded to a suite in the other block. This proved to be a far more pleasant room. High ceilings, good size, cute orange drapes, quaint claw foot bathtub. It was much more pleasant, hence booking a room at Locarno is really like playing Russian Roulette.

Do not, however, let them fob you off with staying in the apartment - I don't think it is worth saving the extra Euro 30/night.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cMay 2005\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3659261", "Content": "This was our first trip to Italy & Rome and we loved it all. We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Locarno, an art deco hotel which is very charming with a great location, within walking distance to everything. Many places to eat, from upscale restaurants to small trattatorias & pizza places in the streets close to the hotel. The staff are excellent and very accommodating to all your needs. The rooms are very clean, safety deposit box in room, and the breakfast is outstanding, we looked forward to it every day...great cappucino! Nice little coutyard and rooftop garden to enjoy a drink after a long day of walking. We walked to everything from the hotel. Close to metro stop, across the Piazza de Poppolo. You can take the metro to the train station, catch a train to the airport for 9 Euros per person, or the staff will gladly make arrangements for pick at the hotel. We stayed in the Annex our first 5 days in Rome, then went on a trip to Sorrento and came back to Rome for 2 nights. Although there was a problem with an overbooking the first night, the hotel staff were superb in quickly finding us accommodation at another hotel which was also very nice...but we were happy to come back to Locarno the 2nd night at which time they had upgraded our room to a suite! If we visit Rome again, we will most definetely stay at Hotel Locarno with its outstanding customer service by all staff members. fdavis@rogers.com Ottawa, Canada", "Date": "July 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mahwah, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "mahwahlady", "ReviewID": "UR3634201", "Content": "My family and I (7 of us) booked the Locarno based on a recommendation as well as the reviews of Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The location was convenient, close to the Piazza del Popolo and easy walking to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and Vatican. However, if you want to get to the Piazza Navona, it would be a really long walk (a short cab ride). We took a bus to the Colesseum. The thing that swayed us in making a decision, all other things being about equal, was that all reviews stated what a great breakfast was served, and they were right. The breakfast (especially for a moderate hotel in Rome) was FANTASTIC -- from eggs, meats and cheeses to a large variety of cereals and fruits to an assortment of pastries and breads, etc. - You name it, they had it. It was served in a garden-like courtyard which was very pretty. Considering that the 7 of us would have had to pay for a substantial breakfast to give us a good start for the day's touring, it was really a bargain. We stayed in the Locarno annex just across the street from the main hotel (called the Anahi) and the rooms were more than satisfactory - not cramped at all and very clean. The air conditioning was excellent - no problems at all. A double was 150 euros. We had espresso one evening on the roof top of the main hotel in the evening, which was lovely. The staff speaks English and were helpful in getting us cabs, etc. The best pizza in Italy was just down the street from the annex as you walk toward the Piazza Popolo. We went on to the south of Italy from Rome but were spoiled for all future pizzas we had in Italy.", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JF&PM", "ReviewID": "UR3612187", "Content": "The Locarno is a lovely hotel in a great location, within easy walking distance of all of the major sites.

It's a little hotel across the street (the entrance seems more like a residence) - a tiny street. Apparently the Locarno acquired the ANAHI and it is now part of the Locarno but they still call it by it's old name. I'm explaining this because it was difficult to understand the situation when I was booking the room. There is no smoking allowed in the Annex, which is fantastic. It has five floors, and the fifth has only one room - mine! Had my own staircase, even, and there was a locked door at the bottom of it as well as a locked door for my room. I felt very, very safe (and I'm a safety stickler). I had a private bath in my room, and there was a little rooftop terrace outside the corridor - I was the only one up there. The room was much larger than your typical European room, and it was very clean. The icing on the cake here is that they charge less for rooms in the Annex because they don't provide room service there. Who wants to eat room service in Italy?!? (Btw, the included breakfast is very good). And there's no smoking! 105e/night. It was great. There were a few glitches (my TV remote didn't work, had a little difficulty with the shower one day), but for the most part it was great, and I loved the staff.

Now for the negatives- we arrived to be told that our \u20ac150 room in the new annexe had been \"flooded\" due to a faulty pipe and we could take our pick of a new hotel across the river or a small room for the 1st night and a suite for the 2nd night. we were shocked when we saw the small room- it was no bigger than a closet and was most certainly not worth the \u20ac100 rack rate they claimed- more like a \u20ac30 hostel room. After much insistence by my husband (we said the very least the hotel could have done was infomed us via telephone since the \"flooding\" was claimed to have happened the previous day) the girl at the reception made a few calls and informed us that she would be putting us up in a room in the old building and would have to send some other people to another hotel! room was smallish but okay. Did not see any senior management at the hotel - if indeed there had been flooding surely owner/mgr etc could have been present to explain situation rather than have desk clerk fob us off? rest of stay was good- staff helpful on the whole.
