We made a hotel reservation for two double rooms as we were two groups of adults traveling with children. We arrived at the hotel at midnight, exhausted, checked in and when we arrived at our room; they had booked us in two king rooms. When we returned downstairs, we were told that there were no double rooms available for the first night. Their first option was to give us two king rooms down the hall from one another for one night and switch us over for the second night. Having children and sharing luggage made it impossible to have two rooms that didn't connect, and we weren't about to spend our only day in LA packing up to switch rooms again. Luckily a few minutes later they had a cancellation and were able to give us a \"suite\", which was a room with a king bed and a small sofa sleeper. The staff tried hard to try and be accommodating. The rooms are basic, typical hotel decor; however, the hotel was very clean (bathrooms, linens, etc.) and rooms always smelled fresh. Our toilet wasn't working the first evening, and we had to fill the tank with water to get it to flush. We reported the next morning, as we were just too tired that first night, and it was repaired when we returned. The other room with the rest of our party also had a toilet clog in the morning, which was immediately repaired.

If you feel like venturing further, the subway is a close walk as well. We decided to take the car to West Hollywood for the Halloween Carnival. Aside from the regular \"LA\" traffic, it was a quick ride. Upon returning later that evening, there were plenty of parking spaces still available. The morning we departed we decided to hike/run Runyon Canyon. The hotel staff was kind enough to give us a late check-out. So after we hiked, we were able to return and shower. We really appreciated their flexibility. The rooms were clean. The usual wear and tear, but nothing gross. We had a room at the farthest end from the street so noise wasn't a problem. Shower worked nicely, and the fridge/microwave were nice to have available. This hotel has pretty much all the things you need when staying in Hollywood. Proximity to attractions (very close to Universal Studios, Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood Blvd), the FREE Parking is a big deal (trust me), and a clean place to stay while exploring LA.

The cons of this hotel would probably be that it was designed more like a motel, so the hallways are not closed, they are open and you can hear the traffic and everybody who walks by, especially if they just came back from going out all day/night. The air conditioner/heater was particularly loud when it was bringing the temp. back up/down, but quiet when it was in-between those cycles. Also, the TV was a bit weird, it was a flat screen Samsung but it had lines that would run across it while you were watching - it reminded me of those old TVs.

We stayed here in 2005 and had a pleasant stay. It is very convenient to the Hollywood Blvd. and Highland complex. Nearby Hollywood attractions include the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Graumann's Theatre, the Kodak Theatre. Parking can be a challenge especially during weekends but we always managed to find a spot. This was our second stay at this hotel, but we won't be staying there again. This visit started off on a bad note when the front desk tried to charge us about $50 more per day claiming that the rate that we had received on our confirmed reservation through \"bestwestern.com\" was just an estimate. After complaining, the clerk agreed to talk to the manager and eventually called to tell us that we would receive the rate that I had agreed to pay on my reservation. Beware of this since others have complained on TripAdvisor about \"fluctuating\" prices at this particular hotel. The rooms have outdoor entrances connected by walkways. The people next to us stood outside their room smoking and talking at all hours of the day since they were in a non-smoking room. We could hear them talking while we were inside our room. Our sleep was interrupted repeately on two of the three nights that we stayed at this hotel. The second night was worse with yelling and the sounds of things being broken coming from a room on the other side of the walkway and one floor below us. We called the front desk to ask that they send security to stop the noise but it continued for several hours. The next day we complained to the front desk that nothing had been done about the noise after we called. They apologized and acknowledged that many other people had also complained. Later that day the manager left us a voice mail informing us that she had given us one of the three nights free. The least expensive of the three nights was deducted instead of one of the two more expensive nights with actual noise issues. This hotel had other noise problems also. We could hear cars coming and going from the parking area since the rooms are located directly above it. Some of those cars had the need to honk in the middle of the night for some unknown reason. The sound of trucks driving on Highland could also be heard in the rooms. If location is all that is important for you, this is a great hotel. If you care about quiet and uninterrupted sleep and friendly service, this might not be the place for you.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Multinational in Singapore", "Title": "\u201cFree parking and a clean bed was all we needed (and got)\u201d", "Author": "FriesAndFoieGras", "ReviewID": "UR12454191", "Content": "I did a lot of reading (especially the TripAdvisor website!) to find a suitable place to stay for our visit to Universal Studios.

Once the suitcases were on the floor, there was little space for the two of us to maneuver. Another room where four of our traveling companions slept had 2 Doubles ($119) and that was more spacious. Other reviewers said this BW was really near Hollywood Boulevard and so we took a (non-scenic) walk, a good ten minutes away and it seems longer if you\u2019re tired. Manager has maps of the area that are useful and you can easily get a copy upon request. What was slightly worrying was the fact that other people on lower floors could peer into our room through the heater vents in the wall. So do take note if you\u2019re concerned about privacy.

One stop on the nearby metro will take you to Universal Studios and, if you're interested in renting a car for your stay, you can obtain one just down the street at the Renaissance Hotel. Oh, and this hotel offers free parking. Secondly, the staff were extremely friendly, accommodating and helpful. The rooms are secure, clean but a bit small; I wouldn't want to stay there with more than one other person or perhaps 2 very tiny people. The onsite restaurant was good and affordable.

I actually booked it online through my Costco club membership travel program with their discounted rate. We stayed for Thanksgiving weekend and it was NOT as crowded as I expected.

Location was perfect, close to the famous Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards...if going with a large crowd, you can easily walk to these locations from hotel, but since we had our kids, we didn't take a chance since it's not a safe area to walk at night. It's perfect location if you're going to visit Universal Studios....only 5minutes away. Hotel was nice and clean when we checked in, but the two night s after that, the cleaning staff forgot to vacuum the carpet and clean the bathroom floor. When I called the front desk the first night to ask for extra towels, it took over a 1/2 hr to bring them to us, so I didn't even want to bother calling to have them vacuum at night time. We had a mini fridge and microwave along with coffee maker, which were all nice to have since the hotel does NOT provide any complimentary breakfast. They do have a restaurant onsite, but beware....prices are very HIGH. Their parking lot is on the first floor, under the rooms and the spaces are VERY tight, so if you're driving a big SUV, you will have a hard time getting in/out of your vehicle.I will say, though, that as I checked out and complained about the floor not being cleaned during our stay, they offered me an additional discount off my total rate and it was much appreciated. This shows that they have good customer service and want my business.

We called front desk to clarify and confirm if there had been any calls placed that evening for a broken toilet and they informed me that no calls had been placed from any suite in the hotel. Furthermore, an access card was found haphazardly placed among one of our suitcases which could possibly mean that it was dropped while he was snooping.

There isn't a computer print out from the hotel, but, it's one-on-one by 'phone and the staff knows what's available and how to please the customer. Everyone was very helpful, even when the lobby was full of people. The room was what I had requested: Quiet and away from the street noises and parking. It was on the third floor, in the rear of the building, overlooking the pool and jacuzzi. Tall plants and trees obscured the buildings on the other side of the property, giving a park-like atmosphere to my view. The room was clean, if dated. The place looked newly renovated, including furniture. The air conditioning worked and the bed was comfortable. The TV, refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave seemed new. The bathroom was the cleanest I've seen in some time. The shower nozzle was large and easily adjustable, compared to small hard-to-use sprays at other hotels. There is a restaurant on the property, but I wasn't impressed enough with it to try for anything other than an expensive cup of soup. The computer, on the desk in the lobby, wasn't convenient, but it was there and could be used at any time. Hollywood Boulevard and the Metro station were 2 long blocks, over construction debris, down the hill. I would not recommend the walk to Hollywood Boulevard for anyone with a physical problem. Some of the past problems may have been due to previous owners and hotel condition. Current owners appear very anxious to please and there are on-going repairs to the property. It's not 4 star, but, it's clean, safe and close to everything.
