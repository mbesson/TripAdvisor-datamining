These reviews were RIGHT ON! LOCATION: In a cute neighborhood within walking distance to Beyoglu and Taksim Square, and you can even walk over to Eminonou (where you get the ferry and location of the Spice Market), Sirkeci and Sultanahmet on a nice day. Ortakoy was about a 30 min cab ride away (went to dinner at Chillai Restaurant and Reina Nightclub), but was not a bad ride. The surrounding area of the hotel has very cozy, bohemian type restaurants/cafes. ACCOMMODATIONS: Excellent. We stayed in a corner Grand King Suite, and although it was on the first floor, we had an amazing view of the city. The suite was about 530 square feet, very large by hotel standards! The bed was a standard size King bed, and very comfortable! The kitchenette was awesome - fridge, microwave, coffee machine, glasses and flatware. Bathroom was amazing - had an adjustable shower head on the wall and several shower heads on the ceiling for an unbelievable shower experience. Wonderful Molton Brown body wash, shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, hand lotion and body cream. This room was truly our home away from home. SERVICE: Even in advance of our stay the hotel gave us amazing service. Arranging for car service to and from the airport made things so easy. Arranging a trusted private tour guide for us as well (which, by the way, is the only way to go if you want to hit as many landmarks as possible in a day, and they show you the great local restaurants/cafes as well as get you appointments at the best Turkish Bath House in Istanbul :)). We were warmly greeted by the staff upon arrival and a welcome drink and snacks were brought up to our suite. Breakfast each morning was fresh and delicious, and you could either have it in the lounge or order and have it brought up to your room for no extra charge. Most hotels nickel and dime you for everything - this hotel does not. I had mentioned to the front desk staff in passing that it was my birthday, and sure enough when we returned from our day tour, there was a beautiful birthday cake in our suite (that said happy birthday with my name spelled correctly which is huge since most people get the spelling of my name wrong) compliments of the hotel! We were there Easter weekend and they also placed delicious Easter cookies on our pillow. They were so incredibly helpful in arranging all our cab transportation and making our dinner reservations. Really, anything you wanted they would bend over backwards for you. Four Seasons service at a bargain price!!!

Very steep and the road/footpaths are not at all maintained, obviously not the fault of the hotel, but I wouldn't want to be injured or elderly and have to walk up or down that hill very often!

Room 42 has an excellent view over Istanbul and the Golden Horn, room 61 has the same view from two floors higher up, but with the big plus that it has a large terrace. The only minor criticism I have is that the website reservation process does not provide a room-by-room description of the facilities and view for each apartment, and the option to select which one you want. The use of terms like 'Grand King' and 'Grand Queen Panoramic' is not helpful. There are only 17 rooms so this shouldn't be too much to ask.

The suite itself was perfect, and the facilities just right. The Nespresso coffee Machine was an excellent addition and the bed was very very comfortable. The free Internet (excellent connection) was a very big plus, but the biggest draw had to be the view. I simply couldn't get enough of it; day or night. If there were some drawbacks, and one would be knit-picking; it would be the steep climb to the hotel and the uphill, although less steep walk to Taksim (the walk back from Taksim is a breeze). One could of course take a taxi, but since the distances were quite short, I felt embarrassed to take a taxi and preferred the huff and puff of the short but tough climb. I must stress, it was my decision not to take a taxi up the hill when I could have, and the hotel could not be faulted for it. Also, while the breakfast setting was very very nice and the service first class; a little bit more variety in the items from day to day would have been nice. The ride up the lift always had me laugh; make sure to take the lift from the basement all the way to the 6th floor at least once during your stay.

The rooms are big, clean, airy, have excellent kitchen facilities and awesome shower. The fittings are high quality, nothing was broken and the design features add to the quality feel of the place. The personal stuff... The thing that really sets this place apart from the other high end choices in Istanbul is the staff... They are knowledgable, courteous, ever obliging no matter what the request; I would say some of the best service I've ever had. Never intrusive but when called upon for recommendations or advice they were spot on following a series of questions to hone in on exactly what we were looking for. The final pleasant surprise was the final bill, we happily munched on nuts, coffees and even alcoholic drinks in the lobby and from the mini from time to time and having picked up bills in bars around the city thought they would be a similar cost... Not the case. They were very reasonably priced which I wish I'd known sooner as we'd have stopped for drinks more! The location is good for those who like to walk to the main sights (or use the excellent transport links), myself and my partner didn't use the tram once... Istanbul is hilly and the hotel itself is located half way up a incline, bring sensible shoes! We easily walked across to Sultanahemet in 30 mins, stopping off for the recommend per Baklava enroute for fuel! The location is perfect for exploring antique shops, restaurants and bars that are all on its doorstep. All round a fantastic experience...

The Witt Istanbul is definitely where I'll stay again- the location is ideal, in Cihangir, away from the blandness of Nistansi, away from the tourist quarter of Sultanahmet and without the traffic traps of major large five star hotels thanks to being walking distance from the tram (albeit with a steep climb uphill when walking from the Tram to the hotel, which is something we precisely sought out to burn all the calories we would be consuming in Istanbul's great restaurants). The hotel is full of furniture designed by Autobahn (a mod Turkish design company), so don't expect Iznik tiles and kilims. The rooms are spacious, and the sea view corner rooms 4th floor and above have amazing views across the Golden Horn. The breakfast is reasonably well done (not overly generous, but then again they don't have a full kitchen). Besides, there are a number of cafe's down the street that seemed to be buzzing at all hours, with bohemian secular Turks. The staff are very helpful, and try very hard- on occasion they get things wrong, but that's totally forgivable given their sincere attempts at being helpful. The crowd staying at the hotel at the time was not one that I would particularly associate with a mod hotel, and seemed to be comprised mostly of Americans, rather than my preconceived notion of style setters originating in cities like London, Tokyo and Milan. But unless you're offended by guests that cling to that frumpy JC Penny look, this is all neither here-nor-there. The rooms are beautifully done, very clean, with nice touches all around. The extra seating was particularly appreciated. The showers were large, with a very nice and mod shower head. A few nits though- the shelving above the kitchenette island was poorly conceived from a design perspective- banged my head on it twice. A female friend of mine complained of the bathroom lighting in her room as not suited to females, as well as the corian sinks which splashed too much water (they were nice to look at though...). Beware re the bed size- it's described as a \"king\", which is true enough in the European lexicon- but a European king is equivalent to a queen size in North America (a king size bed by North American standards is often referred to in Europe as a \"super-king\"). The hotel is very convenient from a logistics standpoint- walking distance to Beyoglu, Circurcama, the Istanbul Modern, Pera, the Galata area and the ferries at Kabatas. The tram at the bottom of the hill whisks you to Sultanahmet across the Galata bridge in no time - beats sitting in Istanbul's increasingly bad traffic.

The rooms are lovely and on the whole finished to a good quality, showers are amazing, there is ample space if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying for more than a couple of nights and the space is laid out well, the breakfasts are lovely (try the scrambled egg on toast), small muffins left in the afternoon feel like a naughty little treat, the service is on the whole very good (especially from the tall gentleman on reception) with nothing too much effort and any problems (such as our last minute cancellation of a restaurant that was difficult to book for and accidentally leaving one bag behind when taking a taxi to the airport) dealt with very efficiently and graciously. The welcome drink and chat with recommendations is a good touch. The location isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the middle of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctourist Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 however this is something that appealed to us and allowed us to experience a couple of different aspects to the city. The tram is only a few stops from the main attractions. The area felt safe and had some excellent cafes and restaurants, and a couple of mini marts. The Witt do deserve their high rating on Trip Advisor, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d urge them not to let it make them complacent or arrogant as this would lose them the advantage they currently have. If I had any constructive criticism it would be that they should ensure the service staff knock before entering the room (it happened once and they were very apologetic when they realised we were there during the day on that occasion), try not to look ever-so-slightly irritated when faced with an unusual accent that is more challenging to understand, ensure the reception is covered at all times during the night (we had to wait 10 minutes and make a (not cheap as it was a UK mobile) phone call to get access into the hotel when we returned from the wedding) and consider adding to the kitchen unit as currently the guest can use only the fridge and microwave. But overall this was a great hotel with wonderful staff and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have no hesitation in recommending them or, given the opportunity, staying with them again.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rocky river", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "rivertrader46", "ReviewID": "UR116528743", "Content": "We spent three nights here at the end of a two week trip to Turkey.

I rarely had a more professional service in a hotel. The room was impeccably clean and quiet and came with free Wifi. The breakfast in the hotel is truly amazing (the omelet is not to be missed). You are offered a rich choice and an added bonus is that you can have the breakfast in your room. The room has a small area to prepare tea etc. There is a Nespresso machine but the price for a capsule at 3 Euro a piece is a bit on the expensive side. The location is perfect, right in the 'hip' part of Istanbul with lots of restaurants, bars and shopping. Traveling to the Old Town for sightseeing is very easy using the tram. This part of Istanbul is very hilly and the way up to the hotel is steep but short. If you don't like the steep hill, you can always use a taxi. The receptionists can order you one and they even give you instructions to show the taxi driver on your return.

When we arrived, Aykut was very helpful in going over all the important sites on a map. During our stay, I also received help from Anil in making sure we had proper dinner reservations and transportation back to the airport. The biggest star for us was Emrah! His English is perfect and he was simply delightful--he guided us to a place for drinks (Fifth Floor) and then dinner (Hayat Cihangir) by DRAWING MAPS for us!!!!!!! It was absolutely fantastic and I saved the pieces of paper as a memento! Not to mention, his recommendations were superb. The best meal we had in Istanbul (we had been there earlier in our journey but stayed at another hotel before touring around the country and returning to Istanbul) was at Hayat Cihangir and we would not have even known about it if not for Emrah. The room itself was great. We were on the 3rd floor and it was a very well sized space, almost like a studio apartment. The bathroom was wonderful with the 6 shower heads and I believe the floor might have been heated!! My only complaint would be the lighting in the bathroom but it's such a minor thing, I can't even really complain about it!! It was just a little dimmer than we would prefer but it fit in with the vibe of the whole place. The only other tiny thing I would suggest would be a doorman at the front door of the hotel because that door was realllllly heavy! But honestly, these are truly minor things in an otherwise perfect place. The breakfast every morning was full of incredibly delicious and varied choices--there was something for everyone and lots of it. It was all kept very neat and clean. I don't know the name of the man who was there to serve us our coffee and tea but he was just so pleasant to be around, especially first thing in the morning! You could also choose to have breakfast served in your room but we enjoyed being in the lobby and selecting all the yummy stuff on our own--plus we could go back for more! The location is fantastic but not for the out of shape or injured! It can be tough for people who are not used to walking, especially the steep hills and cobblestone streets. For us as New Yorkers, it was not a problem as we love to walk everywhere. We also loved being in the \"hipster\" neighborhood--reminiscent of the East Village in NYC or Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Lots of very cool cafes and restaurants. In close proximity to Taksim, Istiklal Caddesi and Galata Tower but still easy to get to all the tourist attractions via tram or even walking.

I loved everything about it. I had a suite on the top floor (room 62), which has a view straight out over the rooftops across to the Golden Horn and the heritage sites of the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, & others in the old town. We watched the ferries & ships come & go & the light change across the city. Service is fantastic& genuinely friendly - we arrived in a town car & were asked to pay in Euro, not Lira (our fault). The concierge, Aykut, immediately & without asking us got some money & paid the driver to help us out! This helpfulness was demonstrated by his other colleagues too (sorry, have forgotten your names guys!) The modernist design of the suite is brilliant - simple, clean, and luxurious without the try-hard extras put on by upmarket chains. Breakfast & in-room wi-fi is included. The location is 5 minutes to a tram stop, and 10 minutes to the main street (Isklital) and 10 minutes to Taksim Square. Across Galata Bridge to the old town is around 30 minutes. If I had to find a negative - which is hard to do - there is some noise from the small mosque next door, at prayer time.

Although the hotel is not in the Old City where all the major sites are located, it is still quite conveniently located in Beyoglu just up the hill (a bit daunting but you can do it!) from a tram stop (Tophane) that gets you to the Spice Bazaar and the Galata Bridge in two stops, and the major sites (mosques, Topkapi) in four-five stops. Nesting in Beyoglu was quite lovely, because the neighborhood, which is quite encompassing, was interesting and a bit offbeat with many little restuarants,, shops, bakeries and endlessly winding streets with surprises just around every corner; Taksim Square and Istiklar are also within easy walking distance. In short, Beyoglu was really quite convenient to everything. The hotel itself was stunning, with every possible amenity. The rooms are enormous and well-appointed with a spacious sitting area, perfect to come home to after a day of sightseeing. Breakfasts were something to be greatly anticipated--plentiful, fresh, and Turkish delicious, the perfect way to begin a day of active sightseeing. Browse a book from the wonderful little library and listen to music while sipping your Turkish coffee and being teated like royalty by the attentive and delightful staff. Most impressive was the front desk staff, in particular Emrah and Arkut, who so graciously assisted us in planning all of our sightseeing and restaurant reservations. They never seemed to tire of our endless questions, always at the ready with a map and a suggestion to make our days and nights in this fascinating and exotic city as memorable as possible. Their recommendations were always perfect. Without them, our trip just wouldn't have been the same. This is a hotel experience to savor--small and intimate, but without sacrificing luxury.

The expresso machine that is part of the open plan deserves special mention. Breakfast and the staff there were equally amazing. The breakfast is Turkish style, the staff polite and friendly and the food quality and preparation is top quailty. I have to mention George, one of the duty managers. Quite possibly one of the most professional staff I've ever met who went to great lengths to recommend nearby restaurants, accomodate our silghtly oversized car, and even cooly handled my slightly annoyed phone call when we thought we had left some items behind that couldn't be account for (the missus discovered them buried in a bag after all). A total professional - thank you George for all your help and patience.

We were on the first floor so we had some street noise, but that's common in any major city and ear plugs dealt with it. The breakfast (included in our rate) offered cooked-to-order eggs / omelettes, freshly squeezed orange juice, marvellous home made fruit salad, yoghurts, pastries, cheeses, meats etc etc. Again with warm and charming service from the two breakfast waiters. The location is good, being about 10 minutes walk from Taksim Square (not in itself a particularly pretty sight) on typically shoddy Istanbul pavements (which, for the less mobile or poorly sighted, include unguarded drops down to property front doors, uneven and broken paving, crumbling steps etc etc). The tram to the historic sights in Sultanahmet is straight down a steep hill, only about a five minute walk, but you have to walk in the road as the pavements by that part of the street are to all intents and purposes non existent. To get to Istiklal (the main street on the European side of the city) the quickest and for us easiest way was a route involving many steps and astonishingly steep hills which brings you out on the street about half way along. For the less mobile or fit a taxi would be better. Incidentally, traffic seemed well used to avoiding people walking in the street and it appeared preferable to follow the locals and take what seemed a small risk of being run over rather than face a significantly greater risk of a sprained ankle or broken leg from misjudging the pavement. The best things about this hotel? The room, the staff, the service and the breakfast. All fantastic. The receptionist even managed to get us a table at 360 (one of the best restaurants with a view) at short notice on a Friday night. The worst? Two small issues. First, the individually controlled air conditioning was anything but, and the weather still being quite cold would only pump out hot air (and therefore overheat the room) as that was the setting decided by hotel management. I wasn't the only guest to complain about that and the hotel should fix this so that individually controlled means just that. Second, the hotel provides a Nespresso machine in every room but charges 3 Euro for every capsule used. So we didn't use them. Either provide the machine and the capsules as an amenity or don't bother would be my suggestion. Addressing these two small points would make a really great hotel superb.

The rooms look exactly like the photos on their web site. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spacious....no wide-angle photography necessary! We enjoyed the lively neighborhood, full of cafes, shops, and groceries, with a very good wine shop just a few blocks away. Having previously stayed several times in the Sultanahmet, we were glad of a change of location. Their breakfast buffet was quite good, all you could expect, with some of the largest fresh figs we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. When we returned from Damascus, we were presented with a complimentary bottle of wine...a nice touch. Supposedly we were given one of the biggest rooms in the hotel, but it looked about the same size as our first room. As it was a corner room, though, it was sunnier from the extra window, which had a nice view partial view of Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exotic skyline. On our last day in Istanbul, there was a suicide bomber in Taksim Square that morning, a few blocks from the hotel. No one at the hotel mentioned it to us, although we knew something was up due to the presence of news crews at the hospital across the street. I realize there was nothing to be done about it after the fact, but I feel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to keep guests up to date about significant events in the immediate area. One thing about the Witt that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect most guests is the presence of many heavy doors.

Emrah sat with us and spent 20 minutes showing us where we were, how to get places, sites to see and much more. This hotel is very modern and contermporay in decor and amenities. The lobby is cool and comfortable and a welcome respite from the activity of Istanbul. Our room was huge and so comfortable. We had a large sofa and chair along with a bar equipped with fridge, microwave and coffee maker and electric kettle. The bathroom was fabulous with a huge walk-in shower - and five shower heads (maybe more). After coming off a cruise - it was a real treat. There was tons of storage space and room to spread out. We had a lovely little Juliet balcony with a great view of the Galata Tower and the rooftops of the city. The morning light was magical as it reflected on the buildings. After a day of seeing the sites, walking for miles, and rubbing elbows with the 16,000,000 people who call Istanbul home, the Witt Suites was truly an oasis.

The staff at breakfast were so nice and a pleasure to speak with - obviously pleased to share their knowledge of their culture and city. The location of the hotel is excellent - yes there is a very steep hill you need to ascend from the Tram station - but just take it slow.

The free WiFi in the room worked well with iPhone and iPad (although, I think the internet speed was a bit slow because it couldn't handle skype calls very well). Regarding location - It's on a quiet street away from the crowds, yet an easy walk to Taksim or Istiklal pedestrian areas. As many other reviews mention, the walk downhill to the tram is short but steep. The trek uphill to the hotel after a long day on your feet can be challenging. However, we viewed the challenge as a good way to burn off those extra treats we consumed throughout the day. If walking is a problem, I might recommend using taxis or another hotel.

Not sure how I forgot to leave a review for such an amazing hotel, but better late than never. The top floor penthouse is absolutely fabulous. It has a wrap around balcony with deck chairs and a dining setting for late night drinks and relaxing (whilst watching the sunset over the Bosphoros and call to prayer) or morning breakfast in the sunshine. The size is huge by any standard. The bed - a super king - is so big you could get lost in it. It is incredibly comfortable too, with fresh crisp white sheets. The decor is fantastic - think scandanavian/swedish uber trendy design in high quality finishes. Everything has been thought of in the room for your comfort and enjoyment. Even an evening snack which is brought in when the rooms are made up for you. The minibar is very well stocked and reasonably priced, though there is a supermarket just a block away and loads of cafes and eateries nearby. The breakfast is great, ordered the night before and delivered for you to enjoy in your room (or you can have it downstairs if preferred). We have had 2 sets of friends stay in a sea view suite and they said these were also extremely large and appointed with the same top quality finishes and thoroughly enjoyed it. On our last night, we had to change to the other penthouse (slightly smaller and cheaper) as the one we had been staying in was pre-booked. This too was fantastic with a large balcony and great pressure shower. We certainly weren't dissapointed. Location-wise the hotel is a short walk to taxim and all the bustling activity (around 10 or 12 minutes). It is a very short walk downhill to the main road with tram stop which takes you anywhere - Sultanahmet, Istiklal etc (between 5-7 minutes). Only word of warning is if you try and walk back up the hill, it is a significant incline-so we were always exhausted by that stage of the day and took a cab. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in Istanbul. The outlook from the rooms is very mystical, particularly at dusk. We always stayed on the balcony enjoying the sunset, then headed out for a later meal. The hotel is so good, you need to make a conscious effort to leave. Fortunately in Istanbul there is no shortage of amazing places to visit, so this makes it a little easier. I would certainly recommend this over staying in the more touristy areas, such as Sultanahmet. It is much nicer to be able to head out there for a day of site seeing them return 'home' where the restaurants nearby and setting is much more authentic and less gymicky.

I was glad I emailed the hotel about transit from the cruise terminal. Their advice was spot on. The taxis at the cruise terminal run a racket - fixed fares, off meter. They quote a \"standard\" rate double to triple the meter. The hotel advised the appropriate rate and we refused to pay more. The dispatcher conceded when we said we'd call the hotel to send a taxi.

The hotel is only a 10 minute walk to the new Istanbul where all the good bars and restuarants are too.

The huge bed is so luxorious, thre is an ipod system, TV with all channels, and the most amazing shower! Quite literally the best shower expereince ever (the molton brown shower gel and hand cream is a lovely touch!).

Floor to ceiling windows along two walls and a wrap around balcony make it a very special place to watch the sun set over Istanbul.

We arrived in Taksim late in the evening in a thunderstorm (yes it does rain sometimes!), and got lost trying to find the Witt. We did eventually find it, thanks to 2 friendly police officers, who took pity on our bedraggled appearance, and gave us a lift. The apartments are on 6 floors (get the top floor if possible for a view over the Bosphorus), and we were on the 4th. It was open and spacious, and had a small balcony, which if you opened the double doors, gave an excellent view over the city. There is no cooking facilities, just a microwave, fridge, and sink, with an assortment of cutlery & crockery. The bathroom was roomy, and the shower had 2 settings (single head standard, and multi-head on the ceiling). Breakfast was from 7.00 - 11.00, so plenty of time to get over the 2 hour difference, and was buffet style, with a turkish slant - very nice. Top tip is to get the Bosphorus ferry, which takes you from west to east and back several times, travelling the length of the Bosphorus, and ending just at the mouth of the Black Sea, on the east side. The ferry waits there 2 hours, giving you time to walk around, or eat (not enough time for both), and then retraces it's steps. All for 25 Lira (about \u00c2\u00a311). Otherwise, if you get the \"Bosphorus Cruise\" for 10 Lira, it only takes you 1/3 of the way up, and doesn't stop - avoid it at all costs. We visited Topkapi Palace (visiting the Harem is a must), and the Blue Mosque (which is free). Don't take the open top bus tour, as the commentary is poor, and the experience is not good value for money. Evenings walking along the pedestrianised Istiklal Caddesi were great, with so many sidestreets off, containing bars & restaurants. We were spoiled for choice.

It was the best hotel that we stayed in whilst in Turkey, & in particular, Istanbul, during our one month trip around the country. We stayed at some hotels that were rated 5 star during this time. I would have to say that none of these compared to the quality provided by the Witt. The rooms were extremely spacious, modern, beautifully appointed, & very clean. We were able to have 2 roll our beds for the kids & still have lots of room to move in despite luggage for 4 people. There is a sitting area with a couch, coffee table & satellite TV. The kitchenette is well equipped with a microwave, fridge, crockery, coffee maker, kettle etc. Wonderful for a family. The bathrooms were spacious, with stunning appointments & extremely clean. The Molton Brown soap & lotions were luxurious. We stayed in both city view & sea view suites. Both were lovely & comfortable; however, if you can book a sea view one, do so as the view is well worth it . The staff were wonderful. Nothing was too hard for them. Upon my return to Istanbul, I had severely injured myself on the tour bus steps (a ruptured achilles tendon, but that's another story !!) & had difficulty walking. I thought that my 1 week stay in Istanbul was going to be a disaster. However, the concerned hotel manager very kindly arranged for a wheel chair & crutches to be provided for my use throughout our stay - at no cost !! I also was very impressed that after a day of major shopping, upon our request the management provided us with every imaginable packing material (again, at no cost) so that we could post a large parcel back home. I am sure that they would have mailed it for us if we had asked, but we had relations there who did this for us. There is not a restaurant serving meals at all times, but you can have a buffet breakfast downstairs or place an order & have it delivered to your room. We did the latter most of the time as my children (after an arduous tour of the country) were keen to lounge in our comfortable room & take advantage of the satellite TV which, though initially difficult to navigate, was relatively easy after assistance by one of the patient staff. The breakfast was very substantial, though at times we couldn't predict what would or would not arrive as part of our order. Some nights after sight seeing my children were too tired to go out.for dinner. The concierge had a myriad of menus from nearby restaurants from which we could select a delicious meal at reasonable cost which was promptly delivered to us. When I wanted to arrange an afternoon tea at the hotel for my relations, the manager quickly organised for top quality baklava & cookies to be brought in AT COST & set up a lovely private sitting area downstairs with tea & coffee service provided attentively. The kind & friendly personal attention & service that we received at this hotel was wonderful. Our experience could have been tarnished due to my serious injury if not for the amazing support provided by the staff. Further, unlike some hotels around Turkey, even those rated 5 star, the staff can speak perfect English . They were helpful in arranging taxis for us. One problem that we faced was that upon our return, it was difficult for taxis to find their way back. I found that it was easier if you told them that it was near the German & Italian hospitals. Otherwise, you may need to download a map from the internet & keep it with you. I am sure the staff wouldn't mind helping with this. There also is very little parking available which caused some problems when visitors arrived to see us. The only quibble that I had with the hotel was that come November, the heating was put on full blast. Prior to that, the airconditioning had been excellent (which is a rare thing in Turkey). My husband called management when we awoke roasting in our beds at 1 am. Upon our request, the heating was turned down for a short while. However, it was put back on full blast within a couple of hours and again we sweated terribly. My children even awoke & had to take off their PJs. We eventually opened the windows. However, be warned, the hotel is near to a couple of mosques & the duelling calls to prayer boom through the room when the windows are open. (We love the call to prayer, but sleep is important, too. ) Otherwise, the hotel rooms themselves are very quiet. & you would never know that anyone else was staying there. The hotel is located near Taksim & Beyoglu, just a short walk from Istiklal Road. There are some hilly areas, so be warned - get a cab if needed. If you want to see the 'Old City', it is only a short inexpensive taxi ride there. There are many little local stores where you can buy soft drinks & the like if you should need to This is a top hotel - a real find - & I thank tripadvisor for providing the information which led to my reservation.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "worldtraveller555", "ReviewID": "UR63931805", "Content": "We went to Istanbul for 5 days in a business trip and the Hotel is great.

One thing to bear in mind however is that access from the hotel to the public transport is a really steep but not very well paved road, so if you have walking difficulties it would be necessary to use cabs, which are plentiful enough. Location-wise there are lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby and it's close to the tram link.

You find an ordinary 70s building in chic location, near Taxim but not that too near to this crazy square, and you hire the best Turkish designers, Autoban (a must-do is to visit their shop in Pera) to turn it into a luxury suites hotel. The rooms are impeccable: function meets beauty in a way that could become a case-study for other hotels! The staff is very polite, the toiletries are from Molton Brown and the breakfast has quality (albeit nothing to shout about!!). The city is indeed spectacular, one of the great cities of the world but in my opinion with a great down-side (read below). Few suggestions: The restaurant recommendations need to be again very well thought-off. At the moment i write this review (on my 3d day) we have had only bad dinners. To be fair, only one tavern was recommended to us (Sofiyali 9) from the hotel and we went there on a new year eve BUT the food seems to be an issue in this great city, sorry guys but the food quality i had ranged from disgusting to medium!!!! I think that such a hotel should really try to find the best in restaurants, if possible in the vicinity, and warm the guests about the problematic food scene. And the guests should really do some homework before they come to Istanbul if they want to eat properly (and not pay a fortune). A small massage room would be a nice addition as the hotel, other than the great rooms, seem to not cater to the other needs that a modern traveller might have, such as some kind of spa facilities or a good restaurant or some nice in-hotel bar where locals would also frequent.

Regardless of what aspect you wish to comment on, this hotel is flawless. From our arrival we were greeted warmly and offered drinks and a chat regarding what we wanted to do that evening. The lobby/breakfast area is beautifully designed in modern decor but is warm and inviting. The staff - absolutely outstanding. Friendly, and knowledgable, we had some great restaurant experiences by describing exactly the type of place we felt like each evening. Location - many restaurants are within walking distance as is the main pedestrian street. A short downhill walk will get you to the tram stop - from here you are easily connected to the major tourist sites of Istanbul - minutes to the end of the tram line will take you to Dolmabahce Palace then travelling in the opposite direction you can get to the Mosques, Bazaars, etc. very easily and within minutes. It is extremely easy to navigate by following the tram lines if you choose to walk back to the hotel. Breakfast - fantastic assortment of cold buffet items as well as eggs if you wish to have a hot breakfast. One morning our waiter suggeted trying a typical Turkish breakfast item which I did, and was told the hotel manager had made it at home. It is these types of special touches which make the hotel so outstanding when compared to most hotels. The rooms - we found them incredibly spacious and great design features. Many reviewers commented on the shower and it was not disappointing - the best shower ever! Molton Brown products in the bathroom, the design of the shower, sinks and fixtures were gorgeous. The bed was comfortable, linens soft and there was a sizable sitting area with flat screen tv, kitchen and mini fridge for refreshments. We were quite impressed with the stock of in room refreshments including a bottle of Turkish wine that we enjoyed - prices were fairly reasonable as well. We had a truly memorable stay at the Witt - I honestly don't think we would have experienced as much of Istanbul staying at one of the typical five stars that we were considering before reading the reviews of the Witt.

The place is gorgeous and looks like the Web site. It is one of the nicest places we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in. I love the little holes everywhere! The room was large with a comfy bed. It was surprisingly quiet given our room location. It was kept clean. The location was excellent for our activities. The best part about the place truly was the staff. Kursad, the F&B manager, was the best. He was accommodating, friendly and helpful. He is also quite funny. Honestly breakfast with him was a highlight each day. One example of why we love him - one day, our favorite breakfast item was not available and he sent someone out to a nearby bakery to get something that was close to the item not available. I was so astounded that he would go that much trouble. Who does that anymore? It was so thoughtful. He answered all of all questions and convinced us to take the cruise up the Bosphorous (How could we not - everyday he asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have you taken the cruise yet?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Incidentally, I recommend that to everyone. The rest of the staff was friendly and accommodating as well. We enjoyed talking with everyone (thanks to Onor and Murat for answering all of our questions) and appreciated the opportunity to interact with everyone on a more personal level than we would have been able to at a larger hotel. Small items that could enhance the stay - more light for the bathroom mirror, a digital alarm clock, and a few complimentary bottles of inexpensive drinking water. Also soy milk at breakfast would have been nice for those who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do dairy. I know they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accommodate every special request, but just thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d mention it. And, curiously, there were no peepholes on the doors. I think this would just be a prudent safety measure. The only snag we hit was with a leak in our bathroom. The ceiling in our bathroom began leaking one evening. Of course at the time we did not know what exactly was leaking, the toilet? shower? sink? etc. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spare you the details but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say it really should have been handled much better. It did get fixed the next day. We were very surprised that we were never approached by a manager in the following days with an apology. We had to bring it up in the end to ask for a credit for a night (which was granted) but certainly felt we should not have had to inquire and an apology should have been proactively offered. By their collective response, it seemed as though the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think leaking sewage in our room was really much of an inconvenience for us. It really was. Perhaps it is just a cultural difference as we have been afforded a higher level service for much more minor issues at other establishments. Even with the snag, we would stay here again and would recommend it. The only unfortunate part for us is that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid with its popularity it will become too expensive for us.

You are made to feel at home from the moment you walk through the doors (and even earlier, if you order a pick-up service at the airport through the hotel). I was traveling with family and we had two rooms over 8 nights at the Witt. The hotel ended up feeling like home for us. Onur, Murat and Aykut at the reception are simply exceptional. They helped us with everything from restaurants and directions to experiencing local spots. Always a smile, always willing to help and extremely warm and friendly. After a long day, we we were always offered tea when we walked into the hotel. There is a great lounge area in the lobby with an eclectic collection of books and travel guides and several DVDs (for the room). The rooms are extremely large with the most amazing and comfortable beds and shower. Heated marble floors and six-head showers in the bathroom with amazing Molton Brown products are a fantastic touch! The kitchen area (fabulous marble island) is great - espresso machine, hot water pot and a great selection of items (many that you pay for, if you consume). The owner of the hotel, Tuncel, was also there during our stay. He was extremely generous with his time, regularly checked to make sure everything was fine with our stay and that we were having a good time, and provided us with several excellent suggestions - - restaurants, neighborhoods and shopping. The morning breakfast (included in the room rate) is fantastic - cheeses, cold cuts, cereals, baked goods, eggs made to order, juice, coffee/tea etc. Kursad, the gentleman who serves breakfast, was such a joy to get to know. He provided us with great service and it was a joy to talk to him every morning. The Witt was an absolute highlight of our stay in Istanbul. I know I will definitely be returning to this hotel as it is a true gem. Having stayed in several different hotels in numerous countries, the Witt easily ranks among the best.

The room also includes a fantastic bathroom that includes a fantastic and enormous rain shower. The Witt offers a free breakfast which is pretty good, offering a good selection of breads and jams and cheeses. The location, while on a very steep hill, is an ideal location for exploring Istanbul. It is across the Golden Horn from the major tourist sights in Sultahanmet and as a result is in a real neighborhood. The street the hotel is on is lined with restaurants, bakeries, and cafes primarily frequented by locals and not tourists. While the hotel is up a steep hill from the nearest tram stop, it is a walkable hill. And there are alternatives to get up the hill, such as the two nearby funiculars. The hotel is located near Taksim Square and Istikal Cadessi, offering lots of restaurants and shopping opportunities. While it is across the Galata Bridge from the major sights of Sultanahmet, it is only about a 45 minute walk to those sights, or a quick tram ride. The hotel is also close - about a 10 minute walk - from the metro stop in Taksim Square. Personally, I liked being a bit away from the major tourist attractions and in a neighborhood.

We had breakfast served there and the staff were marvellous, accommodating in every way and we felt like we were their number 1 priority! The suite was a marriage of chic state of the art style and true comfort with a tranquil ambience. Every little detail had been considered to make your stay as perfect as possible. The design was a feast for the eyes. The breakfast was varied, generous, healthy, delicious and well balanced. Something different appeared everyday and the homemade grissini sticks in the lobby and homemade chocolate muffins that appeared everyday in our suite were delicously wicked! Tuncel and Secil gave great insider tips on arrival so we did not have to spend our short stay finding things out. We went to neighbourhoods we would never have found thanks to them and enjoyed the most we possibly could from our 5 day stay. The restaurants they booked and recommended were spot on and varied. Their staff could not do enough for us and helped in every small way. Secil even made us a little map of a particular neighbourhood with her favourite shops because we wanted to shop and take advantage of the sales. She was great and we are so very grateful. The hotel is set on a hill with outstanding views of the Bospherous and landmarks of Istanbul in an area full of life with lots of coffee shops and great ecclectic boutiques. You are walking distance from Taksim and this could not have been a more perfect trip. In fact we are definitely going back in January as it was so memorable and we are still talking about it.

(The official conference hotels were all nondescript , large chains and because I only had limited time to explore Istanbul outside of my meetings, I was looking for something smaller and more personalised.) Beginning with my initial emails to the hotel, I was impressed with their prompt and thorough communications. In addition, their website includes a wealth of information (including videos!) about the area and provides helpful tools (e.g., maps, print instructions in English/Turkish to help the taxi drivers find the hotel) for organizing your journey. Upon arrival, I was so pleased that my initial positive experiences continued throughout the stay. The staff at Witt - especially Murat at reception and Kursad in the cafe area - were extremely patient with questions (eg, directions, recommendations, pronunciation of names, etc.). Starting with the refreshing lemonade at check-in, everyone went out of their way to be helpful and they welcomed you to call them at any time if you received confusing information outside the hotel. The hotel is located in a truly lovely neighborhood - on a small street lined with local cafes and shops. If you walk 5 mins south (down the steeper - but not actually too steep - of the hills described in other reviews), you are at the Tophane tram stop (a great and inexpensive way to avoid the taxi issues described in previous discussions on Istanbul) and just a few more mins to the water. To get to the Lutfi Kirdar Convention Center (LKCC - the site of my meeting) was a very nice 22 min walk north; of which about 12 mins is a gentle hill (definitely NOT steep - I walked it twice daily for 7 days in shoes with 2.5\" heels with no problem). To get to the LKCC, you pass through Taksim Square and just adjacent to the Istiklal pedestrian avenue so you have very easy access to all the restaurants, shopping and entertainment you could ever want. You are also quite close to the best baklava and Turkish sweets in the world... at the Karakoy Gulluoglu (don't miss it!). The rooms are quite large by European standards and 2 adults had plenty of room to coexist comfortably. Everything is very clean, sleek and purposeful. After a long, steamy day it's a nice place to relax... and the showers are especially refreshing. My room was fully equipped (microwave, TV, refrigerator, kettle, iPod dock, Nespresso machine, etc) and everything worked very well. When we requested an iron/board to press clothes for the conference, one was provided within 5 minutes. The complimentary breakfast buffet is delicious - a nice combination of fruits, grains, coffee/tea and fresh juice. In contrast to a previous review, I actually enjoyed eating in the well purposed reception... very chic, reminding me of the Library Hotel in New York City. High speed wireless is complimentary (some of my colleagues were paying 20E/day at the big chains) and there is also a computer in the lounge that you can use. The Witt reception area has a book of restaurants (all kinds) that they personally recommend and they offered great advice about seeing the local sites. I was fortunate to have a week of gorgeous weather with rain (and sadly floods in the NW) coming only on the last day - on which I was offered an umbrella by reception. In conclusion, I will definitely be returning (for pleasure!) to Istanbul and I will absolutely book the Witt Istanbul Suites.

I had been looking all over town for Cornucopia magazine, but only found it here with our well-edited coffee table magazines.

Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 30 minute walk to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Istanbul but, the area around Witt Istanbul is buzzing. There are bars and restaurants galore and also the main shopping area in Istanbul, including some wonderful antique shops. Also, the walk to see the traditional sights over the Galata Bridge gives you a chance to see another side to Istanbul - and you can always catch the tram. Our suite didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t technically have a view but, if you hung out of the small Juliette balcony you could see the Bosphorus which was enough of a view for us. The decor of the suite was so contemporary and there was so much room with a huge bed, sitting area and a gorgeous bathroom with amazing shower. You really couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for anything more. On our first night they even ordered pizza for us to eat in our room. The breakfast buffet each morning was really delicious and served by friendly staff. On one night we ate at Changa just down the road which was wonderful whilst the views from Leb-i-Derya at the Richmond Hotel where we had drinks are just stunning. The hotel sorted out a trip to the Aga hamman for me and my husband. Being a prudish Brit amongst a room of me (as well as male masseuses) it was certainly an experience. I was very kindly taken to a separate room for my massage but, do expect to expose yourself to the masseuse!

The hotel is a triumph of design whilst still being very comfortable. Good quality bedding. Excellent breakfasts. Lots of space even on the lower floors. But it is the staff who make staying here such a pleasure. From the surprise Mother's Day gift (thank you) through to recommendations for trips out and food the staff are friendly and very helpful. Even when our transfer to the airport failed to turn up (more about the transfer company in Istanbul forum) the staff moved swiftly to organise a transfer for us which despite exceptionally heavy traffic jams managed to get us to the airport on time. They even telephoned us during the trip to the airport to keep us informed of the estimated time of arrival as the driver did not speak English! Now that is thoughtful! My only suggestion is that breakfast needs some explanation. Fresh fruit juice and cooked eggs are available if you ask but they cost extra which isn't made clear. It would have been nice to know that freshly squeezed orange was available on day one. If you do not want to be closeted in the centre of Istanbul with the carpet sellers and hordes of tourists then stay in Beyoglu which is the European area of the city. The area is lovely with lots of places to eat and drink. You can spend ages exploring the back streets and mixing with the locals. As I have mobility problems we didn't climb up the hill from Tophane Tram station. We took the tram to Kabatas (next stop along from Tophane) and then the funicular to Taksim Square where we then strolled down to the hotel with lots of opportunity for shopping on the way especially at the cake shop !!

From the minute we arrived, we were completely spoilt. The check-in was easy and the guys behind the desk could not do enough to help and recommend places to visit or eat/drink. We had a room on the 4th floor (43) and I would totally recommend the extra cost to get the larger room AND the view of the old town. The rooms are absolutely beautiful. Everything from the attention to detail in the wall hangings, through to the excellent little kitchen/bar areas is just a dream. Our room was also huge, which meant that a late afternoon rest on the divine leather sofa with a chilled bottle of wine, some baklava and a DVD from the collection downstairs, was a real treat after a full day of sightseeing! Yes, the hotel is half way up a fairly steep hill, but taxis are cheap and if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face the walk, they are an easy way to get home.

In terms of the hotel itself - really superb value in a city that actually isn't that cheap.
