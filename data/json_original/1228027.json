{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good, clean and above expectations I have stayed in Florence before  knew what to expect or not to expect from hotels in this class... however the Caravaggio was a pleasant surprise. The hotel was incredibly clean / spotless, staff were friendly and helpful (they never once charged me full internet usuage  gave me lots of free coffee) and I had a pleasant 6 night stay. The rooms had a nice decor and the bathrooms were all newly rennovated. Like all hotels in Florence, there is some noise from outside and the floors in the hotel are tiled so sound does carry. Breakfasts were adequate and above the usual stock standard fare. There are some good restaurants near by - highly recommend the very tasty 'I Brincello' a two minute walk down the street towards the train station. Would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Dec 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR566909808", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IntrepidAU"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1228027-r23024689-Caravaggio-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "1228027", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
