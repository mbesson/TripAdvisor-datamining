Guests are issued with a card key which sometimes doesn't work and I had to go back downstairs to reception to get it fixed. This card must be placed in a slot for the electricity (lights, aircon, tv) to work. Also the TV was left on so I got a bit of a shock at loud blaring noise when I entered the room for the first time. Leave the TV in standby so you don't wake any guests if you come home late (I was never woken by a neighbouring guest's TV by the way). Pros: Location: So near the Arc de Triumph and Champs Elysees - perfect for shopping and I arrived just in time for the sales (although Paris is very dear for clothes even in a sale). Staff: The reception staff all have very good english and make a real effort. Room: Second floor. Double bed. Was a solo traveller so was fine for space (could be a bit cramped with 2 people but bear in mind most tourists are out all day). Airconditioning: Great to have it but TAKE NOTE: it cannot be switched on when a guest is out so the room may be warm (too hot) when you return. However within about 15-20 minutes it's back to a nice cool temperature. Bathroom: Was very clean and had a bath which was great to relax in every evening. Had a room facing out onto rue de montenotte not onto rue de Terns. Was nice and quiet most of the time. No noise from this little quiet street but I was very near rue de terns so traffic could be a little loud (see below in cons) Room had a little balcony with double doors opening onto it which was lovely. TV: Large flatscreen, obviously all channels in French but I think CNN was on it too. Fridge: Worked fine and very well stocked. I didn't have anything from it as it was too expensive (for my budget) but very handy to store my cheaper bottles of water, drinks etc. Concierge: From what I could see they allow guests to leave luggage if they have to wait for a flight but check this as some hotels have stopped doing this for security risks. Cons Location: The street is a little hard to find so have a very good map handy. Noise: Unfortunately the walls are paper thin but I only had one night out of 4 where a guest stayed in the room next door. However I could hear him going to the toilet and taking a shower at 1:00 am. I could also hear other noisy guests. It's pot luck really if you are staying at the same time with considerate people or just rude ones! My advice with the paper thin walls is to ask that you be put in a room away from other guests if the hotel doesn't have full occupancy when you are staying there. My first night there a lot of noise came from a pub accross the street which was a Thursday night but was quiet after that (11:00 pm) so I'm guessing it's frequented by people who work nearby and not a loud tourist pub at weekends (Fri/Sat/Sun)? Windows/Double doors: Opened onto a little balcony which could have done with some cleaning but then I had great trouble closing them for the next four days and even though the receptionist came up to look they never fully closed. The only thing wrong was extra noise could come in from Terns street so ask to change rooms if you have a dodgy window/double doors. I am a heavy sleeper. Housekeeping: Come every day but one day left a dirty towel with what looked like hair dye stains. I meant to complain but was so busy I forgot but I wouldn't normally let a hotel away with this. Bathroom: Flooded when I took a shower, annoying as I had to use a towel to mop up every morning. Breakfast: Was 13 Euros, cheaper than a lot of other hotels but I never had it at that price. Lift: Really is tiny but hey it works! Can be awkward with large suitcases though. I hope this review was of some help, I would stay there again, but I would warn them about the noise. I do think that all advantages outweigh the disadvantages.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201chorrible room\u201d", "Author": "KatherineMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR39531599", "Content": "The hotel lift was tiny and barely fit a person in it, let alone a person wiht luggage.

Once you have your luggage put away, you can opt for the circular staircase which winds around the elevator shaft (practice for the circular stairs to the top of the Arc de Triumpe). We had our 16-year old grandson with us and found the triple room to be adequate in size. Contrary to a few of the posts, we found all of the staff to be quite helpful and very nice. We thourougly enjoyed our stay in Paris and the hotel played a part in that. The neighborhood seemed safe. There are a few restaurants in the area. I would suggest passing the Chez Clement about 2 blocks away on Ave de Wagram and eating at the sidewalk cafe Chez Clement at 123 Ave des Champs Elysees (2 blocks east of the Arc de Triumpe). As one other post, the phone in our room never worked, however as requested they did provided a wake-up knock on our door the morning of our depart.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "cookie1121", "ReviewID": "UR7046063", "Content": "Arrived Lunchtime check-in was fast, when i booked the hotel i was told breakfast was included but the receptionist said it was room only, we were on the 5th floor the lift could only take 2 people never seen a lift so small, hotel only supplied cartons of milk for tea or coffee on the arrival day not much use if you wanted a hot drink on the second day, the room was small but clean bathroom was small but clean to.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "daoly", "ReviewID": "UR6034535", "Content": "Stayed there recently for 3 nites from 23 Oct. 2006.

After arriving on an overnight flight from the US, we were told by a non-sympathetic desk receptionist the room would be ready at 3pm, and no sooner. Exhausted, we returned at 1pm to ask again. Again we were told we could not check in until 3pm, but for lack of anything better to do, we waited in the lobby. They finally gave us a key at 2pm. One to two hours of check-in time is a huge difference when traveling overnight. Also, the hotel's own website is misleading. The front picture is wrong - it's been changed somehow to make the lobby look bigger. There is no separate \"concierge\" as the site says; the front desk receptionist functions as this. Also, the \"bar and lounge\" is a small area within 5 feet of the reception desk that had a small couch and two chairs, and a teeny tiny bar (which we never saw anyone use because who is supposed to be manning this \"bar\"? - the receptionist?). The whole area is smaller than my living room at home. Also, their website says there is valet parking and there is not; says breakfast is 8 euros when it is 12; says \"elevators\" when there is one elevator that fits either two people smooshed together or one person with their luggage. Also, I don't know how this hotel classifies itself as a business center - there is not even voicemail in the rooms. The front desk will take a message and deliver a hand-written message to your room - while I received several in this way they failed to give me at least one that I know about. As well, there is no internet connection in the rooms but you can purchase a card that will allow you to use their wireless downstairs. Other little things were annoying - there is no iron or ironing board in the rooms but you can get one from reception -- yourself. You yourslef have to go down and pick up the board and iron, and then yourself bring it back when you were done. We had champagne in our room one evening but they had no ice for us to keep it chilled. Overall, this hotel was nothing special. The room was clean and at least there was air conditioning.
