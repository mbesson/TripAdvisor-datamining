After reading the reviews we were a little worried, but with no need what so ever! To get to the hotel was easy! We booked the water bus straight from the airport from Lido, this cost 15euros each, but was definitely worth it as I think this was the best possible way to arrive! (Try and get seats outside at the back of the boat, this way you can see everything appraoching!) We arrived at Lido and it was just a 5 minute walk up the main street! Our hotel room was lovely, we were on the top floor. From what I can see there were only 2 rooms like ours. Can't remember which number the room opposite was, but ours was 311. We couldn't open the windows, but soon worked out it was because we had an air conditioning unit in our room on constantly. This was a god send!! Our room was very spacious (a double bed & a single, wardrobe, 2 bedside tables, chest of draws, desk with a cupboard and a tv. Bathroom was big as well, shower, toilet, beday, sink & mirror) it was a bit rough around the edges, but we had fresh towels and our bed changed every day! The only draw back was there was no lift, so we had 4 flights of stairs to climb. This didn't really bother us, as we were eating so much food we probably needed the extra exercise!! We saw into the other rooms briefly (walking down the stairs passed as they were being cleaned), I can't comment on these really. They all had large windows with shutters, but looked slightly smaller than ours. Still would be perfectly acceptable for the price of this hotel considering its perfect location. Lido is beautiful, we were so thankful we stayed here rather than in Venice itself. Venice is very easy to get to though, the waterbus runs what seems like every 5/10mins and it goes 24 hours a day. No trouble. We bought a week travel pass for 53euros, which included our transfer back to the airport. (waterbus to p. roma and then no.5 bus to the airport). There is glorious beaches all along Lido, and it was perfect to come back to after being in the hustle and bustle of Venice for a couple of hours. We hired a 2 person bike one day and found an even nicer beach on the left hand tip of the island (as you look at it from Venice). The water was very clear here, with hardly any people and 2 gorgeous beach bars leading onto it. I think you can catch the bus here from just side the hotel. Unfortunately we only found it the day before going home and didn't have time to go back here for a day. Loads of places to eat and drink along the street the hotel is on, its location was actually pretty central. There is a supermarket up to the right, on the way to the waterbus stop. We didn't eat breakfast here, it was an extra 5euros per person per day, we found a little bar up the street opposite the supermarket called 'Bounty Bar'. They were very friendly here, and we had a couple of croissants or pastries each a day, which some coffee and water and cost us about 8euros all together. All in all a perfect holiday!!

Provided you're fine with Lido and the 6.50 euro ferry fee you'll be paying each time you want to leave (or not, somehow I don't think anyone ever checks if you paid to board), the location is quite good. Lido seems to have a \"main\" street extending from the ferry stop to the beach across the island where the grocery store and all the restaurants and tourist shops are. Reiter is conveniently located roughly half-way down this street. Upon arrival, we were notified that our double room was unavailable for the first of the two nights, and that they could either offer a much smaller room with two single beds for 10 euros less than we ordered, or we could get a regular double at a sister hotel elsewhere on Lido. Wary of sister hotels, we opted for the first option, landing what I think was 203. As promised, the room is ridiculously small, coupled with an absurd amount of bulky furniture. The combination of both factors meant we had to stuff our luggage into the closet, and move the table and dressers around as if we were playing \"Parking Garage\" whenever we wanted to open the balcony/window. The second night, however, we were offered a much more spacious room with three beds at our original rate as compensation--307 I think. Both rooms were adequately clean and tidy, though they had water/fungus stains around some ceiling corners. We had some moths flap around our pillow in the second room, as well, so I would not be surprised if bugs become an issue as the summer goes on. The electrical wiring also seems a bit hazardous, with the sockets shakily sticking out exposed from the wall. The bathrooms were clean and roomy, however, with all the standard amenities like towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Water was hot in the first room early in the morning; in the second room, by 10 AM, it would not exceed lukewarm. Because we changed rooms each night, we did not get to see how well room service took care of used sheets and towels. Each room gets a TV, but no fridge, and food is not allowed into the room. The balconies are also a nice touch, provided you can access them. Decoration is plain, sparse, and very inconspicuous. In short, a decent place for sleeping, but I wouldn't want to spend any time of my day in there--what you'd expect of a decent hostel. The staff appear friendly enough, though their English is limited. They're helpful enough to let you use their dining hall utensils and tables for eating your own food during the day, but not enough to tip you off to a good restaurant or local price range. Maybe they're much better if you can, or at least try to, speak Italian. Didn't try their breakfast (for which you have to pay). No lift. All in all, there's nothing terribly wrong with this place (aside from having ridiculously small rooms directly across from the stairwell), but nothing endearing either. Expect this to be more of a good hostel than a hotel, and you won't be disappointed. The price could be cheaper for what you get, though. I realize Venice is expensive, but so is Rome, and we grabbed a much better place there for the same price (Alice in Wonderland). Especially when you consider that this is Lido, a ferry ride away from mainland Venice and with a bland continental atmosphere (no Venice charm here), I think they should be offering either a better rate or better amenities.

Although it was a little more than we would have liked to pay for what we got, thats pretty much the norm when you are looking for something around carnival time, even if you do book further in advance but it was ok. Hotel Reiter is on Lido which is about 20 mins away from the main islands by water bus, and about 5 mins walk from the Hotel, to the water bus stop. We stayed in room 108 on the 1st floor. Walls are pretty thin, so we could hear people coming and going (our room was right by the staircase) so if you were a light sleeper maybe you could request a room further away from foot traffic. The room was basic, but had everything we needed. Good heating, queen sized bed, hand towles, bath towels, and floor towl (although we didn't have a face cloth, no biggie though). Ensuit bathroom, small but fine for what we needed. High water pressure in shower, toilet, sink, hair drier. The water tank must have run out the first day, and I got a cold shower, but I had left it untill late in the morning, so I must have been one of the last to have shower and all the hot water was gone.

There was no fridge or sink, so its a good idea to buy a few plastic bowls and cutlery if you want to save a bit of money by not eating out all the time. There is a super market about 3 mins walk down from the Hotel Lido is a good location. Being slightly away from the main island, its a bit cheaper, but it doesn't take very long to get to the main islands. If you are on a budget as we were I would recoment eating at Lido as much as you can rather than the main island. We worked out that on average most things are about 5 euros cheaper per dish, so if you were having a starter plus main or dessert you could be saving up to around 20-30 euros for the whole meal for two people.

The hotel is located on the main drag, just about 3 blocks from the vaporetto station (no hills on the island). It was nice because you can reserve online and pay via credit card. also includes a private bathroom which is a gem in budget accommodations in Europe. The hotel doesn't have a lift, so be prepared to lift you own luggage up the stairs. They only have 1 hair dryer, so you have to borrow it from the front desk when you want to use it - no problem. Breakfast was effecient (included), of fresh rolls with hazelnut spread (Nutella imitation that was fine). The coffee is despensed out of one of those nescafe machines, which is mas o menos. a fine stay.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conamara, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cIrish group in Hotel Reiter\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5026939", "Content": "A group of 15 Conamara people syed at Hotel Reiter on the May Bank Holiday weekend. Everyone in the group found the hotel a nice place to stay. It is unpretensious but friendly and comfortable. The manager (Fabio) was very flexible and accomodating, as we needed to make some changes in types of rooms, from singles to doubles etc. The location is great. The Lido itself is a very nice place, completely different to Venezia. Overall we would recommend it to anyone......unless you are a bit of a fusser and have nothing to do with your time but go on the internet. Beidh muid ar ais.

The Hotel Reiter was lovely, especially considering how cheap it was. When we asked for a double room, the smiley guy at the desk asked, \"United or seperate?\" which was quite funny. We actually got a quad room so the bathroom was lovely and big - i'd stay there again just for the power shower!! We got stung when we first arrived off the bus from the airport as we followed a crowd and ended up on a private boat over to San Marco. You need to go to the ACTV water bus station which is behind the auto bus station to get the public bus - its a lot cheaper and if you get the 51 or 52 bus, will take you straight to Lido. There is a nice bar in Lido called Star People and the owner, Luca is lovely (if you go, say Hi from Lindsey and Jo) - we went there every night. Its just around the corner from the hotel (ask for the Chinese and you'll find it there). All in all, a really lovely stay and would highly recommend to all!", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, UK", "Title": "\u201cReasonable hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "soontobebrown", "ReviewID": "UR3809373", "Content": "Plus points - good location close to Vaporetta stop.

But beware, there are only 2 rooms in the whole place with air con - we were lucky. Breakfast was fine. Internet stations didn't work, bar one. But it was great to have free internet access in our hotel! It was only a short, pleasant ride away from Venice. In fact, it was nice to be away from the huge crowds in the evenings. And of course the beach is very near to this hotel, at the end of the road! Compared to the other hotels we'd stayed in which were the same price, this hotel is excellent!
