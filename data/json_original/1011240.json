This is the second time we've stayed here. It was a little more then I usually pay for hotels- but so worth it! The hotel is beautiful- there is a view from every room. The first time we stayed we got a room with the Bay/City view. This trip, however, we had the Port/Coronado view. While Coronado island is beautiful- I'd suggest the Bay/City view. The rooms are fabulous. Plenty of room to spread out. The beds are AMAZING! So lovely to fall into one at the end of a long day. I love love love the pillows! The bathroom has lots of counter space. Only issue I encountered... I flooded the bathroom floor with water from the shower once. But, its not the hotels fault- I'm just a dork. The best part about this hotel is the location! Its right on the bay. A 5 min walk to the convention center- there is a trolley station right across the street- and just past that is the entrance to the Gaslamp District. It is SO nice to be able to walk to the Gaslamp for dinner or drinks and not have to take a cab.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Granby, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWonderfu Experience!\u201d", "Author": "C D", "ReviewID": "UR126944142", "Content": "After leaving the Hotel del Coronado, we arrived at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront and they immediately upgraded our room to a veranda/bay view and were smiling and ready to help us!

I found out this enormous hotel is new, only 3 years old. The rooms and bathrooms are modern, immaculate and bright with floor to ceiling windows. The beds are extremely comfortable; we slept so well. There was no minibar in the room which was fine for us and there were many places to get food just outside the hotel in the Gaslamp area. There is a Starbucks and yogurt store onsite but they can only be accessed by going outside which is a bit inconvenient. As with previous reviewers' mention, it is a little sterile and impersonal. The lobby is open and there was always people milling about. The concierge was a bit snobby, not even attempting to call one restaurant for a reservation as she was sure it would be fully booked. We used the hottub which was nice. Regarding conference areas, these were plentiful but the wifi access was terrible and not available in the rooms. With conference booking, we got free wifi which was a super perk (they left a message on the phone with the password) and wifi worked seemlessly in the hotel bedrooms, thank goodness. My husband and colleagues were appalled that the waitstaff were clanging dishes and serving etc during a lunch session when speakers were presenting. We hope that the hotel can communicate better with conference organizers to prevent this rudeness by organizing time/breaks when there is no food service and disruption to speakers. The main onsite restaurant Vela was terrible - they messed up our order twice (bringing the wrong dish to our table and then the dish had the wrong side dish) and the total time between sitting down and finally getting our meal was 45 minutes. It was not busy and there was no compensation. I would not eat there unless you absolutely felt lazy and don't want to leave the hotel. Maybe try the Sports Bar. Location is good, right next to the Convention Centre and 5 minutes walk to Petco Park and 5th Ave/Gaslamp Area. Horton Plaza shopping was disappointing. We had dinner at the Hotel Del Coronado one night. It's worth visiting that historic hotel across the Coronado bridge. There is some strange thing about which kind of taxis and can you between San Diego and Coronado though. Nobu in the Hard Rock Hotel across the street was excellent. I was also displeased to find out that packages I sent to this hotel required at least a $6 fee per package for handling as all their mail is processed through the UPS store. No other hotels at which I've stayed had this policy but I think because this hotel is so large, it requires this service. You can check-in for your flight and print your boarding pass for free in the UPS Store/Business Centre. I still give this hotel a 5 points because it was comfortable and new. We paid conference price for this hotel, which was still about $250 per night. I would only consider it again if it was quite discounted.

Pros: 1. Rooms, clean, modern with comfy beds, good down-style pillows, and a large window with pseudo seat to take in the view. 2. Location, PERFECT for a convention,and a bridge to Petco park, right on the bay with fantastic views of Coronado island, a walkway along the waterway connecting you to the convention center, marriott, hyatt, sea port village, and eventually USS midway if you are a GREAT walker. However, only on site restaurants are there, everything else is a bit of a walk. 3. Pool, nice heated pool and jacuzzi with view of the bay (and a large Dole Freighter while we were there) and a Huge TV playing the NCAA basketball tournament. 4. Noise, this is the kicker, some of the other hotels are really near the trolly or worse train, that blows its horn throughout the night. I didn't hear much of anything from my room except some howling wind, but we were in the midst of a heavy winter storm. 5. Views, the lobby bar and various other vantage points have really pretty views of the bay, and had the weather been nicer we would have enjoyed our drink on the deck. They even have a fire ring outside that looked like a fun place to enjoy a drink. Cons: 1. Parking, was $27, I think, my frugal husband did free street parking blocks away, not sure how he found that but he was determined. 2. Service, we only interacted with the staff at check-in and check-out: check-in was luke warm and check-out was really slow due to a couple of guests with prolonged transactions Tips: 1. We bought the bed and breakfast package for an extra $30/nt for 2 buffet passes because I read on Tripadvisor the cash price is like $24? for one so I thought we'd just commit ahead of time. 2.

As we were there for a celebration they upgraded us to an bay facing room which was great except it did not have a bathtub in the bathroom. The hotel is beautiful and large with conference levels and a running/walking path that goes all along the bay. As Hitlon honors Gold we were provided with free access to the spa facilities and a 25 dollar credit to a treatment. The spa has a lounge area with refreshments and an eucalyptus steam room . We spent quite some time enjoying the facilities every day. We also got free appetizers at the Hotel bar which consisted of a handful of chips and some olives. Don't bother using these, you end up paying too much for a drink that you of course need to wash away the salty olives! Service was okay, the staff were helpful and gave us directions whenever we needed it. In fact the doormen and maids were the nicest, the girls are the desk not so much. Parking is extremely expensive at 25 dollars per day but we were okay with that as we got our room for $120 per night. Usually with Hilton gold breakfast is included but instead they give you a voucher for a drink and food item at the starbucks which is attached. You could trade the voucher in and pay an extra $10 for the breakfast buffet which is no way was worth the $35 they were charging. It had a sad looking omelet bar and not enough variety. In addition service was slow. The key advantage of the Hotel is its location to the Gaslamp district which was a half a mile away as well as the stadium.

I stayed here for 4 nights, and would definitely recommend this hotel. The decor was pleasantly modern, without looking like they're trying too hard to be edgy. I had a room on the 15th floor, with a nice view of the San Diego Bay, over looking the promenade. I usually travel with a fairly decent number of toiletries, so large bathroom counterspace is essential, and this hotel didn't disappoint. I forgot to bring toothpaste, when I went downstairs to guest services to inquire about how to find a drugstore, the helpful staff gave me a complementary travel sized toothpaste, which was very kind! I did end up having to go to a drug store to buy other things, and I found a CVS a few blocks away in the Gaslamp district. For 2 nights of my stay, I was too busy/tired to go out for dinner, so I decided to order room service. I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the sea bass that I ordered. Even the bread and butter were very good quality as well. One thing I wouldn't recommend is the mojito at the Odysea bar - I tried one there with a couple of colleagues, and it was one of the worst mojitos I've ever had because all I could taste was sickly sweet syrup, incongrously mixed with a small quantity of rum.

We had a bedroom connected to a hospitality suite. PRO Great location. The hotel is near the gaslight district (walking distance), so plenty of places to go eat for lunch or dinner. If you plan to walk at nighttime I would check with concierge what is the safest way to go, as a friend from San Diego told me downtown can be \"spotty\" when it comes to safety\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning that one block could be perfectly OK, then next block is not that safe. If you get a room with a view on Coronado island, bring binoculars. You will see plenty of actions during the day and perhaps catch a glimpse of the Navy Seals returning from their daily practice and of course all sort of military and civilian vessels. The hospitality suite was very nice and very very large. The views were breathtaking, if it wasn't for a large framed print that detached from the wall and almost hit my daughter on the head I will have no complains. If you like jogging or walking you can take a nice stroll all the way down to the shops at the end of the Bayfront (past the convention center). You will walk by the marina and there are a couple of really lovely parks on the water. Beds were comfortable. Loved the Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathrooms! Had a lovely massage at the SPA. They will add 20% gratuity by default, but at least you will be notified prior to receiving the service and you can always adjust the gratuity accordingly. CONS I am going to talk about the \"package highjack fee\" because it was the first I ever encountered such a thing, and we travel a lot. We had a package shipped to our room. Apparently concierge or the front desk will not hold the package and will send it to the business center instead (which seems to be run by UPS.) You can get your package ONLY if you pay a fee. Of course no one will tell you about that and if you call concierge they may not know about it either. Here's the best part\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou would expect a small consistent fee, right? No! the fee is calculated based on the size and weight of the package, so unless you know how much your package weights you'll have no clue until you are trying to redeem it. We had to pay $6.99 for one small package that was probably less than a 1/4 pound. The fee was twice the cost of shipping\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe irony! At the business center we were \"greeted\" by a very rude young woman which had no interest in helping us (Note for management: this person was working on Friday, March 2nd at 6:25PM) . She was slamming envelops on the desk, being very unfriendly and completely annoyed by our presence. When we asked if she could please open the package, she ran the xacto knife so close to my husband hands we thought she was going to cut him! Service at the business center was despicable\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I am still wondering what that fee covers and what if I do not want to pay the fee?...I don't get my package? Some of the cleaning ladies, were sort of...obnoxious and not very discreet. For example they would enter the room without too much notice or without announcing themselves and one in particular, if she saw us in the hallway, she would ask \"Does your room need cleaning today?\". I think that was the first time ever I was asked that question in a hotel! There are two restaurants in the hotel, but the menus are very limited and fairly boring. They also seem to have problems understanding the difference between \"rare\" and \"medium rare\". Children six and under seems to eat free at the breakfast buffet, but some waiters will omit the information... The bedroom itself was very small and average. Inquire about the cost of WIFI as they seem to charge per device and at $13 per day, with multiple laptops, ipads, iphones etc it can get pricey. SPA: it would be a good idea if the cleaning crew does not have to walk through the relaxation area with dirty towels etc\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperhaps an alternate route that does not involve passing through the relaxation area? They should also avoid cleaning (dusting in my case) the relaxation area while guests are in there. TIPS The San Diego Zoo is a must-see, but take a trip to La Jolla (bring plenty of quarters for parking). Our daughter enjoyed exploring the tidal pools and probably had more fun there she had at the Zoo. Check online for the best time of the day to go explore the pools. For lunch go to Georges. Great food and location. It can get a bit crazy there, so expect to wait one hour for a table. Additionally check out La Valencia hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dA little gem, in Hispanic style! and if you like Dr. Seuss stop by Legends Gallery, Fine Art of La Jolla.

There was also a frozen yogurt store you had to enter from the outside. The room was nice and big but the beds were soft. The bathtub was a regular porcelain tub with a shower curtain.

The hotel website and some tripadvisor reviews are misleading. The hotel is close to the gaslamp quarter but be aware it is a hike, especially if you're short on time. You need to calculate at least 15min each way unless you plan on jogging across the bridge and over to the heart of the gaslamp quarter.

The decor was nice but by no means luxurious. As the hotel was close to the busy convention centre, it was stretched to capacity with guests. This was particulary noticable in the hotel dining room. Four mornings in a row there were long cues of people outside the restaurant all standing around in groups with electronic tags waiting to be called up for a breakfast table. Once inside the restaurant: food, plates and cutlery were insufficient for the number of people wanting to eat. Many containers of buffet food were empty and I couldn't believe they only had one small double toaster for hundreds of people to use. Also, if your seeking a decent coffee - you won't find it at this hotel. Furthermore, if your just in San Diego to only attend a convention, then the Hilton Bayfront is adjacent to the convention centre but it is several large city blocks from Horton Plaza - the main shopping mall in the Downtown Area.

I got to watch a REAL Banana boat being unloaded and loaded and truck constantly zooming all around the facility. I was on the 22nd floor so the noise was not a problem but the view was not spectacular. Others I spoke to had a much better view so ask for a room with a view of the Bayfront, towards the other hotels. The WiFi was the slowest of any hotel I have been to in along time...my Netflix would not load at all because it was so slow...good for slowly checking email was about the only use for it. Breakfast buffet was so packed I gave up on trying to get in...the service there was very slow. I would suggest picking either real early or a letter breakfast time to get right in. Positives...super clean room. Everything was perfect, no hairs in the shower! Big, fluffy towels to dry off with after the shower. The water warmed quickly and lasted! Really close to the Convention Center and a great sky bridge over the main street and streetcar tracks right into the heart of the city for baseball or the Gaslamp District or just finding a great place to eat or drink. The elevators have high and low floor banks so you can zip up to your room if you are on any of the higher floors (19 or above)...this is a real convienant feature.

When they say it's bayfront, they are not lying. Location: Like I mentioned, this property is right in front of the bay. Coronado Bridge to the west and the Naval base to the east, then the beautiful and lively downtown San Diego to the south. Getting around the hotel might get a little tricky as the road leads/leaves the hotel is parallel to a very busy set of train tracks. In addition it's right next to the Gaslamp Quarter which is constantly in heavy traffic. However don't let this get you down, as I suggest you WALK or take the public transportation (San Diego Trolley right in front) to wherever your destination is. Many of the close by destinations can keep you busy for a good 24 hours. Let it be family, historic or just some night life, you can pretty much find it around the hotel. Hotel: As many of you mentioned, unlike many Hilton properties in historic towns, this one is a very new hotel. I do not recall when it was built but if you compare to it's sister hotel literally across the street, this is not your typical, San Diego jaded hotels. If upbeat, new and bright is what you are looking for, then this is the hotel for you. The lobby is large, clean and bright. First impression it gave you is a very upbeat and comfortable welcome as you step into the lobby. Many amenities are located close to the lobby and it doesn't take much leg work to find whatever you are looking for. Also I must give credit to the sofas around the lobby right by the giant windows, they are comfortable. With the view of either the bay or the cityscapes, it's a very welcoming treat. Staff / Service: Friendly and professional. I simply don't need any other adjectives to describe them. Prompt, fast, sometimes very funny, treats everybody with their best. Not just the front desk staff, pretty much everybody I came across in the hotel are just well, happy and friendly. Valet is one of the most efficient I've ever seen. Cost a bit much but then again parking in San Diego, especially in downtown area is nothing but a major hassle. The valet is daily-rated so you have in-and-out access. Check in / out are fast. Now here's where the perk comes in... if you are a HHonors member like I do and when you reach certain level, you will realize that it's totally worth being royal and all the perks that comes with it makes the whole stay a new experience. Room / Amenities: I originally booked the corner view room but was offered an eUpgrade standbys. Now you can only get this if you book directly from Hilton. So upon check in, I was offered the Executive Corner Suite, aka the Sea Suite at the north west corner of top floors, at a pretty steep discount. Again you can only get these offers if you book directly from Hilton and being a HHonor member. The room was one of the BEST view rooms I've stayed at in any Hilton properties. Check out the pictures I included below and you will see why. It's large, clean, very modern and best of all, the view. From Coronado Bridge to the entire downtown San Diego, just the view is worth the price. The amenities in the room are very new. Furniture and all the fixtures are kept in good shape, however some of them needs a little maintenance. The bedroom is roomy, the bathroom is even better. Which if you have a standard of what a modern hotel should be equipped with, then this Hilton meets all the standards. One thing I had problem with was the bed. Now I am not sure if it's the mattress itself or what, but it seems like it's broken. The best way I can put it is the mattress I slept on was way too soft/plush without proper support. As if the springs inside has no tension to support any weight. More or less I had a good sleep there. Oh yes you can hear almost no noise at all! Which can be a tricky thing to do when some of the locomotives running at full power slowly passes by the hotel. Overall I would suggest this hotel to those whom wants to see downtown San Diego and the magnificent view of the bay at the same time. I see a lot of business travelers but not a lot of families here. Then again at the time of my visit it's not considered peak time for tourism. Remember this is at one of the prime location of San Diego and the hotel itself is very new.

It's pricey at $27 a day, but the garage seems secure. The pool has cabanas and lots of seating options. Nice fitness room with a beautiful view.

After driving a good few hours from LA to the hotel, we were excited to check in as we are Hilton Honors members and often stay at the Hilton hotels when we travel. Well, never again! We unloaded our luggage and our two young kids and then at check in were informed by the front desk that they were sorry but there were NO rooms available! They did have confirmation that I had booked, but all they said was they were sorry but there was nothing they could do?!? I asked to speak to the front desk manager and was told the same thing and the reason she only gave me was that sometimes people refuse to leave when they are suppose to check out?! I was so upset as I had just received confirmation welcoming our arrival from Hilton San Diego Bay front a week ago. After I voiced my concerns over not being guaranteed a room when you book a month in advance and then having to pack up with my kids she offered ONE free night hotel stay at a neighbouring hotel and that was the best she could offer. I was told I could pay the rest of my nights at that hotel or check back in with them the next day. Why would I unpack all my belongings after one night and drive back to that hotel with two young kids? My husband is here for work and would need to leave early in the am. I cannot believe that such a large and respectable hotel chain would do that to a customer who booked and got an e-mail confirmation a week before the check in day. They also never attempted to e-mail or call me (they had my contact info) before the actual check in day to tell me that they had no room for me anymore. I am so shocked as we have travelled and stayed at many hotels both for business and pleasure and never once have heard of this happening. Upon check in at the suggested hotel (we had to leave to have a hotel to stay for the night) they did confirm that this has happened with Hilton San Diego bayfront before as well. Interesting....I think it is not an honest mistake but they oversell the number of rooms they have on purpose. It is a disappointing experience as prior to this happening we were even thinking of purchasing a Hilton vacations club in the future. I just hope you think twice before booking as you don't want to be surprised with no room upon check in.

In fact, I can't think of another hotel that comes close of providing the facilities/services this Hilton offered for that price. Transfers from the hotel are available, but you'll probably end up needing a rental if you're heading out of the downtown area, so you may as well pick up the car at the airport and drive the 10 mins to the hotel - it's not a difficult route and there is amble self-parking available (but the parking garage layout can be a little confusing). It seems a bit odd that in order to access some of the amenities (sports bar, starbucks, etc) you have to leave the hotel, walk round a corner, and enter from the outside. Then repeat the exercise to back into the hotel. Not a major trauma, but its a bit bemusing that you can't access them from inside like you can the cocktail bar and restaurant. A quick walk over the bridge delivers you to the Gaslamp area and more restaurants/bars that you'll probably ever need and catering to every budget and preference. If you just want to stretch your legs then the waterfront is right outside and you can wander along looking at various floating maritime attractions. Breakfast is good, with an amble buffet and portions from the menu are sufficient to see you through the morning (and maybe more!). Food at the Fox sports bar is perfectly acceptable, if somewhat predictable, but then it's a sports bar so you know exactly what's what. Rooms are clean and tidy, sensibly sized, the same can be said for the bathroom. Higher floors have better views, and if you plan to spend time looking out the window then opt for one overlooking the bridge rather than the container docks. The higher up you go the less noise is apparent and there's little need to close the curtains - no one can look in - and if you're not fussed at the scenery then save yourself the extra $ charged for the bridge view and stare out the window at nothing in particular from the comfort of the bed.

We had taken the Amtrak down from LA so that it would feel like a real getaway. The downtown Trolley took us from Santa Fe train depot to the \"Gaslamp\" stop, which was a short walk from the hotel. The hotel is very modern, with sleek lines and large, open spaces. The atmosphere is a little cold because of the modern style, but that is made up for by the warm customer service. At check-in, the lady at the front desk was friendly and professional. I had booked a Bay-City view King room, and I requested a room with more of a bay view, if one was available. She assigned us to Room 1602, which was on the very end of the hotel, overlooking San Diego Bay. What an amazing view! (See the picture I took from my window.) Our room was immaculately clean, and very comfortable. The bathroom had gorgeous lighting, and the water pressure in the shower was very strong (which is unusual for a hotel). I wanted to take that shower home with me! The room was very quiet, and I never heard any noise from the hallway. The pool area is nice, with a gorgeous view of the bay. A large container ship was unloading right outside of the hotel, but is was cool to watch. If I was trying to relax all day, the noise from the ship might have been a little annoying, but that is beyond the control of the hotel. I would have preferred a little more greenery by the pool area, but again, it was in keeping with the cool, modern architecture. We had drinks at the \"Odysea\" bar off of the lobby, which had a lovely view of the sunset at Happy Hour (discounted beer and well drinks). The service was again friendly and professional. Afterwards, we headed to the Gaslamp district for dinner, which is a short stroll from the hotel. I would be happy to stay at the Hilton Bayfront again..

The hotel staff was professional and accomodating in every way. The conference included most meals, and I assume the food was provided by the Hilton. Either way, it was AMAZING, as was the catered services for each meal. The conferencetook place at the hotel as well, and everything was beautiful and ran so smoothly. If you are in San Diego on business - heck, if you are looking for a place to host your business conference - I could not recommend the Hilton Bayfront more!! If you are simply on vacation to the city and plan on spending time in downtown, it is a perfect location to access everything you need. A few extras: If you spend anytime at the pool, there will be a guy who comes around and takes drink orders, however if you don't mind hopping up to get your own drinks, head into the Vela Restaurant bar, and the beers are about $2 cheaper than what the guy outside is charging (he works for a different restaurant/bar at the hotel, and for some reason they charge more for the same size drinks) The hotel is right on the bay, and walking up the sidewalk along the bay makes for a gorgeous morning stroll or jog. I walked up to the USS Midway and back a couple of different mornings (about 1.5 miles each way), and it was lovely. There is also a ferry behind the hotel (and 200 yards to the right) that takes you to Coronado Island and back for about $8 total. That is a fun and easy day trip.

Being a Hilton Honors member got us rooms on 22nd floor facing the bay, my mother-in-law was awed by the experience, staying here made it a perfect first vacation with her. They don't have an executive / club lounge for Hilton Honors members but they give you breakfast coupons for Starbucks good for ANY drink and ANY food item at their in-house Starbucks. We were also able to use those coupons to get a discounted price (only $10) for the breakfast buffet (more of a brunch.....) ! However the evening HHonors coupons for Odysea lounge were hardly worth anything, the front desk told us those were good for any food appetizer but the lounge folks honored those for only chips and humus serving (weird disconnect). Explained that to the front desk and they comped us some of that expense, Hilton customer service always wins me over ! The hotel has done considerable development around the area and even if you are not staying here, I would recommend visiting the complex and try one of the awesome signature cocktails at their Odysea bar in the evening on the outside terrace seating with a view of the bay. They advertise that the herbs used in their cocktails are from the personal garden of the executive chef, can't get more organic and low carbon foot print than that !! They also have this amazing footbridge that connects the hotel to Gaslamp Quarters, it reminded me of the Helix bridge in Singapore, great piece of engineering. There was a wedding at the hotel when we were there and the bride and groom must have spent almost half an hour just posing on this bridge !

I must admit that the Hilton San Diego Bayfront hotel is an excellent property throughout. The hotel enjoys many unique advantages. It has a waterfront location and is just a few minutes from downtown San Diego. It is next door to the San Diego Convention Center and just a few steps from PETCO Park and the historic Gaslamp Quarter. The guest rooms are very well-appointed with excellent amenities and high quality furnishings. The standard rooms are ideal for solo business travellers. I could not find the room safe initially but it was tucked in one of the drawers. There was no mini-bar or fridge. The hotel has a spa and excellent fitness facilities. I used the fitness centre during every day of visit. The staff members at the fitness centre and spa were very friendly and extremely helpful (special thanks must go to Sarah for her kindness). The outdoor salt-water pool was heated and the water was really clean. There was no underwater music. The restaurants bars are all excellent as well as the Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee shop with free Wi-Fi. The Odysea restaurant has several iPad stations for checking e-mails. The gift shop sells personal items, snacks and drinks and some clothing and toys. There are also some magazines, sunglasses, suntan lotion and souvenirs on sale. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference facilities are outstanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect for an international congress. I would definitely recommend this hotel overall. Minor complaints: 1. Although I had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room for allergy sufferers, I was not able to sleep very comfortably because of the noise from the pipes and the air conditioning unit (especially between 2 and 4 am). My room (2451) was clean but unfortunately it was also very noisy. I complained to the front desk about this issue but nothing was done about it. 2. The UPS Store at the hotel is responsible for handling all outgoing and incoming parcels and they charge for this service. I took delivery of four parcels and to pay $6 per item. I was not happy about this because I had already paid FEDEX for delivery! The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website claims: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our UPS Store is committed to providing world-class customer service to hotel customers. We are committed to providing personalized and professional solutions while supporting our core values.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd To be honest I think that hotel should provide their own business centre rather than using UPS. UPS are more interested in making money than serving Hilton customers. 3. The rate was quite high, perhaps because Hilton wanted to make money from the scientists attending the convention.

At 7pm they opened up a banquet room and served all guest a cold meal, drinks, dessert and then even though the electric came back on at 1:30am they served a full breakfast buffet in the morning in the ballroom.

We walked around most of the time and there is tons of stuff to do after you leave to the hotel also. Service was ok we had the problem at the front desk with the parking but it wasnt that bad. The service throughout the hotel was good. But i did get charged for the 35 dollars a night that was included in our package and had to call to get it fixed. The value was nice for the hotel and as much as they offer but if I book a special package I would like them to follow through with it and not have to be reminded of it. Sleep quality we were on the 28th floor and away from the elevator so there was no extra noise and the bed was nice. Cleanliness the room was very clean. When we were first going up to our room there was a cupcake all over the floor by the elevator and about 30 minutes later when we came back down it was still there. Also the fox sports grill the first time we went our table wasnt wiped down that well but the seceond time it was good. Outside of those things the hotel was very clean. Spa we only went to the pool but it was nice we spent longer down there then we thought we would. Restaurants they offer the two once is expensive we didnt go to it. The fox sports grill was good. We were disapointed when we went to the starbucks and frozen yogurt they have on site because you cant charge it to the room but they were ok.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous Hotel in a Great City\u201d", "Author": "Brisa03", "ReviewID": "UR117235785", "Content": "Came to see the Padres on August 19 and 20.

Our 23rd-floor room faced south, providing a perfect view of...the Dole (as in fruits) freight yard immediately to the south of the property, where a freighter that was in port was being worked the whole time we were there. It actually wasn't offensive to look at, as the operations were neat and orderly.

I say it's the perfect business hotel because the lobby, access, and public areas are all business. It's like being in a class \"A\" downtown high-rise office building. Expansive open spaces, tall ceilings, lots of wood and stone surfaces, escalators to move you up and down to the street level, and meeting rooms right off the lobby. It's clearly not catering to kids (though there were many families there) and that was just fine. The pool is a token pool, not very large, not intended for all-day leisure.

This hotel is at the south end of the bay front hotels and it is cool to look south and see the freighter ship unloading, then you look north and right there is the convention center and all the other hotels lined up along the bay. Look north east and you see Petco Park/Gaslamp district and the city. Look the opposite direction and its the bay and Coronado you see, and if you're up high enough the Pacific Ocean.This hotel is a gem. Yes, the views are great, the location is fine, The bars and restaurants are very very good, but the clincher for me was the staff. What wonderful service I experienced especially at the front desk, the spa, Vela bar and restaurant, and Odysea bar/lounge!

The hotel is beautiful and customer service excellent. We arrived at the hotel way to early to get our room. The front desk attendant checked us in, gave us keys and said they would call us when our room was ready. We decided to enjoy the city while we waited. When I had not received a phone call by 3:30 we went back to the front desk. They apologized profusely and gave us an upgrade in our room. WOW! We had a beautifully decorated room with a view of the city and the bay from the 22nd floor. The bath room was spotless with granite counter top and a huge shower. It was unbelievably beautiful. I have looked since returning and the extra $30/night will be worth it on our next trip here. Since we were only here one night I did not get the opportunity to try the dining choices, pool or fintess center but I did look at them. The pool is a beautiful salt water pool and for the guys there is a very large TV showing sports right out at the pool. They had a pool cafe and you could eat and drink while enjoying the sunshine. The lounge had a fire on the balcony that would be so enjoyable at night. We only had that short time in San Diego so our sightseeing was limited. I highly recommend the USS Midway Museum. Fun and educational. We went to have pizza at Pizzaria Luigi, a recommendation from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. This was the best pizza I have ever tasted.

It really is beautiful, with incredible eye-catching decor not just in the lobby but also tasteful pieces in the guest rooms. However, it's not worth it when it comes to the service. Every person I encountered (front desk, concierge, etc.) treated me rudely or coolly. By far the worst part about it was when I was checking out--they handed me my hotel bill in a SEALED envelope at the final moment and then started serving the next person in line, so that I couldn't review the charges before leaving. I have stayed in numerous hotels and NEVER have I encountered this before at any hotel--usually I am asked to review the charges before they actually charge me, in case there is anything amiss on them. I thought that this was really strange. So, just to make sure, while I'm standing there, I open the envelope to review the bill, and lo and behold, find a charge on there that wasn't mine, for pizza. I had it corrected, though it was incredibly awkward with the person after me being helped, and the staff member behaving as though correcting a charge was a huge inconvenience for her. The other downside about this hotel is that they nickel and dime you for little things that other hotels would not charge you for (internet, use of the gym, etc., and I didn't even use the parking garage), so it appears to be cheaper but in reality is probably just as or more expensive than other hotels in the area. In addition, it is a busy hotel--when I was there, there were probably two different meetings going on simultaneously, so the lobby was often crowded and full of people. The location of the hotel is both good and bad--it has great views of the water, and is right next to the convention center.

Additionally, make sure you arrive early for breakfast (830am or 9am) otherwise you will wait in line (in a large crowd, really) for at least an hour.

There is a Starbucks at the hotel (you have to walk outside to get to it) and this is the only semi-cheap breakfast option. However it only has the regular Starbucks fare, with inflated prices, and often has a lineup out the door. When the hotel is at capacity or close to it there are long delays for the elevator. Often it would take 15 minutes just to travel from the lobby up to my room. All things considered it was a good experience at the Hilton but if you're looking for a relaxing/romantic or family vacation I'd reconsider this business-oriented hotel that is often busy and lacks that personal feel of smaller establishments.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Hilton was nice and I will return\u201d", "Author": "airtahoe777", "ReviewID": "UR114834768", "Content": "Went there on business and really enjoyed it.

What we liked best is the location and the modern design and amenitiies - it feels elegant and is modern clean while still being very warm and welcoming. Love the Odysea lounge and the selection of SD area microbrews on draft! What we liked least: service. Although all the people we interacted with were pleasant, the service itself was lacking. Let me give you two examples - when we checked in, we had to remind the front desk staff that we had booked a special package through Hilton. This was after they completed the check in process - we had to remind them of our package the benefits. We encountered the same problem on checkout - I had to remind the staff of our package - they just gave us the standard check out which didn't account for our resort credit and parking. Perhaps a minor detail, but why does the customer have to make sure they get the right rate and benefits when they have already been booked/confirmed? Lastly, the wait staff in the Odysea on our first visit were a bit slow and didn't even mention the specials including the Happy Hour (HH) specials (which we had no idea about). On our second & third visit the service was much improved but again, no mention of the HH specials (which include both early evening and late evening). At least by this time we knew of the early specials but we missed out on the late specials. Overall, I have stayed in tons of SD area hotes and this is simply the best I've ever encounted.

My sister and I-- both Vegas regulars-- thought it looked like it belonged on The Strip. I like the free water available for the guests. Nice touch. The gentleman at the reception desk was efficient, professional, and friendly. Having only stayed here one night, I can't comment on any other staffers. Our room was a little small since it was at the end of the hallway, but it had an AMAZING, completely unobstructed view of the bay. Bed was comfy and the room overall was very clean. WiFi worked beautifully. Two things that are important to me that the Hilton knocked out of the park: tolietries and breakfast. I'm a bit of a product snob so I swooned when I saw the Peter Thomas Roth brand. Great stuff! The comped (for HHonors gold status) breakfast was a voucher for one beverage and one food item at Starbucks! I wish all Hiltons would do this. The normal continental spreads and breakfast buffets make it hard to eat healthfully as a vegetarian. By going to Starbucks, I was able to get my standard spinach wrap & latte combo.

The location was ideal. It's about a 10 minute walk via the pedestrian bridge to the heart of downtown Gaslamp district and about another 10 minute walk in the opposite direction to Seaport Village. While I very much recommend this hotel for it's location, I would not recommend if you are looking to save a few bucks. We were lucky and got a good deal on a room via AAA. But everything else in this hotel is outrageously expensive. You won't be able to get a meal here for less than $50. You won't be able to get a Miller Light at the pool for less than $7 (a bit much for a domestic, bottle). However, a trick we learned on our last day is to visit Vela restaurant right inside from the pool and pay $5 for a beer on tap, (although they don't have domestic on tap). Cocktails were a bit too expensive as well. The cocktail watiresses at the pool were horrible. I counted at least 6 different times the girls saw my husband and I and still didn't come to our chairs - needless to say we didn't want to tip them even if we did eventually get service, so we went directly to the bar. There were no small fridges in the room, but we brought a small collapsible cooler and hit up Ralph's from some beer, wine, fruit and saved about $50 in a bar tab at the restaurant. The rooms were great! They were a bit smaller than what we are used to, but the bed was extremely comfortable and the rooms were very quiet. The Dole ship even docked on Sunday and Monday and was loading and unloading and from our room on the 15th floor, we couldn't hear a thing. Also, internet is a joke - if you can use your phone as a hot spot, you'll save a ton of money! The customer service at this hotel is lacking to say the least. We ran into maybe one person at the Odysea bar that was friendly. The front desk staff was unattentive at check-in, but great at check-out.

The convention center is a 5 minute walk...and it's nice to walk it along the boardwalk.. the pool is nothing extravagant and I dont know how people can stand the noise from the cargo ships being loaded...but to each their own.

I got refunded for the internet...but I needed to vent to the manager for the money grab....I call the guy up...I get the manager of the arrivals dept...who says to me...\"well if everyone uses it..then it will be slow\"....so why offer it...why try and squeeze people out of hard earned money....why not offer one service normal high speed that is offered in Marriot, Sheraton etc etc.... Sad to see the Hilton is really trying to pick and pull every dime from your wallet... If you stay here...make sure that you understand where you're room is...make sure that if you get an \"upgrade\" they don't take away your King....or Double Bed...on account of you asking for the upgrade.... The Marriot and Sheraton...are all next to the Convention center...so..you have a choice... One more thing....the gym is Decent...most of the stuff if not all is precor...but get there early on weekdays...it fills up quick and if your into weights...it get's a bit dicey with all the people in one small area....", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience...wonderful time.\u201d", "Author": "nikityree", "ReviewID": "UR106993186", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at the Hilton.

We travel as a family quite often and this was by far a property that ranks quite well on our list of places to stay. We had 2 double queen rooms; One for our family and one for my mother who was traveling with us. I paid $125.00 per room per night with no discounts in place. I felt the price was quite fair for this area. The place was spotless! The rooms are not oversized by there was plenty of space to move about for two adults sharing a room with a two year old and a 5 year old ( we took a room with 2 queen beds). I know that some folks will not like a room overlooking the bridge or the train tracks, but my 5 year old daughter woke up each morning, and grabbed her milk and dry cereal and would sit on the window sill behind the curtain each morning to marvel at the trains moving in and out ( I only heard 1 small horn around 8 at night during the 2 days we stayed there) and the boats plying the harbor. We took an add on package for each room for a cost of $25.00 each. For my room we took a 2 day wireless internet and self parking package. I was really impressed with the speed! (This is something that tends to bug me in hotels charging a small fortune for access to what amounts to dial up!) No dropped connection problems at all. For my mother's room we took a breakfast buffet and limited spa use package ( she could use the relaxation rooms, steam room, sauna and showers), so she did have to wait for my slow poke kids to get dressed and out the door for breakfast each day. Also provided her some serious recuperation time after chasing them through the San Diego Zoo, which is only 2 miles away from the hotel! As for the rooms, they were perfect. Beds are deliciously comfy, the shower had plenty of hot water and pressure even though were were up on the 28th floor. The toilet flushes whisper quiet. And did I mention the a/c unit?? SO QUIET!! The a/c is built flat into the wall so no bulky unit taking up floor space under your window or dripping stinky water onto the carpet. Always nice for those travelers that may need to set up a baby's crib or pack n play next to their bed. The TV's in the room are 42\" flat panel LG tv's. They connect to a very expanded satellite package including CNN, FOX, MSNBC, PBS, HBO HD, FOOD TV, HGTV, NICKELODEON (Sorry no Nick JR, fellow parents) and a ton of others. There is an extensive On Demand (pay per view) service. The one thing that bugged me was that you had to pay $2.99 for each kids programming episode, although for an additional cost you could buy a package. No problem, I just set the kids up in front of our computer for some dvd's or I could have streamed some stuff from Disney or Nick Jr. I know there are reviews out there that give negative notes re: the cost of parking ( $35.00 for valet or $25.00 for self parking) or the fact that there is no fridge or microwave in the rooms ( $25.00 if you want a fridge brought up to your room. Free if it is for a medical need, like storing meds or special foods.) We ALWAYS travel with a large rolling cooler and ice for kid and adult beverages, fruit, ect for the kiddos so never and issue for us. Plus we are traveling by car from Las Vegas, and not by air, so I agree, that is a legitimate gripe. We just chose to work around those things as the overall cleanliness, comfort and central location of the hotel was suitable for our family.

I thought it might be fun to try someplace new. I'm so glad we did! The hotel has an amazing location to start. It is the last property located next door to the convention center. Thanks to the bridge that connects it back to Petco Park, you have immediate access to everything. In comparison to the other hotels in San Diego, it is not too pricey for what they are offer. Overnight parking is actually cheaper than a few other hotels in the same vicinity. Since the property is only two years old, the rooms are very nice, clean and comfy.

When I say 'not memorable', I mean I didn't go out of my way to remember their names to say thank you. I think that's pretty much on par with everywhere else. Since the property is larger than that of places like the Omni, you don't necessarily see the same faces over and over again. That's not their fault, so you can't criticize them for that.

The hotel- The hotel is located across from PETCO field where the San Diego Padres play and within walking distance to the Gaslamp district. The Gaslamp district is where all of the nice shops and restaurants are located. So, the location of the hotel is quite good if your purpose is to spend time in downtown San Diego/Gaslamp. Our hotel room was clean except for a smudge on the pillow. Not sure what the smudge was but needless to say didn't use that pillow. Our room was on the 21st floor with a view of the city and marina. We had to pay 20 dollars to upgrade to get this view but it was worth it. Anyway, bathroom was clean but not very big, the room itself was not very large but it was comfortable. No noise at all and very quiet. Room had contemporary colors and was adequately decorated. Room had flat screen t.v. Bathroom small but the shower area was larger with tile flooring and glass door. No tub. Part II. The Stay: Service was excellent. Check in Time was only about 10 minutes and conciere was helpful in giving information. Our package included the buffett. The buffett was EXCLLENT and highly reccommend the buffett. Buffett had more offerings than most hotels and the quality of food was great. We got our room for 150 dollars and it was well worth it.

Another thing I loved was there was a small park nearby and a walkway being built for direct access to Petco park.

Beautiful view. 3) Due to us being Hilton Gold, we were given a free food and drink item each day from Starbucks. We kept kosher, so Starbucks allowed us to get 2 free drinks each day. Also, because we kept kosher, the hotel had also given us a free food item from a restaurant in the hotel, which they also allowed us to exchange for Stabucks credit. 4) New pool was really nice and modern, and overlooked the bay. Negatives: 1) $25 a day parking. Way too high in my opinion, and no alternative in the area. 2) We reserved a king bed, but when we got there they said they were all sold out due to a convention, and only had 2 Queens. No choice at that time but to accept. Wish they had told me earlier. 3) Walk to Gaslamp quarter has a lot of homeless people, and we did not feel so safe walking it.

I ate in the sports bar twice, first time the food was good, second time so so. You can't access it from the hotel which is very strange, same with the Starbucks. I ate dinner in the Vela and found my food tasteless and expensive - having the discount coupon made it slightly more palatable -- and you can look at the Dole container ship when you're put in a not prime seating area as I was. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. A little too chilly to use the pool and you're staring at and listening to the container ship being loaded/unloaded.

We arrived late on Saturday as Air Canada has changed our routing...and were left short in LA...as apposed to flying into San Diego as planned (6 months in advance!). So...we had to rent a car and drive from LA to San Diego...the distance was not far...but the traffic was horrendous! It was rainy and cold and we were not happy that we had to foot this bill....Air Canada....grrrrrr.....and....most unfriendly airline there is!!! We had been traveling since 6am that morning from Halifax and arrived at the Hilton at 8:30pm....tired and hungry...as there were no meals offered on board...and we deciced to just drive instead of having dinner before hand...as we just wanted to \"be\" at our hotel. On arrival.....they did not have our room....the king we asked for...so insisting...as we had booked so far in advance...we were asked to wait... Upon hearing our troubles with Air Canada...the hotel offered a $50.00 coupon for their restaurant....which I thought was very very nice. We ate at their main restaurant. We had a cheese plate....had limited cheese....but the Temecula honey was wonderful, then we had our entres....I had chicken and my husband had salmon. Both meals were sorely lacking in flavour. My chicken was in a broth like sauce...but tasted of nothing??? The service was friendly however, which made up for taste a bit, With tip...our meal with two glasses of wine and 2 pre-dinner cocktails came to over $130.00. We thought this was steep ....especially for what we got. Our rooms were ready by 10pm. We got a beautiful view on the 19th floor overlooking a terminal area and Coronado Island. The rooms are not huge, but sufficient. The bed was very comfortable....but the furnishings were more like a Holiday Inn Express. The bathroom was very clean, as was the room. The convention my husband was on, was located within the hotel. This made for a perfect location for him. The hotel is also one of the pick up/drop off spots for the hop on hop off tour bus. Perfect for me. We did this tour together on Sunday....as hubby's convention did not start for him until Sunday eve.....it was raining again...so being on a sheltered bus was perfect. We did do the zoo...and did get quite wet...but not a big deal ....the zoo is huge...lots of variety....friendly...but I found some of the enclosures very very small, which made me sad.....the panda exibit however was wonderful. I did the hop on hop off twice ....as I discovered the taxi fares were pretty steep here. To get to all the spots I wanted to see again...I could take this tour bus and pay $34.00....or pay a cab each way...which would have amounted in over $70.00 or more in charges. You are quite handy to the start of the gaslamp district...with all of its restaurants and clubs etc. the pedestrian bridge was not completed when we were there, but we found a shortcut to the gaslamp area...about a 5 min. walk to the beginning of it. We ate in this area twice....as we found the restaurants/bars in the hotel were too expensive ....and food lacking.... We did do star-bucks each morning...the line up was out the door....as eveyone had the same idea. Not a cheap venture for coffee either..but way more flavour.. You have to physically exit the hotel to get to it...and to the other restaurant...name escapes me....a sports bar....chain...not connected to the Hilton...but renting space there...good sandwich option, or sit down breakfast option as well..here the Hilton owned restaurants lack in flavour and expense. We ate at Tequila 100 in the gaslamp area one night...it is on 5th...the most amazing chicken mole I have ever had....and I have been to different areas of Mexico 5 times....you have to try it!!! Another night we ate at Bice. Wonderful appetizer...young crowd...too young for us by 9pm....they have a seperate bar area...as you enter the restaurant...very young....the main course was just ok...the service was pretty good....to lacking in the end. Another night we ate at Baci...takes a good 15 min. by cab to get there....so ....pricey ride....but the food, and service were spot on. Wonderful stuff...family owned and they certainly take pride in everything they do. Our rooms here were cleaned each day by 3pm...and the maid staff were all very smiley and friendly. The pool area was quite large...but a bar inside over-looking this area...made you feel like you were in a fish bowel if you swam....it was too chilly while we were there to swim...as temps were only up to 14 celcius in the daytime...and went down to 8 at night some nights....I did find the bar staff here to be a little snooty...but perhaps they were over-whelmed with the convention??? however, this IS the hotels number one draw...many many convention rooms here. One real negative here...is a $15.00 per day charge for internet....this is a HUGE hotle complex...and with convention being it's number one customer...shameful that they charge for internet....especially when on a work related trip and there is no choice in the matter....parking is also steep here. they need to look at the nickle and diming here...

So, it's not the best location for leisure travellers. I got a corner room on a high floor, with great views of the city and mountains in the distance. Room was soundproofed against the aircraft landing noise (airport is 15 minutes away by car in traffic). Bed was good for a sound night's sleep. Bathroom was sub-standard for a Hilton, without handshower and a bit cramped for two. Breakfast was generous; get the On Your Way deal, where two can eat buffet breakfast for about $25. The lobby was spacious, but had a strange design flaw. To enter the hotel, one has to go through a lower-level foyer then up the escalators to main reception. Once there, to get to the rooms, elevators are accessible only from one alcove in the lobby, even though the lobby wraps both ways around the alcove. As such, one has to walk around the lobby enclosure to reach the elevators. These should have been made accessible from both directions in the rectangular lobby. Weird. Other than this, the lounge and bar were very cosy. Mini-iPads were set up in th lounge alcove to allow guests to check e-mail for free. And the UPS shop downstairs offers free printing of airline boarding passes for departing guests. The hotel is right on the edge of the bay for joggers, and looks out onto Coronado Island, so the scenic location is an attraction. Taxis are quickly hailed by the curbside concierge at the entrance. The lobby concierge was very good at making dinner reservations and had a good knowledge of where pharmacies and supermarkets were located (a Ralph's grocery store and CVS pharmacy are about 15 minutes walk from hotel, in Gaslamp District). On checkout, I was stuck in a long line with other guests, but a hotel staff member approached me with a notepad on which I gave him my e-mail address for billing, enabling a quick departure without waiting.

The main drawback is that the internet is not fee, in fact it costs quite a bit. Definitely a nuisance in this day and age. All that is available in the Hilton, I found in smaller hotels, which also usually had free internet and a fridge to keep your drinks cold. The Hilton has many meeting rooms, but that is the only difference. To top it off, when I checked in, the hotel charged the entire cost of the room for both me and my colleague, who was supposed to pay separately and happened to check-in second, to my credit card, even though I made them aware of the situation. This meant that a couple of thousand dollars were charged to my CC, the first day of the stay. I was told they will just authorize the charges, but the next day I was told that they actually charged it. In any case, this has brought my CC to the maximum and I couldn't rent a car, canceling my trip to Joshua Tree Park, which I was really looking froward to. (It takes a number of days for the charges to be reversed, so there was no use doing that). Also, if you book through an agent, you won't get your Hilton Honors points, the usual feel of being nickle and dimed by Hilton. The pool is waist high, with no deep area for swimming. When I first arrived, I came in late at night and was desperately looking for a bag of chips or any kind of a snack, but the vending machines had only pop. If you are coming for the conference, note that this hotel is not attached to the Convention Center, it is some distance at the southern end of it. I was disappointed how far it was, I would have much preferred the Omni, which is right across. Any hotel near the conference center-end of the Gas Lamp District would have been more convenient, or the Marriott (The Hyatt is too far as well). Also, the hotel doesn't have a free airport shuttle, unlike many of the other hotels in the Gas Lamp District. When I checked in I was asked if I would like to pay extra for a view of the city and I didn't, so my view was to the ship yards, with the pleasure of listening to the containers being loaded, irrespective of the time of day or night, but the noise wasn't too bad. That being said, any of the other hotels, especially the Omni, only have a city view, without having to pay extra.

Went with our twin 5 year old boys. Got a great rate on sandiego.com, buy 2 nights get 3rd night free for $149 a night. Which I thought was a good deal esp at last minute. Did our research so we knew to expect high parking fees. $25 to self park. But the free night made it still seem like a good deal and offset the parking charge. We also knew about the wifi charge. We paid it, but in the future we should just go to a free wifi cafe. We were lazy. The view from our window was EXCELLENT for our boys. 24th floor. They got to see the train/trolley yards, the shipping dock with a load of Dole bananas being put on a huge cargo ship, the bridge and water with sailboats. The boys set their toys up on the window ledge and played and played. Room size was just fine for us, we don't need a huge room to mess up. 2 queen beds. Beds were very comfy and furniture and bathroom seemed new and in good condition. I like that they supplied a BIG blowdryer. Pool was great for our boys since it isnt super deep and they could really swim around. Lots of families so we didnt feel like we were disrupting a \"singles scene\". The location of the hotel on the bay was SO great for us. The boys could RUN and RUN and RUN down the pier length or in front of the convention center. Then just a short walk to Gaslamp area. We had no trouble getting good reasonable food close by with no waiting. There were many good family choices. Broken Yolk for breakfast. Tin Fish was great casual place for our loud family. At night the Hilton lights this big pit fire outside near the water, and there were comfy couches to sit on. It is probably meant to be a lounge-scene, but no one was there when we walked by so we had a nice end to the night, just watching the flames and enjoying the bayfront breeze and lights. The Hilton also was showing Shrek one night and Avatar the next night on the HUGE screen tv outside by the pool. It was free and they also served free sodas and popcorn. I thought that was a cool idea. Didnt bother using the gym (supposedly there is also a charge for that). The long pier is right outside and perfect for a morning run.

I am just going to move straight into the pros/cons for this hotel: Pros: Location for a Ballgame: It is a great location for attending a Padres game. This will increase once the pedestrian bridge is complete. D\u00c3\u00a9cor/Style: Personally, I loved the look of the place. The outside is very cool, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and style of the lobby and sitting areas works really well situated on the water. The entrance as you drive up the car ramp to the valet is something that you would expect in other large cities, not San Diego, very cool. Same goes for the in room d\u00c3\u00a9cor, it works. Room Service: Very quick service, good food. Drink Prices: Drinks at both Vela and Odysea were competitive with or less than most places in the Gaslamp. Price: We all got a very good room rate right from the hotel website that was well below what the other hotels in the area were asking. Cons: Noise: The doors in this hotel might be the loudest that I have heard when they are shut. They seem to be super heavy which probably does not help the situation. Tub: The tub would not drain properly so showers were taken with 4 inches of water around the ankles. Check In: We were told our room was not ready yet the other people in our group all got their rooms. Thought that maybe it was b/c we asked for a King Room. When finally got our room after the game it was a double queen room, same as the others in our group. Was not very happy about that. Room Size: The standard two queens room is on the smaller side of rooms that I have stayed at in the gaslamp. Also, no fridge in the room. Location for Dinner: Not sure if I would stay at the Hilton if I was not attending a Padres game or an event at the Convention Center. It is a bit of a walk to get into the heart of the Gaslamp if you do not want to get a taxi. I would stay at the Hilton again if I was going to be attending a Padres game.

They were overbooked the day I tried to check in because of the conference next door. I was apparently perhaps not a major sponsor of the conference and a mere young looking attendee, who knows, but anyways, they made it up by transferring me to a nearby hotel 9 blocks away at the Hotel Indigo for the night compliments on them, which turned out to be an acceptable replacement hotel though really, I would have preferred just staying at one place. I returned the next day to a room on a high floor with premium views, with a letter of apology, parking and internet fees waived and the works. I would say, this was acceptable to me a compromise, and I commend them for their service, they could not have done better. The views could not be beat. But looking from the architecture of the building, there has to be views in all directions no matter which room you are in with no hidden black sheep rooms, unless of course, if you were located in the lower floors. The hotel itself is marvelous, the interiors clean and expectedly hilton-like, but even newer and brighter. The location was unbeatably perfect, right by the water, with direct access to the bay and the embarcadero which allowed me to walk freely for miles and take in the air. It is also a stone's throw away from everything a visitor will need at the Gaslamp District. Although San Diego downtown is not quite my kind of scene, I have to say the recent construction in the area, and the general pleasantness and livability of this downtown core is to be highly commended. Taking advantage of their location by the bay, their pool, gym, various commendable restaurants, all face the bay. Their service was excellent, super prompt room service and extremely professional. Their housekeeping was also good. They also have a spa downstairs, and an attached Starbucks if you really need it. Did not like the spartan and unimaginative design of their reception desks, but the lobby, restaurants, public areas were marvelous enough. Light spills into the spaces at every corner, and the multiple extended public terraces offer multiple opportunities to take in the sights without having to buy into any services (ex. restaurants, bars). Their room service menu was extensive, the food good, though not my style nor particularly creative, but whatever I ordered was well done, presented and of a high quality. Highly commended from me, making it a wonderful week long stay from an otherwise begrudingly businesslike stale experience. Parking was $25 self park, $35 valet, per day.

It was not a bad place to stay. Our biggest problem was the costs of staying there, which made the other stuff that was not up to Hilton standards seem even more frustrating. First the bad stuff: We used Hhonors points, so our stay could be free. We were trying to save for other activities--like dining out and going site seeing. We did do a room upgrade and paid 40 dollars for that. As beautiful as the view in the room was, most other hotels we've been to have been willing to upgrade for free when you tell them you are there on a romantic getaway. On top of that, everything necessary was ridiculously expensive. We paid 20 bucks a day for parking and 20 bucks a day for high speed \"premium\" internet access. We did watch one movie for 15 bucks on pay-per-view one of the nights. Our final bill when we checked out came to 170 bucks, even though we were supposedly getting a \"free\" stay. The decor of the place was not inviting--it was rather intimidating, actually. The lobby felt like the lobby of a hospital. Almost everyone who was staying there with us seemed younger than us (I'm 28--my husband 39). All the older folks seemed a little put off by all the contemporary design as well. I get the feeling that they will have to renovate soon because the style of the place is very *now*. One thing made my husband and I a little ill was the strong odor of sewage coming from who-knows-where as we walked down the hall to our room every night. I don't know if someone had a serious case of the stomach flu, or if we were located next to some sewage pipe. Regardless, it was definitely more than a little rank and we were always nearly knocked off our feet by it. We never complained to the management, though. One not so significant issue was that the consierge was away from her desk more often than not. But there was plenty to the good side of the whole experience as well. We did have to take a short walk to get to the gaslamp district, but it was well worth it. LOVED it there. Balboa park and all the museums didn't take long to get to by car. We highly recommend Donovan's Steakhouse. As mentioned before, prices aside, the room's view was really spectacular. Coronado bridge and island were beautiful sights at night. Other hotel guests have complained of noise, but this was not a problem for us. We slept through the night with no problems. We were located on the ocean-side of the hotel, though.

I used Priceline once again...I'm a local and it's the only way I stay in the Gaslamp since I know there is an abundance of rooms in 4-star hotels (as long as Comic Con or a holiday is not happening). I got the two beds per room as I requested, but no adjoining rooms were available. They treated me respectably considering I only paid $95 per room for two rooms....sometimes that's not the case with hotels and their Priceline customers. The reason for the 3-stars is because of specific location and overall feel. Yes, the hotel has great views, but location is a lot more important to me since I don't spend a lot of time in my room...and, when I'm in it, I'm not spending a lot of time gazing out the window. It's just outside of the Gaslamp district, across and a ways up Harbor Drive...a taxi is required to get to all the restaurants and clubs. Unless you're a maniac. When you've got 6 women, that adds to the overall cost.

The conference itself was well run and pleasant enough but as a guest in the hotel there are a few things that nigggle me. It's my first time in a Hilton for a couple of years and I was disappointed. The hotel is newish - Hope you like trains and noise from the container port!! It's a beautiful hotel inside and feels airy and spacious but nothing else. It has zero soul or heart and whatever design they were going for seems to have fallen flat going for clinical open space. It feels more like a hospital than a hotel. it doesn''t help that the staff wear something not too dissimilar to hospital nurses uniforms completing the look. The Bar has no atmosphere but adequate service but both the food and dribks menus are pretencious and over fussy although not overly expensive. Service was adequate and functional. I only had breakfast in the restaurant - If you want it in your room it has to be orrdered hours in advance and again is very fussy - God help you if you wan OJ, toast and Coffee. Right through the menus they have over complicated the food to make it sound fabulous and i suspect hoike up the price. But on every occassion it fails to match the grand descriptions. The food on the hot buffet at breakfast is usually cold in my expereince of the 4 days I ate there and the freshy squeezed orange Juice was not. The waiter described it as being freshy squeezed then put in the packet. For a hotel of this quality less than Minute Maid quality Orange Juice is unforgivable - especially in california. Again it looks like all show and no quality. On one night I had the hotel burger from room service and it was pretty awful. Compared to Mariott room service it was a dismal failure. I think it was supposed to be freshly ground beef but I got a greasy sloppy burger covered in fried onions that felt like a bad Wendys. Seriously under done raw in the middle - very offputting for a burger and it sat in me for hours and had an after taste like a bad kebab. Two other points if you are on any floor leave pleanty of time to get around, the lifts work at thier own pace and getting from room to lobby or bar is an expedition in itself. They have six lifts and all I can say is that they struggle off peak but in the morning and early evening they are hammered and you wait and wait and wait on your floor for a lift. They also allow dogs in the rooms and public areas. Onthree occassions I was accosted by dogs in the corridor outside my room or lift. Having some big huge dribbling dog put its paws all over me whilst the owner tells me hes judst being friendly is not what I want in a hotel. And it seems happy to let people stayt with whatever dogs they want and exercie no guidance over thier control. NOT EVERONE LIKES DOGS and I don't want them as part of my hotel expereince.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cSleek, modern, and oh so comfortable!\u201d", "Author": "PRexec", "ReviewID": "UR63755467", "Content": "I accompanied my husband on a recent business trip and couldn't have been happier with the accommodations at the Hilton Bayfront. The hotel is brand new and beautifully designed with sleek, modern Euro-type decor-- lots of light wood, chrome, modern artwork, etc. If you're looking for small and cozy this is definitely not the place, but if you're looking for a really hopping yet extremely comfortable hotel with all the amenities in a great part of town, I'd say go for it. Our room was on the 26th floor with an absolutely gorgeous view of the city and harbor. The large, sunny window made the room seem much larger than it was, and at the end of a busy day-- it was a light and airy place to come home to. Very, very quiet and relaxing! Everything you might need is right at your fingertips including a Starbucks on the premises and a terrific business center. The bed was amazingly comfortable and although the windows didn't open, the thermostat could be easily adjusted for perfect sleeping temperatures. There weren't bathrobes in the room, but when I called the front desk and asked for them, housekeeping delivered complimentary robes within 5 minutes. Perhaps one of the nicest features of the hotel was its proximity to the water. Right out your door literally were walking, jogging, biking paths along the waterfront and two lovely seaside parks. Restaurants were a stones' throw away, both along the water and in the bustling Gaslamp area a block away. All in all, I have nothing but praise for this new San Diego hotel and would highly recommend it for business and/or pleasure traveling.

Only stayed because it was a conference hotel, otherwise I would have left. It's isolated away from the downtown core, and I got tired after visiting downtown each day to have to trek back along the soulless walkway past the behemoth convention center and across to this badly designed hotel that has the charm of an office building. It's cold and sterile and unfriendly to pedestrians...They have a huge ramp for cars to go up to the second-floor lobby, but if you're arriving on foot, you have to look carefully to see where they've hidden the entrance at ground level...an example of terrible design where you start to suspect they've purposely kept you guessing about how to get in.... The interior decor is stark and sterile, and you get the feeling some crazed designer was given way too much money and told to do something \"HIP\", except it doesn't work here because you feel like you're still in an office building that's trying to be something else. The poor staff are forced to wear ridiculous uniforms that look like something out of Star Trek, and the most annoying thing was the incessant electronic club music that seemed to be playing at horrible volumes 24 hours a day. This is not the music I want to hear at 8 a..m. Walk out the hotel lobby doors to the walkway along the water in the sunny morning, and what do you hear? Oh yes, more club music, coming at you from outdoor speakers around the hotel, because who in their right mind might want to hear birds or the sounds of water when you can hear music blasting at you? Our room was clean and roomy enough, but our window looked out on a panoramic view of the industrial loading docks. We kept the curtains closed. The hotel has also adopted the unfortunate habit of charging guests to use the so-called fitness centre...Something like $25 to go and work out at a tiny facility that you would expect to be provided free at a hotel this size. If you want to go for a swim in the pool, you must wear your bathing suit from the 20th floor down to the lobby and back, because no one thought to put something most hotels call a changing room where the pool is. I called down from my room to ask where you could change at the pool, and the woman at the desk said \"funny, you'd think I would know that wouldn't you?\" Um, yeah, given that you're an employee here, I would . After she had to put me on hold to check, she then returned to say 'sorry, there isn't anywhere to change, but you could wear your bathrobe down to the pool.' Oh. Thanks. The pool is bizarre at night (giant video screens on the pool deck with flashing movie images, presumably for anyone who finds a few laps in peace and quiet just a little too annoying).

Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really tie with the rest of the SD feel though, so you kind of feel like you are going to a different city after being out all day and I can see where some people might be bothered by it, but that was not an issue for us. Room was kind of small for a room with two queen beds and the chaise that was I was led to believe by the pictures on Priceline and the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website was actually like a club chair, but by no means a chaise. I had paid for a standard room and was told upon checking that the rooms will have a partial ocean view. Well looking to the one side was OK as we could see the bay with part of the ocean, but turning to the left we looked at the boat dock and the railroads (not so pretty). Have to admit that we were offered to upgrade right a way at checking at an additional charge ($15-20 I believe). Parking is expensive; I would have liked to have been able to avoid this charge. Internet was expensive as well and we decided to leave without it for the 3 days. I read on some other reviews that there was free internet at the bar in front of the hotel, but we actually did not make it there to check that out. Did not go to the restaurant as well. Went to Starbucks for coffee and bagels for breakfast each of the mornings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that saved us a lot of time of driving around, trying to find something and some money too. To find the Starbucks you would take the escalator to the Ground level on the side of the hotel and walk around or exit the hotel on the side by the pool and go around this way. The pool was awesome as well as the hot tub (which got crowded at times). The water in the pool is heated just enough so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get cold. It was kind of called in Mid-October for (coming from Hot AZ), but my daughter could have stayed in the pool for hours. Would not recommend the pool for swimming, as it is not deep enough.

Bedding was not anything special; in fact a couple of he sheets had small halls in them. Staff was courteous, I had to ask the housekeeping for some extra coffee and they left some in the room (loved having the coffee maker in the room and also the safe).

In any event when we booked the travel, the King room was a more expensive option than \"room allocated at check-in\" and was also a non-refundable rate. My wife and I returned to our room to collect the reservation and returned to the lobby. This time a different staff member was at the desk and actually knew how to treat a customer. He checked with house keeping and what do you know? They did have a King Room available meaning the original people at check-in had short changed us and the second person had lied to us. The King room is substantially better in more ways than the bed itself. The other negatives are the internet prices ($14 for \"standard\" and $20 for express broadband). This set a new record in my experience - not even Vegas hotels had the hide to charge that much. Also the lobby is basically on the second floor. To get to ground level you have to use the car park lift. The bridge linking the hotel to Petco Park/Gaslamp seems some way off being completed. It's only a five minute walk to the Trolley stop but there are other hotels better location. And unless you fork out for the bay view, the \"bridge view\" is actually a truck park with the bridge in the distance. On the plus side, the King room is very nice, especially the bathroom which thankfully has a shower not located over a bath. There is also a nice day bed.

The location is very good both for being near the convention center and an easy walk to the Gaslamp District. Since it is right on San Diego Bay, the outdoor restaurants and pool have a nice sunny and airy feel, and you can walk along the waterfront promenade to other hotels along the water. The public rooms are very nice with cocktail lounges everywhere and outdoor drinks possible on the terrace. The staff was very nice throughout -- check-in, waistaff, housekeeping, pool and spa people, etc. Room 1510 had two queen beds and was the typical well-fitted-out business class hotel room - everything you expect, but nothing surprising (i.e. coffee maker, iron an dironing board, very good internet connections, etc.) Nice size room and bathroom, and every felt fresh (the hotel is not that old.) Nice toiletries. Spotless housekeeping. The room looks south over the Coronado Bridge and Bay -- some may prefer a view north that includes the bay and more of a city view. You immediately overlook the pool, which is nice, and a shpiping transit area further beyond. This is less lovely, but it was actually interesting to watch the Dole banana container ship loading (but that's me.) There is a very nice outdoor pool area with towels, food an beverage options, etc. It is attached to a fitness center with good equipment and a nice view of the Bay. There is a small spa and locker area with an assortment of services. My sister was with me on this trip, and she enjoyed a few of the services -- I was busy. She thought the staff was friendly and professional. The spa has a free sauna of aromatic woods -- really nice if you like heat. The food at the restaurant at breakfast and lunch was very good and on the pricey side as one expects at a place like this. There is a lunch buffet for approx. $22. Bothersome: you can order a la carte items like a bagel and coffee, but this option is not shown on the menu -- only major plates of breakfast are on the a la carte menu. If you ask, the staff is very pleasant about filling requests -- but why should I have to guess about these items? There is also a sports bar and Starbucks that are entered from the outside of the hotel -- possibly to attract convention goers from across the street. The sports bar is quite nice and can put together some good main-dish salads. There is a separate dining section from the bar itself, and the outdoor seating is very pleasant, inclduing the fire pit. The Starbucks is a Starbucks, but I have a complaint: the music is head-banging irritating, especially in the morning. Given the typical customers, this music wasobviously the preference of the staff, not the guests. Most customers tried to be outside, even in damp weather. My only other complaints are somewhat minor: the hotel again tries to nickle-and-dime you for extra charges for the internet, the fitness center (pool is free, I think.) I got the fitness center free given my booking rate, but not the internet. My convention rate was more expensive, and at first did not cover the internet rate, but then we complained and it did, but even then the rate I found online was better, even when I paid extra for the internet. The point: look for online rates, and call the hotel to negotiate. It shouldn't be this complicated or this annoying. Because it is near the Convention Center, the hotel allows the pool area can be booked for special events. This happened only once during a 5-night stay, but the staff shooed people away by 4 for an evening cocktail and dinner event. Fair warning if you counted on the pool for an after-work or after-dinner swim. But these days, it happens, and I have to compliment the banquet people on a good job for some of my industry events held at the hotel. The fitness facilities were very nice, but some of the spa services compete with guests who are trying to clean up inthe locker room. One day, a staff member was doing the hair of a client in the same smallish area were guests were trying to put themselves together. There were too few outlets for various hair dryers and styling appliances. It would be nice if more tourist brochures were immediately available. While the concierges are very accomplished, you had to ask for everything, which could result in a back up if all you wanted was an area map. One complaint more: for a hotel this new, some of our presentations in the conference rooms had a few technical glitches. This shouldn't happen at a new hotel, and some of the rooms could have been outfitted better for presentations. Still, it was a very nice stay and I'd consider it again.

Wearing comfy sweats, t-shirt and tennis shoes due to the long flight, I didn't look my best as I got out of the car and entered the hotel. That didn't matter to the valet/bellman, as he was very pleasant and opened the car door for me. We didn't need our bags carried in at that point, and he told us that he would be upset if we didn't let him know how he could make our stay most excellent. Wow, what a first impression. Bonus material: My room was ready too (Sunday). Everyone we encountered from the front desk, to the concierge, maids, and service workers proving food at the conference I attended, were so exceptionally nice it blew my mind. Every worker at all resturaunts and stores had this same pleasant attitude. I'm from the deep South, and we're supposed to be known for friendliness. I was absolutely astonished that San Diego had such a great attitude in general. We don't have anything on these people! The hotel was very clean and modern. My room number was 718 and faced the Dole \"Banana Boat\" that comes in on Mondays and Tuesdays. It was a little noisy, but not bad. It unloads 491 cargo containers, so they work pretty much around the clock to get it back out to sea in two days. Room also faced Coronado Bridge. Be prepared: Parking is $20 per day. When you leave the parking garage, you must turn right and drive 1000 feet before you can make a U-turn. They also deliver a paper every morning. If you don't want it, let them know and they take 75 cents off your bill daily. GPS won't work either, I suspect because its such a new property. I plugged in 100 Park Blvd. and it got me close enough. Walking to the GasLamp was about a 5-10 minute walk, and was pretty desolate from the Hilton Bayfront. I would definitely not walk by myself, but felt fairly safe with one other female. This hotel is the last one on a row of hotels before you get to the shipyard. Beds were comfortable. Good water pressure for the shower. Hot water is REALLY hot, so watch this if you have a child in your room. There's always lots of cool stuff to see from the pool area and front of the hotel. Military ships cascade by, low flying helecoptors, F-18's on practice runs, dophins jumping in boats for Military training, etc. Sunsets were gorgeous too. Overall, a great experience.

The hotel was very nice and in the perfect location. It was a 15 minute cab ride from the airport and within walking distance of the Gaslamp Quarter, Pecto Park, and the pier. The hotel is on the bay and we had a beautiful view of the mountains and the water. We did not rent a car and it's really not necessary if you plan to stay in the general area. Plus, parking at the hotel is expensive. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants because they seemed overpriced and we preferred to venture out. The Gaslamp Quarter has every restaurant and bar you could ever hope for - great fish and chips at Tin Fish, excellent seafood at Lou and Mickey's if you want a nicer restaurant, good breakfast at The Broken Yolk and really good breakfast (especially pancakes) at Richard Walker's. Richard Walker's gets very busy on the weekends, we waited in line for almost 45 minutes on Sunday morning, but it was worth it. The Zoo is a 20 minute cab ride from the hotel. It's very big and has lots of animals, but very expensive. It was $70 for the two of us. The highlight of our trip was taking the water taxi (it leaves the pier every 2 hours) to Coronado Island. It is absolute paradise over there. The main part of the island is 2 miles from where the boat drops you off, so you can walk, take a trolley, or rent bicycles. We rented bikes and it was such a beautiful, relaxing way to see the island. There's a bike route that runs along the water and the golf course and it ends near the Hotel Del Coronado, which is amazing. The pacific ocean is at the back of the hotel and it is stunning. Lots of restaurants and shopping on the island as well. Overall, we loved our trip to San Diego.

The Fox Sports Bar was the chosen spot. There is not an entrance to the Fox Sports Bar from the hotel, one must go outside to enter (explained that Fox rents space from Hilton). Staff there were young, most were helpful but inexperienced in treating people friendly. The conciere at the hotel was the most curt unprofessional person I have ever encoutered at a conciere desk. She was efficient, however. Hilton needs to find a polite and friendly person to put at that desk and that would not be the blonde, thin, female that was working when I was there. The front desk people are usually working on a computer when you approach and are seemingly too busy to help those waiting. No check out process except to approach this desk. The conference wait staff is the exception, they are very polite, greet you in hallways, and are very helpful.

While from the outside the hotel appears beautiful, it lack amenities and service which should be readily available for a new hotel. Normally at a Hilton Hotels Gold and Diamond members are provided 2 complimentary breakfasts (if this is what you choose on Your Way preference). This hotel was so petty that is only provided a certificate for a complimentary cup of coffee and bakery item at Starbucks. The hotel Starbucks is not licensed to make food so they don't even have their hot breakfast sandwiches. I would have been satisfied if the hotel offer this, considering that most Hiltons will provide a minimum of a continental breakfast buffet and upsell you to full breakfast bufffet. But no, they wanted to either offer a muffin and coffee at Starbucks (which required you go down to the bottom floor of hotel and out door around corner) to get a lousy unsatisfying breakfast, or pay $15 for their breakfast buffet (normally priced at $25). There was no option for a $15 credit towards a plated breakfast option. We ended up getting the buffet which was way overpriced, as was everything else in this hotel ($9 bottle of Corona beer and $21 parking). Also note that the hotel provides certificates for a complimentary cracker and olive plate at the bar. Don't worry, there is no value there, as they make there money back at the overpriced bar! Try and get something to eat after 12 midnight, even during a night with a full house! No room service, no food vending machines. They are generous to give VIP members certificates which say complimentary Coca Cola beverages from the machines, only to find out it only works on the 29th and 30th floor machines loaded solely with water! The pool is nothing to impressive and the rooms are a bit small. In fact, I notice a stain on the bottom sheet of my bed prior to go down for the night. The business center is ran by a UPS store, very pricey! No complimentary internet access here. I would definitely not stay at this hotel again for 40k points per night.

The location is also very good, right on the Embarcadero, adjacent to Petco Park, the Convention Center, and the Gaslamp Quarter. Be aware that there is a lot of construction in the area as of my review, so there is no real direct route to the Gaslamp Quarter and Petco park even though they are across the street. I saw a walkway being constructed, but as of now, it would entail walking a couple of crosswalks and a walk across the railroad tracks. The hotel itself is incredibly modern and stylish, with a design more akin to the \"W\" chain than run-of-the-mill Hiltons. The lobby is bright and airy, decorated with bold colors and modern furniture. The rooms are also of similar aesthetics, with comfortable modern furniture and sleek design. The rooms are sizeable enough, but I was disappointed to find that my room only had a shower, and no bath. At first I thought it was may have been an accessible room assignment, but noticed to grab bars in the bathroom. The hallways on the room floors, however, showed for any lack of design. Where one would expect to see simple prints or plants spread about to decorate the long corridors, there was no added decor in sight. This gave the interiors the feeling of a Holiday Inn. Service was friendly, but spotty at times. Upon check-in I was assigned a room that was already occupied. Although this was easily resolved, I'm sure this was an unpleasant experience for the guest whose room I tried to enter. Likewise, housekeeping was spotty, as one day I noticed that although the bathroom had been tidied, the toilet bowl was not cleaned. And like most hotel chains, and as others had complained previously, there are \"nickel-and-dime\" charges everywhere - $13.95 for internet, $21 daily for self parking, fees for fitness center use. I can understand the need to generate revenue, but these types of things would not garner customer loyalty in my opinion. Overall the stay was pleasant but not extraordinary.

The hotel is very new and its styling is very sparse and clean and simple. We loved the style but for those who like plush, ornate styels they might find it a bit empty. We had a double queen room which was roomy enough. Comfy beds with plenty of pillows. There is a large LG flatscreen TV on top of a six drawer dresser which also houses the in-room safe, coffee maker, glassware and ice bucket. There is a desk, deskchair and seating chair as well. The closet is pretty small, about the width of two suitecases standing upright. The bathroom is nice, but it is all in one room. When traveling as a family it is nice to have the sink and mirror outside the shower area. The towels are large and plush, a nice blowdryer (not like the mini ones connected to the wall) and Crabtree & Eveland shower supplies. The hotel is located just to the south of the convention center. Between them is an art garden and some nice walking paths. It's just a short walk to the Gaslamp quarter (about two blocks) and across from Petco Park. There is some road construction in the area which causes you to have to go up a few blocks to get to the hotel, but once you figure that out it doesn't cause too much delay. The heated, salt-water pool area overlooks the water. They've done an admirable job hiding the shipping area, so unless you're looking for it, it isn't terribly noticeable. Large, over-sized pool towels are available in the pool area. There are plenty of lounge chairs and four cabanas with dual loungers. The area is plenty large so if you want to be away from the pool noise you can still be outside. It looks like they have a snack bar area but it was not open nor did I see the HUGE TV screen in use. Also outside is a large gas fire-pit. A nice place for gathering, enjoying a cocktail. It is located just behind the Fox sports bar which is rather loud. So definately not a family-friendly spot.

My husband had to pay $5 for two AA batteries at the front desk. Ridiculous. Self-parking is $21 a day, which in my experience is very reasonable for a downtown spot in a major city.

If it really bothers you, you can valet your car for $10 more per day that the self parking. My husband and son walked to Petco Park from the hotel and didn't think it was far, at all. You could actually see into the stands of Petco Park from our room. We did pay a bit extra to have our view upgraded, an offer that is made at the time of booking (sort of a standby arrangement - you agree you'll pay the extra when you check in if the upgraded room is available). One thing about the view that is misleading...this hotel *is* on the bayfront. There is a wonderful photo of the pool on the hotel web site, which is lovely. HOWEVER, the photo is misleading in that the pool DOES sit on the bay, however about half the pool also faces the pier where Dole bananas are unloaded. While we were there, there was a freighter tied up and you know what freighters look like. However, I have to say that the hotel (or someone) has obviously tried to make the best of this situation by putting up a kiosk on the boardwalk that tells all about the Dole pier, the capacity of the ships, their voyage, etc. So, your kids just might find this interesting. I did, but I couldn't see the freighter from my hotel window, so maybe that made a difference. :) The Gaslamp district is technically in walking distance, but if you want to venture past the first few blocks, I'd suggest taking your car. The restaurants we ate at were not within walking distance. Downtown garage parking was ridiculous...$2 per 15 minutes...and street parking was hard to come by, especially if there's a ball game. One night (no game) we found a space, on the other, we should have used the valet at the restaurant. At $15 it was cheaper than what we paid at the garage. We did have the breakfast buffet at the restaurant one morning and it was wonderful, BUT we didn't pay for it. My husband had trouble with the tickets he got from the concierge, so they comped our whole family with breakfast. I don't know if I would have paid $25 per person, but the food included an omlette station, smoked salmon, homemade pastries, and some other unusual items along with the breakfast regulars. What it's like when full, I can't say, but all in all, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monrovia, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Great View, Nice Location\u201d", "Author": "javisq", "ReviewID": "UR27101393", "Content": "I stayed here 2 nights over a weekend in March.

From that point on, the service was excellent and the setting was beautiful. The hotel is tastefully modern and the views are fantastic. For those of you from out of town, this hotel is a bit of a walk into the Gaslamp Quarter...even though it's directly across from Petco Stadium, you have to walk a ways due to the fence around the trolley (I believe they are in the process of building a bridge, which will improve access to Petco Park). You can walk if you have comfortable shoes or take a taxi for about $7-$10.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cBest Convention Hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "Husker44", "ReviewID": "UR25547135", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a five day stay at the Bayfront Hilton while attending a convention next door at the convention center. We had a corner king room on the 19th floor, outstnading view. Picture windows on 3 walls with view of the city, bay and coronado bridge. Clean, spacious, well decorated and quiet. We visited with our cleaning lady twice and asked for special coffee one day, more towels the next, both requests granted with a smile. Airport to room service was top notch and friendly. We did not dine in the hotel or use the bar, but spent considerable time at the pool. The salinity of the pool water was amazing, did not burn the eyes and provided extra bouyancy when swimming laps. Hottub was hot and soothing, used it each morning before jogging out the front lobby, along the bay and through the beautiful parks. The location is great. The weather was outstanding and enabled us to get out and about each day. The Coronado ferry landing is only 1/4 mile down the sidewalk, convention center next door, seaport village and gaslamp quarter all within walking distance. We dined at a different restaurant each meal and visited several bars within a mile of the hotel. Plenty of pedicabs are available if you desire a ride for a reasonable price. I have stayed at four other convention area hotels and this was cleaner, newer and has the best view. It is on the high side for cost, but will not disappoint. We did not use the fitness center or spa, plenty of outdoor exercise was available. The Fox Sports Grill which is under construction will be a great addition. I will stay again for my next convention and my wife had plenty to do while I was at the sessions.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "arlington, va", "Title": "\u201cA conference hotel\u201d", "Author": "gomadforplaid", "ReviewID": "UR25404560", "Content": "Adjacent to the convention center, this hotel is definitely for the conference go-er or vendor.

The attendant was polite and things seemed to be going on well. When they could not find us a room of our choice, they even proposed they would waive our parking fee of 21 bucks. That sounded not too bad and we thought it would be a good stay. The room was sterile like others have commented which is a nice plus. However, the parking experience there was horrible. Because this hotel shares the structure with the Convention center and guess what, that night a big event of some sort took place at the convention center. So it took us like 2 hours just to drive from 1 mile away from the hotel to be able to park our car. And the hotel staffs seem very indifferent to this inconvenience at all. Worse part was yet to come. That night around 2:30AM, we were rudely awoken by a bunch of drunkards just out of our door in the hallway. It turned out to be a bunch of teenagers heading to Mexico and they were just too intoxicated to stay calm at all. Next morning, they even piled their trash just outside of our door! So we talked to the front desk about this issue and they promised to lower our fee because of that. So far so \"good\". Then after couple of days of the trip, guess what, those bills did creep up showing not a single cent of deduction as promised. And worse yet, the promised free parking also showed up glaringly as well. It took me half an hour to talk to the finance department to sort things out. However, I would say they are following a pattern here. Basically, when you are on premise, they could and would promise you anything and while you are away, they just change anyways they want totally forgetting about their promises. I am very disappointed by the extreme unprofessional way Hilton BayFront is treating their customers. In light of the current economy situation, should not they be more trained to retain customers by providing excellent services rather than those junks? Anyways, good hardware in the hands of wrong people only means bad business anyhow.

(have stayed at multiple other San Diego hotels in the past). To start, booked a room on the \"Executive floor.\" Please ignore anything the hotel website says about this because there is no free continental breakfast (when I called the desk was told that they \"don't do that anymore\") and no executive lounge. So I paid extra for nonexistant executive floor perks. When confronted with this, management was completely unhelpful and said the price hike was for the higher floor (of course, I didn't think seeing the port of San Diego with its many dirty trucks and rusty ships was important to see from a bigger height, and I don't pay extra for higher floors anyway when I travel). The location is also inconvenient. The street (Harbor) is under construction and you must walk 2 blocks up and then 2 blocks to cross over the train tracks to even get to Gaslamp and Petco Park. It is convenient to the Convention Center and nothing else. This may improve somewhat once the construction finishes but there are still many more convenient hotels. The rooms are nicely decorated but quite small in size for a new hotel. The bathroom was also nice but small, with only a shower stall. The closet is tiny. Internet access is $12.95 a night, which I still think is ridiculous in a nice hotel. My girlfriend's parents stayed in a \"suite\" which was simply a corner room, with no added benefit except an extra window and nicer view. The lobby and restaurant are very nicely decorated and spacious, probably the only positives on this hotel.
