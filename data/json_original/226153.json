Usually we stay at nicer places in Napa in the off season, but summer rates are so expensive that we decided to give the Hawthorn Inn a try. Initially I was pretty distressed because the neighborhood is even more industrial than I remembered (mainly car dealerships and auto parts stores) and I was wishing we had sprung for a nicer hotel. But once we checked in and saw the room, we were fine. The front desk staff is extremely nice and eager to help. The rooms are much larger than the average hotel and include a microwave and mini-refrigerator, which really came in handy. A five minute drive will take you to the center of Napa. Our only concern was we didn't want to drive at all after drinking and there was nowhere within walking distance (aside from taco trucks and one diner) to eat. So my husband had to limit himself to one glass of wine with dinner. If you drink a lot, this will be an issue unless you have a designated driver or take cabs. The free breakfast was a nice touch and saved us some money. All in all, it isn't ideal but if the choice is to stay at the Hawthorn Inn or not go in summer because of high hotel rates, it's definitely worth staying here.

The Bad: As others have noted, the location is loaded with eyesores, from the adjacent abandoned liquor store to the brightly lit car lots across the street and adjacent. I also agree that the beds could be more comfortable. Our room near the front of the building bore the full brunt of noises all night from the busy road; I couldn't have slept without earplugs, but perhaps rooms further from the street are quieter. The front desk gave very poor customer service regarding a significant reservation mistake they made; other encounters were polite, but not friendly. Those who have stayed in a Hawthorn suite will miss the large kitchen area in the Inn. Overall, a decent value if you're a sound sleeper not looking for a particularly romantic Napa getaway.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in the wine country\u201d", "Author": "momonthegoe", "ReviewID": "UR8192893", "Content": "We just returned from a 2-night stay in Napa at the Hawthorn.

The daily breakfast was convenient. We would all stay there again. The only complaint is that the beds were a little hard.

Come to find out, there was a group of about 30 high school aged kids drinking alcohol in the parking lot & playing loud music from their cars. HAWTHORN SUITES STAFF APPARENTLY DID NOTHING!!! After ~ 3am, & some earplugs, I finally fell asleep. We were running late the following morning, to get to the wedding, and consequently never said anything to the front desk. The following morning we went to the wedding and when we returned, that afternoon, our room key didn't work. I initially thought our key had been damaged, so I went to the front desk and got a new key made. Upon returning to our room, WE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE IN OUR ROOM!! AFTER ONLY ONE DAY, OF OUR TWO DAY STAY, THIS DUMP RENTED OUT OUR ROOM TO SOMEONE ELSE????? Our things were later found, in the maids' area & we were informed that there were no more rooms, of the type we'd paid for, and we could leave if we wanted to. The manager didn't seem to care at all. Luckily we were able to find much better accommodations, at a nicer location, nearby.

The staff at first was very friendly and offered us information about wineries in the area. However, the attitude changed when we arrived back at the hotel late at night/morning after the wedding. We were being very respectful, not being loud or anything that would disturb the other guests, we just wanted to go to bed. We arrived at our room and our key cards did not work in the lock on the door. After going back twice to retrieve new cards we had the staff member on duty come and look at the door. Nothing worked to open the door; he brought numerous keys and a machine. After about 45 minutes the staff member on duty called the manager but explained to us that he did not answer the phone and we asked him to call again but he gave us the number. One of the members of our group had to call the manager herself, and explain to him the problem. Finally after an hour of waiting with little apology our door was open. The next morning when we went to pay we asked for a discount on our room and the staff member that was now on duty was extremely rude. Was condescending to us calling us \"girls\" and telling us that we only had to wait an hour and it was very late at night we came in. After loosing sleep and being spoken to very rudely we were only given a $30 discount. We should not have to worry about getting in to our hotel room no matter what time it is or who we are. They had no regard that they had left 3 women stranded outside their hotel room. I was left with a sour taste in my mouth, and I have never written something like this but I feel that I was completely treated inappropriately. I would not recommend to anyone to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201ca Real Value and private Jacuzzi tub\u201d", "Author": "GelatoSF", "ReviewID": "UR5414822", "Content": "This is a deal during high season like June. Our room with a Jacuzzi tub in the room (literally in the bedroom- you could see pics on their website) was $189 ($129 without the jacuzzi) when all of the other hotels were charging at least $250. The receptionists was also very helpful and courteous during the several calls we made asking about breakfast, the tub, quiet room, etc... And the room was quiet and very clean. There is hot breakfast, a basic one: eggs, sausage, potatoes, bread/bagel, good coffee, juice, cereal, hot chocolate, tea. Free internet access in your room. Fridge (excellent for storing your bottles of water or leftovers or refreezing your icepacks) , microwave, coffee maker, and hair dryer too. They also take Hyatt points here. With all that said, this is a basic hotel/motel, not a luxurious one and not a romantic one. There is no view. The location is in downtown Napa, so it's a short drive north to the wineries. During low season, I'll look for bargains at the B&Bs or romantic high end places, but during the summer, when most of the day is spent outside, and I just need a nice cool, quiet, and clean room with all the conveniences, the Hawthorne fits the bill.
