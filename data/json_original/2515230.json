Took a cab instead of the train as we had 3 heavy luggages! Taxi fare was \u20ac67 as we got stuck in heavy traffic. The Gare de Lyon train station is just down the street from the hotel and its so convenient to move around with it. But being first timer at the station, we were so confused with the lines and didn't know where to take the train as the station was huge! There is also another station called Gare de Australitz which is just behind the hotel and have to cross a bridge to get there. The hotel room is great! We had the room with balcony and was facing the street. Not too noisy at night. What I love about Holiday Inns are the pillows...they have soft or firm pillows upon your request. We did have slight problem getting though the receptionist via our room phone through out our stay, it was always on engage tone! One night, our TV was not working and my hubby had to call housekeeping and got them to get the reception to call us back. We didn't try the buffet breakfast and ate at the cafe nearby the station. The cafes have breakfast set menu as low as \u20ac5. On our last night, we decided to try La'Europian restaurant just beside the train station and it was worth it. Dinner set menu for \u20ac33 was affordable as it came with wine,coffee,starter,main & dessert! Overall, the hotel has good service, staff was attentive to your request and friendly too. Room has the warm feeling and clean. And the location is good for people who depend on public transport in Paris.

To be honest the neon light made it easy to find the hotel and the shop itself made no impact on our stay. I think I only once saw someone coming out of it! The area itself had a few homeless people in the vicinity and on our first night there was a feed run. But again they didn't interfere with us. THe hotel itself was lovely. The room was a decent size for Paris and the bed was large and very comfortable. THe room was quiet and clean and warm. The bathroom had a shower and bath and was great. I do love a decent hot shower! Actually they had a nice note that if you'd forgotten anything like deodarant or toothpaste they would supply it on a complimentary basis. There was a nice bar near reception which was great for a drink or two before or after dinner and they bar tender was really nice. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel because it was too expensive and there was a nice cafe serving petit dejuner across the road. The hotel was also within walking distance of Gare d'Austerlitz where we caught the train to Versailles.

We then had to put in a special request for bedding for the pull out bed. The reception staff weren't particularly friendly or helpful though that may have been due to the fact that the woman who sorted out our room change was at the front desk at 6.00pm and still there at 9.00am the next morning.

The location is good - the Gare d'Austerlitz is just across the river if you want to catch the direct Metro to the Eiffel Tower and off course the Gare de Lyon is a few minutes walk away.

But in practicality, it's a terrible time waster ... It took me more than 4 hours to go from Arc De Triumph to the hotel, for a journey that takes 20 minutes by metro! ... Plus, the last bus on the Open Tour is at 7 pm. Not recommended at all!

Looked at Novotel and some other options and decided to stay here based on TA's reviews. Since we were arriving early in the morning, we also paid for the night before so that we can check in early and have one of the rooms for our baby to sleep in. Reservation: reserved on the website and decided to choose the advance purchase rate. At E160 per night (without breakfast), this seems to be cheaper than other options in town since we were here in July during tourist season. I also emailed the hotel ahead of time to inform them that we will be checking in early in the morning so that they will keep the room for us and also put in a baby cot. Received a prompt and courteous reply and everything was set when we check in. One odd thing is the reservation system didn't allow the four of us (2 adults, 1 child and 1 baby who sleeps in baby cot) to all stay in the same room and we wind up taking 2 rooms. Had we known the size of the rooms, we probably could have saved some money and all cramped into one room. Location: our train departs the next morning from Gare de Lyon. Given jet lag, lots of luggages and two child, we didn't feel like taking a taxi or the subway to reach the train station. This is a very good location to the station and is an easy 3 minutes walk even with luggage. You can see the Gare de Lyon in the background in one of the photos. Across the street, there is a good bakery where we bought our breakfast and lunch sandwich. The almond croissant was excellent! The sex shop next door was not that noticeable and did not present a problem even though we were traveling with two young children. I am not even sure if my wife even noticed it. The neighborhood seems to be mostly restaurants and bakeries. Check-in: was efficient and quick. There was no line and they gave us the pre-assigned room quickly. We did have two very heavy luggages and they didn't offer to help though given that this is a Holiday Inn, I wasn't expecting it anyway. Room: decently furnished with all the basic amenities one would look for. On my previous trips to Paris, I have come to expect tiny rooms and this one was decent size given my expectations. We managed to have two luggages on the floor and a baby cot. We would have been able to cramp into the same room had we known the size. In no way is this large but it was decent for an over-night stay. We were one floor above the reception facing the streets and it does get a little noisy especially when a car or motorcycle speed down the road. I did find that once I tried to close the window very tightly, the noise doesn't come through as much and is tolerable. In the other room, the window handle can't be turned as much and it was a bit of a nuisance. Summary: conveniently located for Gare de Lyon, reasonably priced, no real problems aside from a bit of noise from the streets.

Second, it is very close to several metro stations, the Gare de Lyon, and the Rue de Rivoli. Third, it has been recently remodeled and thus the lobby and rooms (or at least my room) were in good shape (modern, clean, and well featured). Fourth, there is a movie theatre across the street. Fifth, one can get a bus directly to CDG Roissy airport from the Gare de Lyon. The TV offerings are limited, but why watch when you are in Paris!

We went for a late drink in a nearby cafe whilst the fire alarm was sorted, when we returned to the hotel at about 1am, I asked the same receptionist guy if he could book us a cab for 5.30am as we had to get to the station to get the RER to the airport. He wrote it down on a piece of paper. After a short bit of shut eye, we were down at reception ready to go at 5.30.

We decided to stay at this hotel due to its proximity to RER A train, and the fact we could book a suite for same points as a standard room (an earlier online offer). The hotel is very close to Gare de Lyon, and around it there are plenty of bistros and pubs where one can enjoy lunch, dinner or even just a drink with friends. The only negative point about the location is that there is a Sex Shop which shares the ground floor with the hotel, almost blocking the entrance and definitely more visible that the HI. This is not setting up the right expectations if you travel with family :) At check-in we were advised that our room has been assigned to somebody else; we have been moved to an Executive Room and offered free breakfast as compensation. Travelling with a small child and being aware of breakfast quality at other HI hotels, we took the deal, I was not in a mood for argueing. Staff was very curteous and gave us all necessary information. The room was on 3rd floor and was the largest room on the floor (317). However, it was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, and definitely not something one could call \"Executive Room\". With a roll-away bed in the room, we only had physical space to keep the luggage on the floor, even the small hall-way was full with the baby-stroller. The bathroom was 1m away from the bed, sepparated from the room by glass doors. It was so small that the door only opened 45 degrees before bumping into the toilet seat :) The room had all amenities you would expect from a 4* room/hotel (LCD TV, fridge, tea/coffee station, bedlights, etc), but due to the size you could not really tell it is an upgrade from standard room. The quality of the furniture and bed was high, and everything was working very well. Internet is free at this proprety, a very big plus for us who wanted to keep in touch with the family and the world. Breakfast was the biggest dissapointment for us at this hotel. I was expecting a full range of starters (yoghurt, salami, vedgetables, cheese, etc), accompanied by the standard range of hot offerings (eggs, bacon, sausages, etc). I stayed at several HIs in UK before and they all offered a much better breakfast. The offer was very similar to breakfast at a Holiday Inn Express, with only lukewarm scrambled eggs and a thin array of other food. For bread they only served \"baguettes\", completely useless if you want to have a proper toast sandwich in the morning. We did not have dinner at the hotel, but the prices were very friendly, compared to the bistro's nearby. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but this was not due to the hotel.

Staff at check-in were very friendly, reviewing on site amenities and taking their time (ie not rushing) through check-in. The lobby has somewhat of a modern look to it. The \"business centre\" which features two computers with internet access (free) are located next to the front desk. The hotel has two elevators - only one of which makes it to the top (7th floor). We were provided with a King Executive room which is located on the 7th floor. I usually like staying on the top floor so this was good. However, as this is an older building, you do loose some space/heights as the roofside/ceiling/wall is at an angle for part of the room. This is actually somewhat dangerous as one side of the bed is on that lower ceiling side and one would easily bump into the wall/window at night. This is really the only \"design flaw\" for those rooms. Other than that, the room was great as far as space, bed comfort and other amenities.

Well, it wasn't bad but it wasn't, as someone said, the best thing about Paris! It was simply a comfortable hotel, well positioned with nice, quiet rooms. Just what you need in Paris. THE PROS Great location - Right near to Gare de Lyons so very easy to get around. Top tip, if you're coming from London via Eurostar, buy your metro tickets at Kings Cross (you get them once you pass through customs) - otherwise you'll have to stand at a massive queue at Gare du Nord. Get the D line - it's just two stops from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon so it's really not worth getting a taxi. The Price - A great price for Paris, some hotels nearer to the centre really do charge ridiculously high prices just because of their central location. This is only 4 or 5 metro stops from the Louvre so just a hop, skip and a jump. The Silence - Wonderfully quiet rooms. We've stayed in Paris loads of times and love the atmosphere but if your room overlooks a busy street, then sometimes the atmosphere can be a little tiring, especially at 3 in the morning! The rooms here were lovely and quiet. The Rooms - Large comfortable beds, fair size bathrooms. Nothing special, simply comfortable. The Staff - Some of the reception staff were lovely, one though was, urm, see below. CONS The Booking - Ring up the day before to check they've got your reservation. We did do this and they confirmed it but when we arrived, quite late, they said that the company credit card hadn't been accepted. Turned out, they simply hadn't got the expiry date so all turned out OK in the end but a little surprised that they hadn't mentioned this on the phone the day before. A member of staff - At the reception desk, we carried out the credit card discussion in French until, a little tired and running out of French vocab, I asked if the receptionist spoke English. \"If I have to,\" he said. I like to think he had a dry sense of humour but I'm not so sure. He was the only member of the reception staff who really didn't seem particularly happy to be there! The rest of them were great.

The bathroom was also a decent size, the only downside was the bathroom doors. The doors were frosted glass, but you could pretty much see right through them, so there was not really a lot of privacy.

We were not disappointed and after a very short \u20ac8 cab fare from Gare De Nore we were pulling up outside a very nice looking building . The reception area was decorated lovely and it took all of 5 mins to be checked in our room was on the 3rd floor (314 I think) and this faced out towards the back of the hotel which was very quiet so although no spectacular views we both got goods night sleep. The hotel as just been though a refurb and it showed the hallways were decorated well and the lights above each room came on as you walked past them. The room we had was small but perfectly formed with a TV (BBC world /CNN news only English channels), safe, full length mirror and well stocked bathroom. The bed was firm and pillows ok and the air con was easy to work, with two wardrobes either side of the bed there was no arguments for hangers ! There was a hair-dryer in the bathroom which worked well however my only gripe was the fact the cord was too short so i had to turn and face the wall to dry the other side of my head . Reception were very helpful giving directions to a restaurant we booked in the Latin quarter and advised us of breakfast facilities etc but we decided to eat outside the hotel and find our own food . Across the road from the hotel (50meters) is a Monop which has a good choice of food, snacks, wine and water which would suggest you buy from there as the mini bar was \u20ac5 for a small bottle !! The stunning Notre Dame was a 25 min walk along the river and the Pantheon was approx 40 mins. We even walked to the Eiffel Tower one day obviously it took quite a while however with the sun shining and lots of things / places to see on your way the time went by quickly. If walking seems a little to much then there were shuttle boats picking up people from various stops along the river or there are Bikes that you can hire from various points along the river bank which from memory were pretty inexpensive. Best part about the hotel is the closeness to Gare De Lyon just perfect ! worst ....I can't seem to think of anything apart from the hair-dryer cord so all in all a great place to stay !", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Really Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "bhaskar_desai", "ReviewID": "UR75129399", "Content": "The first hotel of our trip.

Take the train, and since the hotel is right on the train route than runs along the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es most tourists will be very pleased with the location. With the Louvre, shopping and other sights just 3 minutes by train life is good there. There are two small hints to keep in mind though. First, parking...there is none, you have to park at the train station which is pretty expensive at 25\u20ac/day. Second, breakfast is cheaper at the train station and there are wonderful pastry/bakeries there that offer many things. The hotel was a bit pricey for breakfast so we never opted to eat there.

Hopefully by the time you read this it will all be finished. LOCATION -Despite its name the hotel is actually much closer to \"Gare de Lyon\" than to \"Place de la Bastille\". If you are taking an early morning train from this station this is a good hotel to be in. It\u2019s literally less than 10 minutes from the hotel entrance to the train station platforms. TGV high speed trains to Cannes and Nice leave from here. -Closest metro (subway, underground) station is \"Gare de Lyon\" where you can get the purple coloured metro line 14 the and the yellow coloured line number 1. RER lines A and D also run though this station. If you're going to either of the airports or gare du nord Eurostar terminal you will need to change lines. Alternatively you can walk down \"Rue de Lyon\" to \"Place de la Bastille\" where metro line 5 (orange colour) goes direct to gare du nord. -There is a beautiful restaurant inside the \"Gare de Lyon\" train station called \"Le Train Bleu\" with stunning interiors from the year 1900 where you feel like you're dining in a royal palace ! There are also many restaurants and shops in the \"Place de la Bastille\" area. -Unfortunately the hotel is literally right next door to a sex toy & video shop. Despite this its not a bad area of town at all. ROOMS -Rooms have recently been renovated and look good and everything is new, but despite this, they are still quite small. Windows can be opened which is a plus. Top floor rooms have views over the rooftops of Paris. -Because the hotel was undergoing refurbishment in August 2009 we got 3 free soft drinks in the minibar which was a nice gesture. STAFF -There was only one person behind reception. COMMON AREAS -This is an old building from 1913 and still has some very old features which are lovely. However, probably due to laws prohibiting radical changes in such listed buildings the lift/elevator is tiny and from what I could see they only had one. It\u2019s fine if you're 2 people with one piece of luggage but for a hotel with over 125 rooms it's a nightmare. You're better off taking the stairs. -Breakfast is 16 euro per person. We declined as there were many places nearby with better and cheaper options. -Some parts of the hotel looked quite empty...perhaps they were ordering some new furniture after the refurbishment. PRICE Rooms at this hotel are often quite expensive so make sure you shop around. 100 to 150 euro for one night seems way overpriced considering the non central area and small rooms.

The next morning, I was planning on sleeping in but couldn't because DIRECTLY outside our window they were sanding and banging the metal railing. I asked to changed rooms, which they did oblige us however; the front desk girl had and attitude and smirked when I said I wanted a room away from the construction; she was the one that put us in the first room and I'm sure she knew it was a bad room! I'd have to say 1/2 the staff was helpful, the other half would ignore you even if you were standing there waiting to ask them a question! On the Holiday Inn website it stated there were coffee makers and irons in all rooms, which is NOT true. My husband was there for a confernece and we had no iron. We asked for one the first day (from the same girl that checked us in) and never recieved one, only to be told later they were all gone and if we wanted one we would have to wait until someone returned one and then put a deposit of 20 euros until we gave it back. This was also true of the plug adaptor (we forgot ours) We had to pay 10 euros deposit for that, which we did get back. The Holiday Inn website also listed there was a business center and restuarant, which there is NOT. If we had known all of this ahead of time, that all this construction was going on we would have found another hotel.

They offered a drab breakfast buffet which we were never told about, I just happened to wander in on day 2 because I desperately needed coffee! They had scrambled eggs which were bland, hotdogs, meatballs, yucky not fully cooked bacon, lots of croissants, some fruit, yogurt cereal. I don't know what they were charging, they asked us if we had breakfast when we were checking out and I just said no because I heard them telling another couple checking in it was included. The room was tiny, as well as the bathroom,could only fit one person at a time although things were updated, the carpets were filthy! My feet got dirty walking around the room.

Renovations to the ground floor meant no bar, no lounge, a very drab breakfast room off reception and for a hotel on 7 floors only one lift. The reception staff attitude was that this was all on their website (but not as I could see on the main HI website for this hotel) - they were not apologetic, despite my being a HI loyaly card holder. Not at all welcoming. So we only walked through to our room and spent no other time here. Needless to say we didnot take breakfast here, lots of cafes around the Bastille or Gare du Lyon. Not much help from staff either for parking although you can park on the street in August in Paris for free - if you can't find a space nearby, the Opera Bastille car park is \u20ac28 for 12 - 24 hours. Our room was fine, renovated, air conditioned but as some others comment, rooms are small - but it is central Paris So no complaints about the accommodation, good bed, flat screen TV with CNN, BBC and Eurosport in addition to French channels. Didnot use the internet but it is available, but expensive (strange when some HI offer free wireless!) The bathroom was spacious with a good shower over bath, but no screen or curtain, so it's hard not to saok the floor if you take a shower. If you have young children, be aware all windows open fully inward and an inquisitive child on a chair could fall out! Surprised H+S allow this in these hotels.

Good location, near the Bastille and the Marais, 300 m from direct line from Bastille to Louvre, Champs Elysee etc and 100 m from Gare du Lyon. As others have said, don't be put off by the sex shop next door, it's not a seedy area. An average hotel for an average price, let down by poor service and currently, very poor public areas.

My wife, our twenty-year old son, and I stayed in a seventh floor suite for a week in early July 2009.

The beds were comfortable, the bathroom and toilet area were adequate, the television and refrigerator were fine, and the d\u00e9cor was very pleasing. The hotel\u2019s proximity to the Gare de Lyon is its great selling point. We selected this hotel as we arrived from Italy around 11 pm and only had to cross the street to arrive at our hotel. Also, a Metro stop is less than 100 meters from the hotel-thus you can easily travel around Paris from this hotel\u2019s location. Service and amenities at the hotel aren\u2019t equal to the rooms. Breakfast at the hotel is over-priced at 16 euros per person, and internet access fees constitute outright usury. Use an internet caf\u00e9 next door! Our room was cleaned daily, but the housekeeping staff frequently didn\u2019t replace tissues, soap, and shampoo. Also, there is a coffee pot in the room, but some days we had to request replacement coffee. We received a packet of hot chocolate once, but that option never returned. Frequently, creamer and sugar were forgotten. The front desk staff was helpful in calling us a cab to travel to the airport, but my wife found their English vocabulary limited. I speak French so I had no problem in obtaining all of the assistance which I needed. Dinner was readily available in the neighborhood.

However, when we were checking out the guy asked us how it was and when we said it wasn't great he said we didn't have to pay for it or for the drinks we'd had from the minibar, so that was totally fine!

One other thing is that there is a sex shop right on the corner beside the hotel, but there's no offensive window dressings or anything, so it didn't bother us, although might prompt questions from children of a certain age!

We also had no problems with our reservations and were never told we had to pay a different rate than what I reserved it at on the Holiday Inn's website, which I was worried about when reading other reviews. It is about 4 miles from the Eiffel Tower which can be far for people who dont like to walk but it is a great way to see all of the city. The hotel is only about a mile from Notre Dame and its a very pretty walk along the Seine to it.

I found no problems with the shower head whatsoever and actually thought the water pressure was quite good compared to some European places I have been! The metro station is right across the street and there are several nice little cafes around the area. The Bastille area is not the most happening area in Paris but it was only a 10 euro taxi ride to the Eiffel Tower and even less to other areas that are more fun to be around. We paid 119 euro a night, with breakfast included, which by Paris standards is excellent... All in all, if you want a decent priced hotel that is easy to get to and from, close to nice areas and safe, this is a good place to stay.

Also it was not a kingsize bed, just a 4\u2019 6\u201d double. When I asked about the safe key, the same receptionist informed me that the previous guest had not returned it! I was offered no other option. I was going to ask about changing the room, but thought it best until a more amenable receptionist was on duty.

Of course this was my personal experience and others may not have any trouble at all, it is still annoying as I am a platinum card holder and usually receive a much better standard of service and recognition. Overall the hotel is very well used, with smoking going on in all public areas. It could do with an update, but they say on the website it has been recently upgraded? Also they may boast of sound proof rooms, but you can just hear the lift machinery if you have a room just outside the lifts. The lifts can be slow if it is busy.

One of the best bakeries you'll ever find is across the road and they make croissants to die for.

The staff to their credit were very helpful in checking on and resolving this. They spoke very good English and were very polite. The location was great! We took the Air France shuttle from CDG and its stop at the Gare De Lyon was only one block from the hotel. Also, the metro was very near also.

We selected it because it's just a short walk from the Gare de Lyon, where we would later be boarding a train to link up with a river cruise. It also happens to be within reasonably easy walking distance of Notre Dame and all the major attractions of both the right and left banks -- about four miles from the Musee D'Orsay on the left bank and about an equal distance from the Place de la Concorde on the right bank. Since we love to walk, the location was ideal for us. We were very happy with our stay here. The room, while somewhat small, was very comfortable and tastefully -- albeit somewhat whackily -- decorated. The bathroom left a little to be desired. There was a doorstop in front of the toilet and we kept tripping on it. Try as we might, we couldn't avoid irrigating the bathroom floor while showering. But that's about the only fault we could find with the place. Frequented primarily by business travelers, the hotel was very quiet. The hot and cold buffet breakfast included with our room was excellent. All the staff were very nice. Plus, we got a very good deal here. I booked the room through Holiday Inn's Web site at 97.50 euros a night. At the exchange rate prevailing at checkout, that worked out to about $125 per night. I noticed that their rack rate for this room was actually 159 euros -- $203 per night.
