When I picked up my vehicle the next day, there was exterior damage to the door. I reported it immediately, filled out the appropriate forms before I left, and had the damage documented photographically. A week later I still had no response so I called the numbers on the forms. No one returned my calls. Finally, I received an email stating that their investigation into this matter yielded no evidence that they were negligent and thus, would deny my claim for damages. The car was in perfect condition when left with them, damaged when returned to me, but they deny responsibility. I imagine that this is probably a standard response in the industry. I don't intend to give up that easily though.

The room was your average room, with a unique decor (again, a nod to the days gone by). The bathroom is tiny, and our tub had peeling paint. We were \"promised\" fluffy bathrobes, but our room didn't have any. We were also promised upon booking our room that we would be on floors 3-5, but our room was on the 11th floor. Not that we really cared about that. Another \"negative\" if you can call it that, was we were promised \"Club Access\" which was complimentary cocktail hour fare, and breakfast in the morning. What they don't tell you until you arrive is that children may not partake in this, because it's set up for business travelers. My 10 year old didn't mind, but it would have been nice if everyone in my \"party\" had been able to enjoy the breakfast. What my daughter did enjoy was the pool, and we spent a good part of our brief visit at the Biltmore Health Club. I thought the lobby was breathtaking and the staff very courteous. The one BEWARE I will share with possible visitors: DO NOT STAY NEAR THE ELEVATORS. In fact, if you get to your room and find yourself close to the elevators, insist on another room. Your hotel room will offer you no sound buffering, and you'll hear the \"ding\" of the elevators all night long. Unfortunately for us, another guest on our floor (only a room or two away from ours), came into the hallway and was loud, drunk and banging on doors for several minutes, waking us up and putting a damper on the \"relaxing\" mood the hotel had created for us. I can't blame the Biltmore for that, but beware, you will hear everything going on in the hallway. Be sure to turn on the rooms A/C and it will drown out some of the noise - that's how we survived the night. And lastly - while very courteous and helpful - the VALET service will run you $40 per night, so be prepared for the cost of parking in Los Angeles. I had done my research and expected it, but if it was a surprise I would have been bummed out. Overall, just 3 stars because of noise, and a few details the staff overlooked.

Honestly, it needs to be changed. The water is luke warm on the shower, but scalding on the tub. The toilet's flush reminds me of the one from my elementary school days.

My fiance was already staying in the hotel on business for 2 weeks. He was given room 976. I believe this room had to be one of the worst offered at the Millenium Biltmore. The room was very dark, facing a brick wall and the bed was broken. We asked them to fix the bed after my fiance fell out of it. They put a wooden plank under the mattress. It was horrible. The next morning, I asked them to upgrade his room to another room. Anthony at the front desk spoke with the manager, Christian, and we were given 1037. This room has views of both Pershing and the courtyard. There are windows in the bedroom and the bathroom. It is sunny and airy. This was a marked improvement. If you have issues with noise, you will not be happy in this room or any room facing Pershing. The quieter rooms tend to have horrible views. The brighter rooms with views tend to have street noise. The street noise was welcome considering the alternative. You could feel a bit of the energy of the city, view the ice skaters in Pershing Square and see the \"angel\" lights in the sky. Unlike 976 which required an additional power surge cord from the hotel due to the inconvenient outlets, 1037 had adequate electrical outlets. 1037 is not a suite however the layout is spacious and comfortable. It shares an entryway with another suite... I believe 1035. Although there were many guests and a lot of activity at the hotel due to the Showcase children's talent event in the lobby, there was nobody in the spa area.

Being a massive movie fan, I found the history of the hotel and the events that it has hosted very interesting. There are a lot of photos around the entire building which really takes you back to the 1920's and 30's. The bar and bar staff are very good and the food that they serve is also very good. Unfortunately, the rooms are terrible and in need of a massive re-vamp along with the halways leading to the rooms, they too take you back to the 1920's and 30's but for the wrong reason. Our trip was somewhat spoiled on our last full day, as we were advised by a member of staff at the concierge desk (Josh) to visit the six flags theme park just outside the city. This was something we really wanted to do and so got him to book the tickets on the morning that we wanted to go. On that morning we asked to organise a shuttle however we were told that it should have been organised the night before, when we asked why we were not told the night before when enquiring about the tickets, the answer was \"I must have forgot\". Josh then advised us to rent a car just across the road. We didn't really want to rent a car, however did so because we really wanted to go to the theme park. So, we spent about an hour hiring a car, setting up a sat nav and started to make our way out of the city (40 miles) and when we got to the park, guess what? The park was closed, which everyone apart from the concierge seemed to know. I am in no way saying that this was done on purpose, because it wasn't, the sad thing is that we had spent $140 on car hire and $120 on park tickets, not to mention the loss of 4 hours of our day. Josh really did do everything he could to try and get our money re-funded, but the hotel seemed to refuse, or at least thats what it looked like. All we got from the hotel was $40 to cover the cost of our taxi back to the airport. We were assured that both the hire car cost and park tickets would be refunded to our credit card, however it has been 12 weeks since our visit and still nothing has been done. Its a pity that I have to write a review like this, however no-one from management in the hotel seemed to want to help us or even cared about what had happened.

Many people brush off the fact the LA has a distinct heart, but it does. If you wish to explore some great LA history, this hotel provides a wonderful hive for you buzzin' bees. First of all, the hotel is an amazing place of history and architecture. The lobby, gallery and \"Rendezvous Room\" have amazing ceiling frescoes which are not to be missed. The people who work the Millennium Biltmore could not have been more helpful or friendly. The history of this hotel can be seen by the many photos on display in the gallery. JFK was chosen as the Democratic candidate in this hotel, not to mention the many Oscars held here. Secondly, the hotel is in a great location. One can walk to most of the historic sites of old LA. My wife and I went to Angel's Flight, Grand Central Market and the Bradbury building in about 1/2 hour on foot. Historic Pershing Square is right across the street from the hotel. We also hit the seedling of LA, Olvera Street and the wonderful train station of LA, Union Station, which has been featured in many films (and for good reason). Both of these are a quick Metro ride (two stops) from the station across the street from the Biltmore. The LA Metro was clean, uncrowded and easy to manuever.

I picked it because it was the one among the conference offerings that had some style and unique elements to it. If you like fantastic interior architecture this is the place to stay in downtown LA. It is imbued with the style and mood of 1930s Hollywood; ornate, detailed and glamourous in it's design from the flooring to the ceiling of every public room. It is well worth the stay, just for that aspect. The rooms themselves are small but clean. Not fancy, but perfectly fine and functional. My room, with a single king bed, had the dresser at the end of the bed with not a lot of room to navigate in between. It would have been better to have a slimmer stand for the TV there and the larger dresser farther into the room where there was a lot of empty space that could have been better utilized. The bathroom was also small but they did an admirable job of making enough counter space for it to still be functional. I was alone on this trip so I only had my small toilet kit. I have my doubts as to whether my wife would have had enough room for all her stuff, actually I know she wouldn't have. The bar had fantastic brisket tacos that I got to enjoy two nights in a row. I don't drink so without that food and Ginger Ale I wouldn't have known about the jazz band they had playing. They were fantastic, setting the mood for enjoying the final hours of our conference. The service personnel were wonderful, cleaning the room, helping to get cabs, explaining maps and just in general doing their job very well. Another element I mentioned in my last review is true for this one as well. Nightstands need plugs right on them for recharging, as does the desk. It's 2011, time for all hotels to understand that is a necessity.

I inquired about taxi service or car service at the conceirge and asked if the Biltmore car can take me to the airport and the lady at the concierge desk looked at me as if I had 2 heads and was very sarcastic to me saying it only takes guest with in a 1 mile radius of the hotel. Please note, I am a seasoned traveler and stayed at the Hilton across the street a few weeks ago and they provided transportation to the airport to their guests, so i didn't think my question was unusual. 2. While this hotel is historic, the rooms and hallways are run down. It's really bad when the carpet is pieced together with duck tape. 3. The rooms also smell really musty. Pros 1. When i did complain about the musty smell, they did move me to another room which still smelled but not as bad. 2. Location is nice and safe. 3. Maid service was great. Our bathroom was very clean.

Totally refreshed decor and excellent Air Con.

Yes, that's right. It's the dingy basement of buildings where climactic television foot chases take place, and there's no egress to the lobby. I had to climb back up the stairs to my floor and then take the elevator down. A sign that the stairs lead to nowhere would have been helpful.

Lovely sized room with lovely decor and a very comfy bed to sleep away our jet lag after a 14 hour flight from Australia. The bathroom was old, but very clean and had everything we needed. A club room includes breakfast and hours d'oeuvres in the evening included in the room price. .Also includes free wi-fi in the Club Room area. On second stay, we booked a normal king room which was on the eighth floor. This room was much smaller, and we had a couple of problems with the hot water and TV reception. But after a quick phone call to reception we had someone from engineering come to the room within a few minutes of the call. He was unable to resolve the problem straight away. so got us moved to a room further down the corridor. This was a room with 2 double beds, but a much nicer room. The lobby area and all the downstairs areas are amazing. The hotel has such history behind it and all of these areas are maintained beautifully. The Rendezvous Court is a lovely place to have lunch or just sit and have a drink after a long day of sight seeing. Staff where all very helpful and always pleasant. The girl at the concierge desk was very helpful and booked our flight to Vancouver, all just as part of the service that the hotel provides. If you are looking for an ultra modern hotel, this is not the hotel for you. The rooms are dated and perhaps could use a bit of updating, but all in all everything else about the hotel outweighed this minor problem. The only downside of the rooms that I found, was that the rooms do not have a bar fridge. They do provide an ice bucket, and there is an Ice machine on most floors, but if you want to have any of your own food in the room, there is no refrigeration.

The lobby area is very picturesque and grandiose, while the rooms are a bit outdated and badly lit. The worst part about the room was the bathroom -- I felt dirtier after showering in it than I did before showering. First of all, the shower had three walls (uhh...yeah...), which meant that the entire floor got soaked when you showered. The water pressure sucked and there was mildew and slimy gunk coating the floor and walls. Gross. The toilet was also weird - it was like an industrial toilet that you'd find in an airport bathroom or something, and just seemed to be out of place. Also, the wireless internet is $10/day. Don't think you can just use the business center that the hotel boasts about on their website, because they charge you $0.50/minute for internet usage. Nice, eh? The main gripe I had with this hotel was with its management. I was staying there with a friend, who was the one paying for the room. Her flight was delayed and I ended up arriving at the hotel 1 hour before her, so she called and put my name on the reservation. The hotel manager, Albert, told her that they would need to swipe my credit card for security purposes in order to check me in, but that nothing would be charged and they would charge her card when she arrived. When I got to the hotel and asked for Albert, he was very dismissive with me and had zero interest in handling the situation, even though he was the one who spoke with my friend. He passed me off to one of his hotel clerks and before giving her my credit card, I confirmed with him that it would NOT be charged. He very impatiently told me that it wouldn't be. Fine. Well, the next day I logged onto my credit card account and I had a pending charge of $100 from the Biltmore Hotel. It turns out that even though the hotel didn't charge me the $100, they still sent a $100 authorization through in case my friend didn't show up and I had to pay, which causes the bank to treat it as a pending charge. Even though I asked SEVERAL TIMES about any charges to my card, the $100 authorization was never mentioned by Albert or any hotel clerk. My bank (Bank of America) usually reverses authorizations within 3 business days, but since I was staying at the Biltmore over the weekend, it would not be reversed before I left LA. In other words, it was basically like the hotel charged me $100 and promised to reverse it after I left LA. How does that help?! What's worse is that I intentionally only brought that one credit card with me to LA, because it had a moderate credit limit and I didn't want to go crazy with the spending while I was there on a girl's weekend. It was just a minor annoyance at first, and I went downstairs completely calm to talk to someone about the hold on my card. I spoke with Miguel who was very nice but ultimately couldn't help, and he went to get Albert for me. (Can you see where this is going?) Albert - the hotel manager who is supposed to, you know, actually care about the guests - took about 15 minutes to wander out of his office to do me the favor of speaking to him, and then had no idea what the issue was even though Miguel had briefed him on it. He was immediately defensive about it, interrupting me and talking loudly over me, and told me that he did tell me about the $100 authorization. It was a complete lie, and when he saw that I was getting upset, he changed his story and said he must have told my friend about it on the phone and she didn't pass it along to me. I 100% know she would have told me me something like that, and when I asked her later about it she said that was a lie and he never mentioned ANYTHING about an authorization, much less a $100 one. We went back and forth for about 10 minutes, which consisted mostly of Albert talking to me like I was a 2-year-old and insisting that he was right and I \"didn't remember correctly\". Not once did he apologize for the inconvenience, and whenever he let me speak (a rare occurrence), he rolled his eyes and looked up at the ceiling instead of actually listening to me. After he finally shut up I told him that I came downstairs completely happy and just wanting an explanation, but after being told that my friend was a liar, I apparently had a memory problem, and not being offered one measly apology, I was livid. He shrugged his shoulders like he couldn't care less and that was the end of it. After I informed him that I was going to be writing a negative review on tripadvisor he did say, \"I apologize if you misunderstood about the authorization, but ...\", which is a worthless apology in my book. If you have to threaten the hotel management with a tripadvisor review in order to get a semi-decent attitude out of them, I consider that a hotel I don't want to stay at ever again. He so obviously does not give a crap about the guests of this hotel (read the other reviews that mention the horrendous management!), and his employees looked miserable. In short, this hotel might be adequate, but if you have any problem whatsoever, be ready to want to yank your hair out. I've never experienced such shoddy customer service in my life. I love visiting downtown LA but I can guarantee you I'll never make the mistake of staying at the Biltmore ever again.

My husband was on business for the part of the trip, my daughter and I tagged along. When we booked, I was a little puzzled by the mixed reviews. We booked anyway, and were glad that we did. The common areas of the hotel are truly spectacular, steeped in Hollywood history and maintained beautifully. Our room was fairly large and very comfortable. The beds and bedding were quite nice, the furnishings maybe a little dated but clean and functional, and the bathroom was nicely renovated if not tiny, but I can't say this was a major issue. While my husband was working one morning, my daughter and I spent an hour or so exploring the lobbies, ballrooms, indoor pool, etc. Hotel staff were accommodating in terms of letting us wander around the grand ballrooms. We had a wonderful time taking pictures, speaking to hotel staff, and in general, just soaking it all in. My daughter was completely enchanted. In terms of location, it's downtown LA; by day it's okay, at night and on weekends, a little seedy. Our first full day was on a Sunday and we decided to eat in the area around the hotel but couldn't find anyplace open at 6:30 pm. Being from NYC, this was a bit of a shocker. We ended up at the Rendezvous Court at the hotel, which was the original hotel lobby way back when. It now serves as a tea room during the day, Italian restaurant at night. The food was good, the service excellent, and my then 6-year-old daughter loved dining on a cushy sofa instead of the usual dining chair. Overall, it was a very elegant setting, but child-friendly and easy-going at the same time. Prices were about what you would expect for a hotel restaurant, and my husband and I remarked that the steak was actually cheaper than at Gallagher's Steakhouse at Newark Airport! Most of the negative reviews of this place (at the time we booked) seemed to revolve around the cost of parking ($40/day)and the size of the bathrooms.Not sure who's writing these reviews, because expensive parking in big city hotels is a given. The current charge for parking at New York's Plaza Hotel is $65 a day with no in/out privileges. So, either get over it, park elsewhere, or stay a Day's Inn outside the city with free parking. At least here, as opposed to some other cities, there are other options for cheap parking within walking distance.

When I finally got to the front of the line, the person informed me I had 2 rooms booked under my name, through different booking companies. I booked through Hotwire, and as far as I have been able to tell, I have only been billed once, but this was very alarming to me at the time. I do not know if it was a mistake by the hotel or by the person at the front desk, but it got my weekend off to a bad start. We had a show to catch at the theatre a couple blocks away, so I just grabbed the room key and took off to the show. When I got back from the show, we went up to the room for the first time, only to see that someone else was already in our room, despite the fact that the key worked to open the door.

Parking is ridiculously expensive but behind hotel there are 2 different lots with parking for $10 and $15 per day instead of $45/day.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coppell, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely loved our stay here...lap of luxury!\u201d", "Author": "JulieJ0122", "ReviewID": "UR114795538", "Content": "We moved here after a disastrous checkin at a dive hotel near downtown.

It is a continual annoyance. It started when we arrived and the front desk reported that there was no availability on the 8th, 9th, 10th or 11th floor despite my earlier request. Ahhaaa the front desk man found something...... For $. 50,00 extra per night we could choose for an upgrade to the club member level on the 11th floor. And yes, WiFi was included. In the other rooms you have to pay $. 10,00 (per device!!!) per night extra. We asked for a room with a view and the front desk man found us a wonderful room, he said. We received the key and went upstairs to level 11. There we entered the room. The room was okay, but when we opened the curtains all we saw was another wall. We complained to the front deks and after 30 minutes of waiting we finally received another room. Smaller, no safe (as promised), but with somekind of a view. If you are in a club level room you can make use of breakfast and apatizers and drinks in the evening between 5pm and 8pm. We were very negatively surprised when we heard that my daughter was not allowed in the club member area. The front desk man never mentioned this and I am sure he saw my daughter on ckeck in. Especially since he has three people checked in. Then parking. They very aggresive try to sell you valet parking. Very intrusive they try to pursuade you to pay $. 40,00 per night, \"Otherwise it will still be much more expensive\" they said. When I mentioned that I first wanted to know what my options are, the man became very annoying and and threatened that I should be back soon, otherwise he would remove my car. Finally we parked at the otherer side of the street in a parking near the Hilton. They charge $. 30,00 for valet. There you have no in-and-out privaleges, but who needs that when you are gone all day. I paid $. 10,00 for the night. We had no stamp on our ticket, because the hotel said we did not need that. The man in the parking was very friendly and gave me the discounted Millennium Biltmore price anyway. Tonight I parked my car there again and once again I tried to get a stamp from the hotel and once again they said they never stamp tickets. That is not true because the guy from the parking let me see an example. Tomorrow we will see what happens. When you call the front desk, they always reply with: \"One moment\". Then they leave you on hold for at least 15 minutes. I think they wait till you give up. I forgot to mention their way of \"solving\" problems. My daughter is not allowed in the club lounge where they serve breakfast. So they gave me a voucher for breakfast in a restaurant downstairs. I asked for them (3 vouchers) to slide them under my door. The front desk man promised to do so. The next morning no vouchers. So i went to the club lounge. There I finally received a voucher. I asked for three, since we are staying for three days. No that was not the way to do it, the lady replied. I have to collect my vouchers every day. That is an example of the service level of the Millenniuw Biltmore. Finally the room. Not worth the money. I have seen much better for much less. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone.

I had booked 2 nights in a standard king room with breakfast and parking included. I knew the cost of wireless internet and although agree with most of you that it should be free i did not find it shocking at $10 given the cost of the same in European hotels. Upon check in I asked for a renovated room and was promptly told by the desk clerk that no rooms were renovated because \"this is an historic building\" (except for the flat screen TVs) and besides which he had selected a particularly nice room for me. Down several deserted hallways of the 9th floor, Iarrived at my room which reeked of stale socks and seemed oddly and sparsely furnished with hotel repro. \"antique\" furniture dating probably from the 1980's. It did have a flat screen TV though! Back downstairs at reception I requested a room that didn't smell and they moved me to a room with 2 beds, larger and slightly better furnished, with a view of Pershing square, still stale smelling but not as bad. Another trip downstairs to mention this and to request some tea bags in my room so I could use the little kettle they supply you with. \"With honey?\" they ask. Oh wow, yes please! The solution to the smell was an ionizer which meant I would have to vacate the room for an hour while it was plugged in. Perfect time to go to the gorgeous pool for a nice relaxing swim. And indeed it was relaxing, nary a soul in sight and plenty of clean towels. The only thing was that it was so very bare bones as far as lotions, shampoos, hair products, tea, apples etc...... this functions as a membership club for the public as well as available to hotel guests so I was pretty surprised that it did not supply anything but some rather generic soap and lotion in wall dispensers; The shower in the locker room appeared to be in use by a very dirty person as the water was constantly running. The I saw the sign that it was out of order Only 50 minutes had passed so a spot of sushi at Sai Sai the in house Japanese restaurant, very nice service I might add by Edwin.....limited selection of fish though. Finally back to the room and ready for tea but no sign of tea bags yet . The good news was that the room no longer smelled bad. Call to the reception and no knowledge of my request for tea and was told curtly there was no honey available ever. OK send tea up anyway, please!..It was there in 5 minutes! The bed was very comfortable but i did not sleep well because of the noise of the buses starting up at 6AM. Perhaps I needed to change rooms again ! The following morning, down to Smeraldi's for the inclusive buffet breakfast. But \"oh no\" says the man, where is my coupon? What coupon? So back to reception...oh dear you should have been given one at check-in, well we cant find any at the moment but we will phone over there to let them know it is OK. Back to Smeraldi's for tea and the buffet breakfast. Tea with milk if you don't mind. The tea pots are weird and don't have lids letting all the heat escape. The waiter forgets the tea bags...are they on a mission to save them for the special and reportedly excellent afternoon tea ???They do seem awfully scarce. Finally get a tea bag, steep it for ages as the water was tepid and add milk....oops it curdles. Did i add lemon, asks the waiter. Dah!!!! anyone 1/2 way in their right mind knows you cant add milk and lemon to the same cup of tea. The buffet was very nice though with an omelette station too for those that like that kind of thing I decided not to move rooms again in case i had to go through all the other stuff again so turned on the air conditioning to drown out the sound of the traffic. It worked! I have rambled on enough now and must go...but one more comment about the little bathroom....bathtub had been re-conditioned, you know painted over and was flaking off in one corner, nice! and the toiletries were so generic that one would not imagine being in a 4 star.

Let me start with the positive. The history of this hotel is charming. The common areas are rich in \"old Hollywood history\" and are absolutely stunning. It truly feels like you are stepping back in the 1920's. All of the service I experienced at this hotel was up to par or exceeded expectations. In addition, the cleanliness of both my room and common areas were good to very good. Unfortunately, I still feel that this hotel does not live up to what the Millennium brand is meant to live up to, and therefore, they use \"history\" as an excuse for appearance of the guest rooms. I stayed on Floor 8 in a King room. Let me explain the levels to you. Up through Floor 7 are standard rooms. Floor 8 and 9 are \"upgraded standard rooms\". Floor 10 and 11 are club levels and suites. I was on Floor 8 which is supposedly an upgraded standard room. I was guaranteed a club level room; however, unfortunately at check-in, no such rooms were available. As I walked off the elevator on Floor 8, you could see the hallway carpet was in a truly bad state with the peeling, fading, and fraying. Once I entered my room, I was fairly pleased; however, I would say that Floor 8 should be a standard room. It was clean and spacious. It did have a LCD Flat Panel TV/ MP3 compatible clock radio, a large desk and great lighting. It is ashame to think that Floors 2-7 still do not have these features (which is where I stayed on my last visit). Overall, because of my room on the 8th Floor, my visit was better than last time, despite not being placed in the guaranteed room of my booking. However, Floors 8 and 9 are the minimum for what I would pay for on a standard rate. I would be upset paying more than $100 a night for a room below Floor 8. I can see paying the normal current going rate for Floors 8 and higher. As I said, the common areas are beautiful and the location downtown is good. Parking is $40 with unlimited in and out privileges, which is competitive with the area. If you do want lower priced parking, there is a garage just outside the rear entrance to the hotel (although I'm not sure if that includes in and out). The indoor pool and fitness center are amazing and also throws you back to the 1920's.

I certainly did not find the hallways like something from the movie \"The Shining,\" though there's one large, historic photo of an event in the 1920s, locasted in the lobby hallway, that did remind me of the film (in a good way). There were lots of events, especlly weddings, taking place, but none impacted me at all. As noted, the bar and restaurants are far from cheap, but my dinner in the hotel's Italian restaurant was reasonable for a hotel ($18 for excellent lasagna).

The nice thing about this hotel was the common area. The decor is very nice and to be honest that's what probably attracts visitors to this area. Their bar is also very nice (but very expensive $18 a drink) and customer service was the best at the bar. There was a nice older gentleman assisting us at the bar and he was great! The rest of the staff could take a tip in customer service and work on acknowledging and greeting their customers with a smile. The worst part about this hotel is that people EXPECT a tip, as if what they are doing was going out of their way when actually it's their job. I tip anyway, but their faces seem to beg for a tip. The actual hallways to the rooms were like a scene from \"The Shining.\" Everything was old and looked like it needed some updating. The room itself consisted of one bed, which was very uncomfortable, and one antique armoire which held the T.V. and one nightstand, which was a pain for us given only one person had access to the light. The old fashioned shutters, while gave a nice effect to the room, required dusting and it looked like they had been painted over their dust. There was no mini-fridge in the room so keeping your own refrigerated snacks was not an option. Additionally, the room was very cold and the heat took forever to kick in, while some other colleagues reported theirs not working as well as trouble with flickering lights. The windows themselves have not been replaced so that would explain the noise levels coming from outside and difficulty keeping the room warm. There were no extra blankets provided in the rooms on hand as other hotels would provide. Now, their site says that all rooms are equipped with 1) flat screen t.v.s (false, our room had a boxed older t.v.) 2) mp3 docking station (false, just a telephone) and 3) wi-fi for a fee (No connectivity to the internet in our room, plus the rate would be $10 PER appliance). Additionally, we had to manually turn off the lamps individually, no wall switch to control them which is kind of a pain. The walls were so thin you could hear the elevator bell ringing and people talking as they walked up and down the hallways. The bathroom was the worst hotel bathroom I have seen in a long time. I think hospital bathrooms are nicer. It really looked like they tried to make the interior nice by decorating with a \"nice\" mirror but really, they didn't try hard enough. The paint was awful, the water pressure while I didn't mind it was like you were standing under Niagara Falls, the sink slightly draped over the the bathtub, and one of the mirrors in the bathroom was just plain tacky. They really should have put a mirror in the bedroom because it was difficult for two people to share the mirror in the bathroom. The toilet was old and really needed replacing, no counter space what-so-ever, the bathroom fan looked like it needed replacing, and you could see the outline on the ceiling of an access door. The board rooms where the conferences were held varied from appearance. Of course the Crystal room was nice, spacious with it's balcony seating above. Other rooms however, were UN-AIRCONDITIONED which was awful as the AC was not working. It felt like we were in a sauna since there were so many people in there and we were not allowed to keep the doors open secondary to safety regulations. I was wondering what the hotel staff would have done if someone passed out due to a heat stroke. Their on line site is sketchy. There are no details on where to park. I wonder if that is because valet is $40 a night. And the rooms pictured on their site look NOTHING like the room I stayed in. At the rate of $189 (which was the convention fee price) plus $26 in occupancy fees, I definitely felt better off sleeping at motel 6. If in the area, try the Kyoto Grand. That hotel is A LOT nicer and worth your buck. There are other historical hotels that are able to maintain their historical theme without sacrificing comfort in a MODERN way Overall, my experience with the hotel was poor.

That's a hard lead sentence to follow up, but it's true. We stayed there this past weekend, and were delighted, in every way. Our room was one of the \"club\" rooms on the 10th/11th floors, and it was immaculate, with very elegant furnishings, spotless cleanliness (I couldn't find a speck of mold in the small but bright bathroom), and housekeeping touches that spoke of pride and quality. I was tempted to drop a quarter on the tightly-packed sheets to see if it would bounce but it was too enjoyable to slowly lean back on the soft but firm mattress and many soft pillows! Small toucbhes like a few sheets of actual hotel stationery, table lamps with electrical sockets to plug a cell phone to, and partially-opening outside windows made the room just wonderful. A safe, ironing board, and more (a coffee maker and coffee on request) such as free shoe shining (for Club) and robes. The hotel facilities are beyond description, too: The Club Lounge provides beer/wine and extensive hors d'oerves (some hot) so that we really didn't want dinner, and the breakfast rolls are to die for, with real butter (no nasty little packages), free WiFi and extraordinary coffee. Soft carpets and fresh paint in the halls, and the public rooms and corridors are some of the greatest decorative facilities in America. We most of all loved the aweswome pool in the basement, by the full exercise facility, with actual teak deck lounges, unlimited towels, wonderful steam and sauna rooms, and not a chipped tile or cheap repair to be seen. The staff was wonderful too, from Reception's easy acceptance of my service dog, to the Club Lounge concierge, to the housekeeping staff. Smiles, assistance, and pride were everywhere. Prices? While not in the hostel league, we took advantage of one of the specials on the hotel web site, and found it almost as cheap as a basic hotel. To save money on parking - $40 for valet - we parked in the Pershing Square underground lot for $14, and then entered through the traditional Lobby Court, which is much like Buckingham Palace's entrance must be, except not as small and shabby. If we'd had room for food, Smereldi's was downright budget priced with beautiful food that we saw served in truly elegant surroundings. I don't write gushing reviews; this one is an anomaly, but I actually found myself searching for flaws more and more desperately.

Our friend was flying in from Italy and it being his first trip to America, I did plenty of research in preparation for our visit. I feel I had very realistic expectations and was surprisingly let down pretty much immediately by the front desk staff. I am an experienced traveler and was shocked by how UNwelcoming the reception was, at the time we were their only customer at the counter and were made to feel like a bother AND that we did not have enough money to even be considered clientele for this establishment!!!!! (There was a glitch with one of the credit cards, but entirely because they were trying to charge $2000 over what the correct amount should have been!) In fact, this is the most unwelcome I have ever been made to feel at ANY hotel! My sister didn't even want to deal with them and was ready to go to a different hotel all together (but we stuck it out)! I tried asking a couple of questions about the history of the hotel and the receptionist I asked, just briefly glanced up and said she didn't know and couldn't help me! Her body language spoke volumes about how off-put she was! Working in public relations and customer service, I found the behavior appalling! Other staff at the Biltmore were amazing; housekeeping, door men, and the valets! The building itself is so much more than beautiful architecture, mouldings, painted ceilings, marble floors, and several chandeliered ballrooms . It's a magical palace filled with the stuff Hollywood history and it's dreams are made of! The expression, \"If these walls could talk...\", has never been more accurately used. I HIGHLY recommend visiting this historical monument, but hesitate in advising you to stay over night. Our room was clean, with mediocre furnishings, very comfortable beds, great sheets, and decent towels. I love the feeling of stepping back in time, however, since our room was modernized with a TV and wouldn't of had a TV in the room back in 1923, it's time to upgrade to flat screens. Also, save yourself $40 a day on parking and park 2 blocks away at the Athena Parking Garage for around $10 a day. This hotel is not the best LA has to offer, so I don't know why they act like they are. Really, I am their demographic: someone who can appreciate and is interested in what historical value the Biltmore does have to offer. They were disappointing as a 4 star hotel but exceptional as a museum of politics, dreams, movies, craftsmanship, and great works of art. Furthermore, I will be staying at the Biltmore again but ONLY because it means so much to my Grandmother (who remembers the Biltmore from it's hay day). I pray the staff treat her like the queen she is! If it were up to me, we would probably be staying across the street at the Hilton.

The Old World murals, gorgeous high ceilings with artistic wood and plaster work, and the traditional furnishings qualify this downtown Los Angeles gem as one of the world's great historic hotels. Having said that, I'm not sure I would stay there again. The night I checked in I couldn't make the TV work and called reception. They said they'd sent an engineer, but then called back to say it was the cable company's fault and they couldn't do anything about it. They were waiting for the cable company's visit \"tomorrow.\" I also noticed some fairly obvious deferred maintainance in the room. For instance, the ornamental drape over the bed was held together by a plastic twist tie because the bracket intended for this purpose was broken. I also learned that none of the rooms in the hotel come with mini-fridges, and the in-room safe was useless because it was located on a high shelf in the closet that I could barely reach. The hotel does not have a spa, but does have a fitness center and an indoor pool. I should also mention that my room was on the more expensive Club Floor, but learned that the Club Lounge closes for several hours during the day and at 8pm every night. The staff in the Lounge were not helpful in anyway. The lounge offers one computer with Internet access, continental breakfast, and evening hors d'oevres. I mentioned to two different staff members that my room lacked a robe, slippers, and coffee maker and both of them told me to \"call housekeeping.\" I've traveled enough to know that in a hotel with an attentive staff, they would have taken care of it themselves. Valet parking is $40 a day, which seems excessive, but really it was the staff attitude and the deferred maintainance that bothered me the most. Anyone who decides to stay here should know that room sizes vary widely. I saw a \"standard room\" on a lower floor that was twice the size of mine on the Club Floor (although it had the same small bathroom). I recommend specifying at the time of booking that you'd like one of the spacious rooms - whether Club Floor or Standard. The beds were very comfortable and the bed linens were high quality. The location is also convenient for attending events at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Music Centre. I'm just sorry that staff attitude was so poor.

The advantage of a host hotel is that a shuttle is provided to take runners to the start line at 4 or 5 AM,on race day, so were were willing to pay $180 a night for that safety feature. At check in, we were told, \"no shuttle\". Desk clerks were barely polite, forget welcoming. The hotel is very old, so the old-fashioned rooms were no surprise. The TV provided a laugh; it was a 12 inch box set.. The power on the TV went out several times, but it came back on when he hit the power button again. The TV remote was visibly dirty and had crud on it. I had to wash my hands each time I used it. The bathroom was dirty: the floor had visible water splash spots and was gritty with dirt. The bath tub had a ring of mold in the seams. The pedestal for the sink had a small dark splash of something that could be blood, but that would have been removed with even a cursory wiping... had any cleaning person bothered to do so. The bathtub shower set up had no hand holds with which to steady oneself getting in and out of the tub. I had to grab onto the shower curtain and pray I didn't slip. Before I could even take a shower, I had to call the front desk to send someone to get the shower working. It took two phone calls before someone finally showed up. The faucet was loose and corroded, and the pull knob that starts the shower wasn't working. Maintenance man was polite and professional, he had the strength to jiggle and pull that he got the shower running for me. He said the faucet assembly needed to be replaced and offered to come back later to do that. I asked how long it would take, and he said \"it will take a while\", so I declined. The bedding was clean and fresh, and the beds were comfortable. We were unable to use our laptop computer; in trying to connect to the hotel home page, we got the warning that it is a malware site. There were no vending machines anywhere. The only places within the hotel to eat are three pricey restaurants, but no little snack shop to get coffee or snacks. We ordered room service for lunch, The food came within the 30 minutes promised and was nicely presented and was very good. Cost for a chicken salad and rolls, and a chicken sandwich and soda was $40; that included service charge and gratuity. Server was polite and professional. The hotel was also hosting tryouts for \"America's Got Talent\" TV show, so the hotel lobby were crowded, loud, and chaotic. In fact every time we had to enter and exit through the lobby it was crowded, loud and chaotic. The entry to the hotel for vehicles is narrow and dark, so there is always a delay to wait for a cab or your car to be brought around, and a delay for the vehicles to be able to exit. The valets work hard and really hustle to get your car or cab and load your luggage. Given the poor conditions; they earn their tips. The only staff that was not courteous or friendly was the desk staff. At check in, she was curt and matter of fact. No pleasantry. At check out, he asked my name and kept his head down at the computer until he pushed a paper across the desk at me and said \"there you go\". I had to ask, \"is this my receipt?\" He only nodded yes. No \"thank you\", no \"come again\", nothing. If the lack of amenities, customer service and cleanliness is not important to you, and cost is irrelevant, then you will like this hotel.

After reading some mixed reviews on Tripadvisor I was not sure what to expect. It definitly exceeded my expectations! We arrived early evening and parked in the recommended Pershing Square undergound parking! This is much better than paying the $40 per night valet parking at the hotel. The car park has 24 hour security so did not feel nervous about leaving the car here and is only across the street. We parked on the 2nd level as the 1st is has mostly reserved spaces for a car hire company. You pay each time upon leaving the car park to a dude in a box so it''s better to stay out all day so you only have to pay once a day. The hotel lobby area is really beautiful and the staff were pleasent on check in. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. I agree with some reviews that the bathrooms are a bit aged and can do with an upgrade though this adds to the character of the hotel. I think with most hotels we stayed in during our adventure installing flat screen tv's, this was one thing missing from the room - we only had an old box thing. We only once ate the hotel via room service and was not that badly priced compared to some external restaurants we ate at. I think if I came back to LA I would stay more down the Hollywood end as there is not much to do round downtown. The first night was struggled to find somewhere to eat in the surrounding blocks but found a Wolfgang Puck in the end. Downtown is not a bustling city in the evening like London or New York and there are a lot of wierdos, homeless people hanging around Pershing Square though do not bother you unless you look like a complete tourist! It's not the type of place to walk around at night so better to drive to more populated parts of the city to eat and spend the evening! It's perfectly fine during the day as people are rushing around for work and seems to be a central work hub. Overall not a bad place to stay expecially for the price and as long as you have a car.

As to accessibility to LA, downtown was not very close to all the areas to LA and if I was staying longer than 3 nights I think I would have picked another location. However, as it was I spent most days doing 1 day tours (Universal Studios, Hollywood Homes, Santa Monica and Venice Beach, etc) and it was easy to take Starline tours from this hotel. Bare in mind you need to be there at 8:25am outside the hotel street (50metre walk from the undercover entrance of the hotel) for those tours. Which means you have about 50minutes of hotel hopping before you arrive at Starline to pay the balance of your tickets. There was a Macy's, a jewelry district, a few food places (Mexican for example) and several close convenience stores. Again, based on the purpose of the trip (really just a comfortable hotel to base myself for common tours), I couldn't fault it. There was also a irish pub a bit further down from South Grand Avenue (walk down hill and cross the road, look on your right). The last benchmark for me was the quality of the room. I thought it was above average but moderate to small. The room was a creamy yellow/white, and the carpet was clean but getting a little old. The housekeeping was efficient, never had any problems with fresh new towels (most days I had 3 sets), and bed was always neatly arranged. I slept well in the bed. Concierge and the bellhops were efficient but not \"in-your-face\" which I was glad about. One of them was James, who was very helpful during my stay. Helped me pick the more popular tours (which I later enjoyed). I only ate breakfast once at the hotel, but it was pleasant the 2 guys that attended my table were friendly and helpful about what was available. Frontdesk were also efficient, got smiles from most of them except one lady - but you always get one woman who really doesn't want to be working there. For me, it was not a big distraction compared to my overall pleasant result. Lastly, the place has a nice bar (bit noisy for my liking), and the ceilings were awesome with great detail. All in all, I would recommend this hotel, especially if you're there just for a few days and want something at a reasonable price (72hr special room rate - room only).", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHotel for the stars\u201d", "Author": "FrequentFlyer082", "ReviewID": "UR80011356", "Content": "This place is under rated.

We booked it on expedia after checking out other travelers' advices and balancing out the price (at the time of booking this hotel was the only hotel in downtown that still remains affordable after the sales). This hotel has quite a character to it . Grand Hollywood classic. We took a peek at their ballroom, it is very nice and grand but yet still remain a characteristics vintage look to it. Checking in at the hotel, the hotel looks pretty grand on the outside. We were greeted by friendly , helpful staff at the front desk, going up to our room thru nicely decorated hallway with high vaulted ceiling. So far so good , pleasantly surprised. But then the surprise went downhill from there as we were looking for our room. Thru a long long hallway we finally located our room at the far far far end of the building. We entered with the key but to find ourselves in a small gloomy room with 2 doors - 1 of them is rm 772, our room. We were like \"OK..what now\". Upon opening the door, we've found ourselves in a rm of a reasonable size for a king sz bed rm. The bed is ok (very soft with no back support just like many other hotels). The carpet is so so (my hubby mentioned the carpet might has flea as he felts itchy after walking barefoot). The air conditioning was acceptably noisy but effectively cold. However the room does not have the amenity you usually find in even a lower grade hotel; there is no fridge/freezer, no internet (they charge you for a fee though at $11/night or something). It is quite disappointing. The most ridiculous find - the TV, a 15\" tube projection, it is an antique - just like the hotel itself!! The washroom is very spacious, but I wish it has an exhaust fan, the toilet bowl is clean with no pee stain ring, and a fixture that provides enough counter space for the guests to spread their necessities. Parking - it is a HUGE problem. Upon arriving at the hotel (we flew in from Vancouver, rented a car at the airport), we were shocked to learn that the hotel offers valet parking for a whooping $44 overnight. You can find park it yourself for $16 /night at the Perishing Square underground parking across the street, or if you can walk for 1/2 a block, you can find it cheaper for $12/night at a public parking on Oliver Street. It is monitored, bright, well-lighted - many exotic cars tend to park there overnight, so security gotta be good. Location - in the heart of LA downtown. Close of transit and train station. Reasonably close to many LA attractions and highways.

You could spend the whole weekend in the hotel and not get bored - multiple restaurants, shops, amenities - the dining can't be beat, and love that there is variety of tastes to choose from.

The Biltmore has several locations for dining, all different types of cuisine: La Bistecca has exquisite dinner entrees and desserts. The servers are welcoming, polite, and on top of their game. I never had to ask for anything - they were always two steps ahead of me. Smeraldi's Restaurant has an excellent breakfast menu and an excellent breakfast buffet. The servers are here are also run the restaurant well. Dinner at Sai Sai was another excellent experience. The food is cooked just right, preparation was rather quick, and the display was one of a kind - one of the best dining experiences I've had for Asian cuisine. The lounge connected to the lobby has a full bar, menu, and sitting area where you can just relax with cocktails. I went on a Friday evening once and there was live Jazz til 2 AM. The cocktails were delicious, and with complimentary bar snacks. If you're looking to visit the Biltmore but don't plan to stay, visiting one of the restaurants or the lounge is worth the visit alone.

You could do no better than Room 480 in the Millenium Biltmore Hotel; the perfect room to end everything.

The room itself appears clean, but it's SO depressing and in bad need of being brought up into this century. More dark cream dingy walls and dark, dated patterned carpet decor. I don't know about you, but the first thing I do whenever I walk into a hotel room is look out of the window at the view, which, bearing in mind one was in a big city like L.A., didn't seem too bad. For some strange reason the sash window was covered in chicken wire on the outside, eventhough I was on the fourth floor. I undid the lock and tried to open the window but it was stuck rigid, and when I removed my hands they were black with dirt from the window top which had obviously not been cleaned or dusted in a very long time. Very frustating as I hate having to use air conditioning. The bathroom and bedroom basics were clean, but lurking in the corner of the bedroom was a vile faded armchair which I had no intention of using during my stay there. Even the dark cream shelves for one's clothing were old, scratched and uninviting, and made me feel that I didn't really want my clothing to touch the surfaces. In conclusion, a truly ghastly room.

There are bus stops on every corner outside the hotel and the underground train station is across the street, you can get to Hollywood in about 20 mins and one day we took the bus to Anaheim to go to Disneyland.

We had a wonderful 5 night stay and we were so glad that we didn\u2019t go with a more modern, contemporary chain. This hotel is breathtakingly beautiful and the details of its design truly take you back in time. It was opened in the 1920s and it\u2019s where they used to hold the Oscars in the 30s and some of the 40s\u2026it\u2019s actually where the Oscars were created and where Shirley Temple won Best Actress. There is so much history and background to it and you can totally feel the history as you walk around and see all of the old photos. It\u2019s like you are back in Hollywood\u2019s Golden Era. And we loved the location; very close to LA Live and within walking distance to plenty of local restaurants and fun bars. Other reviews mention that downtown is a \u201cghost town\u201d after business hours, but we had a great time when we went out there. And we had no trouble at all getting out to the beach and to Hollywood to see things there. I guess because it is so old, the AC wasn\u2019t the best. But it wasn\u2019t enough to be a big deal. It was just that the housekeepers would turn it off to save energy during the day, so it was warm when I came back in the evening. And the staff was awesome! There was one male bartender we didn\u2019t care for, but we all have wonderful things to say about the rest of the staff. We didn\u2019t have a single bad thing to say about our stay after we left. If you are brave, you can ask the bar staff about the many ghost stories they have there! But if you are like me and your imagination likes to take over\u2026I don\u2019t recommend it!

I was honestly disgusted, these women were being very obvious and the hotel hadn't done anything to send them away. After we went back to our room, we settled down and went to sleep, only to hear the blaring TV of the room next to us and the loud traffic. Thank GOD the hotel gives complimentary ear-plugs because we sure used them. The next night seemed to be the opposite, they had a worker walking around the corridor where the hookers were and the street traffic seemed to be much quieter so we were able to sleep. It was very odd to see the two extremes. There were many downsides to this hotel, but I did enjoy it as well. They have a computer in the lobby that you can use so you don't have to pay for internet, there is a printer there as well.

Some of the reviews were negative and I will admit, they almost swayed me to look elsewhere. I decided on this one afterall because of the smokin' deal I got. I booked through Travelocity about a month and a half in advance and paid fifty/night. That's unheard of in L.A., even sketchy parts of L.A. (which is most of L.A.). My friend and I drove in from Phoenix for a TV show taping and we stayed two nights. The hotel is in the middle of downtown L.A. It's the ideal location for a business traveler. Upon arrival, we were forced to circle the block to get to the entrance because the valet entrance was coned off (just during morning/evening rush hours). We were immediately greeted by the friendly valet. Check in was simple. The hotel is as majestic as it seems. For all of the patrons who complain of it being old, it is old! It's historic! But, it's well maintained. I booked a double standard room. However, when we got to the room, it was a double suite! No one mentioned an upgrade and I forgot to ask! The beds were small (but I'm used to a Queen) and kind of hard but it's all personal preference. No bedbugs, as I've read from some reviews. It was very clean. The bathroom is small but sufficient. The water pressure was amazing (some reviews show it to be weak). We had a fabulous room. We were at the end of a long hall, our room facing another part of the building. We had zero outside noise. We were on the 4th floor. We never heard anyone. The vending machine is expensive (bring your own drinks) and I never saw an ice machine but I'm sure they have at least one! One night we walked a few blocks to an IHOP to eat and it appeared safe. The area is surrounded with chic, city living apartment buildings. Around the corner from the IHOP was a Ralph's grocery store which was convenient. Traveling into Hollywood took about 15 minutes, depending on traffic (which is NEVER predictable). Valet was forty four dollars/night but it's really the most convenient way to park because you have in/out privileges. I never saw the public parking & even then there's a fee and no in/out privileges. We had our own car so I didn't pay close attention so I don't know if I saw public transportation. Keep in mind this is downtown and it's busy during week days and weekend days. Lots of pedestrians, that move at their own pace (at crosswalks). But, I noticed this is the norm in L.A. So, overall, a trip to L.A. requires patience! We only saw probably 1/4 of the hotel and it was amazing. If I could get an awesome deal again, I'd stay there every time. Take away points- For the budget conscious, there is no free parking, no free breakfast, no fridge/microwave, no in room safe. But, it does include a iron/ironing board, a typical hotel hair blow dryer (I bring my own but my friend tried to use theirs and it died on her), non-labeled toiletries and a small TV (who really goes to watch TV?).

However I have decided to write the review again as I think reading a review like this would have helped me to make a better decision when booking a hotel in LA. This hotel was recommended to me by a friend who had stayed here in 2008. The hotel itself is beautiful and full of history, the bus driver on one of our tours called it a 'world class hotel' The room was big, with 2 single beds and a really comfy armchair and footstool. The front desk staff were very helpful with instructions and directions. We ate on the evening of Thanksgiving in the bar (having raced down to our booked restaurant at LA Live to find it closed ) and the lady serving us was absolutely lovely and the food delicious. It was right beside the metro which was great for getting to Hollywood and Universal. However, beware, we came out the wrong door of the station one evening and it took us 50 minutes to find the hotel, thru some really dodgy areas :-( The huge let-down for me in this hotel was the location, based on the fact that we didn't have a car. As mentioned, the metro was great for Universal and Hollywood, but that's about it. You are stuck in the middle of Downtown, even the bus driver on our tour offered to drop the Biltmore guests in Hollywood as \"there is nothing to do around here\" We got the number 16 bus out to Century City on our last day and to say it was an uncomfortable ride would be an understatement - we got shouted at when we got on for - lets just say - not fitting the profile of the usual people who travel on this bus so felt very unwelcome, and journey went on forever. When we were finished shopping we got a cab all the way back to Hollywood rather than get on that bus again. We booked a shuttle with the hotel to get back to the airport and it turned up 30 minutes late and then brought us all around the city picking up other people (with a driver that didn't seem to have a clue where he was going) We ended up nearly missing our flight. So in summing up, this is a lovely hotel and if you have a car I would definitely recommend it, however, if you are relying on public transport, I would stay in Hollywood or Santa Monica. And don't use the airport shuttle!

Yes, parking is $40 and internet access is $10 - which is truly disappointing considering patrons are paying top dollar for services a seasoned traveler would think was standard. One would hope that some of the money went towards a face-lift in renovating the room decor. Some people may refer to it as classic, while others would say, just plain old. The TV in the room was uh...hmm...small and incredibly out-dated. I understand premium rooms may have flat panel TV's, but the standard room has a TV so small and so old, you would have thought the hotel would be embarrassed to even feature it. I know I was a little embarrassed watching it. I have to admit though, it was a little funny to see. The hotel offers a decent variety with respect to cable channels, but the digital feed was a little choppy at times. But heck, this stuff happens at home too, so I shouldn't complain too much. The level of service was on par of a hotel this size and supposed history. Nothing super but clearly not a flaw. Our room was clean and relatively noise-free, so I cannot relate to other patrons who complained about the thickness of the walls. We did however, smell a lot of marijuana use on our floor. And unfortunately not one day, but a few days. Wait. Is that good or bad??? At least the night manager (James) was kind enough to comp 2 night's of parking. It alleviated some of the disappointment of staying there. Clearly everyone here should take the advice of others and the PR Manager for the hotel by parking at Pershing Square. Clearly a bargain, but shoddy neighborhood, especially at night. Don't park too far from the hotel would be my advice. The only question I leave for the hotel and others to consider is: Why leave these little place cards on the bed each morning about the laundering of linens schedule? My guess is because the hotel is cutting back on services and cannot afford to continue doing such service without passing off the cost to the patron? Then why nickel and dime on the parking, internet, and fridge services? So much hope for a nice stay, but left disappointed. BUYER BEWARE, read up on their hotel services before committing.

There is no argument that the Biltmore truely is a beautiful, grand old hotel. When you walk into the lobby it's hard not to be impressed with all that you see before you. It's like stepping back to a bygone era of elegance and refinement. BUT... if you want to stay in a hotel that has the history, the elegance and the beauty of the Biltmore you have to just accept that your room isn't going to fitted out with modern furnishings and the layout of the bathroom isn't going to make the most of the space. Like most hotels, the Biltmore has rooms of varying standards. Those who are fortunate enough to enjoy a stay on the top two floors (floors 10 and 11) will no doubt be scratching their heads at the reviews left by those who stay on the lower floors. These are their Club Rooms and they have more soundproofing on the walls and windows. The windows also have quality drapes that help keep the sound and light from outside down to a minimum. The furnishings in these rooms is a little grander and the carpets a bit newer. Floors 1 to 9 are the cheaper floors and it shows. They have timber plantation shutters on the windows that do very little to keep out noise and light. There are no drapes at all. The placement of the bed is 10-12 inches from the window, which only compounds the noise and light problems. There is no soundproofing between the rooms and although I didn't hear a great deal of noise from the room nextdoor to mine, I believe this has been an issue for some people. You won't find modern furnishings this hotel, instead you find simple but elegant furniture that is in keeping with the ear of the hotel. Our room, on the 9th floor, and all of the others I saw during our stay, were furnished with a desk, a large comfortable bed, a chair, a large set of drawers and a LCD tv. Our room had a huge closet but I understand this may vary in some of the rooms. The bathroom feels a little cramped but only because of the huge original old tub. Remember the days when tubs were deep enough that you could soak up to your neck and long enough that you could lay back with your legs stretched out? These are the wonderful kind of tubs you get at the Biltmore and they are devine after a long day of sightseeing in L.A.! Yes, you need to pay extra for wifi access in your room. It's $9.95 for 24 hours, but how many good quality hotels provide it free in a standard room booking? Not too many that I know of. In my experience you only find free wifi (and usually breakfast too) on offer in the budget hotels. It's how they pull in customers. There are so many great things about staying at the Biltmore. The food in the hotel restaurants is good and not overly expensive, the location is fantastic - there is a subway on the next corner and the staff were all friendly and helpful but I think the very best thing about staying here is wandering around the public areas of the hotel. There are numerous old photographs that are well worth seeing, including many taken during some of the Academy Awards presentations held at the hotel, and some magnificent ballrooms that are works of art. There was a wedding reception being held in one of the ballrooms during our stay and the room looked stunning. We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and for the most part, I was really happy with the hotel. It's an experience I won't soon forget and I feel I'm lucky to have stayed in the same hotel as so many famous Hollywood stars from years ago. However, I wouldn't stay there again. I say that only because of the windows. If they removed the shutters (or even put them on the outside which would keep the same look) and put up blockout drapes in ALL the rooms it would make a huge difference and I'd be recommending this hotel to everyone as a 'must stay' location. If you can afford the extra dollars, book a room on the top two floors.

Noise from the street was audible in the room (in fact, they had a pair of ear plugs on the night stand) Not particularly luxurious in the room itself; but sufficient and clean. Hallway seemed a bit worn and the lighting was dull. OVERALL: For the money, I'd say this is a good deal for downtown Los Angeles. The hotel has a lot of character and, in my opinion, it means you will not forget your stay here as easily as a typical chain hotel. However, I am a bit disappointed that the rooms were not remodeled better and that the hotel has not resolved the issue of noise being audible in rooms. I've stayed in other historic hotels that have not had this issue (i.e. Reed House, Chattanooga, TN) and were remodeled better. So, I think there are ways for this hotel to improve itself. That said, price paid to value received was fair. So, I can recommend this to travelers. RECOMMENDATION: To avoid the exorbitant parking charges ($45/nt), I highly recommend parking at the Pershing Square garage. It is only $16. So, you save a lot of money in parking.

LA has a lot of unique hotels, but few as Grand as the Biltmore. What sealed the deal was a two fold deal we got on the room. First the regular rate they were running at the time was excellent for this level of hotel, and they have a \"72 Hour\" rate, if you book within 72 hours of arrival the rate is discounted further, couldn't beat it. As far as the hotel: 1. This hotel is a monument to an earlier time when hotels were grand. The Academy Awards, Emmys, and Grammys have all been held here, in addition to several after-parties. The night we stayed the Dalai Lama was having a press conference in one of the ballrooms. The history and grandeur of the hotel is unmatched. The public rooms, lobby, etc are in perfect condition despite their age. It is very impressive and enjoyable. 2. The rooms themselves seem to get some mixed reviews here. Over the years of using sites like TripAdvisor I have learned to read between the lines of reviews and rely more on user photos than what is actually said. People comment on how historic this hotel is and then complain how small the bathrooms are. (Sorry, that comes with the territory in historic older buildings). Yes, they are small, but they are amazingly well kept. I marvel at the little things like the original doorknobs throughout that are still used and look great. Or the real porcelain tubs that are in perfect condition. Or the solid marble floors, the 10\" floor molding, and on and on. These rooms are historic and in amazing condition. The carpets looked brand new, the entire room was immaculate. Some complain that the rooms are plain, again they are beautiful and appear to be set up as they would have been years ago when this Grand Dame was built. The only complaint about the room is though the beds are very comfortable, and all the linens were very clean, the thread count on the sheets did not match up to the quality of the room. The TV was a brand new 42\" flat screen, very nice. The best way to describe the furniture in the room is \"regal\". This furniture could have been in the presidential suite and not looked out of place. Some also complain about paper thin walls, this one baffles me. I know when this hotel was built, and these walls are \"not\" thin. We did not here a thing from any adjacent room or from the hallway. You must realize though that this is a downtown hotel in LA, you do hear some traffic noise. 3. Pool area is spectacular, a classic. But understand again what that means.....it is not large, it does not have water slides, etc. It is a pool from a day gone by that does not show it's age. Again, interested and fascinated by the details, the steamer chaise lounges are something you would have found on the Titanic, but look brand new. There is a jacuzzi (that is absolutely tiny in today's standards but again in perfect condition), a wet sauna, a dry sauna, and a very sizable work out room with high end equipment. 4. We stayed on the Club floor which entitled us to access to the Club Lounge. We took advantage of the evening snacks and beverages, and then again had breakfast there. Both had an excellent selection, not extensive, but plenty to choose from and very good quality. The scones with French cream were amazing. The other highlight for us (diehard Beatles fans that we are) is that near the elevators on the Club floor is the door to the Heliport on the roof. This is the exit the Beatles had to use to escape the crowds in the lobby below when they stayed here. (The Dalai Lama, the Beatles, and Walt Disney, among others.......how did we rate to stay here?) 5. The restaurants all look awesome, though very high end, but we did not get a chance to try them. 6. We were only there one night, so we did not have much need for service from the hotel staff. But the check in was quick and seemless. The valet was extremely friendly and accommodating. When we arrived, we were going to check in and then immediately leave for dinner. They had no problem holding our car aside for us, even though they are working with a very confined mid-city location. 7. Overall what did I love? Original and well maintained public spaces-I felt like royalty. Original double hung windows, door knobs, moldings, light fixtures, and furniture that take you back in time, but don't look any older than when they were installed. Perfect downtown location. Great service when we needed it. The sense of history and grandeur. 8. What didn't I like? The quality of the bed linens (they were clean, just very low thread count) The $45/night valet charge. (But honestly, it is downtown LA, parking everywhere is at a premium). The fact that we were not told that access to the Club Lounge is limited to 2 guests/room and any additional guests are $25/person. The food was good but not substantial enough for an additional fee.

It's definitely like stepping into the past and no Hotel chain could today try to recreate the grandiose, charm and style of the lobby, open hallways, crown molding, stairways with banisters that aren't enclosed in concrete, etc. It's very cool just entering the place. Overall, my room was \"just OK\". Nothing spectacular, but nothing too negative (except the lame TV) to complain about enough to really tell someone else not to stay here. The carpet in the hallways, while worn and a bit stained, doesn't look as tired and dirty as it did \"charming\". My room was 54something. It was a winding walk to the elevators. The hallways can be like mazes, but that's cool to me. The window in my room could be opened and with its big wooden panes, it felt like grandma's house! My room was basic and simple. Bed comfortable. Good pillows. The TV in the armoire seemed straight from 1990. No kidding. But, it came with cable, a working remote, and at least was in color -- it was just it was a bit far away from the bed and probably a 17\" 'er. The bathroom was small, slightly dingy, but still, had character hard to recreate. Not much space to put your toiletries on, though. Towels were pretty dated. Hairdryer...shampoos, etc. all provided. I appreciated the updated cooling system and generally crank it to create \"white noise\" to mask outside noises -- I could still hear street noise and what sounded like the beeps of a backing up trash truck occasionally thorughout the night, though. I found the staff to be professional and helpful. However, when I did get to my room I found it odd that the chair & ottoman were shoved up against the bed blocking the one nightstand on one side of the bed and there was a silly roll-away cot set up in the free open space where the chair should be. I had to call down to the front desk to make sure the cot wasn't something they thought i requested and especially something I would be paying extra for (which resulted at first in some confusion that I WANTED a cot to be brought up). After she finally understood that I didn't want the cot right there in my room, they sent someone within 20 minutes to come get it. Kinda weird, but only a minor inconvenience. The price was fine. Parking is valet only and a whopping $40/day. But, this is a city. It is a city that sleeps though and if you are from out of town, there's not much going on in Downtown LA during the weekend like you find in other major US cities.

It is gorgeous, the rooms are comfy and clean, and it really feels like you are getting to stay in part of the history of LA. The price was very reasonable for the quality of the hotel. BUT The day we arrived there was some kind of MASSIVE event being hosted there (maybe a talent show). The whole place was crowded with teenagers, and I really do mean packed. We walked into very tired (and grumpy) from our journey to a very loud and packed lobby and could barely see the check in desk through the crowd of teens coming and going. There was also a herd of people about 6 deep waiting for the elevators. I have been to hotel/conference centers etc. before, but have never previously felt like my enjoyment of a hotel was so severely impacted by its other activities. No the hotel shouldn't be expected to babysit its guests, but equally it does need to take responsibility for the comfort of all guests. Things that could have been done to improve our stay would particularly have included letting use use the service elevator to get to the room with our bags as we clearly couldnt fight our way into the standard elevators with them in the crowd, or implementing some kind of queueing system or reserving one carriage for guests not involved in the event. It would also have been nice if one of the staff had informed the teens when their behaviour was unreasonable (e.g. there was a group of boys practicing their drumming routine in the lobby the entire time we were checking in, and I couldn't believe a) that they thought it was appropriate in a public place, or b) that the staff didn't realise that this might be unpleasant for other guests and put a stop to it). I initialy thought this may be a one off incident, but the next day the lobby was in similar chaos, and the talent competition had gone and been replaced with some kind of graduation party, so I really dont understand why the hotel wasn't better equipped to handle these situations. Given the scale of the event and the impact that it had on our quiet enjoyment of our hotel room, I actually think that the hotel should have put up a warning about the talent event on its website for these dates, as it really isn't something you expect and does seriously affect other guests looking for a quiet place to stay.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cThe most under rated hotel in Los Angeles\u201d", "Author": "lucyl0ve", "ReviewID": "UR46003670", "Content": "I had no idea what to expect of the Biltmore but my god, did it go above and beyond my expectations.

That morning, we checked out by 7:30am and had the hotel hold our bags in the front and left our car at the hotel. We were done by noon and retrieved our bags and car and was on our way.

The public areas are magnificent. Beautifully restored and elegant. When was the last time you wandered around the hotel? Here you will want to. I applaud them for keeping the property so polished. My room was very large with a roomy living room section. A huge walk-in closet; separate vanity section and long entrance hallway. The windows do open (which I loved) and unlike other posters, provided no outside noise to keep me up. The way the floors are laid out, you can have a very long walk from the one set of elevators to your room. I didn't mind myself, but if you are a guest with problems walking ask ahead of time. The gym was good quality and the pool area was memorable. They restore the 1920s pool and bathing area to great effect. Also locker rooms, showers, sauna and steam available. Nice feature and all complimentary for guests. Most of the staff was wonderful: The parking valets, the bellman, the houseman, the waiters at Smeraldis (a nice restaurant in the lobby) and the man at the coffee stand were always cheery, friendly and accomodating. The problem is the front desk staff and the club lounge employees. I went to the front desk three times total. Each time no other guest was there. Each time no one looked up to acknowledge me. No one ever offered a smile, a greeting, anything. Now they don't need to become my friend, but it can be pricey to stay there. Checking in, my clerk mumbled about my room not being ready (at 4PM) and did I want him to block me to another room. Since I am not an expert on their room types, how am I suppose answer that? I asked if I should choose another and his answer was \"another room wouldnt be as good\". Not exactly what you want to hear upon arrival. So I waited an hour. The club lounge was nice, but the service was really spotty. The concierge and the waiter were usually involved in conversation. Two long discussions about another employee and uniform problems shouldn't be forced upon the hotel guests. ANother night I came up to use the lounge's computer (which is a lovely feature) and had to wait 15 minutes while the waiter looked some things up online. Another incident is asking the concierge about how the subway system works in LA and her responding \"none of us use that\". Okay, that is fine. But you are working in a hotel where guests MIGHT use it. Behavior of these employees really made for a poor impression of the hotel.

The parking is expensive but you can park across the road in Pershing square for 12 dollars during the week and 5 dollars at the weekend, it beats the 40 dollars that the hotel charges.

Yesterday, a shocking charge to my credit card appeared on my billing statement--one that truly brings the ethics of this establishment into question. In August, a full four months after the stay, my credit card billing statement reflected a charge of $645.00 from the Bilmore Hotel relating to that stay. This was inexplicable as my trip was fully prepaid to the travel agent. At hotel check-in I was asked for my credit card number to cover incidental charges that were not the responsibility of the travel agency (certainly a routine request). Upon check-out, I agreed to approximately $80 in incidentals (which was billed to my credit card and promptly paid by me the next month). I never dreamed another $645.00 charge would appear on my credit card months later. I immediately called the hotel and spoke to someone in the accounting department. They contend that the travel agent refused to pay their bil, so the hotel is billing the clients of the company for three of the seven nights of the stay. The above action outrageous, not to say legally baseless. Instead of resolving the dispute with the travel agency, the Biltmore has seen fit to try to squeeze some of the money due them from the travel agent out of their innocent guests. We entered into no contract with the hotel and have no liability for these charges. When I handed my credit card number over to the front desk, it was for the express purpose of paying the incidentals, with the understanding that the rest of my bill was fully satisfied. While I don't rescind my positive impression of the aesthetics and service of the Biltmore, I certainly question the integrity of hotel management and will not stay there in the future.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOlder hotel, a little worn but classy\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoTony", "ReviewID": "UR36640994", "Content": "Room was plenty big except for the small bathroom.

Oh well we can wait until breakfast we thought! Our hotel room was supposed to be non smoking, but the aroma told us otherwise! Oh well, it\u2019s only for a night we thought!

I picked the Biltmore because I love the old-style grand hotel, plus its location is very convenient for our sightseeing purpose. We wanted to stay in downtown so that we can tour the Historic Core buildings (1920s) of LA. We also had tea one afternoon at the Rendezvous Court. The public areas are simply gorgeous. The Rendezvous Court, the Italian Gallery, the Gallery Bar, the Lobby - everything screams old Hollywood. Our room is a Jr Suite with King bed, overlooking Pershing Square. The suite is big, at least 500 sq ft. It has a sitting area with sofas and coffee table, plus TV armoire. The bedroom section is very large, with a writing table and another TV armoire. I would say that the room is both old-style and just plain old. The 2 TVs in the room are still the old Magnavox CRT, hidden inside the armoires. The bathroom itself can really use a complete re-do. The sink/vanity is outside of the bathroom. The vanity, instead of standard hotel's marble or granite countertop, it is still the old tiled version. Amenities include a coffee maker, iron/ironing board, bathrobe/slippers, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion. No in-room safe and no mini-bar. Our room faces East right onto Pershing Sq, which brings up my major complaint. It is noisy. We are not used to city noise, and the buses which pass by Perhsing Sq are quite loud. It doesn't help that the hotel windows are really old too. I bet if they replace the windows with new soundproof ones, it will be much better. We have access to the Club Lounge, which offers a good breakfast buffet and the setting is very nice too. While we didn't have a car, we were informed that parking rate is $40/night. I think one can park for much cheaper in the Pershing Sq garage across the street. What I like about the location is proximity to subway station (1 block), and on the weekend, the Weekend Downtown Discovery route operated by the DASH (LA DOT) runs right pass the hotel with a stop across the hotel on 5th street. For just $0.25, you can have a hour-long tour of downtown.

Built in the early 1920's, the decor and construction of the common areas reflect the opulence of the period and show an incredible attention to detail. The service is very good. If a bit more attention were paid to the maintenance of the rooms, it would make for an wonderful experience. My wife and I stayed at the Biltmore for Valentine's day weekend. Although we live in Los Angeles, I thought it would be a nice treat. Overall, we weren't disappointed. We really enjoyed our stay. We paid $169 per night for two nights in a king room on the Club Level. I thought it was a good bargain. Had the suites been more reasonably priced, I might have opted for that, but they wanted somewhere in the neighborhood of $450 per night, so I passed. Common Areas: Most of the common areas in the Biltmore are breathtaking. We entered through the Rendezvous Court, then up the staircase, past the elevators, through the Concourse, and into the Lobby to check in. I had been in the Biltmore before, but each of these areas had my wife looking around in wonder. The bar, ballroom, and other meeting rooms are also elegant and worth a look. The Club Level lounge was great. Although we weren't able to make it for the afternoon hors d'oeuvre, the breakfast was nice. Eggs, potatoes, pastries, fruit bowls, and parfaits. The decor was elegant and pleasant, with a good view of the city. The only common area I would say I was disappointed with was the pool, not because it wasn't nice, but because of the wasted potential. The pool itself is incredible. Great Neptune themed tilework, brass (I assume) railings surrounding the pool and the brass around the windows, the columns; it's a fantastic room. Unfortunately, they decided to put all the workout equipment in the areas surrounding the pool. It's all visible through the windows. It completely shatters the illusion. If the windows were mirrored, or the equipment were in some other way hidden from view, being in that pool room would be like being transported into the Great Gatsby. It's an opportunity for a unique experience that, unfortunately, isn't realized. The room: The room reminded me of staying in my 90 year old great aunt's house. Everything was quality, but old, which isn't necessarily bad, but lacked attention. We had a king room. The bed was comfortable. The furniture was faux antiques. Not anything amazing, but certainly much better than standard hotel furniture, and it was in keeping with the overall decor. The bathroom had nice period fixtures and was pleasant and adequate. The big problem with the room was the lack of maintenance. It wasn't horrible, but it could have been much better. The main problem was the dust. As another commenter wrote, the canopy over the bed and the curtains are both dust magnets, and should be cleaned frequently. I'm sure this isn't happening. On our last morning, I looked above the canopy and saw at least a couple of months worth of dust collected up there. While it didn't bother me terribly, my wife is allergic, and it really annoyed her. She could tell it was dusty, and we ended up sleeping with our heads at the foot of the bed. There are other maintenance issues as well. The curtains had tears on both sides at the point where the rod ends, no doubt due to years of friction. They need to be replaced. There was also a crack in the paint above the molding. It wouldn't take much to fix it. If these issues were sorted out it would bump up the Biltmore experience tremendously. Service: The service was good. The woman who took my original reservation over the phone was very pleasant and helpful. Check-in and check-out were fine. Someone dropped the ball on one request I had, though. I had asked for down free bedding when I reserved, and reconfirmed this a couple of days before check-in. It wasn't done. A phone call to room service and someone was up within ten minutes, but it should have been done right from the start. One thing I was impressed with: the hostess at the lounge asked me how I was enjoying my stay. When I mentioned about the dust, she immediately asked my room number and was going to send someone to clean. Unfortunately, we were checking out within a couple of hours, so it didn't help me, but the attitude was great. It should have occurred to me to call and have the dust cleaned earlier. I'm sure they would have taken care of it. Overall: Again, stunning common areas. Good service. Reasonable rates. More attention to details in the rooms would make the Biltmore a unique and unforgettable experience.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Quality in Downtown LA\u201d", "Author": "GT05", "ReviewID": "UR24156613", "Content": "Top Notch Quality in Downtown LA My mate and I (both in our early 20's) stayed here in December of '08 on our first stop on a round the world trip. We were extremely happy with our stay at the Millennium Biltmore. We stayed in a Classic Room with two double beds. This included a work desk, a free safe, a TV, a lounge chair and a coffee maker. The room was clean and well maintained with a nice elegance to it. The bathroom was a little small and basic, but was still clean and all that was required. The shower/bath water lacked a little bit of water pressure, but it still did the job. Amenities were also on offer. The hotel also includes a beautiful basement pool and spa, as well as a decent gym and what seemed like a very hot sauna, all of which are free to guests of the hotel. Along with this they offer free locker use and free toiletries (deodorant, toothbrush and toothpaste). Too make this already elegant hotel even more attractive to us was that Expedia was offering a great discount for the days we were staying, sealing the deal. There were a couple of detractions from this hotel and they include the prices of extras inside the hotel itself. This encompasses the restaurant, bar, gift shop, valet parking and internet service. As one other reviewer has mentioned already, you can get around the valet parking issue by parking in nearby self park carparks, just like you can go to a couple of the restaurants nearby for a meal if concerned about prices. Subway, McDonalds, Carls Jnr., KFC, Cafe Rossini (cheap breakfast place along Olive Street just a couple of doors down from the hotel) and other more upper class restaurants can be found nearby, just ask at the front desk. You can also get around the cost of the internet service by going next door to Pershing Square (the park) and using the free community service. Be warned, there are homeless people who do use the shelters of Pershing Square to keep covered during the night, but you\u2019ll have no issues if you use this service during the morning. This brings me to the second detraction, the location. This hotel is in downtown LA and really if you\u2019re looking for the excitement of Hollywood at your doorstop, here is not for you. Though, I found it extremely easy to buy a train ticket on the red line and travel to Hollywood and back and would suggest it may be just as easy as staying in Hollywood. The other thing with downtown LA is that it appears to have slightly a bad name. Let me spell it out, this hotel is NOT in anyway in a dirty area that has violence or unlawful acts happening extremely nearby it. I\u2019m sure it happens around most areas, but with this being said, during my time in downtown LA, I was never concerned or worried when walking along the streets at times near midnight. I did get asked for spare change from homeless people many times, but was never threatened or anything like that. I am a male though and I could understand if a female might feel unsafe. That brings me to the hotels redeeming features. As I previously said, the red line allows for easy access to Hollywood, as it also does to Union Station. My mate and I caught the Flyaway Bus from LAX to Union Square and then the Red Line train to Pershing Square Station, walked about 100m and arrived at the hotel. And all this for $7USD, how much cheaper could you ask for. The trains in LA are underrated in my mind and so not many people use them and so normally they\u2019re easy to get a seat, pretty safe, clean and frequent. There are also a number of buses that I watched go past the hotel so getting around shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue. I also have spoken about the restaurants around the area and should mention that there are Bank of America ATM\u2019s on the other side of Pershing Square to the hotel, which are convenient. Now finally, I can\u2019t write a review on this hotel without making reference to the beautiful lobbies, halls and dining rooms. They are simply stunning and take your breath away the first time you enter. As a young guy who hasn\u2019t seen too many stunning hotels, this was just amazing and really is spectacular. If you\u2019re curious about the history of the hotel, ask at the front counter about it and they\u2019ll give you some documents detailing the history of the hotel as well as what movies the Biltmore has been a part of. Also, take a walk down their Hall of Fame which houses the pictures of when they housed the Academy Awards. It\u2019s just all so grand. I\u2019ve also attached a couple of pictures for perspective guests. The Millennium Biltmore was a lovely hotel and a privilege to stay at and upon returning to Los Angeles, I will most certainly be attempting to stay at the Biltmore.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fortaleza, CE", "Title": "\u201cAtmosphere and comfort\u201d", "Author": "Sutter", "ReviewID": "UR23545936", "Content": "We stayed one night shortly after Christmas, largely in order to be close to Union Station for a morning Amtrak departure.

When I travel, I always request a corner room on a top floor. In addition, if a concierge or club level is available, this is what I reserve. We traveled to Los Angeles for our son's wedding on New Year's Eve. The bride had blocked rooms at the Kyoto Grand, however gave several other choices including the Millennium Biltmore, Westin Bonaventure, and Standard. We chose the Biltmore for nostalgic reasons given its history and are happy that we did. Upon entering the lobby, one can not help but get caught up in the opulence of the lobby, ballroom, and Gallery Bar. We so enjoyed taking a trip down \"memory lane\" while viewing all the old photographs of past movie stars and Academy Award celebrations. I had requested the club level (concierge level) when booking this hotel. Upon checking in, we were told that the club lounge was closed and we would receive vouchers for drinks and breakfast. I had asked for a large corner room with a rollaway, as our younger son was joining us. I was told that this should not be a problem in terms of size, however, it was. Thank goodness for Jose, the bellman. He showed us approximately five rooms on this level, none of which was ample size. With that, he phoned the front desk and informed Greg of our dilemma suggesting that maybe they could give us a junior suite. Greg was most accommodating, and did just that at no extra cost. In fact, they didn't even charge us for the rollaway! Although the suite was not on the club level, we still received club level amenities (cocktails, and full buffet breakfast which would have been continental had the lounge been open). The room was not renovated as were the ones on the club level floors, but it was very large and clean and housekeeping was most accommodating. I can not say enough about the staff at this \"Grand Lady\".

To begin with the good - the ground floors are absolutely gorgeous with a great deal of restored original architecture/decor from the 1920's. My room was only a standard but quite spacious with a very comfortable bed, desk, full closet and comfy chair. My room was on the inside of the building, overlooking a quiet courtyard and I heard virtually no outside noise thanks to the white noise generated by the heat/AC. And the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. The workout equipment in the health club facilities were a little squished and I think I used the oldest still-working elliptical machine in North America. But the treadmills are all pretty new and most machines have a personal flat screen. However, that was completely made up for by the rest of the facilities - the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and spa look original and made me feel like some robber baron in the gilded age. The location is excellent for business in or near downtown and is right in the heart of the financial district. It could also be a good choice for tourists because it is so close to the 101, 110, 5 and 10 freeways, so you can pretty much get anywhere. Now for the bad things - all of which are relatively minor and would not stop me from booking here again. First, like many hotels, they charge for internet access, which I find a highly offensive practice. Also, valet is $40/night. This is not unusual in LA, but should be factored into your budget. The tub/shower had a curtain, rather than a door, which kept sticking to me because it didn't have magnets in the bottom. This was particularly gross since the housekeeping seemed hit or miss - I had 3 great days and 2 \"eh\" days. The TV in my room was an old, small CRT type and many of the channels buzzed or otherwise had bad reception. Finally, when I ordered room service breakfast, my receipt had the wrong name and room number on it. When I asked, the staff person told me \"You must have written the wrong number on your ticket, this is for you.\" That was completely unacceptable at this level hotel. Even if I actually had made the mistake, I should have received \"the customer is always right\" treatment.

I was unhappy with my first Single King bed room because of the buzzing from an outside aircon fan and they found me a Double Queen room immediately which was quieter. The rooms itself are not as grand as the lobby. There is also a difference in size between the single King bed room and the double queen bed rooms. The double queen bed room was much bigger whilst the single King room was a bit on the small side. The rooms are clean but I would say that most of the furniture and TV are on the old side. The bathroom was also quite dated. It seems that very little investment has been made in updating rooms in the last 10 years. Wireless internet was expensive at $10 for every 24 hours. Another very expensive item was parking where only Valet parking is available and costs $40 per day. There is a cheaper underground car park for $15 per day opposite the hotel in Pershing Square.

All I can say is that while some of the comments are valid, the good outweighs the bad at the Biltmore. We were 4 people staying in two rooms for 4 nights. While both rooms were the same price, one of them was really spacious with seating area and a large walk in closet, while the other was more or less a standard sized room. The smaller room also had the inconvenience of sharing an entryway with a locked door with another room, so we couldn't just go knock on our companion's door because they wouldn't hear us. The rooms were clean, though obviously not modern, which two of us found charming and two of us weren't as excited by. The beds were great, the linens were nice and the TV was decent sized. My Mom and I used the pool and the jacuzzi which was really something to see, though not the most functional in that the hot tub couldn't seat more than two people. I would agree with travellers who would say that there is nothing around the hotel and this part of the city is pretty dead in the evenings, but as we had other plans most of the time, this wasn't a problem for us. There are only a few restaurants around, but we found one we really enjoyed and went there twice. There are two big downsides we found. The first was the noise. My home is towndown Montreal and even I found it to be a bit noisy at night and in the early morning. Thicker, more soundproof windows would make a great difference. The second was the price of the valet parking at $40 a day. Yes we could have gone to the parking garage around the corner but we were doing a lot of in and out and it just seemed more convenient. But for that price, we would have expected that when we called ahead to have our car brought round we wouldn't have to wait, which was always the case.

The location of the Biltmore is excellent, being just across the road from Pershing Square and its metro station. This means that prime tourist sites, such as Hollywood and Universal Studios are only about 20 minutes away. This was important for us because we didn't have a car to travel around. As for the hotel itself, the exterior but particularly the interior of the lobby is impressive. It strikes you as a quality hotel as soon as you walk through the door. The large pictures on the wall are reminiscent of the closing scene in \"The Shining\"; the corridor leading to the health centre has many photographs of the hotel's history- I thought this was a nice touch. The room we had was a little on the small side, but was otherwise fine. The health centre is an excellent amenity, featuring a swimming pool (which closes at 8 pm, which is a little early I thought), and a fitness centre (which remains open 24 hours). We ordered room service our final night, which was promptly delivered and was delicious. It was probably the best room service I've experienced in fact. The only negative I experienced during my stay was the shower in my room, which ceased to work on our final morning in the hotel, which meant I had to use one in the health centre. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. I got a good deal on hotels.com, and for what I payed my stay was excellent. The staff were courteous throughout and the facilities excellent.

Prior to our stay, we stayed at the Disneyland Grand Californian property for three days. The Biltmore does not compare to the Grand Californian but it's also not as expensive. Like everybody has already said, the lobby and public spaces are gorgeous (my wife found everything a bit creepy however, as the old black and white photos and the hallways and corridors reminded her too much of \"The Shining\" -- she was half-expecting that I would be possessed by evil spirits when I returned to our room from getting some ice!) but the rooms are less than modern. Parking is also a hassle. So, all in all, here is my summary of the Biltmore: Disadvantages: - lots of street noise (bring earplugs!) - old old TV (c'mon, I understand the Biltmore is limited in some respect by the architecture of the building but certainly better and newer TVs cannot possibly be beyond their budget! Many luxury hotels -- including the Disney Grand Californian -- have already switched over to widescreen LCDs) - No mini-fridge. Really, how many luxury hotels can you think of that do not have fridges. Come on, Biltmore folks, they are not that expensive! - The valet parking is a hassle. Expensive ($40 per day) and also time-consuming if you need your car often. I also stopped tipping the valet after the first few times because I realized to tip a fiver everytime you need your car was going to get way too expensive. Like other reviewers have mentioned, there is parking across the street at Pershing Square but there are no in and out privileges and you have to be out of the parking lot before 9 AM or they will charge you more than the overnight flat rate. There are also some shady-looking characters hanging around that square late at night so Pershing Square is not a very good option if you need your car at all times of the day. Advantages: - Gorgeous property. - Within a short walk of some wonderful LA landmarks -- Disney Concert Hall, Angels Flight, The Bradbury and Grand Central Market. The Grand Central Market is a great GREAT place to get lunch. Plenty of wonderful food and unbelievably cheap. Best bang for the buck, in my opinion, of all the places we dined during our stay in LA/Anaheim. - Clean, spacious rooms. My wife loved the king-size bed in our room. Very comfy mattresses and comforters. - Friendly and helpful staff. The valets continued to be very polite and courteous even after I stopped tipping.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, KY", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay!\u201d", "Author": "obrn855", "ReviewID": "UR17266766", "Content": "I stayed at the Biltmore during a recent professional nursing convention with some trepidation.

Travelling across the country alone, I was very nervous about what I had gotten myself into. I could not have been happier with my stay & wonder what was going on with those who had a negative experience. To say that the lobby and the common areas of the hotel are stunning is an understatement. Everything speaks to the rich history of this landmark. I especially enjoyed learning about the hotel's role in the glory days of old Hollywood. The staff was friendly and helpful, directing me to the best ways to get around the city and the things to do. Cabs were very easy to come by, thanks to the staff of the hotel, but I chose to walk to and from the Convention Center each day. I did not ever feel unsafe walking alone downtown. I found the facilities to be more than adequate- the fitness center has a lot of equipment (more than I was expecting, based on one review) and was open around the clock. This was great for someone who was out of sorts with the time change and wide awake at 3 a.m. most days, ready to get going. Although I did not eat in the hotel much, I had a wonderful, if pricey, breakfast at Smeraldi's. For more value, there's a great little coffee shop around the corner on 6th, called the Yorkshire Grill, where I got a delicious breakfast for less than $10, including tip. My room was charming & comfortable. The mattresses have, indeed, been upgraded and the linens were crisp, clean, and of high quality. Yes, the TV was a little small, but who needs to spend much time watching TV when you're in LA? If I wanted to nitpick, I'd say that the bathtub could have been re-glazed.

Fortunately, the hotel appears to be in perfect condition for all guests to enjoy. The basic room was booked at the convention rate but proved to be one of the highlights of the stay.

This was my first trip to Los Angeles, and I was a little surprised to discover how little is actually going on downtown, especially after 5pm, when it turns into a bit of a ghost town. There is a Metro stop a couple blocks away, but the public transit system in LA leaves a lot to be desired. As for the hotel itself, most of the reviews that I've read on here are fairly accurate. The hotel is ancient by LA standards, and it shows in the rooms. The lobby and bar areas are very elegant and grand, and they set up your expectations of the rooms perhaps a little too high. When we got to the room we were quite underwhelmed. It was clean enough, but it's just very old. The door to the bathroom was heavy and creaked, the TV was laughable (I think it was 19\", and it was very old), and the bed itself was just OK. The mattress was clearly past its prime, although we did see a bunch of new mattresses being loaded into the hotel one day. Apparently they are going to replace all the mattresses this summer. I did enjoy the pool, which is a great old Roman tile type pool, although it would be better if it was open later (closes at 8). The workout room was small but will suffice if you're just looking to jump on the treadmill for 30 mins. The worst part of our stay was getting stuck in an elevator. We were going from the 5th floor down to the lobby when the elevator just stopped. We got management on the phone and they were very concerned and responsive, but there's not much you can do to console people when they're stuck in an elevator. We were in there for about 5 minutes (felt like an hour) when the elevator suddenly sprang back into action, went down to the lobby and the doors opened. Management met us there and seemed very concerned for our well being, although they had no explanation for why the elevator malfunctioned. They offered us passes to the buffet breakfast, which was a nice token gesture but at that point we just wanted to get out of there and go for a walk. The Biltmore clearly is an LA landmark that has seen better days. Without major hotel-wide renovations I don't think we'd stay here again.

We chose it mostly because the price was right and the location was reasonable - good access to highways, and close by to some friends. The hotel is a historic property and there is ample evidence of old grandeur in the lobby, bar, and restaurants, which are really quite lovely. It certainly evokes a different era when you step through the doors into the hotel. Our room was suprisingly large with a view of downtown LA. We also had a very large walk in closet - the size of some kitchens in NYC. The bathroom was good sized and had a seperate tub and shower. The shower did not have any place to put anything other than a bar of soap which was a negative. The room has a box TV, desk, and chair. The biggest problem with the room is when you walk in, the first thing you see are very dated linens on the beds. The comforter is literally fraying at the edges and losing its color. The linens were of poor quality and need to be replaced. The carpet in the room was also coming up at the edges of the room and also was not high quality. Those are not things you would expect to encounter at a 4 star hotel. We also could have done without the prom on the Saturday evening of our stay. The lobby turned into an impromptu photo studio and those attending the prom spent a good deal of their time shuttling b/t the dance floor and various hotel rooms in a loud manner. Valet parking is $40 per day, and our car was always ready when we requested it. The hotel charges a fee for internet usage per day. Check in and check out were quick and painless. We did not eat at the restaurants or go to the bar in the hotel. Ultimately this hotel is a high end 3 star hotel, but the above mentioned problems keep it from attaining the 4 star status.

Sure, it's beautiful at the lobby level (actually stunning), but that age also makes the rooms small. I'm sure it may have been sufficient in the 1930's, but it's not even remotely up to par for the 21st Century. The bathroom fixtures are old and they make a lot of noise. 2. The room decoration was really cheap. The desk looked like something out of the Sears outdoor furniture collection and the TV.....a 13 incher. C'mon, I can accept the limitations of an old hotel, but a 13 inch TV obviously built in the late 70's or early 80\"s. I just couldn't believe my eyes. Motel 6's have better TV's than that. 3. The street noise, just awful. I've read the management notes on other reviews regarding this and I understand their point, but half of the rooms face the outside streets. You could do better on the lower floors with better insulated windows. I've stayed at older hotels all over the country on business. I've seen how it could be done well.

Few tips for future guests: 1) use your cell phones and go to the public library a block away for internet 2) downtown LA closes on the weekends in PM including restaurants and Starbucks--I kid you NOT!

Everything from the lobby area to the hallways and the architecture was beautiful! I stayed in one of the Club Rooms (business travelers) on the 10th / 11th floor. One of the perks of these rooms is that you have access to the business lounge on the 10th floor which offers continental breakfast in the morning and refreshments in the evening (all inclusive of your room rate). Keep in mind, you are paying a higher room rate, so not sure if it's necessarily worth it for leisure travelers. The breakfast was average (coffee, juices, cereal, fruit & yogurt, and some pastries) and the evening refreshments consisted of sodas, crackers & cheese & meat, fruits, and cookies. It was a nice set-up in a lounge area with tables and couches and flat screen tv's. Internet access is also free should you have access to the lounge. Speaking of Internet access, it costs $9.95 for a 24 hr period from your room. Also, because the building is older, wireless reception is not that great and the signal quite weak. Make sure to bring an ethernet cable along to plug into. Cell phone reception is also quite weak -- mine kept fading in and out depending on where I was in the hotel/room, so beware of that. The room size was awesome. So much floor space and a sitting area with couch and table also. Not sure if this was just available for Club Rooms, or it's a standard feature. The only disappointment was the bathroom size. On one hand you have a HUGE room with TONS of floor space and even a walk-in closet, yet the bathroom was TINY with not much room to move in at all. Also, the tub was in bad shape -- cracks in the drainage area. I think the bathroom needed a renovation. All in all, great place to stay. Excellent location, if you want to be in downtown. Seems like there were quite a few restaurants in the area. I didn't have much time to get out, so I grabbed a bite at Smeraldi's one night and Sai Sai the next night. Both restaurants are within the hotel. Smeraldi's is Italian with a Meditteranean touch. Really great food and excellent creme brulee! Best I've had in LA so far! Sai Sai is a Japanese place.

I'm not sure I've ever seen a property with so many high reviews right after or before low reviews. I was intrigued and decided to check this property out for myself. I stayed one night during the week and booked a special rate, which also meant that my expectations were quite low for the type of room and service I thought I would receive. I chose to park at Pershing Square across Olive Street and pay $14.00 instead of the $30+ valet at the property itself. Parking at Pershing Square was very convenient (ride the escalator up to the ground level and walk across the crosswalk to the hotel) and also appeared to be quite safe. Security there is very present. Check-in was not only quick and efficient, but also quite friendly. I'm a firm believer that you reap what you sow, especially in large properties that see a constant stream of travelers, many of whom are less than patient. I greeted the front desk clerk with a smile and was treated with a kind, professional demeanor in return. Others have reported problems in this area, but I can honestly say that I saw no issue here. The bellman was also helpful when I asked about parking safety at Pershing Square. The location was perfect for my needs, in the heart of downtown and close to the 101 with easy access to other freeways. My room didn't have the best view, but again ... this was a special rate room. Room 329, though, did have a king sized bed, windows that let in plenty of light, and a headboard that was made up of substantial columns rising to the ceiling ... quite different than that of other photos posted by other reviewers on TripAdvisor. The carpet was in fine shape, the bathroom was in decent shape, and the room was appointed nicely. This is a historic property and one needs to keep that in mind when staying here. It is meant to have some \"old world\" charm. It does and I think it carries that off fairly nicely. \"Old world charm\" doesn't necessitate using cheap sheets and bed coverings, though. Millennium should be ashamed of themselves for keeping very low end linens in this property. That's such an easy thing to update and such an important part of an overall stay. The mattress, too, is absolutely sub-par. I've had better beds and linens in Holiday Inns and Travelodges. That charm requires a certain amount of maintenance, too. The Biltmore could stand some maintenance in spots: mouldings chipped, scuffs along the baseboards, chipping paint on the window panes. Another item that the staff really needs to pay better attention to is the amount of catering/room service items left in the hallways. I was amazed at the sheer volume of items outside doors as I walked to my room ... glasses, trays, half-eaten meals, etc. Most, if not all of it stayed there for the duration of my 1-night visit. Overall, I think many of the lower reviews for this property have been too harsh.

We generally use the Choice Hotels' Clarion, but decided to go for something out of the ordinary to make the trip more exciting. Bad decision. The true cost of your stay is not reflected in the rate, because they will charge you for every service you use. Rooms: Dingy and in dire need of repairs/upgrades. Once we entered our room we were certain that we were in a 2 star hotel. Repairs to the tile, plumbing, and fixtures looked like they had been performed by the bellhop. The workmanship and materials were low grade. Tile grout had been replaced with poorly installed silicone caulk--ultra cheap. Services: $9.95 for 24 hrs. of Internet access. Free Internet access is something I have come to take for granted. Another mistake. The good news, the LA library is just a half a block away and offers free Internet access to the public. Great walking destination after breakfast or early dinner. The hotel charges for LOCAL calls $1 each. The hotel charges for Toll-free calls, $1 each. Linens: Terrible. The sheets were thin and so were the pillows. Towels were thick and nice. Parking: $32 per day. I am not a fan of giving my car over to strangers, or being gouged for parking, so we parked across the street each evening for $14 in the underground parking garage which felt safe and secure and is little further from the elevators than is the hotel's driveway valet drop off. Pool & Exercise Room: The pool has a classic look with tile throughout with an attractive brass railing all around. Unfortunately, it is very small. With three other people in the pool we felt it was too crowded to get in. Also, the floor surrounding the pool was dirty. The exercise equipment might have been installed for the hotel's original grand opening in the 30s. And it is crammed into much less space than is needed to enjoy your workout. Restaurants: We ate at Smeraldi's the first night. Food was good, the service very slow. The prices were reasonable. The second evening we stopped in what the hotel touts as \"Downtown LA's hottest sports bar. \" It must be downtown LA's only sports bar, then. And it is not open on Sundays. Uh, don't most sporting events occur on Sunday? Anyway, the food was poor, the beer was warm and the service was very slow. We actually had to get up from the table and go to the bar to ask for drink refills. The environment was dark and dreary, but there are plenty of televisions, if you want to watch a game.

We booked this as a special treat to ourselves because we could not afford a honeymoon since we are both graduate students. Since we are both history buffs, we booked the Biltmore for its historical value and it seemed like the closest we could get to European grandeur without having to go to Europe (or Vegas, heaven forbid). Like others have stated, the entrance of the hotel is spectacular and the pictures speak for themselves. We booked a standard room but we were hoping to get a free room upgrade as most similar-class hotels provide this service for new bride and grooms. In fact, nearly all of our friends received free room upgrades and complimentary champagne and strawberries on their wedding nights in similar hotels in the area such as the hilton, westin, intercontinental, and the hyatt. We walked in with our full wedding attire and received many congratulations from random people. However, we were only met with rudeness with the concierge. The service was curt, there was no mention of congratulation, and when we asked if any kind of upgrades or services were available, the front desk person seemed appalled that we should even ask. When we mentioned our friends who had received this service at the Omni recently, they said, \"Well then maybe you should have booked at the Omni.\" We were not expecting or demanding any kind of upgrade; we just inquired based upon the experiences of our other married friends. The fact that we were rebuffed in such a rude way was a major sore spot on our wedding night. The room we did end up staying in was almost offensive for the price we paid- we have even stayed in nicer hostels in Europe for a fraction of the price. My husband felt sorry that we had to spend our wedding night like this and we were very close to getting another room at the Bonaventure just down the street. We have stayed in their rooms and although they are small, the furnishings and decor are up to par with a 4 star hotel. We even called the Bonaventure from our Biltmore hotel room to inquire about room availabilities, and when we asked about services for new bride and grooms, the concierge replied professionally and guaranteed that yes, the Bonaventure always provides room upgrades for bride and grooms based on room availability, and we would have definitely received a suite if we had booked that evening. We ultimately decided not to book since we were so exhausted from the wedding and we didn't want to have to pay another $35 for valet parking on top of a wasted hotel night fee. The grand days of the BIltmore are certainly behind it. Judging by the service, you can tell that the hotel is struggling as it cannot keep up with its competitors in standard measures of hospitality.

I saw a ticket come up for my car and a lien of guys standing around doing nothing for at least 5 minutes before one of them decided to pick up the slip and retrieve the car - and for this I pay $32 a day?

I stayed 3 nights at the Millenium Biltmore in LA. My friend and I were in LA with the sole purpose of the trip to go on the Price is Right before Bob Barker retired. The hotel was a bit difficult to find even with GPS in the rent a car. It was not marked well and there is only one entrance to the valet parking structure. When you walk in the front lobby your breathe is taken away by the shear glamour of the hotel. After checking in and tkaing photos we were handed an 11 page list of all the films and television shows that were filmed there with the most recent being Dreamgirls, Mr. Deeds, Italian Job, etc. Hollywood apparently knows what type of grandeur this hotel offers. Anywhere in the hotel you felt as though you were among royalty and that old souls had walked the halls and stayed in the rooms. The Academy Awards were also held here and the Oscar statue was created on a cocktail napkin as well. We had a junior suite and when I called to check my reservation I asked if there was a fridge in the room and was assured there would be. However upon arrival there was not one in our suite. There was a gentleman, Mike, who was inspecting the fire sprinklers and I mentioned it to him, within 5 minutes I had a fridge in the room. Teh shower pressure was immaculate in our room although the fixtures were old, but ecclectic. We only ate at the Sports Bar which was good, Nachos and chicken sandwich. We tried to have Sushi delivered to our room but were told we had to pick it up, even though the restaruant was in the hotel. Teh sushi was expensive and we ended up going to Nobou in Malibu which was excellent. We opted for room service instead. The meal was excellent and hit the spot. We did use the Business center where internet use was quite expensive and printing was $1.99 per page. We were able to sneak into one of the main ball rooms as my friend saw a man carrying a table out of one of them. He turned the lights on for us and we took pictures of this beautiful room. We also went to the indoor Roman pool, spa and sauna as it was shown in the movie Cruel Intentions. We only went in the spa and sauna which were nice. There were workout facilites we did not use, but there were quite a few people partaking. The location was awesome too, we drove around for 3 days and only went 150 miles as the Price is Right and the Farmer's Market was only 10 miles away as well as Hollywood and Malibu, and LAX. All staff was helpful and courteous. We really enjoyed the old world charm this hotel offers and reccommend it to anyone, although I don't know that kids would enjoy it as much as we did. The only real complaint I had was the price of parking @ $32 per night and you could only valet.

I had read the reviews before coming here and was expecting the worst in a very old hotel. I was pleasantly surprised! I felt like I had been swept back in time upon entering the lobby and browsing the hallway arcade. The rooms are a little dark and yes, seem a little old, but when I saw it I thought it was all just part of the overall theme. It would have seemed odd to me to be in a super modern room in such a historic hotel! I felt like my room was quite large and was impressed that the dressing area was separate from the bathroom. The workout room downstairs was great, and a lot bigger than other hotels I've stayed in. Lots of towels, lots of little extras, very modern. Like panewsgal, my toiletries did not get replenished during my stay. I found that to be a little strange. The service was excellent and (almost) everyone went out of their way to help me. For example: Although it's not in a convenient location for tourists, it is close to the bus stop. On my first day, the concierge walked me out to the street corner to guide me to the bus stop. The bellmen were also exceptional in pointing me toward (or away from) places, helpful with money saving tips, and enthusiastic about food choices. The waitstaff at the conference were outstanding (coming from a banquet waitress background). I would have come away from this hotel with very high marks, but all it takes is one, unaddressed incident to make you think twice. I was REALLY surprised that this went unaddressed, since I was at a PR conference! I stayed in Room 635. Some high school kids were partying in room 637 from earlier in the afternoon on Saturday. I did not complain at the time but mentioned it to the front desk at about 630 p.m. I was a little surprised that I was told, \"OK--if it becomes a problem we can move your room.\" I guess it's okay to have parties in the hotel rooms and it's preferable to move the affected guests? I'm not sure if the Biltmore is okay with underage parties and that's why they put them at the end of the hallway. If that's the case, they shouldn't have put any guests near their room. I figured the child having the party was connected to a hotel employee to get a special exception, especially with what followed: The party got louder at 1030 p.m. With lots of yelling, slamming, dancing, etc. (heck, I thought they had a whole mobile disco set up in there) so I called the operator. It didn't seem like the hotel did anything, so I called again before midnight. They said they would send security again, but it just got louder. I called AGAIN after midnight, and was told they would send security again. At that point, it seemed like they got the music turned down and a large group of kids left. But a group remained, at 1 a.m. it was still noisy with yelling, and more kids coming in with beer... the kids started to jiggle my doorknob, too! I gave up calling security and at 1 a.m., wrote an email to the hotel to outline the events as I have done here. I never got a response. (I know the email works, as I used it prior to my trip to get transportation directions.) I overslept for my conference the next day, and told a few of my friends there what happened the night before. They turned around and told their friends. And as each day went by, people would ask if I got a response. I guess I would have left feeling better about the hotel if they had at least said something, or replenished my toiletries!

I travel quite a bit for business, and at this hotel, I feel it's all about the lobby and public areas and the guest rooms are sadly overlooked. When I arrived, I was definitely impressed. The lobby and front desk areas are truly stunning. Front desk clerk tried to \"upgrade\" me at check in (for a $50/night fee). I declined. However, I have to say my room was large when I stepped in - I was one of the lucky ones at my conference - other people's rooms were half the size of mine. No matter - as the PR/Marketing person for the hotel stated, it's an old property - and I can definitely understand the room variations in older hotels. What I can't understand, however, is the lack of quality in everything *inside* those guest rooms - small or large. Sheets were thin and paper-like, the pillows were like burlap sacks, the comforter was ratty, and bathroom amenities (shampoos, soaps, etc.) were never replaced during my entire stay even though I used them. In fact, one day the maid knocked a lampshade off the lamp when making the bed, and even though she was back to the room two additional nights - it was never fixed. What ticked me off though was the way the hotel nickel-and-dimed. I understand it's a high business hotel, and the thought process is that people are on expense accounts - and who cares what things cost?? Wrong. Those days are over - I have strict budgets I need to adhere to when I travel for business, and I don't appreciate a $6 charge to print out my boarding passes for my flight (grand total of time in the business center - 3 minutes). The hotel advertises hi speed internet in public areas and guest rooms - but be aware, it's certainly not *complimentary*.. The food was very good at my conference, however, and the meeting rooms, while a little chilly (but what meeting rooms aren't?), were beautiful and the ballrooms extraordinary. Staff was always pleasant and helpful I do agree with other posters, however, that the hotel is not the best location-wise for tourists at all, and while I didn't feel *unsafe* in the neighborhood, it did get a little seedy at night.

We also had trouble with the water draining in the bathtub. After probably less than 2 minutes in the shower, the water was over my ankles. For late night snacks, don't count on the vending machines. The floors alternated between vending and ice machines and a search of a couple of floors with the \"vending\" machines only turned up Coke machines. The hotel staff was friendly so that was nice.

On arrival, we were greeted in a friendly and efficient manner and directed to our room. The hotel lobby and all the public areas were fantastic. Not exactly my style hotel, I'm more into contemporary decor but the public areas in this hotel looked fantastic with their traditional decor. Once we entered the corridor from the lift though, we noticed that the standard had dropped dramatically. Instead of looking fresh like the lobby, the corridor looked very dated and in need of some redecoration. Once we entered the room, in this 4 star (?!) hotel, we were not too pleased at all. It was grubby in fact. I moved a chair towards the wall to make a bit more space and there were crumbs from the previous guests there which were obviously not cleaned properly. The room was dark, the bathroom was completely outdated, with dirty looking old tiles and the wooden panelling was painted white a long time ago but was now a dirty yellowy colour. Nothing special about this bathroom at all. I wasn't impressed. I was going to complain and ask to change rooms but I decided maybe that I was just expecting too much and that if this room was like this then all of them probably would. Later then we lay on the bed with the intention of watching telly for a while. There was a large mahogony television/drawers unit a few feet away from the end of the bed but with the side of it facing the bed. We pulled out the sliding tray with the television on it as far as we could and swivelled it as far as we could but we still could not comfortably see the television from the bed. This was a very bad set up altogether. Mind you there was 2 chairs in front of the television unit so perhaps you're only meant to watch television from there?! The concierge though, was very helpful, he helped us to organise a rental car and a day trip to Disneyland, he was a brilliant help to us I must say this. On our first morning, we went for breakfast in the hotels restaurant (we mistakenly thought it was included in the price - our fault). We walked in and it seemed to be a bit of a help yourself/we'll take your order at the table set up, so as the waiters were staring at us (but not approaching to explain the routine) we felt under pressure to just do something. So we took a seat at a free table. The waiter then approached and asked if he could take our order, I just wanted a bowl of Frosties and a slice of toast and my boyfriend ordered an omlette. I got the feeling from the waiter that we must have been doing something wrong with the ordering, and caused him some inconvenience but he never took the time to explain what we were supposed to do therefore how could we rectify this? As a result of whatever we did wrong?? the waiter proceded to be quite rude and abrupt to us throughout serving us. He nearly cut me with a look when I asked for a 2nd glass of orange juice. Next thing shock horror, the bill arrived for the breakfast! You won't believe the price. 7 dollars plus tax for a small bowl of Frosties, 5 dollars plus tax for ONE slice of toast with butter, 3 dollars each for the small glasses of orange juice and 15 dollars for an omlette served with a few breakfast potatoes. When we queried the waiter politely as to whether or not breakfast was included he stomped off to check with reception, he came back and said that it wasn't so we didn't argue and took the bill. He left us momentarily while we organised the money. The total bill including tax was around 38 dollars so we put 40 dollars in the bill booklet and as we stood to leave the waiter practically ran over to our table and picked up the bill booklet, in front of us, he rudely opened the bill, acknowledged the 40 dollars and threw his eyes to heaven with a loud \"tut\" because clearly he didn't think that 2 dollars was enough of a tip for making people feel uncomfortable and being rude right throughout our service. The Sports Bar in the hotel was very dingy and really undesirable but we ate there the first night, the food was only ok and a homeless person managed to come in and hassle us for a tip while we were eating. Location-wise, the hotel was only ok too. We rented a car for a day or two which was great and also the metro stop was only around the corner which brought you to most places easily enough but it was a bit of a trek out to Hollywood and Universal Studios. The gym and swimming pool were very poor as well unfortunatlely and we didn't feel the urge to use these facilities once we saw them. Unfortunately, for the price we paid for the grubby accomodation and especially the measly overpriced breakfast, and the rudeness of that waiter, the dirt of the Sports Bar, it was just enough for me to say that for your money you could probably get a better hotel in LA in possibly a better location. I honestly wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone - especially tourists, maybe we had that look about us that they felt they could throw us in any old room and we'd be content because to be honest the hotel seems to hold a lot of business conferences etc during the day and the restaurant where we had breakfast seems to be a classy financial district type restaurant where professionals go for business meetings over dinner or something.

The hotel has a good business location and is near the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion. When I went to check in, I had to wait for about 10 minutes because the entire computer system had crashed. However, after, that there way no wait and I was on my way to my room. It was unacceptable. First, the room looked like something out of the 1950s -- an older looking, low-level queen bed complete with a 1950s/1960s style cream bedspread and dust ruffle that didn't match, didn't fit, and was torn. There's good retro and bad retro; this was bad. The carpet was stained. The room was very, very small and very dark. The view was of a wall. The bathroom was tiny and poorly remodeled. There was one wing-back chair that looked incredibly uncomfortable. Also, the room was so small that you couldn't possibly sit in the chair and watch TV. TV was on the dresser. There was a desk with a desk chair. However, the desk was the only table in the room. There was no nightstand -- some weird heavy box-like object (like an overturned computer box) was lying on the floor right next to the bed with various wires attached to it. Not sure what it was or what it was for. But no bed light, no place to put anything if you lay in bed. I didn't see a clock. The only phone was on the desk -- not reachable from the bed. The worst part, however, was that there were huge stains on the cream-colored bedspread. At that point, I demanded a new room. I was upgraded to a \"junior suite.\" Very large with separate sitting room, but the furniture was still somewhat dated and I couldn't fairly describe the suite as attractive or luxurious. The carpet was stained. Tiles were missing from the dressing area counter. The TVs (there were 2) were only 19\" at best. The bathroom was ok but small and also a bit dated. Also, no mini-bar and no bottled water, coffee or tea. Not sure if there were vending machines but, other than tap water, nothing in the room to drink. Service was unremarkable -- neither great nor bad. Concierge was helpful. Checkout was slow -- there were 7 people in line and only one person to provide assistance.

A lot of tourists and business travelers go to the Biltmore because of its high-class reputation and historical significance; we were there as part of a self-guided architectural history walking tour (which I highly recommend BTW, check the LA Conservancy web site). The best feature of this hotel is its public areas ... make sure you allocate time to sit in the lobbies, have a look at the banquet rooms, have a drink at the martini bar (expensive but very romantic) and definitely swim in the beautiful Italian-tile pool. I think the hotel is aware of the popularity of its public areas; after I got dressed I took several pictures of the pool and at some point a security person showed up and looked me over (but left when I smiled and waved at him). The rooms were small but very clean and the bed was wonderful. Decor is classy but materials are somewhat old. The bathroom was very small but nicely tiled and worked well. We had a view of the interior air column of the hotel, but after walking around downtown LA I can't say that we would have benefitted much by an exterior view! The staff are very nice and polite but very busy (I get the impression that there are a lot of people checking in and out all the time). Internet is not free and parking is expensive. The neighborhood has improved a lot in the last decade-- we felt safe at night but there are a lot of disheveled, muttering people wandering about and occasionally panhandling in their polite, southern California style.

When we booked the hotel over the hotel's website we felt somewhat uneasy - the rates were less than the half of that what the other five-star hotels in Los Angeles wanted. However, after staying there for four nights, I justly can say: What a phantastic experience! First, the location: Of course, it is a downtown location (by the way, adjacent to the Hilton). Believe it or not, the first two days we explored Los Angeles (!) on foot. From the hotel, the old town (Olvera Street), Chinatown, the Cathedral, the Walt Disney Concert Hall are in walking-distance. We even enjoyed to walk to old downtown and the market hall which is now a colorful hispanic neighborhood. The location of the Biltmore is really safe, also at night. On three nights, we walked from the hotel to the best restaurants in Los Angeles (Patina and the Water Grill) and around 11:00 p.m. back. Since the hotel is located in the financial district, there was no safety problem Second, the building. The Biltmore is a historic building in the overwhelming style that was typical for the bustling twenties. Of course, freaks of ultra-modern design will find it overdone and kitschy, however, we loved its unspoiled historical charme. Thirdly, the rooms. We had rooms on the club floor, which were decorated with brand new furniture in historical style. The rooms were spacious enough. The bathrooms were, as typical for historical hotels, on the small side, however functional with tub and shower , sink and toilet. We had no problem with water (however, the water system was freshly renewed). The only weak point: The windows were still old and in no way sound proof. However, it was not a problem, because the nights were quiet as there was hardly any traffic on the streets. Fourthly, the amenities. The hotel has a large, up-to-date fitness club which is frequented by office-clerks who work in the nearby banks. The indoor pool is all in historical style, well-heated and boasts a jacuzzi, a dry sauna and a steam room, all historical. We loved it. Fifthly, the restaurants. We had breakfast in the informal Californian restaurant. We tried the big buffet, breakfast a-la-carte, and the continental buffet which included steamed rice and vegetables. Everything was good, the staff was very friendly. We did not visit the Japanese restaurant, but had dinner in the Water Grill (excellent!), which is 50 yards away, the Patina (excellent!), which is two blocks away, and the Checkers at the Hilton (mediocre), which is 25 yards away. On the first evening, we ate in the Club room, where hors d'oeuvres (vegetables and dips, dim sum, cheese), wines, beers and soft drinks were served at no charge. Sixthly, service. We cannot image, why other guests complained about the service. Everything was excellent. Valet parking was quick and convenient. Even at peak times, when 8 guests wanted their cars at the same time, it took only 5 minutes waiting time. Maybe, 26 Dollars a day seem expensive. However, we habe looked up other parking lots in downtown L.A. which charges 26 Dollars for self-parking! (The only cheaper parking lot is the Cathedral). Maid service was excellent. Service at pool and gym was excellent. The receptionist was friendly and efficient. The only point was that during the holidays, the club room was closed. However, there offered us, either to take rooms on the regular floors (for a much cheaper rate) or to stay on the club floor with a considerable reduction from the usual club floor rate (which we did). I have to mention, the hotel manager was not just sitting in his office; instead, we met him everywhere: on the aisles, in the restaurant, in the lobby...

The suite was the size of a small apartment, complete with a small entry hall, huge living room and dining room plus wet bar and refrigerator, and a separate spacious bedroom (with 2 double beds) and bathroom. There were two TVs, so the kids could watch their shows on one. The rooms were all clean and nicely furnished. The windows had shutters which blocked out the sunlight in the morning. Our suite was located on a corner, so we could see across the street towards Pershing Plaza and over the roof top of a lower building. We felt very comfortable and safe staying here. I peeked into a standard room, and I can report that a standard room is just as spacious as an average hotel room. The same as the bedroom in our suite. I would not have been disappointed with a standard room at all! And all the reviews that mentioned \"no coffee maker\"...we had one, maybe it came with the suite. But you can always REQUEST A COFFEEMAKER for FREE--it is stated in the hotel's guest room book. It also includes packets of coffee and paper cups with sip and go lids. Our only complaint about the room was that the water temperature in the bathroom was uneven. This happened a lot with the shower. The water temperature from the sink was ok. Also, it took forever for any hot water to reach us during the \"slow\" time (Wed & Thurs) in the hotel. Once there were more guests on Friday and Saturday did the hot water come on as soon as we turned it on. I think they need to upgrade the bathrooms, especially the showers! Although we understand that parking space is a premium in downtown LA, or ANYWHERE in LA for that matter, we weren't thrilled about the $24.00 per day valet parking fee. Yes, there are other garages across the street and around the block, but they charge a $6.00 fee for evening entry (between 5pm-12am) and then they charge $2.00 per hour after 12am. The total comes out to be close to $24.00--not much of a savings there. We figured that the money we saved on the hotel room went toward parking, so overall everything evened out at $100 per night. Which is still a great deal for downtown LA with parking included! Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend the Biltmore to anyone!", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westchester, NY", "Title": "\u201cWe liked it!\u201d", "Author": "rl549", "ReviewID": "UR3815776", "Content": "We were there for one night for a wedding which took place there.

I booked the hotel about two months in advance for three nights, the first of which was a Universal Studios package (breakfast, Uni Studios tickets and valet parking), the other two the weekend package which included the valet parking. The rates were very admittedly good and unlike one of the reviews I read, the hotel was actually extremely easy to find using google map directions to aide me however upon arriving at the hotel we had to wait for 20 minutes to get into the valet parking area (granted they were having a prom that night). Once we got into the reception area (beautiful but quite empty looking - could use a decorator) we were greeted (and I use that word with a grain of salt) at the check-in counter by a very rude young man who made me feel quite uncomfortable. We got up to our room which was very pretty indeed - until I went into the bathroom where there was a reddish sort of stain on the bathtub and the fixtures were so dirty they looked as though they'd never been cleaned and until I saw the view - we were also on a 'club floor' but with a distressing view of the back of the other building. We waited for our luggage to arrive as we were wanting to go out that evening and needed to change but the time ticked on and on and still no luggage. I also realized that we weren't given our Universal Studios tickets when we checked in nor was there a hotel directory (with room service menu etc) in the room so I called the bellhop to find out where our luggage might be. I was asked by the lady if we had asked for our luggage to be brought up (umm-yup?) to which I of course replied yes, we asked the valet to send it up and even told him exactly which bags were needed. After putting me on hold for an interminable length of time she came back on the phone to say we didn't know you wanted it brought in (umm that's interesting since we were on record with reservations for three days so not really sure what we would do without our luggage which was in plain view in the car!!) and would I like directions to my car so I could go and get it? No exaggeration. Well, I've never been asked this before and was more than a little dumbfounded but after gathering my wits I nicely said no I was under the impression the bellhop would be bringing it up. She then transferred me to the bellhop who shockingly also asked if I would like to come down and get it!! To put this into perspective, my 11 yr old daughter and I were on a three week roadtrip, we had two large suitcases, one smaller suitcase, one laptop, one large toiletries bag and other sundry bags which we carried in ourselves so this was not a manageable amount of luggage for me to go and \"pick up\" from the lobby. Anyway, they eventually brought it up but let me tell you it was hard to give the guy a tip (even though of course none of it was his fault). I then phoned the front desk to ask about the Uni Studios tickets which they questioned me on saying they had been given to me at check-in which I was again surprised to hear (I guess they didn't believe me?) I told her they had not been given to me which I should think would easily enough be checked. I was again put on hold for ages and when she finally came back she tersely said she'd send them up. I then had to ask her about the hotel directory which she said was a housekeeping issue and that I'd have to speak with them about it at which point she then transferred me although I half expected her to hang up so I'd have to phone them myself. I spoke to housekeeping who were very nice. Our luggage still had not arrived, in fact when it eventually DID arrive it had taken an hour and fifteen minutes. By this time it was too late for us to make our dinner reservations in West Hollywood that I'd had for a month so we had little choice but to order from the room service menu and unlike the person from Nebraska who commented that the prices were reasonable (omg - $16 for a hamburger is not what I call reasonable) I must heartily disagree with them and believe me, I'm not the most budget-minded person by any stretch of the imagination. The bill came...$36 for 1 hamburger, 1 tiny half bottle of 7-Up and 1 piece of apple pie with ice cream which included (although I was not informed about this) the gratuity (I added tip to make the total $40) and taxes. When I phoned a day later to ask why the bill was so high they then told me the gratuity was already added and said they'd refund my $4 tip! - this was not in fact done not that it would have made a difference anyway) Quite unbelievable. I very badly wanted to complain about the whole experience but thought I'd wait another night and see how things went. I didn't end up complaining though I truly wish I had done but only because the person who checked us out was so rude and made me feel so uncomfortable that I felt terribly intimidated - he didn't even ask how our stay was (that would have been the point where I would have said something) or whether everything was to our liking - questions which I have come to expect from the calibre of the hotels I stay in. This all says nothing about the surrounding area which is INDEED slummy looking. The area coming from the north from the highway to the hotel is fine (Mus of Metropolitan Art, etc) but the area an immediate block south and all around from there becomes highly unsafe looking and feeling. I had to advise my daughter not to look at anyone as we were driving by, the area IS ugly and scary looking. Your member from Canoga Park who said the area is NOT unsafe is kidding themselves, when he says \"further east of the hotel\" he must mean by further, a block, east, west and south as well and I would under no circumstances walk around with my daughter in the area surrounding the hotel, in fact I wouldn't chance it with a male adult either. I will never stay in this hotel again unless they were to take some serious instruction in customer service and the art of dealing with people effectively. Do these people care at all about how they represent the hotel and the impression they leave people? Apparently not but the hotel management should be advised that this is the downfall of the hotel and a probable reason why they get little repeat business. The hotel's architecture is so very, very beautiful and it's history so steeped in tradition that it's a very big shame it should be ruined by the lacking service of many of it's front-line staff.

It was the bellhop who was sooooooooo nice. Without asking, he told us everything about LA and what we could do and where we could go. He also told us about the hotel amenities. He was very informative. We stayed on the 10th floor, which is the Club Level. We were told at check in that the rooms had been renovated and we would be very happy with ours. Oh my. If our room had been renovated, I would hate to see the rest. The 10th floor smelled old and musty. Our room and bathroom were dirty. The walls looked patched up and the shower head was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been cleaned since it was first installed. When I sat on the bed, it felt hard as a rock, so I called down to housekeeping to ask for a bed pad. The lady told me she didn't think they had pads and I should call the front desk and ask to be moved since most of the mattresses had been replaced in the last year, but our mattress was one of the ones that hadn't. So, I called down to front desk who said they would check on it for me. When front desk called back, she rudely informed me the mattresses on our floor hadn't been replaced and there was nothing she could do. She said she would send housekeeping up to put a pad on the bed. They did, but I had to jump thru hoops to get it. Because we stayed on the club level, we had evening \"snacks\" and continental breakfast. WOW!!! That was definitely worth the upgrade. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful, with fresh pastries, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh oj and the freshest/sweetest mix of berries I've ever eaten. We ate at Sai Sai, the on-site Japanese restaurant. We had eaten there before and had a wonderful experience. Not so this time. The waitress handed us our menus and returned about 3 minutes later (no exaggeration) and asked us if we had made up our minds. When we told her we needed more time, she became irritated. She hovered over us (without being helpful) the whole time and we felt like we shouldn't be there. It was very uncomfortable. And then our food arrived cold. The 10th floor concierge was definitely much more helpful and friendly than the lobby staff. The gentleman manning the concierge desk spent a considerable amount of time showing us maps of LA and telling us where to go and where to eat. We followed most of his suggestions and weren't disappointed. Check out was a different story. The valet staff must have been in a bad mood because they were rude to everyone. People were complaining to management and staff. It was sad.

In addition, this price included an upgrade to the club rooms which are located on the eleventh and twelfth floor of the building.

We all had very comfortable rooms (no complaints) and the hotel itself is truly beautiful...there are photos showing the grand events that took place back in Hollywood's \"glory days\" and we all enjoyed viewing the big stars of the day...it used to host the Acadamy Awards. The intricate detail of the ceilings and walls is amazing and a true historical treasure...no complaints about the 100 year old elevators because they just add to the hotel's authentic character. Yes, the rooms are not as large as newer hotels, but people need to appreciate this hotel for its beautiful architecture and history (believe me, we are not history buffs but could not help but appreciate the splendor of this hotel). The staff that we dealt with were very professional and we highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "France", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "WilfFrance", "ReviewID": "UR3357156", "Content": "Having read a few reviews after I had booked this hotel that were not very encouraging, it was with some apprehension that my wife and me checked in here in March 2005. All of these fears soon dissapeared as we took in the surroundings and the rooms which are first class. Sure there were a few mini hiccups like the TV system which was undergoing a changeover of some sort but we didn't travel to LA to watch TV! The car parking is a bit of a rip off but again, this is LA and at least the car parking ervice is efficient and takes away the problem of doing it yourself and finding the wheels missing next day. If you need somewhere sumptuous to stay over, this is the place. However, remember this is downtown with not much to see in the area if you're walking. Oh, and the Water Grill restaurant adjacent to the hotel. Its good, but take a mortgage out for the bill. With the wine list starting in the region of $80/100 plus for the local brew you can make your own mind up!", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE SERVICE\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3349515", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for a wedding. Prior to our arrival, I called and confirmed our reservation for a non-smoking king size bed. When we got to the hotel, they stated they only had two non-smoking rooms - queen size and double size beds. So we opted for the non-smoking/queen size bed. The room was small, old, smelley, dusty and the lights were not working. Our request for the second room was met with rude commentary and poor service. The second was much better than the first room, but more in-line with a one or two star hotel. It was not a four-star hotel. Other guests that were attending the wedding also stayed at the hotel and had similar experiences. We were all very disappointed with the cleanliness of the rooms, service at the front desk and valet.
