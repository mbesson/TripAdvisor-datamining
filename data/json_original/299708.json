One tip on using taxis, I found it much cheaper getting a taxi outside the shopping mall than from directly outside the hotel. The gym was fantasic and one of the largest fitness centres I have seen.

The Carre Four grocery store (it's like a Super Wal Mart) that's in the mall has a great prepared food section. All hotel rooms have a refrigerator so you can buy perishables and store them during your stay. The Health Club inside the hotel is really nice. A lot of machines and it's very clean.

We had stayed here twice in 2007 and we came back here again in 2010. In 2007, we had stayed in the hotel rooms but now we stayed in 2 bedroom apartment. Location was great. Hotel is part of Deira City Centre Mall which has Cinemas, Supermarket , Food court and most well known shops like Debenhams. We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment which is in City Centre Residence. Hotel is located close to the Food Court side of the Mall. This is another advantage as our 15 year old son could walk to the food court safely. Mulitple Cinemas in the Mall was also advantage as we could go for late night shows and return back to bed within minutes without having to worry about transport. Another great advantage is the closeness to airport. We arrived late night and airport shuttle was there to pick us up. We were guided by friendly airport staff to the shuttle and were in bed in our room within few minutes. Hotel is just 5 to 10 minutes drive from the airport. Breakfast in City Centre Hotel was great with enough varieties and my children always enjoy the 5 star style buffet breakfast with variety of food. Deira City Centre Mall has Metro Station and so it was easier to just board the Metro and go to other Malls like Mall of Emirates. You can also go to Dubai Mall by Metro but we did not try it. We took the Metro to Mall of Emirates and this is the best thing to do. We also took the Big Bus for Cit y Tour. Big Bus also starts from Deira City Centre Mall. Thus the hotel has many advantages being part of the Deira City Centre Mall. The bed and pillow are very comfortable and cosy and it is best thing we can have after a tired day. Only negative that I can think of is that the bath rooms. The flush worked but it was always after couple of attempts. Carpets and Curtains also looked not very clean. It was all bit old and it will be good if hotel management can refurbish the bath rooms, carpets and curtains. There was a washing machine in the apartment which was good but there was no dryer. It will be nice if the hotel management provided driers so that we do not have to hang our clothes in the balcony to dry. Hotel staff were very kind from the start till the end. Special mention should go to Mr.Saji in the reception who was always very kind and had big smile for all guests. Just like we were picked up promptly in the airport, we were also dropped in the airport in a private car promptly and without any discomfort.

The hotel itself is welcoming and efficient, with check-in over in minutes, unlike some places I have visited. The rooms available were wide ranging for both non-smokers and smokers, though smoking outside of your room in the hotel wasn\u2019t tolerated unless in the Churchill\u2019s Bar. I had to settle for a smokers-twin instead of the king-size, but I couldn\u2019t grumble as they were large comfortable beds anyway. In the room you have everything from comfortable bed, large LCD TV, mini-bar (chargeable of course), full internet services, free safe, basically everything you would really need. Also a nice touch I thought was the laminated TV listing to tell you the channels available and in what language.

It was infact 5 minutes away from the airport which is great for early flights out. Also the best part was that being attached directly to the Deira City Centre Shopping Centre, after a long day sightseeing, we didn't have to catch another taxi out for dinner or for shopping. The shopping centre has a huge range of shops, restaurants, cafes, fast food outlets, a jewellery court, supermarket, cinemas, a play area called Magic planet for children. etc etc.... endless. The Hotel lobby was very classy, the buffet breakfast was great. The clientelle were business people and tourists. Flight crews etc. The rooms were spacious and to correct a previous post - they did have coffee and tea making facilities. They also supplied a bottle of water daily for teeth brushing. The room service was good and efficient. The rooms were fine , 4+ star. You are not paying for a resort on the beach , so don't expect it. The receptionists were very helpful and courteous and they had a money exchange desk that was comparable to the exchange on the ground floor of the shopping centre. Taxis from the Hotel to the Burj Al Arab were $ 22 Aus. Taxi from the Gold Souq was about $ 11 Aus. We did the Arabian Adventures City of Merchants tour and their Sundowner Dune Safari which were both great. Also Afternoon Tea at the Bur Al Arab was an experience....we had no time for the beach! We enjoyed our stay here immesnsely and would definitely stay here again on a short stopover. If you are staying longer and the beach is your scene, book a resort type Hotel.", "Date": "December 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot a true Sofitel but still comfortable\u201d", "Author": "shopsuey", "ReviewID": "UR10009244", "Content": "We travelled to Dubai for the first time in October 2006 and booked into the Sofitel. Being a Sofitel hotel we expected something quite 'flashy' unfortunately we were let down. The rooms, although comfortable and clean, were not of the standard we expected and were definately not what we expected after looking at the photos on the hotel's website. We suspect that the room photos shown must be the Executive Level suites. The rooms were large with plenty of space for the huge bed, eating area and desk. The bathroom was a good size with great water pressure and loads of hot water - something I am obsessed about when travelling. Our Emirates flight from Australia arrived very early in the morning and I would suggest if arriving this early (6.30 am) that you pay for the extra night so that you have a room to go to when you arrive. We didn't, so spent many hours sitting in the hotel foyer waiting for a room to become available. However we were supplied with complimentary drinks and were able to have breakfast even though we would be charged. It worked out well as we had breakfast included in the cost of the room and as we had an early departure to Paris we were unable to have breakfast on the day we left so in the end it cost us nothing. Also the hotel provides complimentary transfers from the airport which we weren't aware of when we arrived so we would suggest notifying them prior to arrival so that they are waiting, however taxis in Dubai are not expensive. Overall the service, particularly in the resturant, was excellent and the staff were very friendly. We had a few issues with the check-in staff but we feel they were the exception to the rule. We would recommend the hotel to others but if staying in the standard room we would suggest lowering your expectations for the usual Sofitel standard. We are booked in to the hotel in the next month for our second stay, mainly because we couldn't get our chosen accommodation elsewhere however we have booked an executive level suite, fingers crossed it will live up to expectations!", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNever book a triple at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Tracy-Seattle", "ReviewID": "UR8136447", "Content": "Arrived at 1:00 am.

When arrived at the room, no third bed was set-up! What had they been doing for an hour and 1/2? Once additional lumpy rollaway was added to room there was little room to move. Asked front desk to be moved to larger room in morning, was told that all rooms were the same sized. Advised them that they should not sell triples and was told, \"The travel agents know the room size.\" Found that this hotel and the staff had little customer service skills and less ability to anticipate the needs and expectations of guest.

Is in attached to the City Center Shopping Mall and you can shop until you drop. The hotel has a small swimming pool with no much of a pool bar, no fitness facilities, breakfast is average, rooms are okay, but because of the location we are thinking of revisiting. If you are not going to Dubai especially for shopping and you need business facilities and other luxuries this hotel is not for you.
