This was by far the worst room I have ever stayed in. We had paid $109.00 a night for a room that I had to clean and change the sheets myself before I even felt comfortable enough to stay in. First thing I checked was the beds\u2026 hair was on the sheets and when I removed the dirty sheets I had found pieces crumbled ceiling tiles under the sheets!!! After walking to the desk down 3 flights of stairs I was given new sheets to change on my own and was told to bring down the dirty sheets. The room also did not look like it has been vacuumed in weeks. The comforter was stained with what looked like blood and defiantly not been washed in quite a while. I would not even put it on the floor to walk on!! The whole building was rundown with a few exceptions that looked like an inexperienced and cheap remodeling job. The best thing about this hotel was the outside which was recently resided with pink vinyl siding and they had also added balconys to some of the rooms. This hotel advertizes that it has a pool. It does not have a pool the hotel across the street has a pool. You must return your one and only key to your room to the front desk to receive a key to the door of the hotel across the street. This is a huge inconvenience if someone from your group wanted to stay at the pool or go somewhere else they could not get the room key back until you return the pool key. Also, if you lose the one and only key they will charge you a $100.00 fee. At checkout I had asked the women at the desk if they are planning on remodeling the rooms and she had said not anytime soon.

My boyfriend and I are thrifty shoppers and look for bargains, but also completely expect to get what we pay for. However, the Royalton is an exception to that rule! To start, we booked our room thru Booking.com and brought our reservation confirmation to check in. They charged us an extra $10 stating, \"That's what the price is, those website's mess up all the time.\" No \"sorry\" or even an ill fated attempt to honor the printed price. Onto the room... I don't know how they can get away with charging for a \"hotel room\" that is essentially a room in an attic! We had dormers and sloped ceilings with exposed rafters. The lack of insulation proved to be the reason why the tiny, cheap air condition that was turned to its coldest setting for the entire 4 day weekend did nothing to cool the room! We were in the room for a couple of hours, sweating, when we realized that it wasn't going to get any cooler. We walked the 3 stories down to the desk (because there are no in-room phones to call from) to complain, and they graciously lent us a box fan. Great. Thanks. They said they could move us the next nite because that nite was booked. However, first thing in the morning the next day when we inquired, they said the rooms had been sold out. It seemed there were plenty of rooms that featured balconys as you could clearly see from the outside, but we were obviously mislead and taken advantage of based on the room they stuck us in. There was 1 dirty, grimy chair in the room and a puny dresser to serve as our only surface area in the entire room. The bathroom sink was not even large enough to rest a tube of toothpaste on. There was a fairly large closet stuffed under the low end of the sloped ceiling, however no bar to hang anything on it... useless. We would never consider staying at this place again!

So my friends and I had to wait until 3pm to check in because supposedly they had to prepare and make sure everything was cleaned for us. When we checked in and entered the apartment, it was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!! They made us wait that long and it wasn't even clean AT ALL! The bathtub had mold all over it, the beds were bedbug infested, the sink was clogged, the couches smelled like smoke, the refrigerator and oven were dirty and stained, and there were flies flying around everywhere!!! There was also a throw up scent that never went away during our stay no matter how much air freshener we used. We SPENT THE NEXT 2 HOURS cleaning the place before we could even relax.

The staff was very friendly and accomodating to my request to be placed on the first floor since we had an elderly, they gave extra towels, and even gave us a discounted price off the ususal rate to extend out check out time.

There was dust on most of the surfaces. There were splash stains on the inside of the lampshade. We had a broken chair which we discovered after trying to sit in it. The water in the shower was two temperatures cold and just short of a luke warm. The comforter, well let it suffice to say, that things had clearly happened on it before our visit which involved bodily fluids. The shower was as small as that of a WW II submarine but I know for a fact that the submarines had a shelf and a hook to put stuff on unlike the one in our room. The TV is an RCA model which has not been made since the early 1980's. The room had two phonebooks but it didn't matter because there was no phone. The hall smelled like a hamster cage and there were ants on the trash cans. In addition, should you want your room cleaned, you need to sign up for it which is something they didn't mention when we checked in. I would mention the common veranda but if you have an imagination and read the above rating my guess is the picture in your head would be accurate.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "red lion", "Title": "\u201cthis hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly\u201d", "Author": "purplezoey", "ReviewID": "UR70558876", "Content": "this hotel was located on the board walk in ocean city and it was near all the shopping and food u want.

The first thing we noticed when we got in was the dust on top of the furniture, good thing I had some windex. The lamp on the night table was an ornament since there were no plugs in the room, we had to unplug the fridge and use that plug. Also, they were too lazy to remove the broken tv so they just placed a working tv next to it. The room had little ants and on our ride home we found out that they were tagging along, so everything went from the garage to the wash. The place didn't even have an ice machine so I went next door and offered a couple of dollars every day to get a little ice to keep our water cold. Other things missing were a hose to rinse the sand off your feet, for this we used the hose at the motel next door and hoped no one would notice. If you want housekeeping you need to sign daily and what they do is empty the garbage and give you towels, no rinsing of the shower, give you soap or making of the beds, so we only did it once.

I got physically ill staying the night at this place. There are no refunds for this place; they don\u2019t clean the rooms before you enter them. They pretty much just kinda organize it before you get in. I found a screw driver and a bowl under the bed and an old noodle soup inside the microwave. The Microwave doesn\u2019t work there is no remote for the TV but you have a choice of over 300 channels and it resets to channel 3 every time it turns off. The room is supposed to accommodate up to 6, but its best for no more than 2 or 3 at most. The pull out couch is in the way of the bathroom door so people who want to use the bathroom will have to climb over you to enter and the couch is the most awful filthy thing. The entire room is tiny and somehow the walls and roof are all uneven. There are stains everywhere and the rooms are very dusty and dirty. The AC unit is very low to the wall so whoever sleeps by it will get cold air blown on them all night. The AC unit is very dirty and isn\u2019t installed correctly; you can see through cracks in the wall by the AC unit outside so bugs can it in from outside. The ceiling and walls have water stains.

However, it was very clean, room service came by every single day to give us towels, and everything in the room worked. We had a small fridge that worked better than the front desk said it would (they cautioned that it may take a long time to cool down but it worked fine for us) The renovated bathroom was decent, very clean and it looks brand new. Although the website led me to believe the bath was a full tub, it turned out to just be a shower stall. There is a Boardwalk clothing store downstairs, and if you are quiet you can hear the techno music playing from inside the room, but it is not excessive and it was turned off/down by 11. Upon check-in, we were given coupons to the ice cream shop that is also downstairs (Sweet Surrender, on the boardwalk) This hotel is also directly beside the famous Julia's Cannoli and Pizza Boy shops which is an added bonus if you like either of these No, there is not an in-room phone or alarm clock, but then again there wasn't a nightstand beside the bed either. The bed squeaked if you jumped on it/threw heavy objects on it (such as suitcases) but using common sense, any bed would make noise to an extent. Parrot Lagoon owns this hotel as well as the place on 9th, so the pool at 9th street was open to us. We never made it to the pool, since we had the entire Boardwalk right in front of us.

The owner (male) was very nice, the female owner was a tad rude to me in particular actually banning me from the hotel because she said I wasn't a guest even though I mean i obviously was- I paid and stayed there for 6 nights before sooooo I just used a different . The rest of the staff was mad relaxed- They helped with our problems and had a good time themselves so that was good.

My wife, 2 friends and I wanted to save some $ on the hotel stay, so we all got together and randomly picked a cheaper hotel on the internet. They advertised it as being \"one of the last original hotels in O.C\" Boy is that an understatement. We should have known something was up when we saw a physic advisor attached to the place and 2008 senior week rates still on the website. We waited until after the labor weekend to book a room. When we got there we should have looked at the room before giveing up our payment cards. (mistake 1) We went to our assigned room (#8) and could push the locked door in with ease. The stench was overwhelming through the hotel, but it was worse in the room. So, we went down to the desk to tell the \"clerk\" about the problem and request another room. (mistake 2). Once in the other room (#12) we were overwhelmed with how small it was. NO room for anything. It looked nothing like the pictures on the internet. The toilet didn't flush, the sink didn't drain, the shower was nasty, the beds were in horrible condition, the lamp was broke (although they did have one of those new energy saving light bulbs in it), no clicker for the T.V., unknown stains on the sheets and overall NOT suitable for any human. To make a long story short...luckily we brought lysol with us, so we lysoled everything...stayed one night and checked out the next evening. We ate the money that we COULD NOT BE REFUNDED FOR and went somewhere else for the remainder of the stay. As we left O.C. we called the state health and welfare people and they basically said that there has been numerous complaints about THE ROYALTON and THE ROYALTON gets fined and pays the fine...over and over again. This does not seem right, but I guess that is how the laws work. So, I'll end with this...If the owners/employee of THE ROYALTON (yeah, you,the kid behind the counter who laughed when I confirmed there were no refunds) are reading this....I can't believe you can live with yourself. I hope you get shut down.

We booked a room for 5 people and the room was so small, its smaller than your average size home bed room. There was 6 of us so it was extremely cramped. We paid an overpriced amount about $200 for one night. When we arrived to the hotel, the parking lot is horrible barely any parking spots they're all for the nearby restaurants, horrible conditions all torn up, there is an overflow lot about a block and a half away. Once we gathered all our belongings and headed up to the room, we stayed in room 3, we opened the door to a HORRIBLE odor, I didnt really even want to stay in the room due to the smell. There was beer caps in the ceiling light fixtures, I found a countless amount of empty condom wrappers and actually found a used one in the sheets of the bed, the bathroom door was broken clean off the hinges, the carpet was covered in stains and DAMP. We brought a bunch of food down so we wouldnt have to waste money on $8 chicken fingers, and the fridge smelled SO bad, and barely worked our sodas were warm, and the microwave didn't work, so all the TV dinners i had bought for the night went to waste. There wasn't any outlets to plug cell phone chargers into. The bathroom was so disgusting. It looked like no one ever cleaned it. The shower was covered in brown soap scum, and the water knobs were green and moldy. Which brings me to my biggest complain of a million, THERE WAS BLACK, GREEN AND GREY FUZZY MOLD GROWING on the walls, and ceiling of the room. The AC wasn't working so my buddy messed with it a bit to find out the whole AC filter was covered in mold. That's a huge health code violation. I actually did get physically ill from the mold in the room. There was balconies for the guests to share and use, out on the balcony there was piles of puke from drunken teenagers. They claimed the hotel was \"non-smoking\" when clearly thats all that goes on there, the ashtrays on the balcony looked like no one ever cleaned them. The plastic chairs were covered in dirt and bird feces. We checked out about an hour early, and went mini-golfing, and afterwards I had realized i had left my cell phone and debit card on the bed in the room. I called the hotel to ask them if they had found it and instead of saying \"yes we found it\" they had said \"well theres room damage\". So clearly right there it was very obvious that they held my belongings due to the conditions the room was in, which if anything was in worse condition when we got there than after we left. We went back to the hotel to try and find my stuff, and they were extremly rude to me. After the hotel managers son was complaining to me I had brought up all the things that were wrong with the room and he seemed offended and then actually started to use profanity at me. I threatened to call the police and the health department and he just got worse, he walked up into my face started screaming at me about the bathroom door that \"we apparently broke\" I even offered to pay for the crappy door just to get my belongings back, and he didnt care. As he was screaming at me in my face and cussing at me he was spitting all over me. These owners clearly do not know how to treat customers. I did not get my belongings back, so luckily my buddy let me borrow gas money to get back to PA. I strongly suggest staying in your vehicle before staying at The Royalton. The hotel is very tacky, faded old signs with rules that no one listens to and they dont enforce, one of the rules was no drinking out on the public balconies, or smoking and that was clearly all that was going on, and even when the hotel employees saw it, they didn't say one thing to any of the people. There's much more complaints that I have. I can't even think of everything. If you're thinking about staying at the Royalton, think again, take my word for it. It is not worth what you will be paying. you honestly are better off sleeping in your car. There is not one positive thing I have to say about this hotel besides the location. Horribly rude owners that do not seem to care about their customers, or business for that fact. Spend an extra $20 a night and stay somewhere else.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Royalton Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d1103047-Reviews-The_Royalton_Hotel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$117 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1101 North Atlantic Ave.</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">11th Street &amp; Boardwalk</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1103047", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/40/a8/the-royalton-hotel-thumbnail.jpg"}}
