You do not get room service unless your stay 7 days or more; however, you can get clean towels from the front desk. If you want service is an additional $7 dollars per cleaning. I thought the free parking compensated for that.

We picked it for the price and relative proximity to the cruise port. We had 3 rooms in total. Two of the rooms faced the freeway and some of our group complained a bit about the noise. Our room was on the other side, facing the Walgreens and we did not hear the freeway at all. If you choose to stay here, I'd suggest requesting a room facing Walgreens, not the freeway if you are a light sleeper. Check in was a breeze. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They suggested we walk under the bridge to an Italian Trattoria for dinner - Tutti Trattoria, I think it was called. Very good pizza and service.Highly recommend it. The rooms are basic, but clean. The port is approximately a 10 minute cab ride away. There is not alot in the area to see and do. There is a Walgreens and Publix accross the street and if you walk under the bridge there are a few restaurants to choose from. We did not have enough time to reallt explore the area, but I think the subway (people mover) is about 10 minutes walk away. Overall, good value for your money and decent for a night before a cruise.

This hotel is clean, staff is responsive and helpful. The rooms are clean and spacious plus the kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, dishes, silverware, etc. It's close enough to everything without getting hosed by the cost. $84.00 for a Sunday night stay $22.00 taxi ride from the airport $21.00 taxi ride to south beach $12.00 taxi ride to the port of mimai Walgreen and a Publix within a 3 minute walk. In addition, we ate an amazing lunch and breakfast at the Baklava Factory, which was about a five minute walk from the hotel. Our total bill for both meals (for two) was $28.00.

I picked this location primarily because of price, proximity to the port, availability of transportation to the port, and the nearby Walgreens and Publix. We flew into FLL, and had prearranged transportation from the airport to the hotel in Miami, the driver had a little difficulty finding the hotel, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say if it was 5 blocks more in another direction, the area would be a little scary, but where it is was okay. We were 3 women traveling together and felt safe enough walking across the street after dark to pick up some last minute items from Walgreens. We checked into our room, on the 3rd floor. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a view; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too far off of the major highway (95 I think). There was a full size fridge, a sink and a microwave. The bathroom was average size for a budget hotel, 2 double beds, a dresser w/ tv a small desk w/ 2 chairs and another comfortable chair to sit in. The room really was decent in size, but the furnishings are low key at best. I should mention here, if you need internet, its 5 dollars per day. There was also a coffee maker w/ coffee available, some dishes, an ironing board and iron. Since our room faced the highway, I did hear some noise when the air conditioning was not running, but since it was running most of the time I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice the noise as a problem. One of the primary reasons I had chosen this hotel was they offered a shuttle to the port, which when we asked about it at check in, the clerk was polite enough to tell us taking a taxi would actually be a little cheaper. The taxi ride is a set amount of 21 I believe, and that was for a van, and the shuttle offered by the hotel was 10 per person. We also asked for a recommendation for nearby pizza that was good, and the clerk had several offers, and we went with her 1st recommendation of Mama Caruso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and it was great! If you are looking for a well priced pre-cruise stay, or an economy place to stay for a few days, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this location. There is no view, no pool, and nothing really nearby that would be an attraction to walk to, so this location is not for you if you want any of that. The staff was great, and I will probably stay here again before our next cruise.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hidden Gem\u201d", "Author": "bajangal45", "ReviewID": "UR47400615", "Content": "The service at the front desk was efficient and pleasant. No hassle check-in. We had to pay for the entire stay at check-in, but they make you aware of that beforehand on-line. The room was very clean, no orders, ac worked like it should, TV worked, lights no problem, bathroom was spotless, toilet had a loud flush, but it worked, the shower worked properly (water got hot when it should). I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The price I paid was $74.99 per night and I think I got way more for the price I paid. The location was great for me, I was staying there because I was going to the Miami/Broward Carnival, which was 5 Min away. It was right off of the I95 (about 2 min way).

The parking is free, which was an added plus. The only things I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like was how loud the toilet (when flushed) and the door (when closed) were.
