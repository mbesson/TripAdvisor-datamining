{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A nice, clean and quiet pension at a good price!!!! My wife and I stayed for three nights in a double room, which was very bright, big, with a nice view of the courtyard. There is a beautiful park close by where we did our jogging in the morning. The streets are quiet, beautiful lined with trees and the Metro is one block away. The breakfast in the morning was very good and the staff was very friendly and pleasant.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR464670225", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bberger123"}, {"Content": "Great Value Hotel in West Berlin I had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel during the World Cup. It is in a great location on a quiet street in West Berlin, about a twenty minute walk to the Ku'damm but only a few minutes to the nearest subway station. I stayed in a single room which was simply but tastefully furnished and extremely clean. Herbert, the manager, is knowledgeable about art and museums and is happy to pass on information to you. Herbert will tell you his English is not great but it is in fact extremely good and he is a witty and charming conversationalist. If you want to keep to yourself, however, he will also respect that. The breakfasts are excellent: Herbert serves only top-quality breakfast items, many of which are organic. The price for the room was very reasonable given the location of the hotel and the quality of the breakfasts.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR659682246", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "CanadianReviewer"}, {"Content": "Good value and friendly We stayed in the apartment at Hotel Pension M\u7709nchen. Although it was a little crowded for 4 adults, it was very clean, friendly and well located. With four people sharing the apartment it is very good value and you can save some money by cooking in the apartment's kitchen. I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR718983674", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Alexvonw"}, {"Content": "Loved Pension Munchen The place is small, yet charming and very clean, and the service very nice. Breakfast was very good and the staff pleasant. The location was very convenient as it is very close to the Metro station. I would stay there again if I go back to Berlin. A terrific deal for your money and a great place to stay.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR709231462", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "belfebe"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234953-r10761775-Hotel_Pension_Munchen-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "234953", "Price": "$75"}}
