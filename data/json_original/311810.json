Plus the ADO station is just round the corner, which is great for buses to/from other cities or from Cancun airport. The building is very nice and it's pleasant being down by the pool. The pool itself is small, but it's still good enough for a quick dip if you're hot. The water is, however, rather cold. We got one of the cheap rooms online, and as was perhaps to be expected, it certainly wasn't the best room in the place. Being on the ground floor, it had no natural light, so was rather dingy. I imagine the rooms on other floors would be brighter at least, though I think they cost more. The toilet seat was missing when we arrived, but a workman replaced it. The staff were friendly and helpful, but one thing they weren't able to help with was the internet. Wifi was available on the first night, but went down the next morning and didn't return for the duration of our stay. It was very frustrating, for we had things to organise online and therefore had to go to an internet cafe. Before the internet went down we had to to outside to use it, despite our room being off the courtyard.

This was irritating as I had called and confirmed that we would be able to get a king size bed and that our late arrival would not be a problem. Good Points: The room was very clean and fairly comfortable. This is a good option if you are looking for a clean budget hotel that is on Avenida 5. I personally wouldn\u2019t pay more than $45 USD/room at this hotel. We paid $65 USD through hotels.com which is way more than we should have paid. The reception desk staff was polite. The lobby is cozy, nice, and comfortable with a small pool. Negative Points: There is no parking for the hotel so if you have a car it makes things more complicated as parking is difficult to find in Playa. We had to run the shower for about 15 minutes with the hot water knob turned all the way in order to get the hot water running. I would stay away from the rooms on the bottom floor facing the pool as they have huge windows facing the pool and lobby. There are curtains for privacy but you won\u2019t have any privacy if you open your curtains. Wifi at the hotel wasn\u2019t working while we were there so this added to the list of annoyances.

The staff was very helpful at the front desk, other staff like kitchen and cleaning were very kind and don't speak much English so a bit of made up sign language will help. There is no phone in the room, but there's wireless and a TV and an a/c that worked great. There was hot water everyday and great water pressure.

Great places to eat are El Fogon for the meat lovers and for Fish try La Tarraya on the beach right at the end of the street of the hotel where 2nd and the beach meet...fish fillet with rice and salad was $5, 3 huge fish empanadas were less then $2 and the view is priceless.

At first we were very pleased. We had a big clean room, a nice bathroom, a good bed and a balcony. Overall we thought to stay in a nice hotel. The location is great 5 minutes from the beach and near the tourist zone, but not directly in the 5th avenue. Unfortunately it turned out to be quit a bad place. First the pool is to small to swim (approx. 2mx1,50m) and seems more to be decoration only. Moreover it is viewable from the street. The worst thing were the bloodsucking bugs in our room. When we went to bed we spotted several of them on the wall and even 3 or 4 in the bed, one that had already sucked some blood. We complained at the reception immediately. The night boy tried to help us and gave us a new room without bugs. Unfortunately it had no windows and the room was directly connected to a second with a locked door. We heard everything from the other room and woke up early (6 a.m.). In the morning we complained again at the reception, they offered us a new room and 40% discount on our next night. The boss was called but not interested to talk to us. They were not willing to give any money back, or a free night. Additionally there was no Wifi in the rooms (both of them) only outside. All in all the Hacienda is far too expansive for what it offers, has an uncooperative management and our room had bed bugs.

If all you want to do is go to Mexico, lay on the beach and not experience the culture, this would not be the place for you. However, we LOVED it! It is probably the most beautiful hotel in all of Playa del Carmen (as we checked out many of the others and they looked kind of dumpy). It is very colorful, filled with handpainted mexican tile as well as hanging plants throughout. We stayed in a Queen sized suite which was HUGE. It had 2 queen size beds, a large sitting area with 2 sofas, a table and chairs as well as a mini fridge. It also had a large balcony with an ocean view. It's located only 1 block from the beach down Calle 2, which from what we could tell was the nicest part of the Playa del Carmen beach. There at the end of the street at another hotel/restaurant we rented 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for only $10 for the entire day. The waiter was very attentive and was contstantly checking to see if there was anything we needed. My 3 year old son had a great time playing in the sand and swimming. Later that day we enjoyed walking down Avenida 5 where all the shops and restaurants are located. We immediately fell in love with Playa del Carmen. Our only regret is that we didn't stay at the Hacienda longer. But we did go back to visit Playa del Carmen later that week because we loved the ambience so much with the wonderful people, shops and restaurants. Since parking is at a premium in Playa del Carmen and we had a car, luckily there is a parking lot right across the street from the hotel. The hotel staff was friendly, the room was clean and bright.

We found the pictures of this hotel impressive and the manager gave us a good deal on the room rate considering it was super high season (first week of Jan). We loved the suite on the second floor with 2 king beds. The room was clean, spacious, with quaint furniture and a balcony overlooking the street with partial view of the ocean at one end. It was just what we wanted, our 2 young kids had enough room to walk around and we were able to soak in some local color from the balcony not to mention sunrise and sunsets over the ocean. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Although the breakfast leaves much to be desired in terms of variety and cleanliness. Thats why we give it 4 stars. The pool is small, but with the amount of water activity outdoors we really didn't need it. Clean towels everyday and clean rooms when we got back, can't complain. Plus a safe, fridge, and tv with cartoons (albeit in spanish, kids didn't mind). Will go back. Nice restaurants too just around the corner. Negatives no elevators but stairs were not too bad. Good place for the price!", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, clean, excellent value\u201d", "Author": "Melbourne_Female", "ReviewID": "UR6022660", "Content": "We stumbled across Hotel Hacienda del Caribe having initially checked in (and paid!) at another hotel around the corner which was a total dive. This hotel though, is not dive like, it's excellent and was really good value at US$56 per night (including tax) for a large room with a king bed. There isn't a refrigerator which was disappointing, but for all around good value for money, this place wins hands down. The staff were friendly, although their English wasn't good and the sheets were changed daily with lovely towel arrangements (swans etc) left on our bed. The location is good and most things you need will be only a 5, or 10 min walk away. Definitely good value and if I'm ever in Playa del Carmen again, I'd have no hesitation staying here.", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cHow could you ask for anything more\u201d", "Author": "TheCanucks", "ReviewID": "UR5920644", "Content": "It was our second visit to Playa but our first stay at the Hacienda del Caribe, and we enjoyed it very much.
