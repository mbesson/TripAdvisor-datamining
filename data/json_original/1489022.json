We arrived at 9:00 a.m. in the morning and since some rooms were empty we were allowed to check -in early even though official check-in time was at noon. Additionally, after a long bus journey from Ephesus, we were ravenous, and the hotel staff welcomed us to enjoy their breakfast (for free). The breakfast on the rooftop terrace is lovely - and there lay out a pretty good spread for breakfast. Location wise - it is just five minutes walk to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Spohia - just step out of the hotel, walk up the hill for two blocks, turn right and then take a left. The staff were very helpful - they helped us arrange for the Bosphorus Tour and airport transfer on very short notice and when we went to Cappadoccia, Pamukkale and Ephesus for about 3-4 days, they were kind enough to let us store our luggage in their storage room.

ROOM/FACILITIES (space, cleanliness, bathroom): Terrible. We had just come from staying in 2 great hotels in our 2 previous cities, and were sadly surprised with what we got at Dara. We checked in and got into our room. Right away we noticed a strong smell of humidity/sewage. It was mainly coming from the bathroom. When we asked the reception to give us a different room, they said they were booked and the only thing they did was to spray a ton of deodorizer. Not only were we frustrated with this issue, but how it was handled by the hotel. They would not acknowledge this as a problem, when in fact they have to know there is an issue with their plumbing because they covered the draining hole in the bathroom (main source of odor) and put plugs on the shower and sink. The man in the reception said next day we would get another room. Off course this did not happen. Unfortunately we had pre-paid the room (for lower rate) so it was though for us to leave. The next day I did find another hotel to move to, but that same day we were changed us to a different room. This one was better. Overall, the hotel has to address this odor issue. Besides this clearly it does not have all the features one would like, such as a real closet (first room did, but second had only a rod and some hooks on the wall that served as a closet) and thicker curtains to block out light (see pics). These smaller deficiencies were not a big deal for us, but the room smell and their service did have a negative impact during our time in Istanbul. SERVICE Based on how they handled the issue with the room, service was poor. I have to say though; the lady at the breakfast was super nice and caring. VALUE Although rates were low, I would not recommend this hotel. In fact, because we thought about changing hotels I did some more searching and found better similarly priced options, some of which unfortunately don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the option of being booked through booking.com, orbitz etc. By the way, I agree with trip advisor member GRKMaria in being hesitant to post this review, based on previous unprofessional replies from the hotel to other reviewers.

I was going to book a name brand hotel to be safe but since we were traveling with our four kids, no other hotel could accomodate us all in one room. When we got to the street I was a bit apprehensive. But after having stayed there, I'm glad we did. The room was a decent size for Europe and especially for the price! The staff is what truly made our trip enjoyable. From the loving lady who hosts the breakfast buffet to the front desk and room service, they went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable. Sometimes its the people who can make or break the experience for you and Dara staff made it for us. They even arranged a shuttle for us to the airport with 6 passengers and 8 suitcases for free! The room was clean and so was the bathroom, with only two negatives: our room was at the street level and we could hear everyone talk as they walked by or drive by. Secondly, the bathroom was slightly below the standard an American would expect with a slight weird smell. That is not to say.ot was not clean because it was. If one could overlook these two flaws, their staff and willingness to help made all the difference for us! We would definitely consider staying here again. Actually, technically I guess we stayed there twice already because the last two days of our trip we were planning on going out of Istanbul but decided to enjoy Istanbul the whole week.

Due to airline flight arrangements I contacted the hotel in February to advise our expected arrival would be approx 4.am, and asked did they have an area where we could relax on arrival, or if they had a spare room was an early book in available, or do we need to book in for the prior night to our arrival. We received a reply from the manager advising that if a room was available, we could go straight in, but no guarantee that one would be available. What a great and wonderful gesture which we thanked him for. Two days prior to our arrival we emailed again to see if there were any problems, but no reply received. As advised, we duly arrived at about 4am and were completely unexpected by the night staff, who were somewhat less than cordial. We showed them our emails from the manager re the room availability, but were told - he doesnt work here any more, so it doesnt matter, but we do have a room. The conversation and the general demeanour did not impress us, and as the reception area was a bit dingy, we agreed to stay for the rest of the nighjt as paying customers, but advised we would stay the one night only. As we were about to go to the room, the staff insisted that we pay in advance for 4 nights, and with their attitude we then decided not to stay at all and left the hotel at about 4.30am. Subsequently we received an email from Engin the new manager which did not address the problem between us and the hotel, but lectured us with a set of rules. To cut to the chase, several emails passed between us, and I advised that I considerd the matter closed and requested that he not charge us any fees, which he advised that he had not. On return to Australia we found that following his advise to us no fees were charged we found our credit card was debited at a later date. On contacting him and advising that it may have been an automatic debit, would he reverse it as previously agreed, he said no, i can debit according to rules and i did.

We also came back to Istanbul a few weeks later and stayed again, mainly as we knew we would be welcomed back and that we would have another excellent stay (which we did!) The rooms are clean and comfortable. They are not large, but they are certainly adequate and the views from the rooms are incredible. It's also nice to know that there is actually a double bed! In many hotels we stayed at the \"double bed\" was just 2 singles pushed together. At the Dara Hotel, there is an actual double bed with beautiful Turkish linen. There is free wifi in the rooms, as well as a laptop downstairs for free use. And never to be taken for granted, the hot water worked every time!

Yes, the rooms are small...I am sure they are equally small in most of the boutique hotels in Istanbul. The size of the rooms was really not that important to us as we were rarely in them other than to sleep or shower. As others have said, the rooms are super clean and very modern. There is a lovely rooftop patio that is open 24/7 with self-serve coffee/tea/apple tea - so if you find the room too small, go and hang out up there and enjoy the amazing view of the Bosphorus. We picked up snacks from downtown and did that every afternoon - it was so relaxing and beautiful! The breakfast was fantastic. Three members of our group are quite fussy eaters - and even they filled up with enough breakfast to keep them going for hours. Nutella and super fresh bread, fresh fruit and cheese was definitely popular with the kids! Our daughter fell in love with Samra - she is a wonderful woman, and so attentive to your ever need. We will miss seeing her! Engin, Cetin and the rest of the staff are all very friendly and super helpful. They take good care of their guests - from greeting you with tea/coffee when you arrive, to helping you with your bags when you leave. We had a great experience at the Dara Hotel for the week that we stayed there. We would definitely recommend it to others planning a visit to Istanbul. The location is great - yes, there is a hill....but at the top of the hill you can walk to everything (Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Archeological Museum, Grand Bazaar)....and if my 70+ year old Mum and our 9 year old daughter can do the hill, so can you :) !

I tried twice to get into the third-party reservation system and it would not allow me. Twice I asked for the password to be sent to me and, again, no dice. So, I ended up having to email my inquiry and got a quick response saying that I indeed did have a reservation. My mistake was not confirming that I had also ordered the shuttle from the airport. Despite ordering the roundtrip shuttle from Ataturk Airport (for an exorbitant $45, however it was convenient) online from the hotel, the shuttle was a no-show at the airport. I called the hotel and the clerk, who's English was limited, seemed to not be able to find my reservation for the room, let alone the shuttle. Eventually, he said the shuttle is on it's way. If I had to do it again, they pick you up for free from the airport, apparently. So, I'd take the free shuttle inbound and take a tram and bus to the airport outbound next time for just a few dollars. My room was ok for the price, I guess, but VERY small. I slept fine, but mornings were noisy, because due to the construction of the hotel itself, it's just clanky and you hear every footstep, other guests' showering, and every room door closing.

Erhan and his staff (Haruk, Byram, Mohammed and Samra) were simply fantastic in looking after all our needs. Lots of genuine love given to the children, in particular the little one was spoilt by Byram and Samra. The hotel is very clean and very new, staff come to clean the room and replace towels every day. There is always at least one person if not two at reception to meet your needs. The room has a safe, phone, TV, mini fridge, shower and hair dryer. But no Kettle or cups for tea / coffee. Breakfast was on the balcony with brilliant views of the sea of marmara and included cereal, selection of fresh fruit, selection of bread and various spreads, boiled eggs, fresh orange / cherry juice, tea / coffee, milk for the kids. The location is on a hill, with Sokullu Mosque 30 seconds away which was perfect for me for the early morning and late night prayer. Blue Mosque was 10 mins away - again meaning all the family could go for the sunset prayer every evening. The only two negatives were, no one turned up to pick us up at the airport, but Erhan refunded me the cost of the taxi from the airport to the hotel and also the bathroom was very small (i.e. your head is practically touching the wall when sat on the loo!!! ) I would recommend any young family with kids to use Dara, I will be returning to it next year.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely place/people - tiny room.\u201d", "Author": "Boydus", "ReviewID": "UR72186235", "Content": "You cannot fault the hospitality and helpfulness of the staff in this hotel.

They were brilliant in that respect. The one issue was the room. The hotelier did apologise for the room saying it was the last one they had. It was nice - clean, tidy, nice d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The one issue was the size. The double bed took up most of the room and there was no floor space hardly for anything. The location is ideal, at the bottom of the hill leading to the blue mosque.

HOWEVER, if you are a young woman who does not want to cover to ankles and wrists (keeping in mind it is 40 degrees celcius out) I do not recommend spending a lot of time in this area, or just have a thicker skin than me! This is based solely on my own experience, I wore sundress that showed no cleavage and cut off at the knee and I was glared at, leered at and received so many dirty looks that it really started to ruin my trip. We did notice that the worst of this was on Sunday, and it wasn't as bad on other days of the week. We stayed in the Sirkeci area for 2 days at the end of our trip and I did not have to deal with a fraction of the same negative attention. In addition, it is a bit of an uphill walk to those attractions from the hotel.

The window, with lovely red geraniums in window boxes, opened out onto the street, overlooking a mosque across the street. Haluk at the reception, is an absolute gem. The entire staff was warm but he just went that extra mile to make us feel at home...from chatting with us and regaling us with stories about local life, to directing us on where to go, suggesting ways to spend a romantic evening, to providing us with a local converter that would fit our gadgets and keep the batteries charged, he just took care of it all. The hotel being located in the old historic part of Istanbul, was within walking distance to the Blue Mosque, The Grand Bazaar and to reastaurants catering to different pallettes and budgets. The breakfast was excellent, with a variety of fresh and dry fruit, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, cheeses, yogurt and breads all served on the terrace, lined with geraniums and with a view of the sea in the distance. The only drawback, as we saw it, was the hotels proximity to the Mosque which ensured an early morning wake up call with the extremely loud 'call to prayer'.
