The restaurant is expensive, the food is good but not as good as the food suggests. The pool area is great - saltwater pool, plenty of seating and shade, daybeds, everything you could possibly want! We had one issue during our stay - the concierge neglected to provide the correct information regarding buses on a Tuesday - the one day they do not travel to our intended destination, this was i'm sure an oversight on his part - however it did leave my wife upset. Elisa from guest services was great - she provided a daybed and complimentary cocktails for the inconvenience and also offered to arrange any other tours personally that we may have wanted - the prompt manner with which the sitaution was resolved was appreciated, the manager also emailed me with an apology- couldn't ask for more. I also like Wednesday nights, the hotel provide free appetizers and drinks to guests for an hour, where they gauge the experiences of their guests and endeavour to rectify any problems, it also helps to ensure the problems do not arise again. This I felt offered a personal touch that is lacking in many other hotels!

My newly married husband and I stayed her for second destination for our honeymoon. We flew from uk arrived in florida first to experience and stayed there for four nights. staying in the modern honolulu was purely my husband 's choice but after four days i have to say this hotel is the worst hotel i ever stayed in my life.the best things this hotel can be proud of is: excellent cleaners. The room is very clean and tidy. the hotel has some edgy design but that's not to everyone taste. 1)- as a honeymoon couple we are not expecting fireworks. But when we arrived in, there is no flowers, card, champagne or chocolate. We made our points across to the manager laurelle and later also we spoke to resort manager nick bargel about more issues about our stay, he explained to us as he is still trying to develop a system for honeymoon couples.that,s the lamest excuse i ever heard. I do not know how many honeymoon couples already stay in this hotel but from my personal expeience had we stayed in other hotels we would have been treated more special. 2)- health & safety. the shower which is in a bath tub can easily lead to a fall. There is no anti- slip mat in bath tub and nowhere to hold on to. i hit on the shelf few times where the toiletries placed while i was having my shower. The shelf is placed on the wall more towards the shower head. So its hard to have shower in a narrow bath tub and avoiding hitting on the shelf. The pressure of the shower head is quite weak. It takes me at least twice as long to wash my hair. the wooden slat panel covering the balcony area is very pretty but the glass door is very thin. Any noises from outside can be heard inside very easily. there is a night club within the building, and you can hear the loud music clearly from inside of the room. 3)- slow service. For example: Room service breakfast : 45 mins. ordering a glass of water by the poolside : 12- 15 mins. So i took back the gratuity from the food order i placed earlier and told the waitress \"it's too late. We are leaving now \". how long does it take for staff to pour a glass of water? 4).......5)...... To me, life is always about details. Hawaii is a beautiful island but the hotel i m staying in has put too much mud on my honeymoon memory .This hotel experience has made me feel very small and i am counting down every hour to set off to the airport.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAn amazing hotel!

The main reason I picked this hotel is because it was more for adults - we were on our honeymoon and even though the hotel has ammenities for children (and there were a lot of children there) I thought it had more of an adult vibe to it. Also it is a smaller hotel 300-400 rooms where it is more intimate and you don't feel like another number to them which was very important to us. The hotel has a really posh vibe to it. The ENTIRE hotel staff is very friendly and accomodating, they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. I really loved the fresh smell of pulmeria as you walked into the hotel lobby and the fresh lemonade and cold towel when you check in. They have free newspapers in the morning and they also have a free coffee service in the lobby - we requested ahead of time (at no extra cost) to have a mini fridge, microwave and a coffee maker in our room so they supplied us with a Keurig which was a cool touch. The pools are salt water which are beautiful. The adult pool was nice but I wish it was a deeper pool - it only goes up to your ankles but when it got hot we went downstairs to the other pool to swim - both pools play jazz type music and it is pretty quiet atmosphere. Food service at the pool and the pool manager were awesome. We went to the spa and got a couple's massage - it was amazing - definately go for it! You are right next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village - so you can walk two minutes and go to their man made beach, and go to the wonderful shopping centers on the strip. And it is 8 miles from the airport which helps when leaving. The biggest complaint I saw on every site was the noise level due to construction next door. We were on the 15th floor right near the construction site and didn't hear anything. If we had our windows open we heard the live musicans playing music by the pool which was lovely! The rooms were so cool - very clean and I loved the look to the rooms, very comfortable beds and you felt like you were in someone's bedroom - very cozy atmosphere to it! I loved how the bookcase in the lobby moved to show the hidden bar in the evening. They housekeeping was great by dropping off bottles of water in the evening. The hotel was a little bit more than I would normally spend but it was our honeymoon and every hotel on that strip that I priced out is that much, if not more.

Why? did they not notice the Sheraton's infinity pool a few doors down?!? Room service screwed up our order once, so instead of a 30 min wait it was an hour before the whole meal was served. I found the lounge unnecessarily loud- its impossible to have a conversation there, so we left for another venue. It's at the end of the strip, so when we went out at night (read: HEELS) we took a $10 cab to get into the midst of the excitement. The concierge was excellent however, and even went out of his way to print off yoga schedules nearby for me to review. And MORIMOTOS was AMAZING. Even if you don't do Japanese its a MUST!

I had never seen a plate of sushi in front of me that I didn't think I could finish. Until I came here. The $40 chef's choice sashimi is more than enough for one person.

Big mistake! I should have listened to the warning bell after an email I sent when I booked the City View Room was never answered however, I chose to ignore it. We arrived via taxi to the hotel Monday morning after a very draining and long overnight flight from Australia. Whilst there were 3 staff at the entry of the hotel, not one came to assist us with our bags. Once inside there were a number of other guests waiting to check-in but given the outlay of the reception desks (there's a big pillar right in the middle), there was no orderly queue. We finally got served and as expected, the room was not ready however we were told there was another one available which had no view. Given we had just arrived and were exhausted, we agreed and when we got to the room, our view was that of the roof with all the airconditioning vents. I later queried the room rate with reception and was told it was the same price even if the room had a balcony which I found puzzling. I also noted at the time that another guest checking in had been provided hot towels for their use which is obviously not applicable for all guests!

Overall, we found the Modern to be a great, clean hotel in a convenient location offering many amenities. Our stay started off a little rocky when we arrived on a Friday night to a full hotel and the only room available was apparently one on the 4th floor. The nightclub Addiction is located within the hotel and is open till 3:00 in the morning Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Unfortunately, the hotel is not soundproofed well and we were able to hear bass beats throughout the night. Our \u201cocean view\u201d room looked out at the roof and air conditioning units and it was only once you went out on the balcony that we were able to see that lovely ocean view we had been looking forward to. With that being said, we talked to the front desk about being moved to a different room on Saturday, only to be told that the hotel was still full. I really didn\u2019t want to be stuck on the 4th floor for another week and a half, so we waited to unpack and were able to move up to a room on the 10th floor on Sunday. This was MUCH better! The rooms are very clean, white, modern and they were tastefully decorated with a cute splash of Hawaiian colour added through wall decorations. Our room had a comfortable bed, a large chaise lounge, a large flat screen tv with HDMI inputs and a bedside Ipod dock that allowed me to charge my IPhone. From what I can remember, the bathroom amenities included a hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, body cleansing gel, body lotion, mouthwash, q-tips/cotton balls, and slippers. There was a safe, lint brush, shoehorn and iron/ironing board in the closet. The really impressive part of this hotel is the pool areas. We spent most of our time at the 2nd floor adult pool which is really a very shallow water area surrounded by sand and comfortable chairs/beds. We never had difficulties finding chairs in our desired locations around the pool. We found the service to be much better at the lower level pool where they will put chair covers on your chosen chairs and provide you with towels upon arrival however, the day we spent at this pool there were many children having a great time, frolicking in the water, splashing and jumping in and out. We found the adult area to provide the relaxing atmosphere we were looking for. Towels are available to be used around either pool or to be taken to the beach which is only a couple minutes walk away. If you are a runner, the hotel offers great routes either down Waikiki beach which includes sidewalk and sand running or along the boat harbor and through Ala Moana park which provides sidewalk running along the coastline. The Ala Moana Shopping Center is a large mall about a 10 minute walk away from the hotel. In the lower level, there is a Foodland grocery store where we were able to pick up fresh produce and stuff for making our picnic lunches when we did day trips out. There are small refrigerators in the rooms to keep groceries cold. There are also ABC stores all through Waikiki, one right across the street from the hotel. We bought swim rafts for $3 from the ABC store to use for lying at the beach, as renting chairs along Waikiki beach is expensive and most of the beaches around the island don\u2019t have beach chair rentals. We did many pre planned tours while we were there but on three of the days, we wanted to rent a car to explore. I strongly recommend talking to the concierge at the hotel who will set you up with a car from Enterprise right across the street. They get very good rates and I checked into various options but the pricing and convenience that the concierge was able to provide was unbeatable! Parking offered by the hotel is strictly valet at a cost of $28 per day. While the valet guys all seemed very nice and I\u2019m sure the come and go system they provide for that works well, it was more expensive than we were interested in. The good news for those value conscious people out there is that there is much cheaper parking available all around the hotel. All the way along the Ala Wai Harbour which is just behind the hotel, there is parking available for $1/hour and we were gone for most of the day that we had a rental car so we just paid $10 a night. Some of the stalls even offer a $6 all day rate. The other recommendation I have is to talk to the concierge if you are interested in going to the Cheesecake Factory for supper. It offers an amazing location for people watching if you get a table outside and seems to be the busiest restaurant in Waikiki with average waits of over an hour to get in. They don\u2019t take reservations but if you talk to the concierge, they can call and will probably be able to put you on a call ahead list which provides you with a wait time that is half whatever everyone else has to wait. We did this and only had to wait 35 minutes for an outside table even though they were quoting 70 minutes to the other people in line. The concierge staff was very friendly and also provided us with printouts outlining 2 different driving routes to follow \u2013 one with recommendations for stops up to and along north shore and one for the southeast part of Oahu. On Friday nights, Hilton Hawaiian Village which is just down the beach from the Modern, sets off fireworks. The pool deck at the Modern provided a good location to watch them. Magic Island is a short walk from the hotel at the tip of Ala Moana park and it was a great place to watch the sunset. Check out was at 12:00; we were able to get a late checkout for 1:00 but we were not being picked up until 7:45. Fortunately, the hotel had no problems storing our luggage for us and they allow guests in those situations to use the spa facilities to get cleaned up. In the spa bathrooms there are showers with many little amenities including shampoo, conditioner, razors, disposable brushes and combs, hairspray, blowdryer, etc. All in all we were very pleased with our stay at the Modern and would probably stay there again in the future. With that being said, we would recommend they do some work soundproofing for the people on the lower floors on weekend nights!", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Honolulu\u201d", "Author": "kaixinboy", "ReviewID": "UR138663008", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at the Modern for three nights recently.

I got my room at a discount, so I'm not as apt to nitpick as someone who perhaps paid more. I had a \"city view\" room, but the hotel is perpendicular to the water, not parallel, so only a handful of rooms actually face the ocean dead on. Most rooms are a combo of both city and marina views. I was able to get a room with a balcony, which was really lovely. Traffic noise is definitely an issue in the rooms, especially for the price. Ala Moana Blvd roars during the day, and I was on the 11th floor (14 total floors). The good news is that at night the traffic dies down so I didn't notice any noise at all, and I am an incredibly light sleeper. However, daytime is disappointing, it feels a bit like being in New York City. Room-to-room noise was nil, which was great, but I also wasn't there over the weekend when the nightclub is open. One review complained of the traffic noise at the pool, but when the music is on (which is almost always), I couldn't hear the traffic at all. If traveling with a companion, make sure you are very comfortable with each other as bathroom noise privacy is virtually nonexistent in the room. I spoke to three different concierges who were all super helpful. They arranged a discount on a rental car right across the street and recommended great places for surf lessons and snorkel gear. The rest of the staff was friendly and helpful especially housekeeping, the bellhops and pool attendants, but wait service at the pool was slow and sporadic. Food was decent, not amazing, but in general I'm disappointed with most food in Hawaii. Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurant is well designed with a friendly staff, and some items are slightly cheaper than the hotel menu. Having lived in Los Angeles with some of the world's best sushi, I was not wowed by the food, but it was good and the Hamachi Tartare appetizer was out of this world. The hotel fronts the marina, which is actually quite pleasant and calm, compared to ultra crowded Waikiki Beach (just a short walk way). It's a bit of a trek to the center of Waikiki, but a nice walk. Ala Moana Mall is very close if you need to get a shopping fix in. Do yourself a favor and rent a car for at least a day, so many amazing beaches and sights are a short drive away. The crowd at the hotel seemed like a mix of young friends, couples, and some families with kids. I was a bit surprised to see families at this type of hotel, but they were all very friendly and respectful. Both pools are great (the adult pool is designed to be a mellow soaking pool) and never too crowded. Free internet worked well. The movie selection on the TV was fantastic, although expensive, $14 a pop. Room service was quick. Luggage delivery was slow, but prompt once they found out I was still waiting. The business traveler might enjoy this hotel, but bring your own computer. The business center charges by the minute for their computer use (unless you're printing a boarding pass, which is free). I didn't use the spa so I can't comment on that, but I was told that I could use the spa facilities to change and shower while waiting for my room to be ready. If you're looking for the resort experience, this is not for you. If you're looking for a quiet peaceful getaway-from-it-all place, this hotel isn't for you. But then again neither is Waikiki. It's a hotel with lots of amenities and service on the slightly higher-than-average side, in the middle of a bustling city that happens to have a world class beach nearby. And it will only take you a minute to get from your room to any of the public areas (unlike a resort). It seems the boutique hotel trend has yet to make much headway in Hawaii. The Modern is trying to meet that need and they are doing a good job, but with a few improvements (mainly noise), they will have repeat guests.

I recently stayed at the Modern Honolulu on a business trip with a few added days of leisure.

The hotel lobby was inviting, with an additional tucked away lounge area that doubled as a bar at night and club on the weekends. The front desk, concierge, and valet staff were friendly and very courteous. \u00a0The concierge was able to rent cars for us the same day, and was conveniently located just across the street. The rooms were crisp white with a touch of Hawaiian flair, and very clean. Although my room didn't have the best view, the extremely comfortable bed and pillows made it worth it! The large flat screen and free Wifi were an added plus! Both pool areas were relaxing with it's lounge chairs, lounge beds, and gorgeous bay views. The ambience at night- the lights in the trees, ocean breeze, and soft Hawaiian music in the background. \u00a0The poolside staff service was so-so.. there were more not-so-helpful food service attendants than friendly ones. \u00a0However, the special pizza (of the day) and the pork tacos were our group's favorites! \u00a0We frequented Morimoto's Restaurant in the hotel for both breakfast and dinner. We loved the contemporary oceana decor, not to mention the food was excellent! The breakfast Banana Pancakes are a definite must try!!\u00a0If diners are more your style, the Wailana Cafe is just a short walk away.. Great food for the value with excellent courteous service! As for catering our conference meetings, the staff were friendly and helpful. \u00a0For the most part the food was good, there just seemed to be quite a few things that ran out quickly- food and iced tea (breakfast and lunches), water on the conference tables, and napkins.

This put me off wanting to spend money I would have willingly parted with, had I not felt so completely bullied. They tried to charge us $65 per night for an air mattress for my children that was very nearly deflated half way through the night. The staff at the poolside were snobbish and ignored people that were not clearly well off. They gave poolside beds to their friends that would have cost guests in excess of $150 just to reserve for a day. One of the bartenders was extremely rude and inappropriate with me. When I complained to management, they credited our account $50 and refunded our drinks. This was a nice gesture but the attitude of the staff did not change and the offending person was not required to make an apology, which, in truth, was all that was required. There were several charging mistakes made with our account as well. They were charging us for the 'bed' after I'd had it removed when it deflated on the first night. I was summoned to the front desk to be informed they required more money from me, only to find they had been charging our room for a week at $65 per night for a blow up bed we didn't have! The day before, we were told at the bar that there was no money on the account. That was a mistake on their part as they had put the account under the wrong name. Needless to say I was not impressed at all with the incompetence that seemed to be prevalent in this '4 star' hotel. I regret wasting my money and it really is a shame.

You're so close to being amazing! The rooms (most of them, at least) are so stylish and glam. The property is stunning - you're never far from a pool or a cocktail. The food is insanely good. The location rocks, particularly for a business traveler like me: easy access to the airport, near central Waikiki but close enough to the edge that it's not a zoo. I also love that this hotel is not too big. You can always find a lounge chair or a server. It feels manageable, unlike that mega-theme-park behemoth next door. While most of Waikiki is overrun and overwhelming, the Modern is cool and relaxing. I love the vibe here. The service, however, stinks. I have stayed here multiple times and can attest that it's not an isolated incident. There are, as always, a few dedicated staff that do a great job (approaching me with a cocktail in hand helps), but overall, they desperately need senior hotel management to come in and crack the whip. A few, but not all, incidents: The bellhops have alligator hands when it comes to opening doors or carrying your luggage down the few steps to the driveway. There is ALWAYS a line at the front desk. There is nowhere to get coffee before 7am, unless you want to pay $11 for room service; $17 for a large pot (with one mug! This despite the waiter entering the room and seeing a second, clearly caffeine-deprived person there). The room reservation system doesn't sync up with what is available, and the person I spoke with invented a room that did not, in fact, exist (ocean front with two double beds), although they were happy to charge me for it. It was corrected only after the front desk sullenly failed twice, including attempting to put me in rooms that were getting progressively worse, and I demanded to speak to a manager. These and other unlisted incidents are, admittedly, not deal-breakers. But they do add up, and simple things like asking for your check so you can catch a flight, only to watch the server stand around and talk to her friends while the clock ticks, are unnecessary and stressful. I always stay here and will continue to. However, like most hotels in Waikiki, the Modern isn't cheap, nor is hotel management and service some unfathomable mystery. Get it together, folks!

The bathroom was lovely with a great walk in rain head shower. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but the reception staff did provide a kettle when one became available the following day. However nothing else to make a drink was provided but a bit of improvisation sorted that thanks to the local abc store over the road! The pool areas are beautiful and the staff are very attentive. We were a bit dissopointed however to find the adults only lagoon is actually only ankle deep but the surrounding terrace is great. The sun beds are very comfortable and fresh towels are provided daily. The other sunrise pool was also very good with a reasonable sized pool it was a little crowded at the weekend but we never had a problem gettin a lounger. The beds around the edge of the pool are expensive having to spend $150 from the bar to use one all day. We were on a bed and breakfast package and couldn't fault the food or the service there was a good selection of food and the quality was excellent.

The young lady at the desk was also very friendly and gave a quick run down of the property (where the pools were, restaurant and coffee service in the morning and access to Addiction).

The Modern employed a talented interior designer to give the entire hotel a very unique and specific look- it's like a beach house, but newer and cleaner. All the wood is bleached white like driftwood, the light fixtures have an old-school maritime look, and a lot of the space is divided by slatted wooden blinds which you can open and close, just like a little cottage on the sea. The issue with the bathrooms is that those slatted blinds make up a large portion of the wall in front of the toilet. People on either side of the blinds can open and close them at will, so there's a privacy issue there, but more to the point: there's a lot of air between those slats. They're absolutely no barricade to <ahem> \"sounds and smells\". It's like putting the toilet out in the middle of the room. I thought everything else about the rooms was just fine- they're very, very clean (everything, from the walls to the sheets to the comforters, is pure white, so they have to be). The beds were quite comfortable, and I'm a stickler when it comes to mattresses. Overall, it's about what you would expect if you're paying top-dollar for a premium hotel, which in this case, you are. Where The Modern really stands out is with its outdoor pool/bar/restaurant area, which they quite rightly use as the image for their hotel. It is a gorgeous space, with nice landscaping, very cool seating areas (including middle-eastern style lounging beds), and wonderful lighting which really cranks up the romance at night (the giant glowing neon blue elevator bank from the hotel next door ruins the effect somewhat, but who's counting?). You can chill in the lounge area and watch the ocean from afar with the marina in the foreground (also not bad to look at), or you can follow the boardwalk a few hundred yards down to the beach itself. It's a convenient spot. The service was impeccable. Very professional, very friendly from the folks behind the desk to the porters to the valet. The guy behind the desk called another hotel for me to help me book a room for another leg of my trip- come on, that's good service. Where things broke down a bit was when I hung out by the pool at night. It can be very, very difficult to get service out there. There were long lines at the bar, few waitstaff taking orders, and it felt like they were understaffed by a lot. I gave up on my drink order and just bought an entire bottle of wine so that I wouldn't have to beg someone for service again.

I was worried when we first booked our room because we were traveling during the high season. That being said the hotel did not feel cramped at all, getting a chair by the pool or a pool bed was easy enough, but the place did not feel empty; it felt comfortable. The cleanliness is off the charts and with all the white they definately hold themselves to a standard. Very few hotels with them being transitional in nature would dare to use white and instead use patterns that can hide dirt. The service was off the charts. I want to give a very big shout out to Carlie (i hope i spelled her name right). She said she is new in her profession of being a concierge but you would never know. She worked hard to provide us with the entertainment we wanted and more than that when we wanted to drive around the island she gave us an itinerary with personal notes and not just something the hotel gave as a canned tour. Service has declined so much over the last decade it was good to see this place is not amongst the rest. When we extended our stay an extra day the hotel front desk worked to make sure we did not have to move rooms (Thanks Jermaine). We were also upgraded because they had space at no charge, something that hotels stopped doing for whatever reason; but is something that causes me to be loyal. The poolside staff was both hard working and attentive. Now that the love fest is over; here are the issues i had that kept me from going five circles.(I think they are supposed to be stars but they just look like circles to me) One of the three elevators was out for a couple of days which made going up and down a hassle (but it was fixed after a few days). They do not have two pools only one, the one not on a wooden deck is only three inches deep and is more estetics than actual pool. The drinks were a little high even by hotel standards. And i have to say, i like a good Mai Tai and this hotel makes about the worst one i have ever had. The one that is deconstructed is also a disappointment. I am not sure how a hotel of this price and star rating has no jacuzzi, but it does not. The club on Fri. and Sat. is loud, i heard it from my 9th floor room so keep that in mind when staying. They did not allow a late checkout but that was not a big deal, but be mindful of it when you plan your trip and ask ahead if it is something you need; and i assume they would have if they could have. If going to the beach is something you are looking to do, The Modern is a little hike to the beach and at it's price point it may be a factor. It is a very small walk to the Ala Moana mall which as far as malls go is very nice. However, the hotel is about a Ten dollar cab ride into the thick of Waikiki. On a positive note if you are going to be staying in Hawaii for the 4th of July there really is no better place to stay for the third largest fireworks display in the United States. We watched the fireworks from the pool and saw every bit of it with comfort and ease. The pool area was both inviting and quiet and offered lounge chairs in a few inches of water. All in all we had a good stay, If you are looking for one of the few boutique hotels that gets it right give The Modern a chance.

We were disappointed after our 3-day of stay! We were native to Oahu and visitting Oahu at least twice per year for the last 5 years. We have stayed at the Hyatt Regency, the Hilton village and the Mariott Waikiki beach! After having dined at Morimoto's restaurant in January and seen the pool area and read some of the reviews, we decided to stay at the Modern. When we got to the hotel, the valet service was quite slow. There was no one greeting guests. The checking-in process was so so! The partial ocean view room costed approximately $300 plus per night. The room was cleaned and modernized with white wall, furniture and bed! The pool is quite nice. However, during our stay there was a wedding going on at the upper sunset deck, hotel guests were all crowded in the lower pool deck. The gym was small with some equipments but clean. The staff is average, doing their jobs with minimal effort. There was no \"usual aloha smiles and warmness!\" Perhaps, being modernized is meaning to be sterile and cold! The hotel is closed to Ala moana shopping center but quite a walk to waikiki. If you have a car, it will cost $28 per night to park. Taxi cost approximately $15 including tax to waikiki. The hotel does not have a hospitality room for late flight guests. You can leave your luggage with the valet and use the pool. We were told that we could shower at the spa 's shower before 5:30pm. There was no late check-out accommodation. Bottomline, the Modern is all about eye candy but lack of personality, warmness, convenience and comfort towards an unforgetable vacation!

McDonalds across the street as well as Kimo Bean for good coffee. Staff is nice and friendly. This is no W Hotel - where the staff is stuck up. It's real and fun. The lobby is fun, bright and welcoming. The valet staff is SUPERB. Very good, very friendly and fast - that is what you want. The Studio downstairs is fun for coffee in the AM or drinks in the PM (it's hidden behind this cool bookcase). The pool deck and pool are PERFECT. Just the right touch of calm, modern and a great salt water pool, that is perfect temperature all the time! The lounges are luxurious and spacious. Perfect. Pool staff is good, but they might need one more person on all the time to get to everyone. Bar staff is nice as well. One issue is that you can't bring food from outside to the pool (we tried to bring breakfast back and they kicked us out due to the breakfast service there) but take it to the 2nd floor and the upstairs pool deck and you will be all set. Very nice. GREAT VIEWS of some of my favorite south shore surf spots from the deck as well. Miramoto (Iron Chef) has a restaurant on the 1st floor as well as a very trendy shop for the tastemaker in you. Rooms are PERFECT - super bright, clean, NEW, great TV and iPhone sound system. Simple and clean. Bathrooms are equally as good. Nice terrazzo sinks! Most of the rooms are partial ocean view so nice. Maid service is friendly and fast. Very good. Our room was a nice oasis from it all. Last note - there is a club that opens in the hotel on Friday and Saturday so be prepared for noise till 3am on those nights with people leaving the club on the Hobron Lane side of the building.

I saw at least 3 other families during my one night stay and all were welcomed, behaving and not. The rooms are exceptionally comfortable. While the asthetic is modern, it is not a harsh, ultra white kind. There are wonderful creature comforts like soft (cashmere?) ombre throws and brightly colored ukuleles. Some decorators remove all funcational items to make it looked modern, but The Modern gets it right by keeping towel racks and clothes lines while still looking clean and uncluttered. Shower only; no tub. The beds and pillows are just right; not overly firm or soft. The headboard is padded for nice reclining. I could not find any aspect that was worn, or needed touching up. It was clean to perfection. I almost wondered if we had a brand new room. Room service was super fast and hot. The menu included haute cuisine as well as kids items. I have included a photo of the \"pleasure package\" including useful agave flavored items. The tv channel and movie selection was extensive and varied between kids options, cultural interests and current releases. Check in and out was exceptional. I booked for the wrong day and there was no hassel. My kid wanted the ukulele and the gift shop was closed. No problem, they got it for me while we got our bags. The breakfast in the restaurant was divine. The best cappacino I have ever had. My daughters French Toast was deeply flavorful, not just sweet. They rushed our service because we needed to make time to the airport. I mean, could they have done better? Not at all. OK wait. One thing. We stayed in room 1234 and there was some traffic noise.

The manager refused to address us directly and instead sent the lady at the desk running back and forth to relay information to us. When asked for some compensation for the lack of sleep (maybe 2-3 hours total) we were advised because we had no incidentals charged (i.e. did not spend extra money at the hotel) we could not be compensated for our trouble. The Modern is more concerned with the money they are bringing in at the nightclub and those \"guests\" than they are with the comfort of the guests staying at the hotel and who are seeking a good night's sleep.

This is part of a continuing series of my impressions and experiences staying at various hotels and resorts while traveling to attend concerts worldwide. This review is for The Modern in Hololulu, Oahu, Hawaii. I have additional photos on my site. Property: The Modern Honolulu Location: Honolulu, Oahu (Hawaii) Address: 1775 Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, Oahu, HI 96815 Phone: (808) 970-4161 Website: www.themodernhonolulu.com Room Type/Class: 3 \u2013 Ocean View (Room 816) Date: May 19-20, 2012 TripAdvisor Page/Reviews: LINK Booking Source: Direct Overall Rating: 3.75/5 [Note: Score is totally subjective based on price, location, and comparison to \"like\" properties within same area and price range] I choose The Modern Honolulu in searching for a property for a one night stay in the Honolulu/Waikiki area, and chose this resort based on TripAdvisor reviews. This was my first visit to Honolulu, so do not have any competing properties with which to compare. The Modern has a well-staffed valet service, but the drive up to the property can be problematic, depending on the time of day and traffic. If approaching from the opposing side of the street, I found that other drivers can easily block entry into the drive up area, leaving you stranding and blocking traffic for five minutes or more (there is no center turning lane, so you are literally blocking the fast lane on the street). It\u2019s not so much attributable to lack of space, but lack of management. This was especially problematic at night, due to non-guests visiting their nightclub. So depending on your arrival and how backed up their valet is, this can lead to a negative/frustrated first impression, as you are left waiting in the street with your turn signal on for up to ten minutes, and when you finally have space to pull in, and there is room for many cars, you are left wondering who is in charge of the mess. The Modern lives up to its name, as it is very trendy, hip, and contemporary in appearance in the lobby and rooms. Check-in was fairly smooth; the room I had booked was not ready, so I opted to accept a lesser room in order to not have to wait for the one that was apparently in a better location. This is one of those hotels where you need to use your room key to activate the elevator; I suspect this is in part due to the aforementioned nightclub and flood of young/immature people that populate the common areas at night. The room itself is very clean and neat, with modern-style decor and appointments (kind of like an Ikea showcase). Not large, but certainly big enough for one or two people. In addition to the bed is a (very) small desk and lounge. I hard a challenging time finding outlets for electronic devices, and finally figured out that there were a few along the side of the desk. The room included a balcony with chairs and a small table, with a view of a marina off to the side. This room faced out the front of the hotel, and I found that it was a very noisy street below, in terms of traffic as well as noise from people (especially at night), even from the 8th floor. The resort features a really nice outdoor pool (with beach-like sand) with a full bar. Overall, the property skews very young, hip, and, for lack of a better term, \u201cattractive\u201d. Seems like everyone staying there must be supermodels and the like, so if you are the type who might be self conscious about that sort of thing, that is the sort of atmosphere I had found during my short stay. It definitely did not come across to me as family friendly at all, especially at night. It is a great hotel if you are young and looking for a place with nightlife and the like; if you are not, you might be annoyed by that sort of thing going on in and around the resort. It would seem that the former is the sort of clientele that they are cultivating. It is also not very close to what some would call \u201cthe action\u201d in and around Waikiki \u2013 you really need to get in your car or a taxi to local attractions. They also charge $28/night for valet parking, which seems like a lot since incoming traffic is not really managed at all, leaving you waiting in the street for up to ten minutes just to pull up to the lobby area of the hotel. I would probably not stay here again, but don\u2019t say that as a non-recommendation, just that I had no interest in that sort of scene even when I was younger, so just not my kind of hotel.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Waikiki\u201d", "Author": "ChrisGe1775", "ReviewID": "UR130717795", "Content": "I travel to Honolulu a lot for work (tough, I know) and The Modern Honolulu is my favorite place to stay by far.

I especially like the folks in the Lobby Bar, the front desk, and the valets, who always greet you with a smile.

I just popped over to the ABC store across the street and they had an amazing little deli there. The staff were wonderful to us. The rooms are white but with just enough wood accents to make it an elegant room. Very roomy. At night we would sit on the lounge chairs at the pool and just soak in the beauty of the stars and the lights throughout the pool area. During the day the pool area was very quiet and relaxing. You are steps away from the beach. The Hilton hotel has adorable shops. We loved the live acoustic groups at the Hawiian Village that would begin playing around 5pm. The Hawaiin Village is right after you walk around the lagoon to get to the Hilton. There is one group called Johnny Pirahna and they played 70's and 80's music on Wed. or Thursdays. People were standing all over the place listening to them. We had such a good time. The mall isn't too far; a 7 minute walk. Just walk across the street to the ABC and stay on that same side of the street and walk towards the mall. Duke's is a good restaraunt which is on the beach and the staff is very friendly. They also had great music at night. We went to a great Seafood Buffet. It is almost at the opposite end of the beach by the Pacific Beach Hotel. There is a two story aquarium in the restaraunt and at 10pm a scuba diver and a women dressed in a mermaid outfit popped into the tank and fed the fish. The buffet is huge; seafood, beef, pork, salads and tasty desserts. You must go to Haunama Beach but it closes at 7pm. Very beautiful. Great snorkelling. Waimea Valley is a beautiful place to go to, but it's at the North Shore. The North Shore is green, lush with many awesome beaches to snorkel. Sharks Cove was awesome to snorkel. You must buy the banana bread that is sold as numerous roadside stalls. So good! ! Pearl Harbour is amazing. Take lots of water and a hat.

Having stayed in and seen many kinds of hotels and accommodations, including both of the venerable old Waikiki classics, I have to say The Modern Honolulu is my favorite. I acknowledge that, while it is not located on the central beach or in the middle of the Waikiki action--it's on the Ala Wai yacht harbor--it is close enough to walk to everything, including Ala Moana Beach Park & Magic Island, the Ala Moana Shopping Center, and central Waikiki. The hotel's location is a plus for me; it is quieter and easier to navigate by car than its counterparts in the middle of Waikiki. The hotel itself: beautifully and whimsically modern. The room is generously sized, with a king bed and a day bed and plenty of room to walk around and to stow belongings. The bed, linens, and towels are plush and comfortable. The bathroom is sleek and modern with an outstanding glass-and-tile shower. Additionally, toiletries & amenities are plentiful and high quality. The balcony is large and bowed, affording views in multiple directions--and, no, I did not have a full ocean or harbor view. Nonetheless, it was a sensational view and a great place to linger for a few moments when I wasn't busy doing all of the other fun things that Oahu offers. The room was exceptionally clean and included all the essentials--a fridge, which can be stocked as a mini-bar if desired, a safe, an iron & board, free Wi-Fi, and plenty of outlets for plugging in and recharging electronic gadgets. The pools are elegant and visually stunning and great places to relax and just hang out. The poolside attendants are just that: attentive. I felt pampered in the little bits of time I spent there. The staff, from the front desk staff, to the attendant who brought ice to the room upon request, to the housekeeping staff could not have been more pleasant or more attuned to fine and unobtrusive service!

The maid cleaned our room and then refreshed everything in the evening. The staff at the pool and bars were so nice and helpful. Gabrielle at the front desk was great too, she helped get us switched to a room that was further away from the club.

The Ala Moana Shopping Centre is a five minute walk down the road and although its a 15 minute walk to the heart of Waikiki, its an enjoyable one. There is also good access to the Hilton lagoon. We would definately recommend dining at Morimoto - a Japanese restaurant located in the Modern. Some of the best Japanese food we have had in a while. Also, the Lobby Bar is a great place to have a few drinks on a Saturday night. During our stay, we also spent a few days at the Sheraton Waikiki. In comparison, the Sheraton is definately more of a family resort, whereas the Modern is a funky hotel, that is less chaotic.

We slept in a room for 2 nights where staff didn't take much interest in ensuring that our window could lock - even after a cranky employee from maintenance assured us it was fixed when he stood there as we tried to force it shut all the while saying it was ok. The safe in our room containing wallets, passports, mobiles and jewellery simply ceased working and it took staff an extensive amount of time to try and open it - all the while having to wait in the room until the issue was fixed, unable to get out and go to the beach or shop. There are no kettles in the room so you can't make tea or coffee. Ordering boiling water and mugs from room service took 1 and a 1/4 hours one night - and when we wanted clean wine glasses, it took 3 calls to reception before they were even brought up. Housekeeping doesn't service the rooms until late in the afternoon - at least they didn't for most of the days we were there. The staff are very keen to push drinks on you whilst at the pool at all times of the day - probably because they want the tips but I wouldn't recommend eating breakfast at the hotel - it is expensive and the wait staff were generally appalling. We had one lovely waiter on our last day who was exceptional, but the day before he was hopeless. This hotel lacks consistency in every regard. Management take no interest in how happy their guests are - I spoke with the duty manager one day who assured us everything would be fixed and it wasn't. The staff at the front desk are generally pleasant - with the exception of one girl whose behaviour towards paying guests was unprofessional, rude and simply lacking maturity. If you choose to stay at this hotel, my recommendation would be to have few expectations and don't spend the majority of your time there - get out and enjoy the beautiful city and beach and shopping. Honolulu is a marvelous place but this hotel will disappoint. I will not be returning to the Modern and will be recommending to anyone who asks about this hotel to give it a miss .

We stayed in an ocean view suite overlooking the Ala Moana harbor. The room was done in all shades of white with colorful accents, it kind of reminded me of a villa in Greece. There were two rooms and a bathroom all decked out in beautiful linens, big screen TV's in the sitting room as well as the bedroom and two balconies. The pillows and quilt were made of feathers which I love but my daughter is very allergic, so we called the front desk and they switched out the feather items, asap. I cannot say enough about the staff, they knew our names, they were excited about my daughters competition and asked her for daily updates, which made her feel very important, they happily held her longboard at bell desk. Her shortboards were transported to the room on the 15th floor without even a blink of the eye. Everybody was very welcoming and epitomized the laid back luxury feel. We dined at Iron Chef Morimoto's for lunch the first day there and it was beyond delicious, a must when visiting Honolulu. We also went to the pool bar at sunset, there was pleasant live music and the Maitai was perfect. The crowd was 30 to 40 and chic but casual.

I fully agree with the other positive reviews. The hotel lives up to its name: it's modern and new. The hotel staff were friendly, and went above and beyond the usual customer service to make guests feel both comfortable and welcome. I stayed in a city view room, king suite on the 12th floor. I had a view of the city, the water (marina and beach) as well as the mountains. The room is more than ample, and I loved the walk in shower, large balcony and the comfortable chaise lounge! The teak louvered sliding door was wonderful to keep the sun out, provide privacy and let the natural breeze cool the room while leaving the balcony door open. Free wifi was a wonderful bonus. The tv was massive with a standard cable selection. The pool area was spacious, with lots of lounge chairs and covered areas (trees and umbrellas for shade). The pool deck is wooden which adds to the stylish look. The pool is heated and open 24 hours. The second pool is a bit of a misnomer - I wouldn't call it a wade pool, more of a reflective surface, but the area is fantastic with palm trees, sand, lounge chairs and hammocks. I only ate at the hotel (lunch) once, and that was by the pool area. The prices are pretty standard for the food in comparison to the other hotels in the area. The meal was excellent, so no complaints. However, you are within walking distance of plenty of cheaper food options: the food court in the Ala Moana Shopping Centre and the Royal Hawaiian offer excellent choices and there are lots of other restaurants in all price ranges. I ended up eating breakfast at the McDonalds on the corner and using their free wifi as well. Across from the McDonalds is one of the many ABC stores, where you can pick up ready made meals, drinks and snacks with which you can stock the bar fridge in your room - all of the Waikiki hotels seem to allow this. I'm not much of a drinker, so I didn't try out the very cool hotel bar, but the drinks I saw were very generous. I was a bit concerned about the location when I booked, but that was really of no concern. You are less than a 7 minute walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, and a 20 minute walk to the main drag in Waikiki. You can either walk along the main road or walk along the beach. This is the first time I didn't even bother to swim in the ocean - I just loved hanging out and using the pool! As others have mentioned, this is a chic, boutique hotel but it's not pretentious in any way and people of all ages and backgrounds were staying there. The only downside was that they ran out of the free iPads while I was there.

The hotel was recommended to us by a friend who went in January. The best part about the hotel is its location. Away from the hustle and bustle of the Waikiki Beach hotels and their overcrowded pools and beaches but easily within walking distance (15 minutes). The rooms are very nice. We saw other reviews about the noise from the nightclub. We requested a room on the upper floors. We were on the 16th (of 17) floors. We didn't hear a thing from the nightclub...just the ringing of the trolley bells, which was not a problem. Our room overlooked the pool. What a great view of the pool, the marina, and the ocean. The room was was neat and clean with twice a day servicing. However, the carpeting wasn't done very well. You could see that the carpet was just laid down and not properly nailed around the edges. But the best part of the room was the bedding. WOW!....the bed was soooo comfortable and the sheets and pillows are made by Frette, which is great brand. Very nice! The pool staff greet you and take you with towels and chair covers to the pool deck. As people leave, they clean up the towels and set everything back up for the next people. So there is no need to come down at 7am and save chairs. I would say that while the hotel might be family friendly, the pool area is not meant for rambunctious kids. There were some young kids running around and that was quite annoying. Staff were pretty good about warning them. The vast majority of the people at the pool were adults; there to relax, get some sun and read. The pool is a mix of salt water and chlorine. The temperature was perfect. Friends of our who were staying at the Moana Surfrider came by were jealous of the pool area. The pool menu is very good. They changed the drink and food menu while we were there, so I assume they're good about mixing up their menu's on a regular basis. The food and drinks aren't cheap, but they're in line with typical hotel pricing. Staff were always good about seeing if you wanted more to drink or eat. And if not, they would top up your water. Also, each afternoon they come around with complimentary sorbet. We never ate at Morimoto's. Our friends who recommended the hotel ate there and said not to waste our money. Too much money for too little food. Overall we recommend the Modern. It exceeded our expectations by a long shot. Don't be swayed by the negative reviews.

When you walk into the lobby it looks very minimalist - however the rooms are anything but. They have a 5 star feel to them - furnishings, linen and toiletries are top class. The pool area is the real stand out - a swanky resort style pool - not large - but then there seem to be no large pools in this area where real estate is precious.

But let me state that I prefer modern design hotels (also, usually means less kids) and this one is exceptional. If you are someone who prefers Hawaiian theme for their Hawaii trip, then this wouldn't be the place for you. The rooms are so comfy and well-appointed. The shower is large and one of the greatest aspects of it, were the handle and shower head were on opposite walls, so you don't get sprayed when you first step in. Why isn't every hotel shower like that? The bed was so comfortable. I was fortunate enough to have a room with balconies overlooking the pool and ocean. There are so many different areas in this hotel to sit and relax in a posh cozy setting. The outdoor bar, the indoor bar behind the bookcase, the lobby, the sofas near the pool deck are nicely hidden so you get to be outside but you are not in the sun. Cruise the whole place so you don't miss an ounce of the great detail that has been put into this place (but wear a sweater, like every hotel -it's heavily air conditioned). The pool decks are fantastic. Can't comment on the water, didn't go in. The pool staff is ready to assist. They'll take you to a chair and put a towel (with a hoodie feature, so it stays on the chair- maybe that's common but I hadn't experienced it before and it made me happy) down for you. Servers are always coming by - so you must try their coconut mojito-delish. Sure this hotel is not on the water, but it's a hop, skip, jump and I prefer to be on the pool deck where i can have service, bathrooms, and good music (beach sand is not the nice soft sand). The only 2 complaints are: elevators are a bit slow and their mouthwash tastes like bactine (but it was a bit of nostalgia to remember bactine). But those would never stop me from coming back. Also, if you have $$$, go to Morimotto's - menu is impressive and food divine. Free wi-fi in guest rooms - nice. Also, the bus stop to go to Diamond Head is right around the corner from this hotel. Couldn't be easier. If the hotel staff tells you to take a $30 taxi there, skip it and take the bus. It's easy, cheap, and green.

I was pleasantly surprised with my experience here. I originally was booked for a 3 night stay at Ohana Melia but EntertainmentHotelBucks messed up my PREPAID reservation! The agent tried to downgrade me until I complained that I selected the OM based on the amenities. They eventually upgraded me to the Modern which I had never heard of. The Modern IS NOT in the heart of Waikiki which is why I never looked into it. It's in the marina area which is at the end of Waikiki with views of boats. You have to walk down this walkway to get to the beach so it isn't exactly on the beach. Not subtracting stars for this since I was familiar with the marina area. You do however have a ton of buses right in front of the hotel which I made use of (no need to rent a car in Honolulu IMO, maybe just rent if you are going to the North Shore for the day). Walking distance is an ABC store, Subway, Enterprise, Red Lobster, IHOP, Waiana Coffee Shop (best restaurant in Honolulu IMO), McDonalds, some bars, and some Japanese restaurants. All the restaurants walking distance are cheap to reasonable. My room had a fridge which I stuffed. I asked the bell boy who came in if I could put in things and he said no problem. I never had a problem with using the fridge, but I never had a cleaning lady come in. The room was chic, all white and wood, with a comfortable bed, plenty of towels, a huge shower, and a nice big T,V. I stayed in room 820 which had 2 double beds instead of just 1 (all that was left without having to pay extra) which was fine. It was technically a city view but I still had a nice partial view of the marina. Had no problems with outside noise. They also had decent shampoo, conditioner, and soap in the room, and q tips which was nice. Oh yeah. Really cool feature that I have never seen before. They keep sarongs in the room for you to wear during your stay! I accidently took the bright pink one home to me so if a worker is reading this, I will happily return it the next time I am in town! The main reason I liked this hotel is it had excellent customer service. Every worker was friendly and helpful. They let me use the spa shower hours after my check out time and let me tell you the spa shower was great! Again great products in there, no one was in there but me, and as silly as it may sound it was a nice way to end my stay at the hotel LOL. I never went to either bar or ate any food there, so no opinion on that. I saw both pools but never used them. I don't get why I would lay out at a pool when I'm in Hawaii! I did think it was odd like the reviews here say that they didn't have a hot tub, but again I wouldn't use it anyway. They have no hidden fees and no fees for the internet (wifi in the room and a router if you want to hook up). They do charge for valet (who doesn't in Honolulu?), but right next to the hotel there is a much cheaper paid lot. Again no need to rent a car in Honolulu IMO. This had the vibe of Vegas hotels that cater to an under 40 crowd, but no one was pretentious, snobby, or anything like that (I wear cheap clothes and I'm average looking so I like places that cater to average to ugly people LOL). It all in all was a nice experience and wouldn't mind staying here again if I can get a good deal. I like how they didn't have too many kids staying here (I don't want to be around kids during my vacation).

I'm still rather annoyed (borderline angry?) at how nobody gave a darn that we were guests there. The front desk staff were robotic at check in (\"we have this on the second floor, and that on the third floor, blah blah\" without eye contact). When we got to our room, it was still being cleaned -- and it continued to be cleaned for about 20 minutes -- while we waited awkwardly on the bed. The hipster-y, \"i'm way better than this job\" attitude we consistently got from waitstaff at the bar and the restaurant (er, the wobbly tables around the pool) was annoying. They were slow. They messed up our orders (and, to their credit, fixed them). Coffee was always cold and/or old. The breakfast potato \"tube\" is silly and overthought.

My husband was working and needed to rest so we put the do not disturb sign out for a few hours until we left that evening knowing that our room would not be serviced and we were fine with that. When we returned the room was not serviced (as we expected) and we had a message that we had to come down to the desk to retreive as they would not inform us over the phone. After waiting in line at the desk for over 7 minutes (there is only one clerk working at 9pm, inadequate staffing is not really an \"upscale\" hotel feature either...) we were informed that housekeeping wanted to let us know they didn't service the room because of the sign.

Restaurants in the area are great, some local treasures like the Chart house right across the street, of course in the hotel, the Iron Chef Morimoto's brings world class guests about the place. The staff at the property are truly amazing, especially the trio of concierge staff at our disposal, they are willing to assist with everything from maps, to reservations, car rentals, you name it, they were friendly, and the best, they did not have their hands out expecting gratuities at every turn! The wait staff were for the most part, fantastic, and the hotel bar is not only beautiful and full of ambiance during the evening, but the food and drinks are great, pricing is a bit high to be honest, and we found the bar could have had later hours, especially during the weekend nights. The proximity of the property, is amazing, right next to and very accessible to the famous Ilikai hotel and all its amenities make this hotel seem a grander scale. The pool area is fabulous, with consideration for the couples at the resort, they thought of everything here, family oriented downstairs, with loungers, food and beverage service, and upstairs, WOW very upscale private beach with a wading, lounging pool complete with palm trees, greenery, white sand. The only disappointment here was minor, not enough beverage and food service despite the amazing huge beachside bar available the F&B manager needs to get on this one! This area is supposed to be adults only, but as per usual, some guests felt that the rules did not apply to them and brought their little ones up, perhaps some enforcement would work there, again there is a great area for them below to indulge in! The rooms are all renovated, very fitting with white fresh linens, furniture and a beach theme, cleanliness is taken seriously here! The beds are very comfortable which was important as we stayed 10 nights. We were lucky enough to get a fabulous upgrade, so our balcony put us right over the pool, in line with the beach fireworks, the Ilikai property, and an amazing sunset! City views may be a bit noisy, but they have done a good job to soundproof the units. Bus access is unlimited, you can get everywhere from here! The Hilton Hawaiian is very close for shopping, walking paths everywhere take you along the entire Waikiki beach. There is valet parking and the self parking next door is close, but pricey, options are to park about a block away for less money if you don't mind the walk. There is an ABC fully stocked store right at the corner with a McDonald's for families, keeps costs down! We travel a great deal and I am a very picky customer being from the travel industry, so I like to think we have high standards and expectations, but with a moderate budget, this property fit the bill, and we will definately stay here again on next visit to Oahu!

During my stay, it seemed that they didn't have room ready for check-in by 3pm and in fact, some guests were kept waiting until after 5pm. The hotel offers a turn-down service, but missed my room two of the four nights I was there (and no, there wasn't a Do Not Disturb on my door). Rooms are okay. I wouldn't say that they are great and certainly not luxurious. Instead they are rather stark (mostly white) and not particularly large. Bathrooms are a little odd - if you are there with someone, make sure that you are very comfortable with them as the bathroom offers little privacy. Staff are pretty friendly. But, I would expect that as a luxury property (or at least laying claim to that) staff would remember guests names, valet would know that you are checking in, advance email or phone call to guests like I experience with other properties. Location is just ok. Not a place to go if you want to hang out on the beach although its about a five minute walk to the beach fronting the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Recent construction on Ala Moana Blvd makes getting into and out of the hotel a real pain if you try to do it after about 6:30 pm. This road work is expected to continue for several more months if not another year. Lobby Bar is nice and service there is good, although drinks are on the expensive side. Morimotos? Expensive and the service is so so. If you go, make sure that you have a couple of drinks as the service can be very slow.

I understand the hotel was completely refurbished about a year ago and it has a very clean, new feel to it. It's facilities lean more to the boutique side (i.e. small). Staff at the front desk were reasonably efficient. Concierge was pleasant and helpful. I have read other reviewers write that service was patchy or inconsistent. We found it the same. Our first day we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and found the menu selection small, the service ok, but we decided not to do that again. By accident we found out that it was possibly to eat breakfast outside near the pool. For six days straight we had breakfast at the pool and on the seventh it all went to hell in a handbasket. We sat down and were ignored (ie not given menus). When we finally asked for menus, the staff member was flipant to say the least. Two of us ordered and about fifteen minutes later four more people in our party arrived and eventually ordered. The mistakes, delays and shockingly bad service were laughable. I have to say though that in the end, the manager did his best to correct everything and did not charge for anything we had during breakfast. While I would rather they got it right the first time, I can't complain with how they handled the situation in the end. We (my family and I) always tip...the gauling thing is that now it is not apprecaited or accepted as a reward for a job well done, it is now expected. Our expectations however extend that when we tip, the next time we visit, the service should be excellent. They have a \"main pool\" and a \"zen\" splash pool, which is ankle deep (not for swimming). On the day we arrived the splash pool was closed in the late afternoon and evening for a function, which was OK because the other \"main\" pool was available. However on one of the days the Main pool was closed from 4pm for a function. This was not acceptable. When there is only one proper pool, it is not reasonable to close it for a private function. We went to the hotels Restaurant on the first and last night of our stay the food was expensive, but excellent. The service on the first night was very poor (and we had a US$100.00 tip whacked on the bill because we were more than six people). On the second occaision the service was excellent (so we didn't mind paying the tip). The rooms were quite expensive, but we would stay there again. While this property is a little distant from Waikiki Shopping it is very close to Ala Moana shopping centre. One of the best things about Honolulu is the shopping. The prices and the variety. I would stay at the Modern again, as I like to stay in newer hotels and most others are aging.

On a tucked away back street, across from a McD's, a Red Lobster, and a behemoth Hilton Village, is the gem of a rather drab block. The Modern is the crown jewel of the area; of all of Waikiki, in fact. I was delighted from start to finish of my visit to The Modern in January. The service was impeccable. Upon arrival, not only was I checked in early (1:30 PM), but also was I upgraded to a poolside room by Gabrielle. It is no wonder she has been mentioned several times by previous guests; Gabrielle was the perfect welcome. My luggage arrived within 5 minutes, with a warm greeting from Hana, with white cruise ship shorts and a white happy smile. The room was beautiful; crisp, clean, and dazzlingly white. The Frette linens were so alluring, it was almost debatable as to whether I should go to the sunny pool, or lie in million-count cotton. I opted for the pool...but it was a close race. On my way to the elevator, I noticed the Wall St. Journal stacked for guests to take. What a sophisticated choice. Thank god; USA Today is so...Marriott. And for those who weren't as bourgeouis, a local paper was piled right next to The Jour-null. What a nice touch. Back to the Surise Pool (not the adult one, and it was still fun for adults). I strolled past a wall adorned with Jurassic-meets-Modern pots of ferns. Tres chic. I stopped at the host, and was offered my choice of any seat. Ohh, the options. Terry-cloth robed chaises lay nonchalantly by the small, but fitting pool. Large pillow-covered beds were tucked between shady trees for loungers. I tried both. Poolside service was swift and always delivered with a smile, although on the spensy side. Get the Pimms Cup. Soooo refreshing, I ordered it, um, a couple more times... The next morning, I ordered a carafe of French-pressed coffee. It was weak and tasted like water. No problem; my server arrived apologetically in less than 5 minutes, with a robust new pot and a plate of croissants for my troubles. How about valet parking (the only option here)? Perhaps I've been to Vegas too many times, as I always cringe at the thought of waiting 30-40 minutes for my car. Under 5 minutes. Every time - even once at 3:30 AM. No, I wasn't doing anything Vegas style. It was a biz trip...I think. I'm disappointed that other travelers on this site found the lobby boring. I would call it minimalist...or maybe, Modern. But what is boring about a wall filled with a collage of old surfboards? That's friggen cool! And what is boring about a bookshelf that secretly transforms into a bar at 5 PM? Bad*ss, I say. And speaking of bad*ss, let's talk about the bar for a sec. Private, welcoming, and intimate, all at the same time. Little candlelit tables dotted the sides for budding lovers. Therefore, I headed for the bar seats. I hope everyone is as lucky as I was to have Jason serve me. Order the Deconstructed Mai Tai from him and remember why life is so worth living. Also order the seared beef I-dunno-what-it's-called-cause-I-had-2-mai-tais-already. Then, marvel over the fact that Jason hears everything at the bar, even when he is at the end talking to someone else. Amaaazing. How about business accomodations? After all, I was on a biz trip, wasn't I? So, the business center was a bit lacking. I needed a couple color copies, and the printer was only programmed for black n white. Boo. I was late and cranky for my appointment. No problem. Russell, at the reception, had the antidote. \"Well, why don't you just email it to me, and I'll print it out right here?\". Whaaat? OK! Done. In, you guessed it, 5 minutes. I was enjoying my stay so much, I decided to extend it over Friday night. I called the front desk. \"Ooh. We're sold out on Friday night. Sorry.\" Oh yeah, it was Pro Bowl weekend. Was that asking too much? Actually, no. My hero, Russell, saved the day again the next morning. \"OK. Why don't you keep your room, and we'll keep the same price bracket, too.\" Seriously. I mean, seriously? At the end of the day, we expect the big things...but remember the little things. We remember places...and especially people (notice how many names I remembered? I suck at names). The Modern hit all marks with aplomb. It was one of my very favorite hotel experiences ever.

A little too loud and I think they are trying a bit too hard to make it too \"hip\" instead of a more upscale, luxurious kind of feel like a four seasons or ritz carlton or something similar. Anyway... it was average... I wouldnt call it bad at all.. just average.

The resort is a breath of fresh air in the Honolulu hotel landscape. Go to any other hotel on the strip and you'll see pool chairs playing footsie, crowded facilities and garden variety design. The Modern Honolulu is sleek, spacious and social, hanging between Waikiki and Ala Moana beaches. A massive surfboard installation hangs above reception and the rest follows this abstractly composed aesthetic: a secret swiveling bookcase leading to the lounge; neutral rooms decorated with tropical accoutrements; an outdoor bar with picnic tables and yellow bistro tables shaded by overhanging trees, lit at night by strings of twinkly wine-bottle luminaries\u2014the list goes on. Every single one of the staff members I spoke to was lovely---helpful, kind and full of the Aloha spirit Hawaii has perfected. For this reason, coupled with the location and design, I\u2019d come back in a heartbeat. The only oddities were the reservation process, I never received a confirmation email despite contacting them three times with two different email addresses {and I diligently checked my junk mail---in case it went there---every time}. Secondly, when I arrived I asked it they could look into a room change and nobody got back to me {even though I asked twice}. Finally, my room was cleaned twice despite the \"privacy please\" door hanger. All in all their service is good, but their follow-through lacks a lot. Rooms are decorated with a white and grey color scheme mixing dark wood plantation-style shutters, a plush chaise, big screen tv and tropical touches a la lime ukulele, sea shells and 3 colorful sarongs. The pool areas play into two different resort types, the ones who want a scene and the ones who want serene. The sandy-bottomed private beach pool area has a bar {only open sometimes}, loungers partially submerged in a blue-tiled wading pool, Adirondack chairs, beach beds, and plush loungers. The sunset pool--just below---is surrounded by wooden decking with beach beds for two, a bar shaded by a small forest of overhanging trees, plush white loungers and pool attendants. I wanted to give this hotel an \"excellent\" because it is so thoughtful and smart, however, there were a few service issues I escalated, which I never heard back on. What to know --- - The location is bang-on. Close enough to the action but far enough away from Waikiki's busy walkways. - There's am ABC store {big shocker:)} across the street, which is super convenient for picking up water, bananas, mags, etc.. - Make a reso in advance for Morimoto. It's a must-try, as is the tuna pizza appetizer. - Doors to rooms are really thin, bring earplugs. - Rooms are outfitted with a ton of little extras like mouthwash and slippers. My room was missing a robe. - There are tasteful grey and beige wool carpets throughout the hotel, unfortunately, these colors stain easily and there were noticeable marks in the hallways and in my room. - Depending on where your room is, ocean view could actually mean \u201c10% hint of an ocean view with 90% street and other highrise view.\u201d - The hotel\u2019s food is decent---esp the poolside hummus & pita with balsamic-soaked tomatoes. - Happy hour at the pool is from 4 - 7. - Happy hour at the lobby bar is from 6 - 9. - Every Friday night at 7.45pm fireworks go off at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 10 mins", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience at Modern Honolulu\u201d", "Author": "CTao", "ReviewID": "UR123280831", "Content": "Great experience at this hotel.

The design is amazing as you can sit in a social area where there are lots of full length chairs to sun yourself. Or you can stay on the Upper level - they have full sun beds with big pillows and lots of towels. 2) The Hotel room was spotless and was cleaned everyday to perfection. There is a bar fridge I did not use as it is on the pricey side as are most Hotels - lots of selection if you desire. Very comfortable bed with big pillows - we had two queen size beds. The room was very large guessing it was 25 feet by 12 feet.

The hotel remodel was done by Ian Shrager and it's sleek and modern with many of the same lines one would see in a W Hotel. Beds are great, sheeting is great. Bathrooms are spacious and the towels are good. They are currently using Lather toiletries, which is different than the ones used when it was the Waikiki Edition. WiFI is slow as molasses. If you stream anything you'll be pulling your hair out. On our last stay I could swear we had twice daily housekeeping. Not now. We also had bathrobes. On this stay, I called the first night and the guy said they were short on bathrobes, but if they found any they would bring them up. This morning when I called reception, the gal was at least honest with me and said there are NO bathrobes anywhere in the hotel. The old ones had Waikiki Edition on them and they have not gotten any new bathrobes. I said I would be happy with one of the old Edition bathrobes, but she said they had gotten rid of all of them and there were literally none on property. As the Waikiki Edition, there was complimentary coffee/tea on the first floor in the mornings since the hotel did not have coffee makers in the rooms. There are still no coffee makers in the rooms and now they charge for coffee. One of the potential design flaws was the neutral cream colored carpets. We were in rooms on both the 12th and 15th floors. Room carpets are stained as are the hallway carpets. Since the hotel was just remodeled and opened in 2010, either the maintenance is way below par or the guests have unusually dirty feet. On this trip we noticed many of the pool employees taking a very casual approach to their jobs, joking around talking with one another and not being client focused. The servers were working hard but the chair attendants and one young chubby bartender were something else. One piece of advice for the bartender, don't make snide catty comments to the female server in front of guests sitting at the bar. You may think it's cute, but it's unprofessional. If she asks where her Pinot Grigio is, look at her and answer the question with respect rather than turning away and mumbling something only later to talk about getting \"tipped out\" to other bartenders. Not the interaction you need to be having in front of guests. And to the taller male pool attendant who looks Korean, don't ever refer to guests as those \"gay guys\" when joking with your colleague. It's offensive. Did you not notice there were no fewer than four same sex couples at the pool when you lost control of your mouth. Possibly you should read some marketing studies about which demographic groups have extra money to spend in establishments like this so that you can earn an hourly wage while you stand around joking all day when the manager isn't where he can watch you. Because whenever he was present, you were suddenly quite busy being busy. Another nuisance was having the adult pool closed all day long one day while the hotel staff got ready for a wedding in the evening. No one could use it so all guests were at the family pool where there were plenty of kids having a great time. If you stay here, request a room on the pool side. These are the odd number rooms. If you are on the street side, there is a tremendous amount of noise, even with the sliding glass door closed. Also note, this hotel is on the marina and there is NO beach. You can walk down the boardwalk and around a lagoon for beach access, but there is none at the hotel. Morimoto (televisions Iron Chef) is the only restaurant on property. There is bar food from a hotel kitchen, but Morimoto is the only restaurant. Breakfast for two will run at minimum $50. It's good, but not that good. Dinner with alcohol a starter and desert will easily exceed $200 and that's being conservative. A lot of celebs will stop buy if they are in Honolulu, including Reese Witherspoon, Elton John, the Obamas etc. We received a good rate for this stay, certainly cheaper than the prices when it was a Marriott, but it wasn't worth it. Between having the kid on the first night lie to me about bathrobes and then watching the pool employees in action during the day, we were left cold. Even with the hotel filing bankruptcy when they ousted Marriott, we had higher expectations for this visit.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAwful stay at the Modern\u201d", "Author": "sydneybrowndog", "ReviewID": "UR122783762", "Content": "If you are a family looking for somewhere nice and relaxing, forget the Modern.

Location: This hotel is not in the heart of Waikiki--about a 10 minute walk to the heart of the action. I appreciated that because it made getting in and out with a car much simpler. It also contributed to the more laid back atmophere. Rooms: We had a standard room on a higher floor. We didn't have any problem with noise, but we specifically asked for a higher floor. Also, the hotel was far from full. I really liked the decor--it was kind of California beach, with a touch of Hawaii. Very relaxing colors. The bed was quite comfortable, but it was a platform bed so might be difficult to get in and out of for someone older. Also I banged my ankle on the platform a few times. The bathroom was fine. The shower was huge, but not a lot of water pressure, which was a little disappointing. Note about the bathroom--if you like privacy while in the bathroom, this room is not for you. The room and bathroom are divided by louvers which can be closed, but not like a door. Room service was great but pricey. Grounds: To me, this was really the best part of the hotel. The pool areas were really nice. I felt like I was just relaxing at a really awesome beach house backyard. It is pretty intimate (ie, small). There was a beautiful tree covered area near the bar, with teak picnic tables and lounge chairs. The ipe deck was gorgeous. I could see the tops of the boats in the harbor over the hedges. Heaven. BUT, not stereotypical Hawaii. Service: I think they might still be working out some kinks. Everyone was friendly, but just seemed a little confused. It is very informal, so that might bother some expecting the full \"luxury, suck up attitude.\" Pet peeve: As has become the standard in expensive hotels, no coffee maker. You may purchase for $3/cup in the lobby. Why only 4 stars? I don't think this place is 5 stars. It doesn't have the over the top amenities to push it into that category for me.

I used Priceline and got this hotel for $99/night which is much less than the advertised price on the hotel site. I placed a bid on a 4 star hotel and got this resort class through Priceline which was a pleasant surprise. However, I don't think this hotel deserves a resort classification. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: - friendly, pleasant staff - clean and stylish rooms - fantastic housekeeping services which came to your room twice a day - complimentary bottles of water - satisfactory fitness center - has a safe - fantastic pool with great poolside service - location was accessible and close to McDonald's, ABC store, Ala Moana shopping Center, Starbucks at the Hilton, about 15 mins to Waikiki Beach - extended our check out time Cons: - shutters separating the washroom and bedroom is NOT a good idea - no privacy when in the washroom - with windows open, it was quite noisy outside - mediocre view - no coffee maker - mini fridge was too small - private beach was insignificant - lobby was nice but small - dark lighting - fee for using business center - not very kid friendly - be very cautious about the fees they charge you - they charged me 3 days of valet when I only used valet once and they charged me 2 bottles of kirins from the minibar when we did NOT have any - valet parking is a bit steep ($28/night) Overall, I was pleased with the hotel.

I booked through http://bookit.com and got an absolutely great deal. Nice Hotel, a great 3-4 star hotel but certainly NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A 4-5 STAR. Because so many people find each post so subjective I decided to start with some facts about the hotel that many people may not know and then go into my opinions. ***will explain more FACTS: -There is NO private beach *** -Valet Parking is $28 plus $1.32 every time they get your car -Rooms do not contain refrigerators for personal use*** -No coffee makers in Rooms -The Upper Pool area is often closed for \"private parties\" or require hotel guests to pay to enter -NO Jacuzzi on the premise -Free Wifi PROS (in my opinion) -Great location. A little separated from the main hustle of down town Waikiki but only a 15 minute walk to everything. Close to the beach area near the Hilton. -The pool area is great. Gorgeous views, great lounge chairs and beds, stylish bar. The so called \"private beach\" is just another lounge area but is gorgeous and a great place to hang out -The whole place is extremely clean and well taken care of -The service is good. The valet's deserve a lot of credit because they work extremely hard and are always moving fast for you. If you call guest services for ice you will have it within a few minutes at your door. -Free WIFI -The decor is pretty nice, great ideas, hidden lounges/bars, great property. Not very \"Hawaii\" more Miami feel. -Towel service at the pool is great and they have high quality towels. CONS and some major set backs during my trip -First off they should be required to remove the posting \"Private Beach\". All this area is is another pool area with sand. I heard a sales pitch for a wedding say they actually brought the sand from Waikiki beach. WHO CARES it does not make it a beach. While nice it is not a beach so please don't think you are getting a private area with the ocean or bay...you are getting a 15 foot by 15 foot sand box. Nice but not a beach. -No refrigerators in rooms. Upon arriving we got to our room and found a small fridge that was a stocked mini bar. Nice but knowing we would not use it we asked to have it emptied so we could use it and the hotel said they do not do that. I think a place trying to claim 4-5 star status would take care of the guest. -Concierge Servie is HORRIBLE. My biggest complaint came on Tuesday night. We stopped by the desk and asked for dinner reservations. We were dressed in shorts and sandals with collared shirts and stated \"we are going to dinner dressed like this\". We were recommended and given reservations at a local hotel eatery. Upon arriving there was a sign that said \"NO SANDALS AND NO SHORTS\". We turned away and found our own dinner. Once again a place trying to be an upscale hotel can not have a service like this. We were very disappointed in the concierge for our entire stay. -$28 a day for parking is one thing. But the 1.32 for each time you get your car is ridiculous. Not because I do not want to pay the fee but because at no point and no where is this price advertised; a complete unfair practice. -Once Monday came and the hotel was fairly empty asked for an upgrade to a higher floor due to noise. They could not accommodate, or they did not want to because I booked through http://Bookit.com (they mentioned the fact that i booked through an external site). Not really a big deal nor did I deserve an upgrade but I do believe you can tell a great hotel when they are trying to make you a customer for life not just one trip (i.e. Ritz Carlton, Kimpton Hotels) SUGGESTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS: DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THE HOTEL. You can get great deals on other sites that make the hotel worth it but don't pay their prices, they are not worth it yet. ASK for a high room. We stayed on the fifth floor and it was very noisy. I am not sure I would recommend this to other people. With that said I would stay here again for the right price. If anyone has more specific questions please message me. Like i said I stayed for 6 nights and got a good feel for this place. I am a very frequent traveler and have stayed in every type of hotel and many five stars and like to see places that truly offer great service to have great recommendations; I am just not sure that this is one of them. Once again I feel that this place is a nice 3-4 star with tons of potential but they have a long way to go and need some improvement to really compete with true 4-5 star hotels! If you are in the area and can find competitive prices I would check out the Halekalani-Royal Hawaiian, Westin, the Trump Hotel, and some of the Outrigger hotels.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livonia, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Strange Hotel...beware of \"Resort\" status on Priceline\u201d", "Author": "Discovision", "ReviewID": "UR121476282", "Content": "A friend and I recently stayed here.

My main concern was the noise levels that everyone complained about from the nightclub on the first floor. I decided to stay at the hotel anyways because I was really excited about the possibility of a truly modern hotel that caters more to adults than kids. We were there for our 27 year anniversary and I really wanted a low key place... I emailed the hotel several times asking to please make sure we were on a high floor away from the nightclub.... When we arrived we were greeted with cold face towels and lemonade which was very nice. I was pleased to learn that the hotel manager had upgraded us for free from a partial ocean view to a full ocean view on a high floor. The room was great and I loved the modern decor. The hotel overall was very quiet and I never even noticed the nightclub (even when we sat in the poolside bar area at night just off from the nightclub). We used the fitness club everyday and it was well kept and very nice. The pool attendants were very nice and set your towels up at the location you desired. We did not eat at the hotel except for snacking at the pool bar in the evening when we were playing cards with friends. We found a new drink that we LOVE... A blended Coconut Mojito!! Yum!!!! Internet is free and bottled water is provided daily in your room for free! Downsides to hotel: 1. We knew it was a walk to the beach and shopping and it personally didn't bother us however it is a trek to get anywhere. 2. I would highly recommend doing the package that includes parking (if you have a rental car) as it is very pricey. We rented mopeds one day (24 hour rental) and when we inquired about the cost to park them overnight at the hotel, the valet staff was rather rude and said we would have to pay between $15-$18 PER moped even though all 4 would fit in one spot!! TIP: If you do rent mopeds, the parking garage across the street lets you park in a designated area for $2.00 per moped. 3. Food and Drink is very expensive!!!

I travel extensively, understand that minibar items have high markups, and I\u2019ve generally accepted that you can expect to pay a reasonable premium to retail for the convenience. Seven times retail however is quite excessive and distasteful. It makes you feel taken advantage of. Much like over the top landline phone charges, it simply cannot be cost-justified \u2013 it is just a money - spinner for hotels when guests choose to use these services. Because I didn\u2019t remember seeing the minibar price list at the time of consumption, after checkout I returned to my room to confirm the price and lo and behold discovered that there wasn\u2019t a price list or menu in the room. So not only was the hotel charging $7 for a can of soda, they also failed to provide guests with a menu to make us aware of these prices before consuming. This is not only outrageous - it is also unethical. Tempers my enthusiasm for this hotel and I will almost certainly not return as a result, which is sad because I do like the hotel.

Since we had not looked at the Tripadvisor reviews prior to going (because of a blind reservation through Hotwire), we checked to see what people had to say. I must admit, this is the first time we are writting a review. We felt this was required, as we could not believe we had stayed at the same hotel described by other guests. We were stunned at the negative reviews. This certainly is not what we experienced. My husband and I, as well as his daughter and son-in-law were all quite pleased with the excellent service we received. We travel a lot --- all over the world! We are of the opinion that those who have complained about this hotel, are probably people who are very difficult to satisfy! Here is what we experienced. We reserved two rooms through Hotwire. When I called to confirm this with the hotel, I was told we only had one room reserved. (I truly believe this was a Hotwaire error.) I spoke with Masa who assured me that everything would be looked after. He later e-mailed me the confirmation, and called to let me know everything was OK. He also told me that because of this confusion, he would do something special for us during our stay. This was about one month before our trip. Surprinsingly, Masa followed up with me during our stay to make sure everything was to our expectation! The Check-in: we were greeted with several men to help with our luggage. We were offered tasty lemonade, and hot towels. These services were much appreciated after a very long flight. The checking-in staff (two ladies) were great. We asked for a complimentary upgrade, and received it. (We had paid for standard rooms through Hotwire.) We were upgrated to two side-by-side rooms with a great marina and ocean view. The sunsets were gorgeous. The Room: We were on the 9th floor close to the elevator. Noise was definately not a problem. The room was quite clean, inviting, and comfortable. The bed, duvet and pillows were excellent. It had a well stocked bar fridge, no drawers but plenty of closet shelving. The room was cleaned daily at a reasonable time, and cleaned again with turn-down service after we left for dinner. We were surprised to be provided with two bottles of water every night with ice in a bucket in each of our rooms. One night, we arrived back to a beautiul plate with a coconut, candies, three truffles and three maccaroons. The washroom was very modern, and a terrific shower. I must admit, the shutters opening into the room, did make for a conversation piece. We enjoyed watching the sunset from the balcony. On the last day we had lunch on the balcony and made the comment that we should have used the balcony more often. The pool area was very nice, very relaxing and the daybeds were excellent. The towel service staff were attentive to our needs. Carly, one of the concierge, was very helpful in providing guidance for activites, and driving directions. A taxi was reserved for our departure back to the airport, and we received a typed confirmation of this a little later that day. Let's not forget, we are in Honolulu -- it's a great place to walk. The location of this hotel is fantastic! We walked to the Waikiki beach (15 minutes away); we walked to Diamond Head (30 minute walk); walked along the ocean in front of all the hotels; walked all the way to downtown Honolulu to the Aloha Tower (40 minute walk), then back through Chinatown, saw the state and municipal government buildings, the palace, the king's statue, the ethernal flame, and even a bronze statue of Elvis; walked to the high end Alo Mona shopping mall (5 minute walk). Lots of choices of restaurants in the area (from inexpensive to expensive) --- from McDonalds and Subway just a block away, or a $4 breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast) a half a block further or delicious and high end restaurants --- we enjoyed an Italinan dinner at Sergio's one evening and had dinner at The Fat Greek another evening. Three car rental companies are a block away. Parking at $28 in the hotel is expensive, so we chose to park in the street about 2 blocks away for free. The outside doors were always being opened for us at this hotel! And to top off how well treated guests are --- on our last day, we asked for a late checkout. Our flight was not until 9:30pm. We were able to use our room until 2:00pm, and if we wished to, later in the day we were told we could shower and change in the spa area. Yes, there are always little things we can find to complain about, but my goodness, let's not be petty! We honestly felt when reading previous reviews, we and the other guests that had posted negative reivews, have we had not stayed at the same hotel.

The hotel service is definately 5 star....towels service, coffee service, house keeping...ect. The towels are new and fluffy and the beds are so comfy. If you are looking for a quiet romantic getaway off the beating path, I would highly recommend the Modern. It is a bit pricey, but worth it as the service is truely the best in Waikiki. The only downside,.... is... it is far away from the main Waikiki beach and drag... but great exercise to walk - 15-20mins. The hotel food prices are on the higher side. Morimotos is great - but not for everyday. In addition, the non-smoking policy should be enforced better. 2 guests - two room away were chain smoking on the lanais and I called 3 times to complain. The smell was so bad we kept our patio door closed the whole day and we had an ocean view. I would suggest perhaps, offering a a package special - in suite dining credit to attract more business.

The room was decently clean, except for a few curious stains on a day bed type lounger in the corner. The bed is pretty comfortable if you remember that the bed frame is wooden and half a foot wider than the mattress...and manage not to whack yourself walking around the bed. Internet is free and decently fast. I stay at tons of 4*+ hotels and this really did start out ok, then things started going downhill. 1) Parking is stupidly expensive. Park along the Ala Wai canal and walk for 5 minutes. It's FREE. 2) The \"ocean view\" rooms face another hotel and give you almost the same view as a non ocean view room. This is a complete scam that I didn't fall for and you shouldn't either. 3) There is no \"private beach\". It's an ankle deep wading pool a level above the regular pool with some sand thrown around it. To get to the beach is a bit of a hike. 4) The patio door is the least soundproof thing going. You hear endless traffic noise all night during the week...and then on the weekend you're treated to something really special. 5) This hotel runs a NIGHTCLUB...yes a full on NIGHTCLUB within the hotel Thursday/Friday/Saturday. If you're staying here on those days (against your better judgement given my and other very poor reviews), make sure you are in an upper level room. I was on the 5th floor and was KEPT UP ALL NIGHT BY THE NIGHTCLUB. Yes, on the 5th floor. All I could hear were beats resonating up through the floor which continued non stop well past 2am. At that point, you got to listen to all the drunk idiots on the street below yelling for the next hour plus. So umm...maybe a few floors above where I was would be better...maybe paying for an \"ocean view\" would be quieter...but that's all just conjecture. To put things in perspective, I've stayed at a few hotels where I read reviews that they were noisy. Those weren't anywhere as bad as this hotel. I found myself opening the patio door more than once wondering if it stopped ANY of the noise (barely). This property often comes up on Hotwire (5* - ha!) and Priceline (Resort - really?) for $100 a night or maybe a little more. At that price, it's STILL too much to pay given that there seem to be many many more options in the area. You certainly shouldn't be naiive enough to pay full price.

Ok...on to more bad things about this place: The place is down right noisy as it is right next to multiple streets. The hotel seemed to have ZERO concern with the level of noise late at night outside their hotel. People screaming, yelling for hours late at night. The hotel cost is also one big scam...they first try to get more money out of you for a Ocean view...$65 more. BTW, the Ocean View from this hotel sucks!!

Oh...and as I said, they did not tell us this at check-in...only at check-out. The staff at the front desk is average. The bar staff at their local bar are not very nice/freindly. We tried each bar once and no more. Another funny one: They advertise a 'private beach'....LOL...this is yet another joke....it is a shallow pool of water with sand around it and lounge chairs. The pool facility is below average too. No jacuzzi. Oh, also they kick you out at 10pm...you can't even be in the area...and they are rude about it too! On to the location: As noted before, this is a short distance away from a park with a lot of homeless people and is in a not so safe feeling area. It is a 15-20 minute walk from the main Waikiki Beach areas and shops, etc. The walk is not bad....just a pain. But you just don't feel safe walking at night in the area.

Once we\u2019d selected our tours we went to the beach and when we returned confirmation of our tours, times, pick-up locations etc.. was waiting for us in our room - The design of the outdoor areas is superb - Pool areas were awesome.

We booked this hotel when it was still being managed by Marriott and we chose it because of the modern d\u00e9cor of the rooms and the beautiful pool areas. After the change in management, we reconfirmed our rate with the hotel and got the room for 199 + taxes and fees. We loved the guestrooms at this hotel. Everything is all white and dark wood and the d\u00e9cor is exactly the modern style that we love. We felt right at home here. I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about the room. Turndown service was nice and two complimentary bottles of water were provided. The towels were replaced each evening. Housekeeping did a really good job of cleaning the room. Our room was a city view room and overlooked the parking garage and from the lanai we had a good view of the marina and ocean which was nice. The service at the hotel was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. Two things that did bother me was that we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a better room for $79 a night\u2026many good hotels with available rooms on weeknights would just provide a complimentary upgrade so I was a bit annoyed by this since the hotel seemed pretty empty \u2013 why not make a customer happy by comp\u2019ing the upgrade when the room would be empty anyway and it was a Weds/Thurs night? Another thing that bothered me was that we had to call the bell desk to ask that our luggage be brought up after we got to into the room and it took them quite a while to get up there \u2013 my boyfriend had to go down and try to find out what the hold up was\u2026this was particularly annoying bc after over 10 hours of travelling we just wanted to shower and change and go to the pool. The location of this hotel is not ideal for tourists. The beach is within walking distance but it is at the far end of Waikiki beach. We walked into the Waikiki beachwalk area where all the shops and restaurants are and it took 20-25 minutes. I think you could take the trolley there though. The hotel is within walking distance of Ala Moana Shopping Centre \u2013 which has great stores but after walking to the shops along Waikiki Beach we realized how much better the Waikiki Beach area is. After two days at this hotel, we transferred to the Trump, and I would highly recommend staying in that area as it is much more in the middle of the action and so so much more convenient! Also, some previous reviews included complaints about the street level noise \u2013 we faced the side of Ala Moana Blvd and could definitely hear the traffic but with the lanai doors closed it really wasn\u2019t horrible. It did not bother us at all, however we are accustomed to hearing downtown traffic in Toronto so maybe that\u2019s why we were not fussed. You could definitely hear noise in the hallways in the early mornings but the hotel wasn\u2019t that busy so it didn\u2019t bother us much. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for couples but not families. If the price was much cheaper than other hotels closer to the Waikiki beach strip, then it would be worth it, otherwise I would rather stay in the more central area.

Great location overall - do stay here if you like new modern hotels - but not if you like beachfront.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oahu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cTransition of branding Beware of new ownership\u201d", "Author": "ziilander", "ReviewID": "UR117470912", "Content": "I would rate this 5 stars before when it was owned by Marriott, but a 3 is generous for location. Before the transition, the staff was the best I ever stayed. Fitness center and it had a towel and ear buds ready for you. After workout, there were cold refreshing towels in the fridge to wipe your face. Right outside the door was coffee. Morimoto for lunch was awesome and valued less compared to dinner. The concierge was looking hot and new everything about eating and what to do. Chisel chin dudes open the door as you left and valet also offered bottle water for your adventure. The staff was looking very hot and sexy that made it like \"Vegas/Miami style\" hotel. Crazy Box is a guest list only club and it took us 3 ID checks to get in. WTF! We checked out of the day of transition and went over to Hilton Waikiki and that was the best decision on our part. We saw rent a cops, no white uniforms but name tags, system was done and everything was done manually. I felt stressed out for them, that is why we left and I new I couldn't get the same type of service as we did before. Chaos broke out when there was no more coffee and the staff did not know what to do. It was a big cluster @#$%! No concierge was available. I wish them luck to get back in order and it just going to be another boutique hotel with out the class of service. .", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "HAWAII", "Title": "\u201cThis is a hotel, NOT a resort.\u201d", "Author": "SURFER_DUDE44", "ReviewID": "UR117430718", "Content": "This building, which used to be part of the Ilikai Hotel, is located on the noisiest intersection, Ala Moana Blvd and Hobron, in Waikiki. Some rooms are literally right on the road and the noise is worse than a Motel 6 located on a freeway. This a not a beachfront property. It backs up to a boat harbor, but the nearest sandy beach is blocks away. The sand box by the pool is just that....a sandbox with a pool in the middle. Try laying on your lounge chair listening to the noisy traffic which is literally right below you. Also the bus fumes are a plus too. That being said, the rooms are nice except for the slotted bathroom doors (have you noticed EDITION management, everybody comments about this). Some rooms do not have a lanai so be sure yours has one before you make your booking. Although because of the noise the lack of a lanai can be a blessing. For the kind of money they charge for a room, you could do a lot better at the Hilton Hawaiian Village around the corner.......a true beachfront resort. And very QUIET. Will never stay at Edition again for that reason alone. Your whole Hawaiian experience should be a relaxing one. One without listening to police and fire sirens at all hours of the night.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cALERT!
