The location is very central close to the central station and the subway. So you can reach the Colosseum with two stops and also the area around the Spanish Steps (2 stops) or the museums of the Vatican (5 stops). The surrounding area is full of restaurants, bars and shops - noisy at night, so ask for a room facing the back. My room had every amenity I could wish for a three day stay and was compact, but clean and cozy. What makes this hotel special is the kind staff working here. Andrea from the reception was very kind, helpful and with a fabulous knowledge about what to see and to do in Rome - and how to do it the best way. If you want to go to the Vatican museums - go early! Don\u00b4t miss the churches San Clemente near the Colosseum and Sant Agnese fuori le mure with catacombs and the stunning Baptisterio Santa Constanza (These are in Via Nomentana, a little away from the bustle of the city). Favourite places to eat: Osteria Corsi, near Pantheon - I come there every year, it is a place, where people from Rome eat their lunch, no fuss, but good cooking! Good for dinner is Il Duello\" between Piazza Navona and Pantheon in a small side street. Best ice-cream ( for me better than Giolitti ) you can enjoy at \"San Crispino\" with two locations near Fontana di Trevi and one around the corner from Pantheon. In summer enjoy a coffee at the terrace of the coffeshop at the roof of the Musei Capitolini. You have all of Rome beyond your feet and you will never forget this view.

The overall experience is great. The breakfast are the best among three hotels for our Italy trip; the other two were in Florence and Venice. It had the largest food selection, the eating areas are very pleasant. We really missed this breakfast when we moved to Florence and Venice (the later one is the worst of the worst). However, it seems unlike in U.S.A., waiter/waitress constantly take the dirty plates immediately after you finish that dish, so you can have space for your next round. This hotel's waiter/waitress don't clean it until you complete your entire breakfast. We were not like it because their table is not very big unless two people take two tables. The location of this hotel is very, very convenient. It close to the central train station and you can go anywhere from there. It's only 5-10 minutes of walking to the station and it's very safe. We went out for dinner every evening and normally return to hotel around 10 pm. we never felt unsafe in any sense. If you want to get a quick bite for dinner, walk to the train station (5-10 minutes walking), the food court offers some special deals for a set of meal, very reasonable priced. But the restaurant hotel suggested to us is great, no regret at all. Actually, there is another restaurant closed to the one they suggested, and the waiter was very handsome and very pushy (always pull seat and nod to you, then tell you something like, \"come on, this seat is just for you...\"). One night, we were attracted by the waiter (I said he is handsome :-)) and sat down. Please don't make this same mistake, this restaurant with handsome waiters is not good at all. Their food is not comparable to the one that hotel suggested us (this one's waiters are older and more professional), not at all. One thing we didn't like -- the bathroom is too small. The bidet seat takes too much space and I really like they take the bidet out and make the shower space bigger. Another thing is their hand towels. I don't think those towels are cotton. They have good looking but not useable because it can't really dry hands after wash. Besides, the hand towels and bidet seat towels are EXACTLY the same. Therefore just think about it -- your hand towels could be last guest's butt towels! We didn't want to touch it at all.

There was a lot of bickering among the staff in Italian about this (after I mentioned how I had spoken to the attendant the day before and asked him to confirm). Claudio DID try to get me another tour similar to the one I missed and he was sincerely sorry for the mishap. The kicker of this story is I checked out then went to breakfast and as I was leaving to the train station - an employee hands me a \"fax\" - on top was what looked like one of those sales/time share faxes you get. On the train I look through the fax and it was SEVERAL faxes starting the 18th from the tour company trying to tell me the tour had been cancelled and trying to reschedule me!! That is NO way to run a busines. Obviously the person never \"confirmed\" my trip and giving a customer faxes several days AFTER the fact?? And I do have to agree about no internet - I was in Florence and Lake Como and had NO problems with internet there. Overall though - hotel was clean, the room was clean and a decent size by European standards. I was alone and not too worried about the location. It seemed a busy street and there were always people (tourists & regular people) around and a store or 2 opened. The breakfast was fine - when you're getting the free breakfast you can't expect a feast. It's ALWAYS a lot of carbs - even in the US. Avoid the little shop on the side of the hotel though - they sell gelato and sandwiches. I grabbed a sandwich one day and it had WAY too much mayo.

Comfortable stay. Some general observations. Firstly, the location. Having the train station and the local metro near by made for convenient transitting around the city. Unlike Florence and some of the other major tourist sites in Italy, Rome is huge. Unless you like to hoof it, take the metro to get to the sites. Easy to understand the maps and stations. Secondly, the service at times (depending on who was working) was somewhat suspect. The Front Desk staff seemed indifferent to our requests. Additionally, it was easier to go to the front desk for service vice using the telephone to call. No one answered each time I called. And surprisingly, we found it somewhat odd that we had more difficulty speaking English to the staff here in Rome than when we were in Florence. While we stayed at the Hotel Genova we experienced no hot water on one morning, a power outage, computers were down, and the obligatory Communist demonstration which proceeded in front of the hotel. Along those same lines, being in the central part of the city, you can expect to enjoy the noise from the street. Fortunately, the rooms were equipped with shudders and windows that blocked the noises at night time. Eating - When you're not sure of restaurants in the area, talk to the Bartender (not sure of his name) who kind of acted as a Concierge. Although the restaurants weren't close by, his recommendations were spot on. Rely on him to point you in the right direction. A general observation about travelling around Rome seeing the sites: Regardless of the time or date, get used to standing in lines (especially at the Vatican and Colisseum). Strongly recommend you go on-line and purchase your Vatican Museum tickets before-hand so that you don't have to wait in lines that wrap around the Vatican walls. Another thing about lines: if you have a tour in front of you, hunker down and enjoy the wait. Because they won't move, step aside, or make an effort to let you walk by. And, if you are lucky, they will share their sneezes with you without covering their mouths or using a tissue. But, the trade off from these inconveniences is marvelling at the Sistine Chapel, St. Peters, Colisseum, Roman Forum and Spanish Steps (to name a few). Unbelievable! Back to Hotel Genova. Bottom line observation: We would recommend this hotel. Give it a shot. The quality of the hotel and location make the other inconveniences tolerable.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berwick, Victoria", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good Average Hotel, clean, good food, ideal for holiday\u201d", "Author": "GriffinFamily4", "ReviewID": "UR82497198", "Content": "Thanks to Trip Advisor, previous reviews were spot on", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cDoesn't worth its money\u201d", "Author": "uoa2000", "ReviewID": "UR78878727", "Content": "We stayed there for 6 days in August of 2010 and almost every day there was a different problem to tackle !!!

The Termini is also where you can catch the 'on/ off' open top bus services that tour the city. You have a few companies to choose from, average price 20 Euro for one day, 30 Euro for 2 days. From the Termini you can also catch the local bus service to Trastevari. An old area of the city not to be missed for an eating experience.

We had no problem with street noise, windows were closed and the airconditioning provided good relief from the heat of the day outside. We slept soundly, comfortably and undisturbed. Rooms were spotlessly clean and house keeping was attended to daily. Breakfast was excellent. Fresh juices, bread/rolls (really good) and pastries, cheese, meats, cereals, fruit, herbal teas and coffee served in a brightly lit eating area with staff on hand at all times. There is also a cosy bar and outdoor garden area that all looks new. Staff were attentive and willing to help organise taxis etc. Internet access in rooms had to be paid for at 5 Euros for one hour.

The rooms are very clean, comfortable, with modern decoration, and well sized (not big, as usual). Great, beautiful bathroom (tiny shower area, though). It's located near Termini (Rome's biggest train station) - not too close as to be disturbed by the crowd and close enough to make it easy to get transportation (subway, bus, trains to other cities). Also walking-distance from Santa Maria Maggiore church. Breakfast is good enough; the building is functional, organized. Some members of the staff could be more friendly. There is one good restaurant just around the corner (called Galina Bianca), but be aware about the other ones in that area (very tourist-oriented, with poor food and wine).
