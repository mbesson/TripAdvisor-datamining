We arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport and caught the Roissy Bus (10 euros) to Opera which was just a 15 minute stroll to the hotel. The hotel proved to be an excellent choice - the location in Opera was a great starting point for getting to most tourist sights. We walked to most of the locations to make sure we saw all the sights. Going by Metro is fine if you accept that you only want to get from A to B and don't mind missing the sights (including excellent cafes/bistros en route). The hotel room (Superior) was very good (albeit a bit on the small side) but well decorated and clean. It would have been nice to have had tea/coffee making facilities in the room but not a major problem. The breakfast provided was excellent with plenty of choice and set in a very nice room. The hotel staff were very friendly and keen to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.

There is a new wing with the modern rooms and an older wing with more basic rooms. We ended up with a basic room. But... The hotel is very nice, the staff are friendly and all spoke good english. The room (although basic) was clean, comfortable and of a reasonable size. Large bed with good bedding, a nice balcony overlooking the street, good storage and perfectly adequate facilities. Some things about the hotel's location: it's well siutated within Paris and within easy access of the main attractions. Nearest metro is about 10 minutes walk, but serves line 8, a very central and useful line. Gare du nord is an easy 20 minute stroll away, perfect for eurostar customers. The street and immediate area is bustling and lively (maybe not a positive for some). Overall, very little negatives to the hotel.

It also had a desk which was nice to sit at when having something to eat or do. The breakfast was reasonable - nothing special and there should be more chocolate croissants, and a bit more of a selection.

The staff were very friendly and were very helpful. There wasn't a great view from the room, but we were on the first floor of rooms and was overlooking the canopy below, and was a typical city like hotel and was nicer than we expected. The location was a little out of the central roads and shops, however, we found this quite nice as it was only a little walk to the main bus and metro, and wasn't too noisy at night either, unlike hotels which were on the main roads.

The room given to me must have been one of the \"old\" rooms as it didn't look anything like some of the photos on trip advisor or on other hotel booking websites, but having said that, I had no complaint as everything in the room worked just fine without any fault at all. There was no issues with the cleanliness of the room and the daily housekeeping was efficient, no fault at all. The room was \"small\" but hey, this is Paris, and considering the very good (cheap) rate (breakfast included) I paid for my room, I was more than happy. I thought it was a good value for money. I found the staff members (especially the front office) very helpful and flexible. I arrived very early in the morning and when I filled in my registration card and left my luggage in the luggage room and was just about to go out and about, thinking I would kill half a day until my room would be ready that afternoon, the gentleman who had checked me in told me I was welcome to have breakfast in the breakfast room! A very nice surprise as the breakfast inclusion was to kick in the following morning. I had my first breakfast in Paris (this was my very first trip to Paris) in the very cosy breakfast room, thanks to the staff member and his kindness and attentiveness. The food selection on the buffet wasn't that extensive but I was just satisfied with nice croissants and coffee on offer every day. The location of the hotel was good too as it only took me 5~10 minutes to Grands Boulevards metro station as well as Paris North Station (I took a Thalys train to Bruxelles one day), and even to the Louvre Museum, I could walk in 20~25 minutes. It also took me about 15~20 minutes on foot to get to Galeries Lafayette from the hotel. I have to say, for those who would like to stay right next door to L'Opera or in the middle of Les Halles, no, Hotel Peyris Opera may not provide an ideal location but for well-travelled holiday-makers, I would highly recommend this hotel as their base whilst in Paris.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery bad hotel\u201d", "Author": "Manueli1987", "ReviewID": "UR119149784", "Content": "Was qtaying in this hotel and must say never again!!

In August quite a number of restaurants / businesses were closed but we had no problems finding places to eat / drink. Food and drink is a large part of our holidays and i must say that we were very disappointed with the quality of what we ate despite going to quite expensive traditional and modern restaurants. Drink also was very expensive with even mediocre (French, there is no other choice) wine costing over 20 Euros at even basic bars.

The bed clothes on the bed were horrible but they had the room spotless every morning. We had breakfast included and it was typical continental. One piece of advice go on to Boulevard hausmann and eat at the Hard Rock Cafe, I know you might think its overated but we got a massive sirloin steak and gorgeous cheddar mashed spuds for \u20ac21.95 we ate there a lot.
