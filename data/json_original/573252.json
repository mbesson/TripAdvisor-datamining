Only thing with the location is, if you've walked round all day, as you probably will -it's Rome, there's so much to see, that by the time you get back to change you won't want to go back in again. We would have preferred to stay nearer the tourist centre but we had left it too late to get something in our price range, but Il Capitello is very cheap for Rome. It is clean, has good sized rooms, a safe with key and air con. The double glazed windowns also brilliantly block out any noise from outside. The only complaint I would have, and it was a big one for us, was that we were woken up early every morning without fail and were not able to get back to sleep as the noise continued. I have read other reviews and was looking forward to the quiet and being left alone but when we stayed there the owner was there every day with the cleaning lady and sometimes her young grand daughter. Every morning they would stand outside our room talking VERY loudly, and one day we were woken up by them blasting the TV in the next room. One night the phone was ringing for absolutely ages at around 5am, even though the owner is not there over night. Although everything about the room was good, I was left so frustrated by the lack of consideration for her guests that I would not stay here again. If you are a heavy sleeper go for it, we may have just gotten unlucky. Also the TV had no English channels apart from Bloomberg and porn! Another thing that really annoyed me was that our airline had lost our bags and when they finally found them and arranged with us to get them to us in Rome, rather than offering to stay at the accommodation to collect them for us, or even letting us do that ourselves, she took it uponherself to cancel the courier telling us we would be better to go the airport ourselves to collect our bag - hence a four hour round trip on public transport in a terrible storm - not impressed!", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cClean, quiet, convenient, secure, affordable\u201d", "Author": "jgrant829", "ReviewID": "UR61950522", "Content": "We just got back from a great week in Rome, and one of the many reasons was Il Capitello. The location is great for a short walk to St. Peter's Square and to many restaurants and shops. The room was clean and perfectly adequate for our needs, a comfortable place to sleep and have a quick, no-frills breakfast before heading out for the day. Bed was a bit hard but we were usually so tired it didn't matter. We felt quite safe at Il Capitello; its three rooms are on the second floor and are well-secured behind interior and exterior sets of doors. (It took us a few days to master the locks-and-keys procedure but that was all part of the fun.) Service was pleasant but hands-off; after breakfast time you are mostly on your own. TV was basic. We'd definitely go back to Il Capitello.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat find\u201d", "Author": "rnbeth416", "ReviewID": "UR32292060", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Il Capitello for 4 nights on our Italy honeymoon. The room was small, however very clean. It had a private bathroom, air conditioning, and a television. The B & B is in a great location, very close to the Vatican. An endless array of yummy restaurants are within walking distance, as well. Additionally, the Metro station is very close and was a great way to get around the very large city. Breakfast was provided every morning, however was very minimal compared to the other B & B's we stayed. Overall, I would recommend the B & B to anyone traveling to Rome.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice quiet location\u201d", "Author": "zmgirl", "ReviewID": "UR19954088", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there for 5 nights. The B&B is conveniently located for sightseeing. Everything was kept clean and above expectation. The owner was available sometimes in the morning if you had any questions and how to get to places but we were pretty much left to come and go as we pleased. It was close to the Vatican and metro/bus stations so that was a big plus for us.

Up one flight of stairs (elevator if needed) you feel as though you are coming home to your own apartment each evening.

Do be sure call the proprietor when you arrive in Rome and somebody will be there to greet you and give you your keys. Less than five minute walk to the metro. It was 90 degrees when we stayed, so the airconditioning was a blessing. Bathroom was very clean, as was everything else.
