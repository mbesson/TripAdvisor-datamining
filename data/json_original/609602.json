Firstly communication between myself and the hotel was great, and they never seemed to tire of my endless questions. Obviously, being responsible for 12 students overseas, I wanted to make sure that the hotel was secure and suitable to accomodate our needs; and we were not disappointed. This is not a high-end boutique hotel with the usual expected amenites, but this is reflected in the price. And although the hotel is a little dated in decor, it's clean, comfortable and homely. I had a single room with a shared bath, and the room had a tv, plenty of drawer space, a rail with hangers, a desk and a sink in the room the bed was really comfy and the sheets were clean. The shower was just opposite and always had hot water and the water pressure was good. The shower could benefit from having more shelf room to put your toiletries on, but there are hooks on the back of the door to hang your things. The toilet was next to the shower room, and due to it being shared, i did find that other guests were not as considerate and therefore thought it was perfectly fine to pee all over the seat and someone else would clean it up. For this reason, i would recommend getting a private bath - but we were on a tight budget. Some of our students shared a room and had a cot/fold-out bed to sleep on, which they said was fine but kind of sank in the middle, but hey they're teenagers, they can manage to sleep anywhere! There's also a mezzanine level where there's a big tv and 2 computers with internet access. There's also a huge table area, which was ideal for us to have breakfast (hotel doesn't provide, but you can use the area to eat your own) and later the students would sit and fill out their workbooks and reflection journals. In the lobby is a hot water tap - perfect for porridge/oatmeal - and there's tea and coffee available for 25 cents a cup - Bargain! The location is just perfect, a block from Union Square subway, and there's a local supermarket/store half a block away for breakfast items. There's a good pizza place a block away called Amore Pizza - i think, and a good Tex-Mex place on the corner. Both are really cheap, but good quality. Everyone we met at the hotel was really friendly, and really added to the whole experience for the students. All in all, we had an amazing time and we are hoping to use the hotel again next year. This was my third time in New York, and i can safely say that even if i make a personal trip, rather than a school trip, i would definitely use the Seafarers, but i would just pay the extra and get a private bath. Thanks so much Seafarers - you were great!", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing, China", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, GREAT price\u201d", "Author": "Fred_Hsu", "ReviewID": "UR124920720", "Content": "Located 1 block from Union Square surrounded by shops, restaurants and night clubs.

The location can't be beat, but I wish we could say the same about the hotel. The room is clean, but barely big enought o turn around. There is one very small single bed & a fold-up cot that had to be the least comfortable bed on the planet. When the cot was open, it was an exercisein agility to move around the room. To make matters worse, we were on a n extend trip & were getting ready to move to France, so we had a fair amount of luggage with us which took up all the available space. Granted, we were actually given a single room, not a double, so the size would probably been OK for one person. We had a room with shared bath, which didn't turn out to be so bad as we rarely had to wait for either the toilet or shower. Everything was clean, even though maid service was not every day. It was handy to have a washer/dryer in the basement so we could have clean clothes for our arrival in France. I don't think I would stay here again in the future.

This room as a single bet as well as a fold-out cot for the 2nd guest. This is terrific value for New York at around $100 per night. There is free wireless in the lobby as well as 2 free computers for guest use; also a laundry in the basement and 25c coffee/tea. The rooms have good airconditioning and cable TV as well as a basin. The beds have minimal linen but include a spare pillow. The problem with the air-conditioning is that you need to keep it on all night since the rooms are so small - but the cot folds out directly in front of it which results in a very uncomfortable sleep. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The shared bathroom is a nightmare. And actual nightmare. Though the toilet is average cleanliness, I can only assume that some guests have avoided using it, preferring instead to relieve themselves in the shower. I have never showered amongst such smells before. What makes it worse is that there are little worms (yes, worms - not millipedes) in the shower which start wriggling out when you turn the water on. How the worms get up to the 11th floor I have no idea! We ended up buying disinfectant and pouring half a bottle in the shower each day - this helped, but didn't stop the worms. I believe this is a serious problem which the hotel management need to attend to. The rooms were just below average cleanliness and aren't given a full clean daily. When they are cleand, the maid likes to turn the televisions on in every room, each TV on a different channel; and she cranks the sound up - so don't expect to sleep in after a late night out in NYC. Overall though I might recommend this hotel since it is so cheap for New York. If you just need a place to sleep then go for it.

The single shower (much better than a locker room set up with multiple showers) had endless warm water and again, was clearner than my own one at home. The room was tiny, but quiet. The location is perfect -- a block from Union Square, with its subway link to the rest of NYC and its great shopping, restaurants, etc. all around. The staff is super low key, but helpful. On a super tight budget, I wanted to stay one night, then stow my bag the next 18 hours to catch an early morning flight...ie, party for a day without paying for a room. I had much trepidation about leaving my stuff there. But the folks locked it up in a room -- better service and more secure than I've had at Hiltons that toss your bags on a pile where anyone could steal them. After 10 p.m., you show your room key to get buzzed in -- making it safer than a chain hotel where anybody could sneak into the elevator and roam the hallways. The staff even let me get my boarding pass faxed to their office (when the printer wasn't working from the free internet computer in the lobby). I could go on and on. Of course there's no pool, restaurant,etc.....you are paying only for a clean place to rest, sleep, shower, secure your stuff... while you play in Manhattan and pay a room rate equal or below the price of a roundtrip cab ride from/to LaGuardia. Amazing. If I hit the lotto, I'm going to donate some money to these folks to help their cause.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK.", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location!!\u201d", "Author": "GeordieJanice", "ReviewID": "UR27952098", "Content": "Without a doubt the best thing going for this hotel is the location. It was by far the cheapest budget accommodation I could find in Manhatten that didn't have mice, bedbugs or cockroaches! It's in the heart of Manhatten, just off Union Square and a stones throw from 14th Street subway station. There is a small reception area with tea/coffee making facilities for a small price. There is also a PC with internet access and a printer that can be used to print boarding passes only. Reception staff were not exactly chatty but then were rarely spent anytime in the reception area so maybe it was more us than them. Behind the reception is the chapel where guest can join the services if they wish. We went for Sunday morning service which was lovely. There is also a small library/lounge on the first floor which has a large TV and another PC. There are 2 lifts that service all floors. Each floor has 10 rooms (5 to the left & 5 to the right of the lifts). There were 2 small shower rooms and 2 small seperate WC's per floor, again 1 each to the left and 1 each to the right of the lifts. Both were very basic, hostel like, but okay. It would have been nice to have mirrors in the bathrooms. No once during my 6 day stay did I have to wait to use either the WC or shower room. Bedrooms also have hand basins which helps. Bedrooms have a/c although we didn't have to use ours in March. Bedrooms were spacious, clean and perfecty adequate. No fridge in the rooms but they did have TV's although not much worth watching, but then who goes to New York to watch TV?!? In the basement is a small laundry room and a small room with a few dining tables and a couple of vending machines, 1 for cold drinks and 1 for snacks. There is also an ice machine just around the corner. The basement did have a damp smell to it though. There is no breakfast but the excellent Gramercy Diner a few blocks away offers very good, reasonably priced food. I would also recommend Shades of Green, the Irish bar next door, for a few nightcaps before returning to the hotel. I think we staggered out at about 5.30am on our last night! I would definitely recommend Seafarers for a budget central stay and would stay there again if visiting New York again.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "swindon", "Title": "\u201cUSA Virgins\u201d", "Author": "johnnysdad", "ReviewID": "UR23231206", "Content": "As first time travellers to the USA, we were looking for a place to stay which had good transport links, good reviews and reasonably priced and this had it all.

If you're looking for luxury and pampering, go somewhere else. We weren't - we just wanted a safe, comfortable and well located place and this ticks all the boxes. The guesthouse it really easy to get to. It's right next to Union Square, about 50 yards from one of the best connected Subway stations in the City - 14th St - Union Square. We never needed more than 2 trains to get back to the hotel from anywhere, and most of the time it was only one. There's a supermarket (The Food Emporium) right near the place too (even closer than the station!). The Union Square area itself is fantasic. Loads of great shops and eateries - plus a cinema. For shopping I recommend Filene's Basement - loads of bargains on designer names there! There are rooms with shared shower facilities available, but we went for the private bathroom option and were impressed. The shower had good pressure and there was always hot water. The bathroom was pretty clean - no real problems there. Fresh towels were provided on 4 of the 7 days. They don't service your room on weekends - plus we were there for thanksgiving too so the cleaners were off then too. As we were expecting this (it's made clear in the pre-arrival info) it was no problem. When the room was serviced, it was done well. It was a twin room rather than a double. Beds were plenty big enough although a little hard. Perfectly comfortable though. There were a couple of chairs, a desk, chest of drawers and a small fridge! Not a mini-bar, but an actual fridge which could be turned on and used free of charge. We didn't use this, but I thought it was a helpful option. There was a flatscreen tv on the wall which had cable. The room was everything we needed it to be - a place to rest our heads in quiet comfort after long hard days of pounding the streets and exploring NYC for all it's worth! Reception staff were helpful and efficient throughout. The room itself was simple, clean and safe. There is an air conditioning system which can't be switched off as it serves the whole guesthouse - this makes a bit of a humming noise which if you're a light sleeper may annoy. However, this is switched off between 11pm and 6.30am. After the first day, we were so shattered that we could have slept with a pneumatic drill going off under the bed, and so we were able to ignore the humming and sleep even when the system was on. In terms of other facilities, there are two pc's with internet (one in the lobby, one on the mezzanine overlooking the lobby) which are free of charge for guests. They recommend that you use them for no longer than 20mins at a time if there are others waiting, but a lot of the time I sat and used them for longer as there was no-one else around. There is tea and coffee always available in the lobby - 25c a cup. In the basement there are food and drinks vending machines and an ice machine. I have to say though, the basement is pretty dingy and a little unnerving alone! Not a place you'd want to spend a lot of time! There is a small chapel and library full of Lutheran literature. Obviously the place is run by the church and there are various ministers who have offices there. But the religious stuff is never pressed upon you. The facilities are there for you to use if you wish, but it's your call. No pressure is put on you and there's no brainwashing! There's a common room area on the 2nd floor which we didn't use but it looked to be just a few chairs and tables and a kitchen which was locked. They were providing a free thanksgiving meal there on the Monday but we didn't join in. There are 2 lifts - but these are unbelievably slow!! Again, the staff are well aware of this and there's a lovely little notice in each one suggestion ways you could pass the time while in the lift! Overall then, this place was everything I expected it to be. Compared to other NYC accommodation, it's very well priced, very well run and is in a perfect location where you can get to anywhere easily! It's not perfect, but four our purposes it was great.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cGood stay in Manhattan\u201d", "Author": "robtheman21", "ReviewID": "UR21623422", "Content": "I think there is no cheaper stay if you want to be located in Manhattan and have a relatively good quality.
