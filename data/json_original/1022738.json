That said, the place is nice..the rooms large and mostly quiet with nice bathrooms. There are a number of pools and a small bar where some food is served up util 7PM. The drive to town and to most restaurants is only about 5 minutes.

In the past we have stayed in old town at La Concha. We were looking forward to staying a bit off of noisy Duval and enjoy the beach so we chose Parrot Key. The location is not bad, about $15 for the cab to Duval. Worth it for being able to go back to a quiet room after a night on the town. We planned on renting scooters instead, and the hotel provided a third party to rent the scooters from, Island Vibe Rentals. The worst part of the vacation was the rental experience, where the throttle stuck on one of our scooters, causing a major accident. Luckily we were not injured to the point of hospitalization, but it totalled the scooter, ruined our night, and of course soured the mood of the rest of the trip. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend using another scooter company other than the one provided by the hotel. Although we informed them of the malfunction, they were continuing to recommend this company throughout our stay, which is my biggest complaint with the hotel. The reason we will not stay again is because of their 100% non-smoking policy. As smokers, we never smoke in the home or in hotel rooms anyway, but when it is prohibited on a balcony or in an outside bar, we draw the line. This is Key West, and it is the home of independence and freedom. Not at Parrot Key, though. So, a non smoker can disregard our reason for not returning, but anyone who even enjoys an occasional cigar like my husband can look forward to being shoved off property to enjoy it. The pool is nice, the bar has tasty drinks, though the fact that it closes at sundown is silly. We never tried the food at the pool. Enjoy the comfy and clean room if you choose the resort, but don't rent the scooter there!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Willow Park, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay in Key West!!\u201d", "Author": "Cynthia S", "ReviewID": "UR126437691", "Content": "Since this was our first trip to Key West, we relied upon everyone else's reviews and the hotel's website to select this hotel.

Our family traveled from Miami to Key West to relax and enjoy all that the City has to offer, with no particular plan in mind. As we entered the Keys, we immediately felt that we had left so much of the hectic activity of the City Life behind. Traveling through the Upper and Middle Keys offered a Rainbow of Colorful Views... beautiful Blue skies, crystal-clear waters, and much activity along the Highway. As we entered Key West, we were ready to really relax! We arrived at Parrot Key, checked-in to our room, with the most welcoming accommodations. Nothing was more inviting than the open-specious, colorful soroundings of our room. The combination of elegance in the decor, cleanliness, yet cozy-like home feeling - was undiscribeable to us all! As we opened the back doors and walked outside to the deck area, which overlooked the water, we knew then this was the treasure we had been awaiting - what a beautiful view! We walked bare-foot in the sand, and made our way to the Cafe Blue, where we enjoyed a savory Tuna-Melt Sandwich to die for! Had some refreshing drinks, pool side and mingled a bit with the Staff about this and the other Singh Resorts - like Tranquility Bay, located in Marathon - the Middle Keys. They were all so friendly, welcoming and so informative about some personally known fun activities to do in Key West and the Keys... Kyaking, Sailing/Boating - even a simple 3 minute bike-ride to the beach sounded great! Forget about your car here; just park it - walk, bike, or grab a cabb... this is part of much of the fun! As we enjoyed the rest of our weekly stay at the Resort and Key West, there wasn't a dole moment. But, relaxing at the Resort... dinning, drinking by the pool side (a few to choose from), simply taking in all the beauty and comfort the Resort has to offer, and enjoying our family time each day - until night time, when we looked forward to sleeping on the most comfortable beds we have ever experienced at a Resort of this kind - like no other -- the best! We realized... that followed by the beautiful Blue colors of the Gulf View Water, the lush White sand, the invigorating Green-lush Architectural Lanscaping and Sculpture Designs through-out the property, and last but no least --- the BRIGHT, Yelllow Sun of Key West - it was as rewarding as a real \"Pot-of-Gold\" at the end of the Rainbow!

Forget the fancy cigar you just bought on Duval Street because they won't let you smoke it anywhere on property, you can walk right over to Walgreens and smoke it is what I was told by \"Alma\". They advertise a fitness center, howeve the \"fitness center\" consists of 3 or 4 treadmills and a water cooler in a room next to the reception area.....very disappointing.

Both had balconies. We didn't use the parking lot balcony. Never having been to the Keys before, we had some apprehension, both on lodging and the actual island. No problems here. Since we had limited time we flew in from Buffalo, a short commute from our home in the Niagara Falls area. I booked online on Delta.com and also booked the rental car which I was able to upgrade to a Camry on my corporate discount. I didn't see a lot of notes on costs n these reviews. The car rental (8000 miles on it when I picked it up) was only $30.00 a day. I promised you some tips: Hertz offered me the full tank of gas offer at the pick up desk. I didn't think I'd use that much. (even after a trip up to Marathon and back and driving around town every day, I only used up about 1/2 a tank, a $30.00 savings.) I was concerned about limited parking noted int he hotel description. When we arrived at about 11;30 pm Sat night, thanks to a late arrival from Delta, we drove around and couldn't find a spot to park. The security guard spotted us, ascertained I was an incoming guest. He advised the front desk was closed but he had my room key in his pocket and said I could report to the front desk in the morning. He further advised we could park in the Walgreens parking lot which is right beside the resort, just not in the front row in front of the store or I'd be towed. Good point. Very friendly. He pointed out the 'crazy' electric golf type cart cars that people rented and plugged in with wires going over the sidewalks which could easily trip you up. Walgreens is open 24 hours. Our suite had a good sized bedroom, separate small shower and separate tub, with a short hallway leading into a living/dinig area. Two TVS, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. For some reason the living room had the digital cable, the bedroom had regular cable. There was a side buffet with toaster, coffee maker, supplies and utelsils, but no sink. The couch and char were fabric and could have used a steam bath. The room was $285 average per night. Maybe it was more on Saturdays. The back balcony was very nice, room for two or three chairs and overlooking the main pool which was obscured by plenty of vegetation. To the right and left of us was many many twin balconies, so if it was party time, you would be in trouble. We didn't see any live residents beside us while we were there. There was another room below us. The Tiki Bar was nice and open until 7:00 for meals. We had a real nice lunch there at fairly good prices and a few drinks. People were in or around the pool all day, but it was quiet. There are either 4 or 5 pools at the resort with plenty of vegetation hiding you from all the room windows. Didn't use the pool but sat at the tables a few times. Apparently there is a gym there too, but we didn't use it either. A very quiet resort, Duval Street was about 10 minutes away by car. Some more tips: When you are leaving the resort there is a stop sign for you and the Walgreens parking lot on the left. Those dudes do not understand the concept of the stop sign. Look out on the left. At the lights, at the entrance to the resort, there is heavy traffic, both on the road and on the sidewalks,. When you are looking left to turn right, a bike will be zooming down the sideway in front of you. Watch out there too. Once you get on the main roads the drivers are peddle to the medal and the bike drivers are crazy too, they'll veer in front of you. We saw an obviously impaired young lady go down hard on a scooter, but she got up pretty fast and her large size seemed to cushion. That was by Duvall St, and you have probably heard about that one already. Now, waterfront: Yes the resort is on waterfront, our room was on parking lot, but it was still quiet. However this resort is not beach front. Although there is a man made beach sand area in the water front units and and canal front units. Just don't expect to fight thru the mangrove swamp to get to the shallow water. Thats not going to happen. There is a small wharf going out to the water, but no steps leading down, so its just for viewing. Not knowing the area, when we flew in and took the rental out, we took a right hand turn from the airport and passed a big public beach in the black of night which we didn't see. At the end of the trip we happened to take the same drive and spotted that beach. Ironically there are not a lot of beaches on Key West. Who knew? Higgs Beach was a little rough including a fully dressed homeless type guy in the 80 degree heat, sleeping on the sand. Since Smathers Beach by the airport is directly across from from expensive hotels, I 'm thinking that one must have a nicer clientel The staffer were quite friendly. The room cleaning was pretty quick, hopefuly a little more intense before the new renters came in. During one stay on the balcony, the maid was in and out in about 10 minutes. If you were party animals, you might want to stay closer to Duval St. That way you could be in stumbling distance of everything.

But despite all the research & planning, you never know what you're getting until you get there. When we arrived after a long day of traveling, we were amazed at how beautiful this place was. From the moment we pulled into the entrance, we knew we had a winner! We were greeted by a circular drive in front of the main office with a center island of 4 palm trees illumunated with rope lighting & lush, tropical landscaping with various plants & palm trees. Finding your way around the complex takes a little getting used to as the layout for the various buildings goes off in different directions & with the extensive landscaping foliage, things are very secluded. As with Jessica C., we also had a ground level Garden Guestroom with back porch & sandy \"beach\" area outside the back doors of the room. A beautiful place to sit early morning for coffee or late night for a drink. The rooms were spacious, clean, & modern. What we realy enjoyed is how quiet & peaceful the complex was at night. Just what is needed after spending alot of time down town on Duvall St. The complex is located on the outskirts of town, about 10 to 15 minutes from Mallory Square/Waterfront area. There is a Walgreens next door and the complex is in close proximity to the Key West business district and fast food places. There are, I believe, 2 smaller swimming pools and a main pool/lounge area with a bar that serves drinks + limited breakfast & lunch food. The only complaint I have is the pool bar closes at 7 PM. Should be open later, until 10 PM when pool closes. All told, we were extremely pleased with this resort and would highly recommend it.

We had an absolute wonderful stay at the Parrot Key. We are a family of four (2 adults ,2 teens), from Canada, this being our first trip to the Keys. We were absolutely delighted with our accomodations, and wouldn't change a thing. We had a three bedroom \"waterfront\" room, which was exactly as described and equally as beautiful as the pictures on the Parrot Key Website. I did a fair amount of research prior to our booking to ensure we had accomodations that reflected everything I envisioned Key West to be, and this was beyond what I had expected. Upon arriving to our room, my children exclaimed \"mom we could live here' . I had to laugh as, this was one third the size of our home, and yet the space was beautiful and functional, with lovely views to what is not the ocean but a lovely sandy walkout, fully enclosed with a waterway beyond. Albeit, it is not the OCEAN, so if you want to go swimming in the ocean from your accomodations, I don't believe this is the property for you. Rather, this is a property with beautifully appointed rooms and accomodations in pristine form, great space, well designed and decorated, with a beautiful tropical oasis at your doorstep, with the water beyond the palms. The suite itself was impeccable - beautiful granite kitchen stocked with cooking necessities and dinnerware - perfect for family dinners which we so enjoyed, given the neighbouring grocery store!!. Our unit had a spacious eating area and living area with walkout to deck perched along a sandy outcropping overlooking the palms and water..It was exactly as pictured on the website. The pool was area was fabulous - pristine and beautiful, lovely loungers, and a nice little cafe/bar to get short order food. Absolutely lovely. The only negative of this property for some folks might be the distance from the Old Town. We took cabs in to town, which were minimally priced by our standards, and it was so not an issue given our beautiful accomodations. However, I can understand if one wants to be close to the \"party scene\" of Old town, this may not be for them, as they would have to cab back at night....not sure how the service is in the evenings as we did not have the need. All that said, the website photos for us proved completely accurate, and we couldn't have enjoyed our lodging any more than we did, particularly being a family of four. Absolutely beautiful!!

If you have ever been to Key West (or know anyone who has) you probably know that Duval Street is really where 85% of the action is. Unfortunately, Parrot Key is about 2 miles from Duval. If you're feeling somewhat athletic and healthy, by all means, walk to Duval Street. We did just about every day, however, after walking up and down the main stretch all day, we definitely needed a cab ride back. However, the distance may be exactly what some people are looking for, a nice place somewhat off the beaten path. I would absolutely stay here again and would certainly recommend Parrot Key to everyone.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, FL", "Title": "\u201cKey West Gem\u201d", "Author": "PAS112", "ReviewID": "UR123446839", "Content": "We love this place!

Anyway, we immediately called the front desk and they were closed (they are not open 24 hours). So we had to spend one more night there. I couldn't get out of my head that we could transport some roaches or roach eggs back to our house in our bags. How could we pay over $200 a night and be in this predicament? Unreal! The next morning we contacted the front desk receptionist who proceeded to tell me that this has never happened before. Really??? Who is she trying to fool. When I first mentioned it to her I did not hear a hint of surprise in her voice and now she is telling me this is the first she ever heard of it. She continues to convince me that I should not worry about transporting them back home (her tone was not sympathetic at all). The hotel manager stopped by to apologize and said that some times guests leave the balcony doors open and stuff tends to come in the rooms because the place has a lot of trees around the property (some plants even hang over the balconies). He was very accomodating...he offered to give us a discount and move us to another room. Of course, I couldn't imagine staying there one more day even if they paid me to do it. After all, I came to Key West for peace of mind. We looked around and found a fabulous Marriot beachside hotel. We paid $300 a night and got a waterfront room.

November 15th and 16th. They have 4 pools but don't tell you all the pools except one close at sunset! The so called restaurant is actually a poolside snack bar and it closes at 7:00 PM. We couldn't even get a drink at 8:00 pm which is a little ridiculous when you are on vacation. It is close to Mallory Square but NOT I repeat NOT within walking distance. We were told at the front desk that we could walk down there to see the sunset and it was only about 1 mile. So we took off and when we walked about a mile we took out our gps (i-phone) it said another 2.3 miles! We had to turn around and go back to the hotel and get the car but of course by then we missed the sunset. Our room was a double queen and very clean. It fit the 4 of us comfortably. However we went to sit on our porch and there were no chairs. We called the front desk and were told \"oh just take them off someone else's porch\"!! Really? You just don't do that! The maid service is actually what they refer to as \"tidy\" service. They empty the trash and replace towels. I've never seen that before. If you stay and extended amount of time then you get the full service. As for the noise it wasn't too bad but I did hear the people next to us and the one's above us taking showers and talking and shutting their doors. As for the parking....well that is interesting too. I guess parking is a prime commodity in the keys (understandably). This resort has an arrangement with Walgreens next door for overflow parking. We got a parking spot every time we came back but it was really full. I don't know what happens in the busy season? We asked if there was coffee in the lobby but they said no. They forgot to mention there is a small coffee pot (4 cups) in the room. That would have been nice to know because we brought a coffee pot with us. There is not a mini-fridge either which would be nice for drinks and leftovers from the restaurants. There is a blow dryer in the bathroom and an iron and ironing board. The vanity in the bathroom doesn't have any counter so space is limited. The beds were clean and very comfortable. There are flat screen tvs in the room. The landscaping around the hotel is awesome. It's thick and luscious. If it wasn't for all the foliage you would be able to see everyone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms which wouldn't be good. There are two strips of sand and chairs to sit on but don't expect to see the water unless you are on the second story. Even though this hotel is on the main road it does feel private because of all the tropical trees and plants. This is a good place to stay if what you really want to do is see Key West.

The one disappointment was that the poolside bar closed early, we were looking forward to an after-dinner drink but had to go across the street to the liquor store. Parrot Key is easy to get to and once there it is a short cab ride down to Duval St. For 3 people it cost us about $12 one way. It is too far to walk, but it looked like there might be a bus that you could take. You would pay more than that for secure parking downtown, so the cab is worth it. There were a few downsides to the place. First when they cleaned our room they left all the trash and wet towels sitting on our entry stairs. They sat there all day and were still there the next day when we checked out. I am sure if I had called housekeeping they would have picked them up, but I was testing to see if they were ever removed. Next, to walk to the \"sunset pier\" you have to walk through the back \"beach\". While we were walking back there we had to walk past people who had rooms that opened up to that area.

I had heard from friends who had previously visited Key West that staying in a hotel in the downtown area (on / near Duval Street) was a must. Duval Street is where all of the action is (e.g., open air restaurants, shops, bars), but it is also a very noisy place - all day and all night. We opted instead to stay at Parrot Key in order to experience more of a resort atmosphere. We are so glad that we did! Being away from \"the action\" was not an issue at all. We hopped in our rental car every day for a 7 minute drive to Duval Street, had no problem finding on-street (metered) parking, and still enjoyed all of the \"action\" and goings-on. We loved coming back in the evenings to a tropical resort where you could hear the palm trees rustling in the wind...so peaceful! Parrot Key was such an amazing place to stay! We had originally booked a Garden View King room, but when we arrived, they upgraded us to a 2-bedroom, 2-bath, 2-story King suite at no extra charge. We stayed in 6B (you can view a map of the resort, here: http://www.parrotkeyresort.com/images/pictures/resortmap3.gif), which is an end unit. We had a balcony off the living room, and a balcony off the master bedroom (with 2 Adirondack chairs). One note: the balconies between units are not separated by privacy screens, so you will be \"sharing\" the space with your neighbors. Both bedrooms were very large; the master bath had a separate shower and soaking tub, and granite countertops; the living room had an entertainment unit with flat screen TV; the master bedroom had a clothes / entertainment armoire with flat screen TV. The entire unit was very clean and painted in beautiful tropical colors. I have heard other guests on TripAdvisor complain that the food at Cafe Blue, the resort's dining facility, was not very substantial. If you are looking for a full service dining experience, then Cafe Blue is not the venue for you. I had no problem with the breakfast choices (cereal, fruit, breakfast Panini's), but my husband chose instead to go out to IHOP for a heartier breakfast. We had originally booked 2 nights, but within an hour of arriving, we just knew we had to stay a 3rd night! We stopped at the front desk and asked if we could extend to a 3rd night at the same price, and after checking with central reservations, they were able to accommodate us! Every staff member that we dealt with (Rutanya, Sahsha, and Sara(h)) was unbelievably friendly, professional, and genuine. They really went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one.

Hotel is relatively new, right next to a 24 hour Walgreens with Winn Dixie across the street. In room fridge, limited restaurant (breakfast only) fresh fruits, patries and waffles. Eggs are more pre-fab, but we weren't at the hotel for that. Staff is great and professional and trained well. Very friendly and willing to go above and beyond. WiFi is included in the $25 resort charge, (not charged when you make the reservation but mandatory when you arrive), also inluded is in room coffee. The hotel does not have in-room safe, and lock boxes at front desk only hold documents, not electronics or laptop. That's where I recommend they make a room upgrade. But, we had no issues with security. Also room has no 2-top dining or work table. The rooms are spacious so there is room for that. Another suggestion. For those that don't drive-in, bicycles and 2 person scooters can be rented. Scooters for $35/day. That is another great value compared to renting a car and trying to find reasonable parking. Also recommend a 1/2 day fishing trip and 1/2 day snorkel trip.

We turned up at 5ish and couldn't park as there is insufficient parking for the resort so were told that the Walgreens car park next door had some allocated parking for the hotel. That car park had tow away signs so I had to double check where we could park. We then took all of the cases out of the car rather than the one bag we had packed as I wasn't sure about security - it's also pretty obvious you are a holidaymaker when you walk across thier car park with cases!!. The room was Ok as we had chosen the suite which we discovered is over two floors. It did smell a bit damp though and having just left Hawks Key which was about the same price for the weekend we were very disappointed with the standard.

It is very clean, and has a cozy feel. Multi-level rooms make for a nice change to the typical hotel room. The walking distance to some convent stores is nice. Here are the problems. Our biggest complaint is all of the VERY LOUD construction going on from early in the morning to well after 7:00 at night. Relaxing by the pool is not an option unless you enjoy the constant banging of hammers and the loud crashes of boards and debris. I understand the news to maintain and improve a property, BUT WARN THE GUESTS WHEN BOOKING THAT THIS IS GOING ON!! We made a complaint to the unfriendly staff, and I don't think that they could have cared any less. We contacted the manager to see if they could at least drop the pointless $25 a day resort fee and all we got was a quick no. If you stay here you will be charged this fee. I have no problem with that IF there is something in return such as transportation to near by attractions, bikes or water sports equipment, Ect. We inquired why we were charged the fee here with none of the mentioned features, and their response was it was for landscaping, free drinking water by the pool, and a useless stretch of sand to set on with VERY limited views of mediocre water. Things that I think just come with running a place. Moving on the road noise is bad when setting on the balcony, the parking is far away, and the pools close at dusk.

I read the reviews and looked at the pictures and made my decision. Boy, was it a good one! When we arrived at the hotel, the entrance was lovely. There are flowers and bushes and trees everywhere, it is beautifully landscaped! Every room seems to have some sort of landscaping outside the front door, and the 4 pools are also landscaped. The main pool, also the largest, has a wonderful tiki bar and restaraunt with very good food and drinks. Our room was amazing! We stayed in the 3 bedroom cabin, with a sandy area in the back, complete with beach chairs and an umbrella. All the bedrooms have their own bathroom and then there is another 1/2 bath on the first floor (it's 3 floors). The 2 bedrooms on the second floor each have a balcony as well! It was much more than we expected! The only downfall we experienced was with our transportation. We took the Key West Express ferry from Ft. Myers to Key West, so we didn't have a car when we got off the boat, as most visitors to the island. I didn't realize when I made the reservation that the hotel is about 1.5 miles from the Duval Street area. We were offered the options of renting an electric car (way overpriced in our opinion), scooters, or bicycles (the island is very bike friendly). Unfortunately though, given the age of our daughters, those weren't very good options, so we did have to take a cab back and forth. That cost between $6 and $16 depending on which driver you get and how they charge, either by distance or zone (distance is actually cheaper!). The city bus was another, very affordable option (either $1 or $2 per person depending on day and time), but you must print out the schedule ahead of time since waiting on a hot bus bench for over 20 minutes for the next bus is not much fun!

And when the occasion arose, we were able to pile everyone into the minivan and drive into town and park without much problem. The hotel had 4 pools as advertised but they were small and intimate. It was nice to have the pool to ourselves one day. Beware, they charge 25 dollars for the pool towels if you do not have the same number of towels in the hotel as the day you arrived. The daily maid service does not give you new towels but does take your old ones away. You have to go to the front desk to request for more towels. The pool towels are terrible, thin, and in need of replacement. The rooms were decently clean and well furnished. It was a plus that everyone had their own baths. We stayed in a 3 room cottage. No one was fighting for a bathroom. Plus it had a nice kitchen that overlooked a small dining area and living room. The sofas were dirty and needed to be cleaned. I guess this is true of all hotels. Only issue was that they staff comes and does a full cleaning only every 4th day. My fault for not reading the little signs in our rooms. I think a full cleaning every 4th day is too long. We over looked the water and enjoyed the sunsets. Overall a great vacation and everyone was happy to share a nice cottage together but still have their space.

The rooms are spacious and clean, plus there was a full kitchen, dining area, and living room. Additionally, each bedroom has its own bathroom (a nice feature when everyone is trying to get ready at the same time), as well as a half bath on the first floor. If you will be spending time in your room, there are flat screen televisions in each bedroom and one in the living room. The kitchen is nice if you don't want to eat out every meal or you just want to have access to a fridge to cool your drinks and store restaurant leftovers. In our cottage, the bedrooms on the second floor had balconies, and the first floor had outside porches as well, each with sitting areas which was nice to enjoy some fresh air and the view. There are four pools on the property, and finding one that wasn't crowded was no problem. We didn't really have any issues with the place, but I'd like to point a few a few things out. First, parking on the property was limited. If the parking lot is full, you have to park at a lot they share with a nearby Walgreens (not a long walk, but I didn't like leaving my vehicle in a lot off property). Secondly, the floor-plan of the cottage we stayed in was 3 stories, plus stairs to reach the first floor. If you're traveling/staying with people who have trouble with stairs or are disabled this could be a problem; the property may have disabled friendly rooms available, I didn't check. Also, the bedroom on the third floor was much warmer than the first and second. Adjusting the AC to cool that room to \"room temperature\" (78 F) meant the second floor was around 68 F. It's always hot this time of year in Florida (Florida Native), so this may not be an issue in cooler months. Lastly, the location of the resort is on the new side of Key West, so you will have to take a Taxi or drive to the historical side (where most of the \"tourist\" things are). Parking near Duval St. can be expensive ($20) and hard to find. I'd recommend the taxi (~ $10-12 each way) just to save yourself from the hassle. Overall, the property had a very laid-back feeling while still managing to meet guest needs. The staff was friendly and courteous, and the room was one of the best I've stayed in Key West (compared to the 7 other properties I've stayed in on other trips).

Check-in was a breeze and the staff very friendly. Parking was horrific. The lot is very small for the size of the hotel, but you can park right next door in the Walgreens lot (which is just a very short walk). The room itself was very nice. The main bedroom had a tub and walk in show with double vanity. The balcony overlooked the gulf. The adjacent room was nice, but smaller with only a walk in shower (tiny, but ok). The third room, which is on the 3rd level of the house was so so. The air conditioner really didn't seem to cool the room that well, so it got warm at night and during the day, but it wasn't too bad. It really is a beautiful property with lush landscaping and is very well maintained. Here are a couple of things I wished I would have known. The \"oceanfront suite with a private beach\" is kinda misleading. Yes, you are right on the ocean, but there really is no beach. There is some sand outside your door with a couple of beach loungers. It is really nice to sit outside and watch the sunset, but it isn't private and there is certainly no beach to go into. Many nights, random people from other rooms would come and use our lounge chairs. No big deal to us since we were not using them at the time, but if you want \"private\", you will not get it. Another issue was with the pools. There are three SMALL pools. All of them are surrounded by landscaping, so there is no room for a breeze, and not much sun. The pools were HOT. Since they are so small, the summer heat really warmed them up. This was a big bummer for all of us since we just wanted to relax by the pool with some drinks. Didn't happen. Too hot, and no refreshing pool to jump into. the hotel is only a short drive to Duval street (maybe 5 mins). There is a Walgreens right next store and other restaurants, grocery stores nearby.

Too many PROs to list only CON we came in late one night and had to park next door at Walgreen, but good thing about this area lots of provisons-Winn Dixie(Food Store) Walgreens and Pizza Joints in close walk to resort.

We took taxis when we wanted to go downtown. Since there was a large group of us they would send a van and we usually paid $4/person to go downtown.

I'm amused by some of the reviews here expressing disappointment at \"no beach\" given that there is NOTHING on Parrot Key's website that would indicate the resort has a beach, only a \"sandy, sunning terrace.\" We also had no problems with parking or with housekeeping, as some others have expressed here. I admit I was nervous when we pulled in to the resort, given the proximity of the Home Depot and Walgreens. But when we entered the resort grounds I was pleasantly surprised. The setup and landscaping are very private and lush, like a secluded tropical garden. The four small pools are so relaxing; there is none of the loud, rowdy, \"cannonball\" behavior you might find at a larger resort with one big pool. We enjoyed lunch at the poolside grill (delicious, although expensive), and bartenders Mindi and Shelley are both VERY generous with drinks! TIP: if you're looking for a budget-friendly, quick breakfast, hit Goldman's Deli across the street in the shopping center. We had a 2-bedroom suite which was perfect for a family with teens. Two full bathrooms and 3 flat-screen tv's. No problems with the wi-fi. The balconies were both also very private. I felt like I was sitting in a tropical treehouse. We did have a small issue with the bed in the upstairs bedroom. The frame was a little loose resulting in very loud creaking that woke us all up every time one of my daughters rolled over. I alerted the front desk in the morning and it was fixed by the time we returned that afternoon. Also, we had a small issue with bugs when my daughter left a glass of gatorade sitting out on the coffee table (NOT bedbugs!!). I suppose this is part of living in a tropical climate, but my advice is don't leave food or drink sitting out!! The workout room is small, only 4 machines and a decent supply of free weights. No windows though, so I didn't particularly enjoy it but I was glad it was there! The resort location, as many have noted, is not a comfortable walking distance from town. That was fine with us as we had a rental car and drove wherever we wanted to go. We had no trouble parking in town but if you get desperate note that there is a parking garage at the Westin where, for $4/hour, your car is in a covered garage keeping it far cooler than having it parked in full sun! All in all, a fabulous stay at Parrot Key.

We all thoroughly enjoyed this resort, as well as our stay. We stayed in the 3-bedroom unit, which worked out great. Our unit had a full kitchen, so we were able to purchase coffee, water, etc. -- so we could make breakfast and carry cold water with us wherever we went, instead of having to spend more money. The staff were very friendly and helpful, whenever we had questions. The last night the people staying in the next unit arrived late, with several small children. They were apparently excited and not well supervised, so they were running up and down the stairs making lots of noise. I called the Security office and the Security person arrived within 5 minutes. She knocked on our door to talk to us first, addressed the people in the unit next door, then reported back after she spoke to them. She told us to call if we had any other issues, which we did not. The resort is located on it's own, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, which we really liked. Everything was within close proximity.

There were 4 separate, smaller pools instead of one big pool. This was good because you can move from pool to pool. They only have one restaurant which served a limited menu for breakfast and lunch and drinks until late afternoon. I think an adult only pool would have been beneficial as well as poolside service.

It's more like a New York style townhouse with three floors of blissful beauty. The rooms are rather comfortable. The kitchen fully equipped. The balconies (all three of them) VERY spacious and all with gorgeous views. To top it off, the location of this resort is superb. It's right down the road from Publix, right next door to Walgreen's, and a K-Mart across the street.... and any mother with 3 children knows how important it is to have access to these stores.

My wife and i will \"\"definately\"\" be back and we will bring all our friends next time too!! We traveled with our adult children 21 & 26 and their respective bf's and gf's. We rented one of the 3 bedroom cottages, so that everyone had their own bedroom and bathroom. The cottage was great had a kitchen and dining room, large family type room and 4 decks! If you are like me, Iread trip advisor before i take any trip. I usually start with the negative reviews as you can often learn some things that you would not otherwise find out until it was too late. Sooo for the sake of giving Parrot Key Resort their just due, and this place was the best, I was going to put this in the 1 star category so \"nay sayers' would see this (if you are like me looking there first), but than I found out that it would drive the resorts rating down, and I just can not do that as our stay was that great!!! Ssoooo, I have decided to take excerpts from the \"negative reviews\" and address them here.... * The reservation guy Dave was great!! Helped us out over the phone and Iwould give him 5 stars. * The manager Bob Bauersachs was better than great - I would give him 7 stars our of 5. * Check in was a breeze, sorry I can not recall her name but she was helpful * There is \"\"not\"\" real noise and yes they are located by Walgreens and Home Depot, so what, you have to be located near someone else, come on, this is key west! if you want piece and quiet, and don't want to be located near anyone - rent a place in fiji..! * Coffee is in the room and we had no problems with the tv's and I am \"not\" a computer geek! * Oh my...! not enough parking?!!??!?!? I had to park in Walgreens three of seven nights, sure did!! When we came home from Duval at 2am or later- ohh and guess what, the walk from Walgreens parking and our room was just about the same distance as our room to one of the great pools that they fabuously maintain - come on get real! Maybe a 150 yard walk - big deal and I have a bad right knee ready for replacement! give me a break here it was NOT far at all as some would have you believe! *The rooms were nothing shy of spotless / immaculate!! The housekeeping staff did an outstanding job in cleanliness...!! and this \"\"included the bathrooms\"\"...! * OH NO...!, what it is 3 miles to duval...??? get a taxi, spend a buck or better yet, take your rental car as we did , there was \"\"plenty\"\" of parking in and around duval street!! We \"\"never'' had a problem with parking any night - period! You're on vacation, enjoy yourself and stop worrying about this stuff. and guess what, if you get a room down by Duval, you save on taxis and parking, but here you will have plenty of noise, circus atmosphere until late and maybe even some sewage smell...! *Parrot bay has a wonderfull staff, that is more than adequate in size, we saw staff all the time during the day, cleaning, fixing, gardening, bug spraying etc to keep it in the \"\"immaculate condition\"' that it is...!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!! * UH OH... guess what - \"\"\"it is\"\"\" on the waterfront!!! We had a great room that over looked the bay and the resort built a dock to watch the magnificant sunset every night!! The water is not visible from every room but it is from the cottage , which by the way are reasonable priced to boot!!! * Awww, we did not have any privacy on our deck that oversaw the water, but we made friends with the people next door and we had \"'plenty of privacy\"\" in our room. you want privacy to the max, go to an all inclusive and pay an all inclusive price!! * Our cottage had a kitchen and dining room. Great for a quick breakfast or snack. *** what would i suggest to the owners to change - \"\"3\"\" very simple things.... 1) I would put ceiling fans in the 3rd floor bedrooms, it does get hot up there and it would help reduce the a/c load and power load. 2) I would give your wait staff at the pool the ability to change to a different station on Serius radio, other than coffee house rock. i did not have a problem with it, but I think island music, jimmy buffet, bob marley, 70's/80's rock or a combination of all. but no deal breaker for me.. 3) Maybe a Teflon or silverstone pan or two for whipping up some eggs in the morning, but again NO deal breaker here! Soooo the bottom line on Parrot Bay.... this place was fantastic...!!! My wife, family and friends will return, I have recommended this place to at least a dozen or more people since we got back less than a week ago. It is clean - actually VERY CLEAN, the pools were great, the grounds were immaculate, the staff was helpful and if I were able to give them 7 stars out of 5 I would...!

There is only one, maybe two resorts/hotels in Key West with actual beach access which are truly not even worth having \"beach access.\" This Resort has everything one needs could ask for who is looking for a true Key West experience.

It is billed as a waterfron hotel, which, I guess is not inaccurate in that you see water-just not access it. What stands out about this Singh group hotel is it's miserliness. There is no mini bar, no bath robe, no slippers, no smoking ANYWHERE on premises, no vending machines, no real beach, no room service. Should I continue? Oh, no real resturant , and a bar that stays oopenn until 8 pm. Even the lobby closes at 11pm. If you want to get something to eat, you have to go to the Walgreen's next door. Ditto for smoking. There are complimentary shampoos, conditioners, etc. in each bath-however the bars of soap are miniscule. Only one telephone, next to the bed, and as this hotel boats cottage style accomodations, on 2 levels, it is difficult to have to run into the bedroom when the phone rings, from the living room. What stands out the most, however is the lack of dining facilities. You are a good 20-25 mminute cab ride from all the action on Duval street. That being said, the horel has a snack bar/bar by one of it's 4 pools. Open limited hours, it's menu features on the most basic offering, paninis, dips, chhips, etc. Breakfast is very limited too, if you can get someone to actually wait on you. Expect, yogurt, bagels, fruit, oatmeal. I found it a very spartan menu, not what I would expect from a hotel with 5 stars. The 4 pools are clean and not crowded, however, the towells provided are actually thread bare! You could acttually see through them. Also intresting was that your room was cleaned every 4 days. Trash was emptied daily and fresh towells provided if you ask.

No. Would I reccomend it to friends or family? No Not unless you just want to kick back and lay by the pool, and order in pizza from across the street.

The staff were friendly and helpful. We were emailed by somebody from the hotel a couple of weeks before our stay, and she helped arrange things for our stay. ROOM - a two bedroom suite - was nice, well maintained, and nice furniture and decor. We had a small but comfortable living room with sofa, chair and TV, a mini fridge, coffee maker and toaster, so we were able to have breakfasts in the room. Balcony off the living room with Adirondack chairs, which we used a lot. On the same level, the master bedroom with king sized bed, TV and nice ensuite bath, and a balcony off this bedroom facing the water. The second bedroom was up a flight of stairs with a queen bed, TV, cathedral ceiling and it's own bathroom. The room was quiet during our stay & we didn't hear anything at night. The pool area and bar close down at sunset, which is good because it's quiet after that. LOCATION - We were willing to stay away from the downtown in order to have the bigger accommodation, which was a good price, booked directly thru the hotel. We walked downtown a couple of times. It takes about 40 minutes, and it's a nice walk, much of it by the water. By taxi, it's about 5 minutes and cost $12. If we had stayed downtown, we would have had more meals there, and so many restaurants to choose from. Near the Parrot Key, we had good meals at the IBIS Resort a short walk away, and Outback Restaurant, and TGI Fridays. There are a couple of Thai restaurants walking distance, but we didn't try them. There are 3 big grocery stores in walking distance, one right across the road, and a Walgreens right next door, open 24 hours was handy. AMENITIES - The 4 pools were nice, and it was nice to have the choice because sometimes families with small kids made a lot of noise, so we could go to another pool. The TIKI bar made good drinks. The water in the pools was a bit warm, and the music a bit monotonous - always the \"coffee house\" on XM satellite. We went to the Fort Zachary Taylor Beach some afternoons. It's near downtown and it's the beach recommended by locals. There is a guest laundry room at the resort which is free to use. The landscaping is amazing - like a tropical paradise. LIKED MOST - The quality of the resort. Everything seems new. Furniture and decor is good quality. The buildings & landscaping are top notch. The atmosphere is relaxing and laid back. LIKED LEAST - The proximity to downtown. We would have liked to have more dinners downtown, but it was more convenient to eat near the hotel, so that's what we did most nights.

We have all stayed at tranquility Bay in Marathon, so we wanted to try Parrot Key. It is similar to Tranquility, the plush and beautiful landscaping, quiet walkways, well cared for and manicured property. We stayed in a 3 bedroom \"waterfront\" townhome. The home itself was very nice, clean, new, lots of light. We were disappointed that our waterfront view wasn't much of a waterfront, basically the canal. The sand outside the back porch was nice, but I guess we were expecting the other side of the resort where the sand was larger and you had better views of the bay. Check in was a breeze. We liked having a choice of the 4 pools, they were all clean and the area was well kept. There were quite a few loud guests, so it was nice to be able to move pools to escape from them! I will never understand why people feel the need to scream at each other across a pool or a patio? :o) Cafe Blue-the poolside bar/cafe was nice. The breakfast service was brutally slow, we actually got up and left one day. The waiter seemed to be very confused by any order or request and got frazzled easily. At lunch it was a bit better. The female bartender was great, very nice and quick. The food was really good, the panini's were awesome, salads were great too! Drinks were good, definitely not watered down! I recommend the cafe blue pink lemonade--yummy! My only complaints/suggestions: 1.)Dont be stingy on pool towels, I get the \"green\" aspect of it all, but it is annoying. I like resorts that have pool towels right at the pool. Here you received a pool towel per person in your room. If the towel was on the floor when cleaning arrived, they were supposed to replace it, otherwise if it was hanging up you could use it again. Well they never replaced ours. We flagged down someone outside the house and he quickly got us more, but it is just a hassle. We almost went to Walgreens to buy pool towels for our stay! 2.)This resort would do great having a large hot tub, the pools all close at night, it would be fun to have an alternative. 3.) Stingy with the coffee in your room/home. There was one pack of coffee and 2 decafs in our house at arrival, we assumed they would restock with cleaning. They dont. So much for enjoying a cup of coffee on the deck. 4.)Their sunset pier, is not really a pier, it would be nice if they had something a little bigger or someway to truly enjoy the waterfront. There is no beach close by, you would need to bike or drive to a beach, so keep that in mind if you are looking for a \"beach\" vacation. We knew this going in, but because we loved Tranquility so much, we wanted to give this a try. Also we got the townhome because we thought it would be good to have the kitchen for breakfast or snacks. We didn't really use it at all, there are so many food options in Key West, if we stayed again, I would just get a guest room. I have seen people complain about parking, it really wasn't a big deal in my opinion. We had to park in the overflow at the Walgreens one night, so it took us anextra 45 seconds to walk to our house? We liked having the Walgreens right there, there was a liquor store too! Parrot Key is very pretty, nice and quiet (aside from a few crazy guests) and was perfect for relaxing all day by the pool. The free WiFi was great too, very fast! That being said, we probably wouldn't stay there again as I would rather stay by a resort that has a beach or a place that we could walk to a beach. We do plan to return to Tranquility in Marathon!

It is a short drive from the airport and nestled in a commercial area, though once on the property you would never know it. We were greeted warmly by Booker, whose last name eludes me, upon arrival who assisted us with our bags and routinely showed us the way or offered suggestions for family friendly activities throughout the week. It is a new resort fashioned in the traditional Key West style architecture. The property is absolutely lush with tropical plantings and on occasion upon opening the door to our pool side balcony we would enjoy the fragrant scent of some of these trees and plants. While out on the balcony one can look left or right and it would be reminiscent of looking down a line of Cape May porches (with some jutting forward or back a bit for privacy), however the dense planting of trees and palms provide a canopy of privacy from the accommodations across the property. The furnishings are comfortable and tasteful with the wood pieces being of the shaker style. Since we are a family of five we took a two bedroom suite with the master bedroom, bath, ample living room and front and back balconies on the second level and the second bedroom and bath on the third floor upstairs. There is a wet bar area in the living room with an empty refrigerator under the granite counter in the cabinet (no sink). It should be noted that we were not told prior to arrival (nor did I ask) that our six year old would not have a bed of his own as they do not have a sleeper sofa nor roll-away beds on the property. He was happy as a clam though and didn't mind sleeping with additional linens on the sofa. The third floor bedroom has ample space for a small day bed for a younger child and perhaps the Parrot Key will find a tasteful way to accommodate this in the future. If the reader has a family of five or more than the three bedroom accommodation would be best. We enjoyed our choice of four small pools separated by plantings and connected by hidden pathway with artful free-standing open doorways, three with it's own bathroom and I believe all had an outdoor shower to rinse if needed prior to dining in the outdoor cafe by the larger of the pools or for use as some did for a flight after check-out. The hotel is located a little more than a mile from the center of town and that is where most restaurants and activities are located. We had arranged through the hotel to have bikes delivered. Though after one trip over a bridge with a sidewalk sized passage for pedestrians and bicyclists to share, my husband nearly abandoned the bikes and only after a relaxing supper was he able to attempt the breath-holding experience for the return back to Parrot Key. We promptly arranged to trade in our six year old child's bike for one that attached to an adult bike. The hotel offers a laundry room with four washer dryer units for your use free of charge along with ironing board and irons. Alma walked me over to the building though she easily could have pointed the way. The property is surrounded by mangroves and thus there is not a beach area with access to the water. Our children enjoyed the dock with railings at the back of the property over the shallow water. We did go by bicycle to Fort Zachery and enjoyed the white beaches and green waters backed up by shady pines and picnic area-- though beware of Portuguese man-o-war if you are in shoulder deep water and there is a south wind. The dock is a nice place to view the sunset quietly if you are unable or unwilling to go to Mallory Square. Finally, this resort attracted a range of guests from younger and older couples, families with young children and teens, and groups adult friends traveling together. The layout of the pool area kept everyone in smaller groups in a tranquil setting. The best sound was of quiet adult conversation and children's laughter.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cloved this resort!\u201d", "Author": "gailmc", "ReviewID": "UR102246079", "Content": "Stayed here with 4 sisters in a 3 bedroom condo on the west side where we could watch the sunsets from our patio each night.

The hotel is beautifully laid out and even though you are close to a main road, you feel \"away from it all,\" so to speak. Our room had two large beds (though one of them was rather noisy) and a nice bathroom. We had our own porch that looked west so we could see the sunset every night. The pool areas were lovely- trees and other fauna separated each pool so you felt like you had your own private pool. They were also heated so on the cooler days it was still pleasant to be in the pools. It was about a 45 minute walk into town, but taxis were readily available. The hotel also had bikes to rent. The staff were all lovely and it was really a very peaceful setting. I would recommend this hotel for families, couples, and other vacationers. My only complaints are as follows: -Our key cards were a little iffy- we had to go to the reception 4 or 5 times to get them reset. -We could hear a bit much of what was going on in the room above us. -Though the hotel's website touts its Cafe Blue, it's really better to think of it more as a snack bar. There's no real kitchen, and though they do have hot meals, it's a fairly limited menu. Barely any vegetarian options, and definitely no vegan ones. The staff however are very acommodating and if you get leftovers from a restaurant in town will reheat them for you. -The shower in the bathroom was kind of weird. It was just a shower, no tub, but was rather large- it felt like something was missing in there. It would have been nice to put a bench on the wall opposite the shower head, otherwise it was really just wasted space. The water pressure was also a little lacking.

Well worth the price - at least in our opinion. On arrival it was kind of busy but the staff was efficient and friendly so we didn't wait very long and were even able to check in much earlier than the posted check-in time. Our kids (9yr, old twin girls) were absolutely thrilled with our \"room\" because there were 3 levels to it. The entrance was one level, the main level included the master bedroom with attached bath, living room and mini-kitchenette area. The third level was for the children and they were thrilled to have their own little \"bungalow\" to stay in. Even though we didn't get back to the hotel until 9:30 or l0pm after touring Key West and walking around Duval St. they enjoyed the time we were there. None of the rooms were super huge but were still large enough to provide a very comfortable atmosphere. The rooms were nicely decorated in a tropical theme and pastel colors so were very relaxing. The beds were very comfortable with feather pillows that we absolutely loved as they were just like home. The grounds of the resort were lush and beautifully maintained and surrounded the three swimming pools so you almost didn't think you were in the city. The only things I was disappointed in were very minor and definitely wouldn't prevent us from staying there again if we ever get back to Key West. One was the floor in the children's room on the third level seemed somewhat barren as there was no carpeting or area rug under the bed. The other was the breakfast. Part of it was free and included your basic breakfast food such as toast and bagels, cereals, juice, milk and fruit but eggs or omelets were only available at a premium price.

The upstairs bedroom on the 3rd floor had a beautiful view of the water. The pool areas were so serene, relaxing, comfortable padded lounge chairs and seating, relaxing music, very spa and zen-like. I would have to say the only downside to this resort was there was no beach, yes there was tons of sand that mimicked beach front and a pier to watch sunsets over the water and an area to rent jet skis but there was no actual beach to enter the water.

Needed two rooms. This place had 2 room \"bungalow\" with sitting area for less than price of 2 separate rooms (here or elsewhere). Because of sitting area there were 3 tv's. Expected this to be first level entry with second bedroom upstairs. Turned out that these were originally townhouses with first floor kitchen, living and dining areas and bedrooms upstairs - giving each bedroom it's own balcony and having a full kitchen. They were intended to be SOLD. Since only about 20 were sold - they are renovating the others. Therefore, as we entered our unit there were two doors. First level is single unit rental. We had to immediately go up a flight of stairs (handicapped, elderly - TAKE NOTE- ask for unit with elevator). Our first level had sitting room (formerly bedroom) with balcony overlooking the gardens, and one bedroom with balcony overlooking the water way and gulf. Up another flight of stairs was the bedroom for our friend - it did not have a balcony. Again, because of the renovation, our unit had a toaster (no microwave) and a micro fridge that held hardly anything. Since this was not originally set to be a hotel/resort, one needs these things to make some food or else plan to spend a lot of money in the tiki bar which is expensive and has a very limited menu.There is a wonderful Deli across the street (shopping center) that makes the bagels for the whole island. Great breakfasts - good price. Fortunately, I had negotiated vouchers for the Tiki bar, so we were covered for lunch. Housekeeping ??? They come in to change towels daily, but did not make the bed or clean rooms. If you want a fresh pool towel, you have to turn in the one you have to get it. Remember,this is more like a time share, where you do the work. The staff was friendly and responsive, if you do ask for something. The units are comfortable and the grounds are beautiful. We had no trouble with parking or crowding at the pools. Liked that there are 4 separate ones - less noise. Travel to Duval street - about 2 miles - if you are able to bike - best and least expensive way. We took cab first day for dinner and were floored to discover it was $12-$15 EACH way. Parking lots downtown are about $30/day. There are meters, but it takes 5 quarters/hour. We had a car,so we got a roll from the bank and used it from about 3-9 pm another day. It was cheaper than cab or lot. One day in Duval was enough for us - touristy shops and expensive restaurants and bars. Went back off Key West about 5 miles to local restaurant (Bubalu's) another night - no cab, free parking, good home-cooked food. Bottom line - beautiful, comfortable place.

Recommendations on tripadvisor.com held true for us. Hotel pictures are accurate. Resort is nearly new and extremely well maintained. Our room was immaculate. We took the king room which was bath and bedroom only. Rooms lacked the added amenities of a coffee maker and iron, but each room has a flat screen and small refrigerator. You can also upgrade to multi-room suites with kitchens. The four pools are the high point of the resort. Poolside bar service and limited menu is available. Sun exposure on the pool area sets behind the buildings at 4:30 p.m. in February, so I recommend that you ask for poolside or gulf or bay side room or suite when reserving. Gulf and bay side rooms provide increased afternoon sun exposure, whereas most other room decks and balconies are shaded. Limited number of rooms may be too close to highway 1A, but you cannot tell that you are in the middle of a city once inside the resort and pool areas. I compared to other 4-star hotels in the same vicinity on Highway 1A and would opt to this resort again in an instant. We spent everyday at one of the resort's four pools, then walked to downtown for dinner and drinks and took a $12 taxicab back.

The resort is not in the center of Old Key West, but you're not far either -- I'd say it's about a 7-8 minute drive. The resort itself is very well-maintained. The rooms are large, and ours looked out on an intracoastal waterway, plus we had a small deck. The decor is Florida tropical -- kind of \"Golden Girls\" -- but it's all still quite charming. There are four pools on the resort grounds, some are salt water and some are chlorinated. The poolside beds are DIVINE, and I have no complaints about the maintenance of the pools themselves. Our only problem was that since we were there in August, the water was boiling hot -- like stepping into a hot tub -- no joke. But that couldn't be helped. I imagine it was the same all over South Florida. The poolside bar was ok, but seriously overpriced. The cocktails were worth it, though. A few things to keep in mind before booking here. -- The facility is totally non-smoking -- you're not allowed to smoke ANYWHERE on the grounds, so if you're a smoker, this may be something to consider. -- You're allotted only one parking spot per room -- This is mostly a family/group friends resort... not necessarily the best place for a romantic getaway -- Ask for a room overlooking the waterway or the pool.

We reserved a 2 bedroom waterfront cottage and a king waterfront suite. Upon our arrival our 2 bedroom was upgrade to a 3 bedroom cottage which was very nice. The front desk representative was very nice and welcoming. The 3 bedroom cottage has three floors. The first floor has a fully stocked kitchen with granite counter top and stainless steel appliances, dining area/large size living room, and a half bath. The second floor has the master suite and queen room each with its own bath and a walk out deck with brightly colored Adirondack chairs. The 3rd floor was a one queen bed room with it owns bath and a great view. The beds were very comfortable and rooms were clean. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is very tropical and cozy. The back deck on the main floor walks out to a white soft sandy backyard with your own sun chairs an umbrella overlooking the gulf. The grounds are very well landscaped from the tropical palms to the fuchsia colored bougainvillea, you feel like you are in a tropical oasis. There are four pools scattered around the property. To access them you must walk through lush tropical gardens where you will come across the great eclectic artwork around the property or freestanding doors that looks as if they were hand carved and sent from Bali. They were so nice that my photographer took some shots here prior to my ceremony and they are some of my favorite photographs. Even though this is waterfront property there is no beach to access the water, but we did a lot of scuba diving and used other beaches around the island so this was ok. They were building what appeared to be a dock when we were there so that would be nice. The resort has a Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next door and a food store right up the road. The location is not downtown but is a very short ride by car or moped. One benefit though from being further away is that you can sit on back deck at night sip a cocktail and hear nothing but the water and palms in the breeze which was very nice and relaxing. Overall I was very impressed I work at a Hilton property and I tend to compare everything. This is like renting your own house in paradise compared to getting on an elevator and going to just another fancy room. Renting 3 bedroom definitely gave us the wow feeling!

We reserved a 2 bedroom cottage and to our surprise we arrived to find out that our 2-bed property was actually a 3 bedroom/3 1/2 bathroom cottage! It was absolutely perfect for our needs since my husband and I were traveling with my father and his girlfriend. The accommodations in the cottage were great. The kitchen was a nice size and finished w/ granite countertops, new appliances, and decent cookware. The cottage was really beautiful - I only have nice things to say about the physical look of the unit. The Cons.... -- Housekeeping was average - at best. When we first checked in, everything appeared to be clean - but it wasn't. After my 11month old crawled on the floor for 5 minutes (literally) his knees were black from dirt on the tile floor. Also, the master bathroom (although appearing clean to the eye) had a smell that smelled like it was \"cleaned\" with an old dirty mop. I actually picked up some spic--n-span at the dollar store across the street and wiped down our bathroom b/c the smell bothered me so much. (I figured this was an easier remedy than calling the front desk to complain within the first 10 minutes of my week long stay. That's just not my style....) -- The hot water heater in the unit can only supply hot water to one shower at a time. If two (or more) people try to shower at the same time - you'll both only get lukewarm water. Also, for some reason the \"hot\" water in the tub in the master bathroom never got hot. It was (at most) warm - but never hot. This was very annoying since the deep soaking tub looked so inviting! We called maintenance - who quickly came to our room to check things out - and we were told that this is a problem throughout the entire property. The maintenance guy told us that hot water heaters in the units are not large enough and it's a design flaw in the buildings. He told me that there was actually no way to get hot water to fill up the tub! He was very nice about the whole thing - I think he genuinely felt bad. He said that he gets tons of calls per week regarding the hot water issue and he hopes that the company will do something to switch over the hot water heaters. -- The location of the hotel stinks. You are in the middle of local-ville (not in a good way) and right off the main road that leads to downtown. It's a 5 minute drive to Duval Street - but parking can be kind of annoying depending on the time of day. We ended up throwing the car in the garage at the Westin for $4/hour when we didn't feel like hunting for a meter or free spot. -- It's not a huge deal - but the cable is not HD even though the unit has beautiful large screen plasmas. Even the big TV in the living room doesn't have an HD box. Oh well. Additional notes.... -- The pools are private, heated, and cozy. The only downside is that the bar/cafe kind of stinks. I don't understand why they don't make this better. -- Parking is first come, first serve - but we never had a problem finding a spot. -- The staff was always very helpful and nice. -- Overall - Parrot Key was great for our needs, but if you want to spend a lot of time downtown, I wouldn't recommend it. I would check out the Westin since its location is awesome - but I have no idea what type of rates and accommodations they have.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place!\u201d", "Author": "Betsy1968", "ReviewID": "UR95941962", "Content": "The grounds are beautiful, and the rooms are very clean and new.

The hotel decided they would change your sheets every fourth day, (ecological concerns supposedly) - other hotels I've been in, let you decide. They turn down their water heaters as well - I had lukewarm showers every day - I asked at the front desk if that were normal - oh yes, said one, that's how it is, the other receptionist seeing my facial expression said she'd send someone to look at it - but there was no change in water temperature. The resort fee of $25 is absurd - what makes it a resort? Are there tennis courts? No. Not even a hot tub! (I was surprised with this). Simply 3 or 4 very small pools.

The first call was a follow up call and the second was a call with an offer to prepay two nights at $159 + a $25 resort fee each and receive a \"resort credit\" of $50 per day. First tip: these people have caller ID and they use it. My guess is that Parrot Key's percentage of return customers is pretty low and they probably rely on nonrefundable prepay package bookings to stay afloat, thus the aggressive sales tactics. We were enticed by the too-good-to-be-true offer and promptly booked a three night stay. Our mistake was not researching this property more thoroughly. Parrot Key is nestled between a Home Depot, Walgreens, and a host of other chain establishments and located nearly three miles from Duval Street on the busy US Route One. It is in a very poor location due to surroundings and noise. I was not even able to find a cup of coffee to start the day in this neighborhood. After a 15 minute wait for the front desk agent in the makeshift lobby, we were handed several lose Xeroxes of the restaurant menu, list of rules and fees for breaking said rules, and an out of date map of the property and a key to our King room. I was quite disappointed to find we were located on the 1st floor in a room with dirty grout on the floor and in the shower. In their brochure, Parrot Key describes the property's rooms having \"spectacular views\" of the pool and waterfront. Our room, a pool view, overlooked a plywood structure and mangrove trees. I couldn't see the pool at all. We immediately returned to the front office and requested a change of rooms. We were given a much cleaner two bedroom suite in exchange and it was the saving grace of our stay. The 925 square feet almost made up for the nonexistent waterfront view and noisiness of the busy interstate. Unfortunately, we were unable to use our two patios as the noise from external air conditioning units and traffic from road completely prohibited any relaxation outside the unit. Singh resorts owns the Parrot Key resort, along with a handful of others in the Florida area. The night we were forced to park in the Walgreen's parking lot next door really piqued my curiosity on the motivation of these people regarding their business practices. Clearly, they make little effort to disguise their lack of commitment to service once a guest at their properties. There are only 74 or so parking spaces for this 118 room property, not to mention that some of these units have two or three bedroom. The \"restaurant\" is open only 6 1/2 hours out of the day (11 to 5:30 PM) and serves microwaved fish (where do they actually cook this stuff? kitchen is outdoors with no real cooking facilities), there is no jacuzzi or hot tub on the property, and guests who don't check out at 11 am are charged a $50 an hour fee if they aren't checked out by one and a full night's stay thereafter. Guests who violate the no smoking rules are charged a $500 PER DAY cleaning fee, and don't expect the luxury of daily housekeeping. Trash is emptied and towels are delivered on a daily basis but that's the extent of it. This place is woefully understaffed, cramped and definitely not a resort or hotel. It barely qualifies as a motel. I am certain staffers are padding these reviews. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra if you are looking for service, much less luxury ...", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cExcellent vacation spot for a romantic getaway!\u201d", "Author": "RaidersOfTheLostKeys", "ReviewID": "UR92293963", "Content": "My wife and I recently vacationed to this resort.

Let me just point out that when my family and I stayed here last summer, we called Parrot key before booking a room to make sure that they had a working TV in the room. (*Note: We were looking forward all day to watch the Olympic soccer game that night in which one of the two countries playing was our home counry. Yea, now you know why the tv was so important to us) We were assured a confident yes, and we booked the room through phone and we got there pretty late on a weekday. The room was decent(I remember it was kind of expensive though compared to other similar hotels in the area, but this one was the only one with an available room). As soon as we got there, we eagerly turned on the TV, and it didn't work. So we call the reception desk and they told me they would send someone. No one came. We then call again. They tell us the mechanical guy left for home so the receptionist would come herself soon. Oh what a surprise, she doesnt show up, so we wake up the next day and try to talk to the manager- shes not in, so the reception dude asks us what we were having a problem with. So we tell him the tv problem then he tells us that it was our fault and that the tv was actually working. Really? Really?? No apologies, whatsoever. I have never been treated this way for something they were negligent for. I mean, the least they couldve done is have one of the employees just come in for a minute and show us the \"right\" way to turn on the tv. COME ON STUPID PARROT KEY EMPLOYEES/MANAGER, it doesn't take an Einstein level genius to work a TV-- I highly doubt we were turning it on the \"wrong way.\" and after I specifically asked them before booking the room if they had a working TV, I could not believe they were so rude and inconsiderate in handling the situation. I was almost resigned to the situation and just decided that this was an unfortunate hotel experience, but I called the hotel again later that day to speak to the manager and get a sincere apology and a partial refund. However, one of the employees refused to let me speak to the manager, and was unbelievably rude. Wow, thinking about that experience now makes me mad even today.

As an aside, there is a grocery store, drug store, liquor store and other shopping and restaurants directly across the street and next door to the Parrot Key. That proved quite handy to stock the fridge with drinks and breakfast food. I should note that my particular room did not have a microwave. I believe some of the other rooms in the resort did have a full kitchen which would have been nice for those tasty leftovers. All in all, I am eager to recommend Parrot Key Resort to anyone headed down to Key West.

Also taxi's were very pricey to go downtown, for 4 people $20.00 each way. We stayed 4 days so the taxi price at the end was very high. The pools are very nice but there were children screaming in 3 of them so we had to use the pool farthest away. I think they should allow one pool for children and designate 1 at least have 2 or 3 for adults only. I realize it was Fantesy Fest weekend but for a 4 night stay it cost a total of $1,762. Also they have a small refrig with coffee and cups but no sink to rinse things out or put the ice in after it melts, and no water so the people staying upstairs in the 2nd bedroom if they awoke eary had to go all the way back upstairs to their room to the bathroom to fill the coffee pot. I believe for a place this pricey they should have a sink if they provide a refrigerator. Had a good time in Key West despite some of the hardships of the hotel.

However consider whats important for you before choosing it. If you are a smoker find somewhere else, as their policy on their entire premises is extremely strict. And you have to sign a form that you will pay alot of money if caught.

We booked this hotel through booking.com for one night on a road trip around Florida with the intention of seeing Key West. Please note this hotel is at least 6k from Key West and they do not provide a shuttle. We were surprised to find the hotel was essentially located in what was a shared parking lot with the adjacent Walgreens. This was all the more amusing as when we asked what the $24 dollar resort charged covered - car parking was was top of list (did they not notice the rather large and free car park next door). Not only was our query in relation to the resort charge met with derision but also what could be described as a \"get lost and just pay up\" attitude; this was merely a prelude to what was to come. We had a double room which I must admit was furnished appropriately and looked the part and the outside deck was a nice touch, however both my husband and I agree the beds were the most uncomfortable we encountered over our 2.5 week road trip. The following morning we discovered there were no glasses/cups in the room. There was no phone to call reception so I walked up to enquire if they could arrange for same to be sent to the room. On entering reception there was a full scale argument ensuing between a guest and the girl behind the desk. I won't go into the details on this as it's not my story to tell but it was inappropriate and unprofessional. Once the argument had finished and the guest had left I was shouted at for my room number and had a invoice practically thrown at me. When I explained that we weren't checking out quite yet and I just need two cups or glasses there was a big sigh and much scribbling of the required items on paper. I asked it it was possible to get them now as we planned to check out within the next 30 minutes. Needles to say \"help\" wasn't high on the agenda, I got the required items from one of the housekeepers who I noticed on the way back to the room. I could out it down to a bad day but all in all two reception staff with serious attitudes means we would not recommend this hotel.

After Our return we decided to stay a few days in Flordia as well as a stop in Key west for a few days. As we drove into town we stopped at the Parrot Key Resort as it was right of themain drag and located right next to a shopping center. Upon our arrival we went to the Lobby to check for a room. We were told that there were no hotel rooms but there were Suites and Cottages. The Suites Were 249.00 the Cottages were 350 to 500.00 if they were on the water. We asked about a Suite there was one available My Wife also asked if they has internet access. We were told Yes it is included in the rate. We then said sure we would like to stay. After to given the paper work to sign we were avised that the Daily rate of 307.00 a Night and that this would include a resort fee of 25.00 a day. This covers the Internet and Parking. Well After we were commited to our stay we got our key and made entry to our room. Each suite is devided into a hotel room and a Suite. This has one Common entry and then two doors one for each room an A and B. there is also two door bells located outside each door which rings. After making Entry to the Common door we entered our Suite walked up a very long and Narrow flight of steps then we found no elevator access. thus many of these units are not ADA compliant.. On the first floor you will find a Bedroom, Living room, Bathroom and Two Balconys. as well as two nice HD TV's. There is No Work Space, There is No Micro Wave, there is also a second bedroom up a second flight of steps.

The Next Morning after Passing the several drunks slepping in the bushes on the property as well as the occiasional panhandler I asked for a refund for the resort fee because the web did not work. My Wife and I spent the day in Key West checking out the sights and having a good time in town. At about 1600 we returned back to our room and found that our room had not been cleaned up I contacted the front desk and was advised that we are a resort not a hotel and thus your room will be cleaned between 1630 and 1730. House keeping finally showed up They Did not Vacuum, They did not make the bed, They Just stacked the new towels on the Toilet, I was also again not able to gain any access to the Internet for the rest of our stay. We also got new set of Guests down stairs they Kept Pushing the door bell mulitple time to get their kids to open the door the problem was they kept pushing our door bell not theirs. This was going on from 1745 to 2400. In addition there Kids kept runnig up and down the stairs, slamming doors, jumping on the bed and overall just making enough noise to keep us awake. We called the front desk to please ask them to stop after we spoke to them. The Front desk did nothing. As they said this is a resort not a hotel. We went to check out I asked for a Refund of the Resort Fee they did reduce our rate by 10 percent for the second day based on the internet.

It appears they cater more to families with older kids and groups verses couples. Although located in a business area of town it was 'okay' once you were inside their compound area. The walkways were as previously described \"somewhat pretty,\" but they felt more like mazes in a private condo complex then in an \"upscale resort.\" We checked-in at 4:20 pm and arrived at our room at 4:30 pm to find the cleaning staff still inside. (It was certainly not due to the previous occupant getting a late check-out as the neighbor advised me they had not seen anyone in our room the previous night) After they left we dumped our luggage and went to find the resort's bar/restaurant for some dinner and drinks. When we did find the bar, we were advised that it was closed for a wedding. (The pools also closed early but the hotel still charged us a resort fee for each day) We went out for take-out and when we returned the parking lot was full. We had to wait for a space which was miles from our room. Possibly this was due to their wedding as we had no real problems the remainder of the stay, but most times could not get parking very close to our room. This \"resort\" has no ice machines and no fridges in their single bedroom units. Nor in these units do they have any other standard amenities you would expect to find in an upscale resort ie: microwave, iron/ironing board, sofa, etc. When I asked staff why no ice machines they advised me that there was no need because all of the cottages and most multiple units had full kitchens... except of course, our single bedroom unit. Apparently they had just converted three bedroom units into single and double units. They offered to have ice from the bar, delivered to our room. They did...only it was over an hour later and long after we had eaten. I cannot comment on their food or bar service etc. as we never went near their bar again. Nor did we use any of the pools (3) and, only sat outside our room on the \"beach\" once in four days that we were there. Instead we spent all our time and money in old downtown and anywhere but this resort. Which is not what we wanted nor what we expected when we booked a \"resort.\" Cleaning was definitely an issue and like the other reviewers we also found cleaning crews in our room more than once after 4pm. The reason may be due to the fact I never saw any cleaning staff at this resort until well into the afternoon on any of the days we were there. As in most of the mid-range hotels in the Keys there are only showers in the rooms and luke-warm water is the norm most of the time. The beds here do seem cheap and are not very comfortable. Additional thoughts: I have traveled extensively and been to Florida numerous times dating back to 1969, but had not visited here for past several years. On this trip we traveled southern Florida visiting both coasts and the Keys. We spent well over $5000 on our 9 day trip and felt we did not get our monies worth especially in comparison to other areas of the world we have traveled. Most stays were in near top-end hotels, Hilton, Marriott etc. and a couple of resorts including this one.

Only 2 years old and filled to bursting with hanging vines, flowers and tropical trees. I mean really, really beautiful.

Forget the iPod radio. (They brought us 2 when I asked).\u00c2\u00a0 No hair dryers in 2 or 3rd bath. No bath mat in master or second bath. Only 1 bar of soap in baths. So if you want to wash your hands later, like I did, you have to step into the wet shower to get the soap bath.\u00c2\u00a0 No mat inside of front door during rain \u00c2\u00a0Super safety hazard. I got an extra bath mat when they brought the missing ones. \u00c2\u00a0 No place to set soap on sink. Just lay it on the counter. NEXT TO THE PLASTIC CUPS! Excuuuuse me? Isn't that a classic joke about CHEAP hotels? I went downstairs and got glasses out of the kitchen. Geez.\u00c2\u00a0 If the parking lot is full they have \"arranged\" parking at Walgreens next door.

Second, the the little area where you keep the dish scrubber on the front of the sink cabinet had water and ants in it.

We complained to the Staff and they were unwilling to even listen- they just continued saying the same thing over and over- sorry nothing we can do about it. We asked to cancell so we could move to a different location and they told us that they had already charged us for two days and we were not going to get it (our money) back. We went to the front desk and asked for a cab, but had to wait until the desk clerk was finished with a seemingly personal phone call. She was also rather rude. At check out, we had to calculate our own bill. Seems the front desk people didn't know how to use a calculator. We tried several time to contact the manager/ Owner- no call back. The front desk did slip-up on that one too. When we tried to reach the manager on Saturday, they told us he was not in; When we brought it up on Sunday, they said, well, he was here yesterday.

They told us to just go to Walgreens parking lot or face a $500.00 'service charge' and they were quick to point out that they had our AMEX on file.

The grounds are absolutely beautiful and tended to and the details down to the potted plants and positioning are wonderfully done. The same holds true for the interior of the units. We had unit 41 which is 3 bedroom and 3 bath villa and has water views. The colors, furnishings and layout is again very well thought out and done. There are 4 flat screen televisions with DVD players, fully furnished kitchen and brand new mattresses put in the day we arrived. The down side is the oveerall cleanliness lor the unit eaves a lot to be desired. There was dust on much of the furniture, the bathrooms were not too well cleaned, the floors not mopped very regularly and the positioning of the furniture had been changed from original set up and needs attention. When a company puts the money and effort to furnish something at the level it did, it is unfortunate that the level of organization and cleanliness doesn't match that level. In addition, the walls are very well scuffed and much of the trim is as well. I understand the need for utilization and productivity but a beautiful assett is quickly deteriorating. Another odd item is that we had a three bedroom unit and a 6 cup coffee maker. Not a big deal but at Tranaquilty Resort in Marathon which is the same company, we had a 2 bedroom unit with a nice 12 cup coffee maker. A curious bit of \"value engineering\". I can understand the issues with possible noise and traffic as the location really is in the middle of a very busy area, however none of that affected us at all once we parked the car and strolled into the complex. Everyone is very friendly, Key West is worth the trip and there is plenty to do and this place is nicely done. The resort fee is a bit slimy as there really is no value added for that fee. Build it into the room rate or offer some value for the additional fee but I sense it is an operator's way to drive more revenue without incurring any additional expense. Having said all this, we definitely would stay at this Hotel again and would look forward to enjoying the pools and restaurant this time.

A separate \"resort fee\" usually indicates extras i.e. such as hot tubs, spa, activity director, separate concierge, restaurants, mini golf course, on site small stores etc.... The concierge is the same person who checks you in and out, who was polite, friendly, very knowledge and gave good advice, but take a seat and wait for people to check in/out to ask questions.

We had a three story 2 bedroom townhome, that was spacious and very well appointed - great appliances, 4 flat screens, 3 balconies - I'd say easily big enough to hold a family of 6, or 8 in a pinch. The hotelier's clearly put a lot of thought into the theme - though for some reason we couldn't find a can opener ;-) Cons: Though the grounds with their lush landscaping and intricate patheways creates this peaceful sanctuary, they could do a better job securing the property's perimeter. I was surprised that you could literally walk right into this area from the main road without being met by anyone on the hotel staff, or a single security gate. Also did not have a great experience with the hotel staff at the front desk. Wasn't certain if this was because it was close to Xmas and the primary staff were off, but it did feel like some basic training was lacking. For instance, when we arrived our room wasn't ready so we headed into town and asked to be called when it was. They never called us and offered no apology upon our return.

I would definately recommend the Parrot because of how COZY* it is and theres really no other good choices in Key West and we DID circle the Island from pebble to pebble so TRUST ME...all the other hotels are dated and pseudo-skanky. All the other things you read in these reviews is correct...staff is friendly etc, resort is clean blah blah blah indeed those are all True, but I was TICKED when I found out that after I had checked into the room, got my key etc....a couple of days after staying there they had taken out a \"Contingencie Fee\" of $500! This was a another deposit they they took without asking us! BEWARE!!!! This fee evidently was in case you ran up a bill at the tiki-bar or left the room smelling like cigarettes or some other arbitrary damage to the property. So lets get this straight...I already paid my deposit when I booked the room...already paid for the room...and after TWO days of staying there they ASSESS this OTHER $500 CHARGE. Hopefully people will not have any debits pending from other purchases when this $500 fee is SLAPPED ON THEIR BANK ACCOUNT! Even though this fee is not actually \"Debited\" Per say... it is AUTHORIZED and Pending as an up and coming potential DEBIT! ALL THIS CRAP WITH NO PERMISSSION! OH! and if you need to use a business printer.. we had to go DOWNTOWN to be able to print ANYTHING! No business center in this RESORT!!! THAT BLEW MY MIND!!! Overall the Parrot was nothing to complain about just because of how cozy, pretty and clean it was, but the front desk was TOTALLY understaffed CONSTANTLY and we spent valuable time listening to the stressed out counter clerk rambling with the maintenance guy over and over, day after day. Other than that, the best part of Key West was the Catamaran ride over on the Key West Express ( $100 per person round trip/ AMAZING! ). If your not an alcoholic, there is not much to do in this city. It is wall to wall t-shirt ships with the same ole cheesy dated designs over and over and over at every shop. Going to Key West In July is like walking around 24/7 with a blow dryer in your face set on low. ITs horrible! The Commerce in Key West Is also dated and certainly there are no malls or up to date restaurants ( Except TGI FRIDAYS), and the restaurants that are functioning are half-[---]. People are barely getting by in this town and it shows. The Beach owned by the state was gorgeous, but the other beaches were kinduv nasty and again..DATED. Lots of thug-ish people walking around from Miami etc. Streets were not taken care of / paved etc. I would not recommend going here at all. I mean there are some gorgeous horizons to see on the coastline, but save your money and spend a couple of extra thousand to go to St Thomas instead! St Thomas is not NEAR as Dated As Key West is. There is just not hardly anything to do in Key West The coral reefs are barron do to the climate changes so dont even think about snorkeling! The best example of how much their struggling financially is: Their \"Aquatic Museum\" as about as big as a White Castle Hamburger Joint.....and was SUPER-SUCKY-LAME! And the price was like $20 per kid! One last thing...and its the biggest of all. There is a WAVERUNNER PLACE Connected to the PARROT RESORT. WE WERE RIPPED OF $300 in ONE HOUR! I am starting a website based upon the experience of this Company~! If you walk near the laundry room the waverunners are down by the docks and they do NOT tell you that you need EXPERIENCE TO RIDE THESE [----] THINGS! I almost seriously and LITERALLY killed my two daughters as we flipped one of these WAVERUNNERS! WE had to be assisted back to the docks and they had these two stoner guys running the place who liked showing off their pecks better than discerning if we were proper material for this hour long ride around the island.

Taxis are very expensive in to town. We paid $15-20 each way. If you want quiet, you'll find it here. Also, there is NO beach or beach access, despite what the website says. The hotel borders the harbor, and it's not really that pleasant and you can't swim there. The, however, grounds are very nice and well-maintained. The swimming pools were fun and the cottages extremely spacious. My main complaints are that housekeeping is a-w-f-u-l! Often they didn't clean the room at all and when they did (after I hassled front desk with a phone call), they wouldn't bring towels or take away old ones. We got in the habit of dumping our old towels out on the sidewalk in front of our cottage in a plastic bag. Crude, but it got the job done and forced them to take them. The telephone system is spotty. We could call the front desk but couldn't call other rooms where family were staying. The hotel bar closes at 6 pm(!). The swimming pools close at 9 pm, before it's even dark. The entire staff goes home at 11 so there is absolutely no one around at night if you need someone.

A word to the wise while you're in key west and staying at the parrot key, cook your own breakfast and lunch as that will save money. Key west dining is pricey but there are fast food places all over. The kitchen is so nice that it will inspire you to cook! A con would be that the pool temp. is too warm and it closes at 9pm and the cleaning women only change the garbage and make beds daily. They do not do full cleaning during your stay.

Key West is not known for their beaches! The villa was spotless clean...the rooms were spacious and it was great that everyone had their own room and bathroom with the exception of two of us that shared. Housekeeping came every morning, we brushed them off as we were in the villa but they were happy to replace towels for all of us!! We had no problems with the inattention of housekeeping. Melissa at the front desk was very helpful and always had a cab waiting for us when we called for one. We loved the pools and had no problem finding a private one when kids were around. It wouldn't hurt to designate an adult only pool. Shelly the bartender was great! We had a great time chatting with her during a rain storm and the food was very good for lunch. Yes, the hotel was a distance from Duval and we would have never walked but it was worth it for the all the extra space and the beautiful pools and scenery. I'm not quite sure of another place in Key West that provides this! **NOTE TO SINGH RESORT** We heard a rumor that the villas may be made into traditional hotel rooms.

We found a great rate at Hotels.com. We booked a 3 bdrm poolside house for 4 nights. The actual house was great - four flat screens, two private patios, full kitchen, and lots of room. The other aspect of Parrot Key we liked were the four pools on property. They're small but the greenery surrounding them is pretty and they were clean. The aspects we were sorely disappointed with were the location, service and amenities. If you go beware that the resort is located about 2 miles from Merrion Square and 1.5 miles from the heart of Duval Street. Cabs for two people were about $10 each way to Duval. We ended up renting bikes for the entire four days which was a good way to get around. The biggest downside to taking cabs or riding bikes back and forth was that we couldn't go back to our room during the day or evening to clean up and change. We ended up staying downtown and hanging out at bars or eating dinner in the clothes we'd been wearing all day - lots of times that meant a bathing suit underneath clothes. We checked in on a Thurs night, our room was not made up on Fri, on Sat it was, on Sun they cleared the dirty towels and empty toiletries but didn't replace them. We called the front desk multiple times but never got an answer. Of the four days we asked for beach towels at the bar, they weren't availabe three of them. Also, the tiki bar is open from 11-6 daily and the restaurant from 11-5. Unfortunately the only restaurant within walking distance of the resort is TGI Friday's. Hence the reason we ended up staying downtown and eating in our bathing suits most nights! All in all we were sorely disappointed with Parrot Key.

The units are spacious and extremely comfortable. While not by the heart of Key West, everything is an easy ride away. The location is actually convenient. A Walgreens (and affiliated liquor store) next door and a grocery store, bagel place, and TGIF across the road, although you'd never know it when you are on the property. (Actually, when my wife and I went to an elegant dinner, the kids decided to stay in and bring in food from TGIF, so that was really convenient.) I was not there when the other recent reviewers had their bad experience. Definitely, something must have gone terribly wrong, since I can't imagine the folks here calling the cops on a guest. But some times things happen, and we've heard only one side of the story. Our experience with the staff has been excellent. Actually, the second time we were upgraded for free from a channel view unit to an ocean view unit, and it may have been by Tina (it was a lady who did it over the phone, and Tina sounds right). The ladies at the outdoor bar, especially Shelly, have been great and even remembered us the second time we were there.

Parking in Key West runs $12 - $14 for the day. We paid $219.00 for a two bedroom townhome and it was well worth it. However, the regular rate of $500.00+ for the same unit seems exorbitant especially without a complimentary shuttle into town. The resort itself is beautiful with lush landscaping and modern, upscale accommodations. We spent a few afternoons/mornings relaxing by one of the pools and enjoyed sitting on our back porch in the evenings with a glass of wine.

It has the potential to be a great resort, but still has a lot of work to do. Most of it being with management and staff training. We arrived on a Saturday, and checked into our 2 bedroom house at the front desk. The front desk staff was young, and simply gave us our room key and pointed out our room ona resort map. We were not told of any of ther esort ammenities, water activities, workout room, guest laundry room, on-site cafe. Most of these we discovered on our own throughout our week there. The rooms are beautiful. Brand new with a good set up, spacious living area, nice rooms. My room was on the second floor, down the hall from the master bedroom. My main complaint is that my room had no windows, just two doors that opened onto the back desk, which had no deck chairs. I was looking forward to sleeping with open windows and an ocean breeze, but couldnt since the doors had no screens on them. Also- the air in the condo cannot be controlled within the unit. It is set at a standard temperature by the facility and the AC kicks on when necessary to reach this temperature. Frustrating since we would have liked to keep windows/doors open and enjoy outisde air instead of AC. Also- the third floor media room is a bit awkward. It can be used as an additional bedroom, but we never went up there, except to see what it was. It has a full bathroom, and a we discovered on day 4- houses the iron and ironing board. There is a gaming unit there, but no games. I assume you would have to get them from the front desk. When we arrived, we found several empty cases of beer on our back deck which had not been cleaned after the previous tenants. Otherwise the unit seemed to be in clean condition. The kitchen is sparsly furnished with very basic kitchen needs, so as long as you only need it for small food/meal preparation, it works fine. Also- they do now provide hairdryers in any of the units. Surprising since my mother didn't bring hers assuming there would be one there. Luckily I had brought mine or else we would have had to buy one somewhere. The housekeeping staff was inconsistent, our biggest complaint is that they do not knock and announce themselves but simply use a key card and just walk into a condo. Many times we were sitting in the living area having coffee or breakfast in our pajamas and a housekeeping would just walk in on us. There is a 'do not disturb' sign to put on the door, but a simple knock would have made us much happier. Also- they did not always replace towels/soap/bathmats in the unit. Most days we found they removed a towel or mat without giving us a new one. They also do not give you any kitchen/dish towels (we used a bathroom towel) and always start the dishwasher, even if there is only a glass in it. The location is mediocre. It says its a waterfront hotel, but that just means waterview. There is no access to the water (which is a sal channel) except at the watersports dock where you can rent ket skis or kayaks. It is next to a Walgreens & liquor store with a WinnDIxie Supermarket & coffee shop & small shopping plaza across the street, which is convenient. We walked across the street for coffee, bagels or other grocery needs in the mornings. It is about a mile and half from the downtown area, so you will need some sort of transportation. We walked downtown the first day, which was fine, but we realized we would not be able to do that daily, or each time we wanted to go out to eat. Taxis are limited and you need to call ahead to have one pick you up on the island. Electric cars are popular to rent, but are expensive. We rented scooters to get around (we were all comfortable driving them) which we the best option. They are easy to get around on and downtown has free scooter parking areas (electric cars have to use meters). The best parts of the Island were: Duval Street, which is entertaining to walk down at any time of day. There is always something going on and people wathing is so fun. I had the best cheeseburger at an approprately named open-air restaurant called Cheeseburgers (the island favorite- with pineapple and avocado). Visit Alonso's Oyster house on A & B Marina between 4 & 6 pm for half price drinks and appetizers, a great deal and huge selection, we made whole meals of it. We spent a day on the southernmost beach, which was beautiful. $5 for chair rental for the day and the staff brings around free treats like popsicles, strawberries etc. We also went to the Buttefly Conservatory, which was an amazing experience. Hundreds of butterflies and birds flying all around you. Absolutely beautiful. On our last day we made sure to do a water adventure and sailed with Danger Charters for the afternoon. We picked a kayak/snorkel/sunset trip which was awesome. We sailed, not motored through the ocean which a max of 20 passengers (as opposed to some of the larger companies who pack up to 100 people on a boat. The guides were great and knowledgeable, taking us kayaking through Mangrove island, and snorkeling through the shallow crescent where we saw lobsters and sting rays. We sailed home with free beer, wine, fresh fruit, chips & salsa and great company. Highly recommended. Overall we absolutely loved Key West. Theres something for everyone and all sorts of people there. Parrot Key is a beautiful resort and a great option if you want lots of space and a full kitchen/multiple rooms with bathrooms. Just be aware that the guest services aren't quite there yet. We had a lot of trouble getting a late check out, none of the employees really seemed trained to handle any of our questions and kept telling us the manager (Tina) would call us to confirm, which she never did. Kyle- the assistant manager was less than helpful and very short with his conversation with us.

This resort is very beautiful. Great location, and friendly staff. But there are some problems in management and a few staff there. First I will start off that I do recommend this place if you are a family traveling to the keys. But again there were a few things wrong. We got there around 9pm, having called to verify that we couldcheck in late, they told us no problem. So my family of 7 go to check in and they have over booked all the rooms. So my ocean view room was not ready to go into and they had us move into a island side room at a discount for the night. The desk clerk had no idea really what was going on. And then told us to talk to manager, who would move us back to ocean side room at the discounted price. Yes they said they would honor the discount for the week. That night there is a highly intoxicated college kid trying to kick in our door, and cursing andyelling on our front porch into his cell. Needless to say security and desk were called as we have children there with us. Security comes out and asked the guy if he is ok!?!?! Then walks away leaving said drunk guy there on front porch who starts trying the door again. Security was called again and never showed, so Ihad to confront this guy and make him leave. First night over. The next day the manager moved us at about 4 pm. But did not honor the discount the desk clerk said she would. Thats ok we still got a steep discount off the price, just not what they said. (I am not complaining about this one... it was a great discount still nearly 400 a night off!!) Manager was very friendly. The rest of week we had trouble getting towels nearly every day. Cleaning staff did not clean. Sheets were not changed once.

The Panini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the cafe although a bit pricey (typical of resort cafes) were delicious. The drinks were also good although they seemed a bit weak. The rooms are spacious with tasteful furniture and beautiful artwork. And, the porch on the first floor and two second floor balconies really bring the outside and its sunshine indoors. The location is very convenient to both Old Town Key West and the beaches. Only one minor recommendation and that regards the music played from speakers installed throughout the resort. After awhile it becomes a distraction and takes away from that paradise atmosphere, especially the speakers located near the back porches. I would reduce the times that the music is played.

There are several pools that are quite nice and the buildings themselves are pristine white as if they were built and freshly painted yesterday. I stayed in unit #8 which is, like most (if not all) of the rooms in the resort is a large, three bedroom unit with a game room upstairs on the third floor (complete with gaming chairs with stereo speakers.) The kitchen was very modern and the bathrooms (my personal pet peeve) were immaculate and the bed gave me the best night sleep I had enjoyed in several months. One thing that you need to be aware of if you are a smoker...all Singh Resorts are non-smoking properties...inside and out. There are designated smoking ares, but they take this non-smoking policy seriously, and I believe that it has a great deal to do with why the resort is so clean...no stray cigarette butts anywhere. Everything is pristine and new. Parrot Key is not like a hotel or even condo (ESPECIALLY for Key West) but a luxury resort that reminds you of the home you would want to have.
