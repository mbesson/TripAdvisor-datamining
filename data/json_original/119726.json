I had my toddler travelling with me and my husband and wanted a non-smoking room, however, we could smell smoke all over the corridor and room we were given. It was the first unpleasant experience it this hotel - the rest followed as we entered our room: thin, darkish-white towels I was skeptical to use, bath tubs that had dirty scum at the bottom,dirty carpet and very stained pillows that were camouflaged by white pillow cases. I was almost afraid to use their linen but had no choice. Breakfast is so-so. The saving feature of this hotel is their very accommodating staff. This is a tired old hotel that needs renovation and new linen.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting !\u201d", "Author": "SDchick1", "ReviewID": "UR121446048", "Content": "Definitely get what you pay for. Cheap price = cheap quality. I was afraid for myself and my family to sleep on the beds. We got two rooms with two queen beds each, they both had an odd smell to them. One beds blankets, sheets and pillows had hair all over them. One bed had what looked like old blood stains on the sheets and mattress cover. The heater blew cold air and the fridge was useless, it didn't close all the way. Not to mention the shower water was freezing then you'd get the water right and it would burn you.

We normally stay at mid-price hotels like Choice or Holiday Inn, but this trip based on the economy and wanting to save money we thought that we would give this budget place a try. BIG MISTAKE. It took the girl (Aunt Jemimah look-a-like) almost a half and hour to check us in because she was more interested in visting with her friends than helping us. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. The room was average, clean, but smelled of stale beer and cigarette smoke, even though it was marked as non-smoking. The area has some nice restaurants, so we had dinner at a nice little mexican rest. and brought back to the room what we thought would be our midnite snack. When I woke up in the middle of the nite to eat the food, it was covered in ROACHES (literally 30-40 of them). YUCK...YUCK...YUCK. When I talked to the girl about it in the morning, she told me that I should have seen it a few months ago when there was a bigger INFESTATION and that they were working with a new pest control company. Many of the occupants seemed to be homeless people with many of them pushing shopping carts up and down the street as they collected their cans and transported their other belongings. The motel caters to these people by offering a cheap weekly rate. Lastly, their free breakfast in the morning features crusty bread and DAY-OLD muffins and danish.(I have worked in the grocery business for the last 25 years and know my day-old baked goods and these were them. Also they have a pool that was closed down by the health department . WHAT A DUMP. Our trip was to last for a week, but we cut our stay with this HELL HOLE short after two days. Unless you are totally desperate (as many of the occupants of this place seem to be, god bless them) go elsewhere. You will thank me for it> I Promise", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "McAllen, TX", "Title": "\u201cawful\u201d", "Author": "kathi913", "ReviewID": "UR18669552", "Content": "Online pictures were misleading.

The hotel and rooms are in need of a face lift. The location is not the best, I didn't feel very safe. The worst part of the hotel is how dirty the rooms are. We only paid 71.00 a night so I didn't expect the hilton, but this place was a dump. The rooms were so dirty I expected to see roaches crawling on the walls. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere else. I wish I had read a bad review so I would have gone elsewhere. The only other review is good (someone from San Diego), must be the owner of the hotel. I wrote a bad review for this place at travelocity.com the never put it on the website. They only had good reviews. I guess there is a little conflict of interest there. I will never trust their reviews again, now that I know they don't post them all.
