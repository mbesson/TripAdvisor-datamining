I booked it online. I was having trouble finding an affordable hotel that could fit a family of five. Imagine my surprise when I found their family suite. One king bed, one double bed and a sofa bed. Plus a full kitchen, dining room, living room and bathroom. The floor plans on the hotel site were exactly how our room looked. We checked in on a Sunday evening and everyone was so helpful until we checked out on Tuesday. The free breakfast on the second floor was delicious. The 24-hour valet parking was convenient. I did some laundry on their 12th floor and was pleased to find out that they sold detergent and softener. Having the kitchen was a great thing, since my husband and I have three kids (5, 10 and 13). We went to the IGA supermarket down the street and stocked up on things to eat at night. My kids loved the rooftop indoor pool and their gym was great. Our suite was spacious, very quiet. If you need to spread out, you should book the Family Suite. The location is great, it is down the street from the Underground City mall and from the Bay Dept. store. The wifi was available and it was free! Did I mention that everyone at Le Square was so helpful??? Harvey, Sebastien, Elena, Louis-Phillip, and Dale were helpful!! After we left, we realized our oldest son left his computer charger plugged in the wall. Willaine in housekeeping mailed it to our home! That is amazing service! We can't wait to go back to Montreal and stay here!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay in the heart of downtown\u201d", "Author": "r_h_Toronto", "ReviewID": "UR127984794", "Content": "If you're traveling as a family, then look no further. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The location is terrific - just off of St. Catherine Street (the main shopping area). The reception is friendly and helpful. The rooms are fresh, airy, and spotless. I'm not sure about other room layouts, but as a group of 4 adults and 3 kids, we took the 2-bedroom suite and were blown away by the amount of space! The living room is huge, and there's a dining table for 6, as well as a kitchen - and the ceilings were 12-13 feet high (ceiling height may not be a critical feature, but it added so much beauty and comfort to the room). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, particularly if traveling with kids. There is plenty of room for kids to move around and play, and the rooms are priced very reasonably. Another perk that's available (but we didn't use) is that you can fill out a grocery list the night before, provide it to the hotel, and they'll deliver the things to your suite, which is very convenient if you do not want to waste time in supermarkets. Breakfast was included with our stay, but it was pretty basic. Bread, bagels, spreads, cereal, muffins, oatmeal, fruits, and beverages. Nothing fancy, but decent nonetheless.

This place is a former factory/warehouse and as such the rooms are GENEROUSLY large, well appointed. My fifth stay. Huge bright rooms, friendly staff, free wifi, kitchen with all the mod cons (don't forget to check to make sure the fridge is turned on when you get in), a little enclosed warm lap pool/gym on the roof with a glass panorama of the area (you can't open the doors to walk along the balcony on the rooftop in the winter...in the summer, it's nice to have a swim and open the doors and look down on the bustle). You're right in the centre of it all, 10$-ish cabs to any place you'd like to go, but everything walkable in minutes, plenty of places to eat and shop. No-brainer. There's a 10$/night parking lot next door, that will give you time up until 4am, no matter when you pay, but will extend it up until 8-9am on the weekends..(unlikely you'll be up that early) so try and find parking on the street (Sundays you can leave your car unpaid on the street until 1pm right in front of the hotel). Alternatively, you can park at the hotel....$. Checkout is noon, which is brilliant, you can usually check in early too. Not a party hotel, generally speaking. Frankly if you avoid breakfast you rarely see anyone. The breakfast is \"continental\" but here that just means breads, cereals, and juices. That said, if you stay in Montreal and are up by 10am for a hotel breakfast, you're doing something wrong! Deals are rare with this hotel. With tax, you're usually looking at around 175CAD/night.

My only complaint is really nothing they could have effected: the city snowblowers and street clearing services begin around 1 a.m. until 5 a.m. on snowy days, and the noise is so constant and loud (like loud garbage trucks scraping pavement all night!) that my sleep was disturbed on nights when it had snowed that day. Thankfully, out of my 2 week stay, this only occurred most of the first week, but not during the 2nd week. When I inquired at the hotel desk if there were any rooms in the hotel that were protected from this very intrusive noise, they said no. Only other problem during sleep was what felt like a cool breeze blowing over me from the heating system which has a vent over it that is forced to blow air in a certain direction and cannot be adjusted. Had to pile up pillows on my bed to block this uncomfortable cool breeze. To the hotel's credit, because of the very dry inside air, they provided me with an excellent air vaporizer that helped immensely.

Old Montreal, the waterfront, Mt. Royal, Rue Ste. Catherine, The Plateau, the subway. Really. Everything. There are several very cool things about Le Square Phillips Hotel in addition to its proximity to all things Montreal. The suites have a fully equipped and fully functional kitchen. This, in addition to the IGA grocery store nearby on Rene Levesque Blvd., means that one does not have to dine out for every meal during an extended stay in Montreal (unless of course, that's what you want). If in-room cooking is not your idea of fun, start the day with the free continental breakfasts in the hotel, then go nuts with great meals in the city the rest of the day. In addition, there is the pool, on the deck, the exercise room, and the laundry room. All very useful amenities during an extended stay. By the way, the view from the deck is fantastic. The suites are great in terms of space, for both living and storage. We are a couple, but with the fold-out couches in the living room a suite can easily be shared by a larger family. And yes, the hotel is animal friendly. We had a couple of dogs among the neighbors during our stay. (They were not intrusive, as the sound-proofing between rooms is quite effective.) The staff continues to be first-rate; fully fluent in English and French and more than willing to accommodate those of us who want to practice our French.

But more than that it's the friendly and helpful staff that make Le Square Phillips so fantastic. The only improvement I could really suggest concerns the included continental breakfast. The offering is reasonably wide (muffins, croissants, bagels, toast, cereals, juices and some fruit plus tea and coffee) but some of the products provided seem to be of low quality. For example the croissants are a long way from freshly baked. Upgrading this offering, even without expanding the range, would make this excellent hotel stand out even further from the crowd. The hotel is well located for the Metro, within easy walking distance of McGill station. The Metro is fast, frequent and clean, with a 3 day pass good value at C$ 16 (around GB \u00c2\u00a310). It will get you just about anywhere you may want to go during your visit. It is also a reasonably easy walk to Vieux Montreal and there is great shopping on the doorstep with La Baie and Le Centre Eaton very close by. One thing we noticed with Montreal, and this is clearly nothing to do with the hotel but is provided for the benefit of Tripadvisor users, is that the number of aggressive beggars seems to have increased significantly over the last few years.

The furniture itself was pretty basic- nothing fancy. Bed was firm and comfortable enough, though sheets were a little too stiff for my preference. I was grateful for thick curtains that blocked morning sunlights coming through the sizable windows when we wanted to sleep late- which was most of time for Montreal has a great night life! And rooms were very quiet at night so there was no worrying about poor sleeping because of noise. The hotel staffs were very nice and helpful. And the maid service was very prompt when we needed. The only thing I noticed was that the cleaning was not as thorough as I am used to with other 4-5 star hotels, but it wasn't noticeable enough to bother me. For travel purposes, the location was perfect. It's central to downtown area- only a block south of St. Catherine and underground city stores, and it's sandwiched in between McGill and Square Victoria metro stations. It takes only 10-15 min walking to Old Montreal and China Town, and about $7-11 taxi ride to St. Laurent and St. Denis (where all the fabulous restaurants are) to the east, and Crescent Street to the west. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway for a couple because Old Montreal area has lots of plush options for that.

I did not really like the location of the hotel despite others praising its central location. Rue Katherine is a pretty busy commercial street with a lot of seedy people. No one bothers you, but when I go on a vacation, I guess I am selfish and like to see the world as I would like it to be and not as it is. The kid friendly stuff is really centered in the old town/port area, which is a 25 minute walk from the hotel. The subway is very good, but it gets to be a drag to have to use it constantly. Again, in the real world, subway is fine. On vacation, I prefer convenience. So in sum, if you are on business or maybe a couple without kids, the hotel is probably good value, but with kids, i would recommend choosing closer to the old town/port or bypassing Montreal altogether. I was not a big fan of Montreal as a family destination. The Botanical Gardens are nice, but pales in comparison to the ones in Vancouver and even falls short of Longwood Gardens, which is in the Philadelphia area. The Jean Talon market is vastly overrated and is out of the way and in a rather shoddy neighborhood. The amusement park, La Ronde, was nothing special. In all, the old town is nice, but falls well short of Quebec City. The crepes are good, of course.

It had bright lights on 24 hrs. a day but the curtains were light blocking so it was never a problem. On some mornings, a trash truck came which we heard but it wasn't terribly bothersome. We were on the 3rd floor. We could not hear any neighbors and thus I don't think they could hear us as our children screamed and yelled at each on occassion (or was that me yelling at them?). My minor complaint was the kitchen. Having travelled to many countries and stayed at similar types of apartment hotels, I wouldn't call this well stocked. It only had four of everything so if you wanted to use a fork to serve something, good luck. There were only four forks and we were four people eating so we had to improvise. There was no tea pot, just a hot water kettle. The tea cups were so small I went to a store and purchased a mug as I didn't want to make a million little teas. There were a few flimsy serving utensils but not much else. There were only four plates, four bowls (again tiny) and a metal collander, one metal bowl and two metal pots and one metal pan. THere were no serving dishes for anything. Even though there is a full stove and oven and microwave, it is difficult to make much to eat for a family of four here. The microwave is so small you couldn't fit much into it. THis was the point of our staying here - to be able to eat dinner at the hotel rather than a restaurant and then go out on the town again- saving money for other things. If you really need to cook, get things that can get boiled, heated in a pan or small individual servings that can be microwaved. The breakfast was great. You can take a tray from the room down to the breakfast room and bring things back to your room. THis is particulary helpful for a family as the room gets quite busy.

This room was so huge, we didn't know what to do with ourselves!! The pictures online do it no justice, as our ceilings were easily 20 ft. tall, with a separate bedroom area, living area, and kitchen area. It was nicely neat and clean. We were located in the middle of downtown, where everything was just a walk away. Old Montreal was about a 20 minute walk, but this city is really pedestrian friendly. The concierge was really helpful with suggestions for dining out, and recommended some wonderful restaurants. There was complementary continental breakfast served each morning, and a small restaurant attached to the hotel. We didn't eat there, but we wish we had, as it looked good. The best part of the hotel is the roof deck with its amazing view of the city. There are lounge chairs and an indoor swimming pool on the roof. The scenery is incredible in that part of the hotel, and we were frequent visitors. In all, we had a very positive experience here. It was a very classic hotel with many strong points.

There is also a drug store within walking distance and many resturants. The Eaton Centre was about a 10-15 minute walk away. Old Montreal was a longer walk away (20+ minutes), but managable and if you hop on the subway at Square Victoria, it is only 2 stops away. I had a deluxe king studio room and it was HUGE! There was a king size bed, large flat screen TV, a full kitchen (fridge, dishes, dishwasher and sink) and big bathroom. There was piles of space and would be really good for families.

There was a free breakfast on the second floor every day and it was very good. They had toast, cereal, english muffins, muffins, croissants, fruit, juice and coffee. If you want a hot breakfast, then this isn't the place. But it had all the basics and was a good way to start the day. My only complaint (and it was so minor) was that the staff was a little too efficient and often cleared your plates if you went up for a second cup of coffee or juice. But again, very minor issue. The people at the concierge desk were fanastic! I asked them lots of questions every morning about where to go and how to get there, and they were always very helpful. Their recommendations were great and they patiently explained how best to get from place to place. There is a indoor pool, fitness centre and patio on the top floor. I visited the patio several times and it was very relaxing to sit there at the end of the day watching the sunset. I'm not sure when it opens, but it stays open until 10:00. I would definately recommend Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites to fellow travellers, in particular families. My stay there was fanastic and would go back again without hesitation.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cA very comfortable and friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "pwiktorski", "ReviewID": "UR33409875", "Content": "It was great because they were able to accommodate, 3 adults, 2 kids and 1 baby in a 2 bedroom suite at a fairly reasonable price.

The location of the hotel is perfect. It is right in the middle of downtown, less than a block south of St. Catherines Sreet and all the shopping it offers. It is also only a 15-minutes walk to Old Montreal, which is where we like to be when in Monteal. The hotel itself is modest. A small reception area, a small sitting area, no bar. However, considering the location there are plenty of bars and restaurants in teh area so I guess you don't really need that inside the hotel. The room that we booked was a studio king. The room was big, with a sitting area and a kitchenette. The bathroom was relatively small and the bath tub not very functional, but the rest of the room made up for that. The hotel towels were nice and soft and the robe comfy. The kitchen was fully stocked in case you wanted to use it (which we didn't). The room had free internet which was great since I had to get some work done over the weekend. The hotel advertises that breakfast is included. Based on our previous experience, we assumed that since the website did not advertise that the breakfast was continental breakfast, that it would be a full buffet breakfast. However, the breakfast was continental breakfast and a little disappointing if you are not a carbs fan (which I am, but my husband is not). Breakfast included montreal bagels, bread, muffins, fruit, cereal, juice and coffee. We had breakfast at the hotel the first morning but went out for breakfast the next 2 mornings. The service at the hotel is magnificent. We asked for recommendations for restaurants for dinner on two occassions, and both times the reception staff sent out to fabulous restaurants that we very much enjoyed. The staff responded to every request quickly (ie more towels, which were sent up in less than 5 minutes) and over all were very keen on good customer service.

If you walk on Catherine street you will find lots of currency exchanges, restaurants, shops and even signs on how to get to the tourist information center (they will give you free maps, information and advise). A few steps away is a pizza place (think it's called pizza II, not sure) that sells good pizza (personal pans with diverse toppings). If you get hungry in the middle of the night, do not want to go out and have the internet you can order from orderin.ca I used that website a couple of times and had food delivered to my room. I had a studio. The room is completely clean, the bathroom is really nice, well lit, very roomy, tub is pretty big and the water pressure from the shower is amazing (they have 4 settings on the shower head). It's pretty strange that they gave me one robe instead of two, considering that I booked it for two people, no biggie though. The kitchen is beautiful as well, there is a full fridge/freezer, oven, toaster, coffee maker, water boiler, microwave. In the cabinets you will have dishes, glasses, forks, knives, spoons and cooking utensils. The oven has a compartment which has pots and pans for your cooking. There is also a dish washing machine, the cleaning employee will wash your dishes in the machine if you leave them in the sink or dirty inside the machine, however you are provided with soap below the sink. I used the kitchen a lot and constantly would stock up on drinks purchased from a close market called IGA which you can also enter from the underground mall. The beds are massive, very firm (I didn't mind it however my boyfriend hated it because it hurt his back), pillows are soft and the duvet is warm. The TV has a mountable stand which is great if you are eating in the kitchen and want to watch TV. There is also a box (forgive me if I do not know the word for it, I attached pictures) where you can hook up your computer (VGA connector), DVD player etc. (you have have the proper wires for this). One thing that got me really upset was that the controls for the TV volume had been locked midpoint, which was pretty low for a room of the size. If you had the washing machine on and the TV at their max, you would not be able to hear it. They give you an ethernet cable to go online with (the cable is real short like 3 foot), They shut mine off on the day I was checking out, which got me really upset especially since I needed to check the bus schedule. The hotel has some great amenities; clean pool, small gym room with weights and cardio machines, patio with beautiful view, laundry room. The breakfast was OK I guess, it was not continental.

The pool area is nothing to speak about, but it is placed on the 11th. floor with a large deck outside, where one can enjoy views of the city. The location couldn't be more central in town. Right by the shopping district and the underground city. 5 minutes walk to the Place d'Art. 10-15 minutes to the business district and the old town. Only warning: Do not eat at the overpriced and not very good Italian restaurant adjacent to the lobby (not a part of the hotel).

A full continental breakfast with cereals, fruit, yogurt, waffles, etc was served every morning. The hotel was a 15 minute walk from Vieux Montreal. It was also just down the block from Saint Catherine Street, a very long street in downtown Montreal with lots of shops (ideal for teenagers). An entrance to the Underground Mall was also 1 block away. There is an excellent pizza restaurant a few doors down from the hotel (they serve 40 types of pizza) that we loved and highly recommend. Staff were very nice and accommodating. We had to valet park our car ($20/night), but the price included in/out privileges and we never waited more than 5 minutes when we wanted the car (we walked almost everywhere). The hotel includes a rooftop pool, but it is only accessible by one ladder at one end, and the entire pool is about 4' deep - ideal for swimming laps, but not good for young children. There is also a coin-operated laundry room next to the pool area - a plus for families traveling with children. We were very pleased with this hotel and would stay here again.

Via the Tourism Montreal site I had originally booked this room on their 1/2 price off third night special (which would have been a great value) but due to a change in travel plans I decided to stay in Old Montreal at a B & B (which for a first time visitor I'm glad we did - loved this \"old\" area as a base), then retuned to this hotel for one night/day after a trip to Quebec City for four days. First - it was a great location for the Jazz festival. Close enough to the free concernts (within two blocks), but far enough away from the scene. The hotel itself is very close (another two blocks) to the train station (VIA RAIL), metro is within a block and the hotel is central to the \"underground\" (shopping/eating) and numerous, numerous shopping options at the street level (St Catherine street is one of the bordering streets on this square and is a mass mecca of retailers if that's your interest). The popular \"Le Bay\" department store also is on this block. Few good fast food type restaurants right outside your door - with street side (under tent) seating (in the good weather). Pizza place right next door was great, and very popular with the locals so that gave us a good hint to try it out! Museum mile is also within a few blocks - so as said - this location is very accessible to a lot of what the inner city offers. Hotel itself , as said many times in previous reviews, is built for a family. Rooms/suites are enormous. We stayed in a King Studio (only two of us) which is the smallest accomodation and with the kitchen table and full kitchen area it was very, very spacious. Our room was extremely clean, all amenities, kitchen ware, glassware, plates, everything you would need to cook in was spotless and plentiful. Good size bathroom, spacious and clean. Very updated. Plenty of dresser space, closet space. Large windows (we overlooked the square). New flat screen TV (large) and bedding was comfortable. For an extended stay, this place is ideal! Hotel itself (our floor) was quiet and the continental breakfast was the usual - but plentiful (toast, bagels, criossants, cereal, waffles, fresh fruit, juices and coffee & tea). No complaints at all. Staff was very nice and helpful in our contacts with them (check-in, taxi service and baggage service). It rained the entire time we were here and due to the short time we never got to even see the pool. But a family full of kids in the elevator soaking wet said it was just fine rain or shine.

I finally opted to take a chance and we spent 2 nights at this hotel. THE LOCATION You cannot beat this location. Steps from The Bay and the shopping on Ste-Catherine. We were also walking distance from the Palais de Congr\u00c3\u00a8s where we were attending the Car Show. So, I can only say this is an ideal location. THE ROOM Well, it was huge. We opted for a Junior Suite with a kingsize bed. The suite was the size of an apartment which was great. BEDS The bed was one of the worst hotel beds I've ever slept on. Both my husband and I had sore backs after our first night. As for the pull-out sofa bed, it was just fine for our 3 year old son, but I doubt it would be comfortable for an adult for a full night. And, I cannot imagine that a couple could share the bed -- it is too small. The standard pillows are brutal, but you can easily get feather pillows by asking at the front desk. BATHROOM Enormous bathroom with excellent water pressure in the shower. Bathroom did not have a fan, which would have been nice. THE POOL A pool is a main amenity for us as our toddler loves the water. It served our needs, mainly because we were the only ones there. It is a small pool with a maximum capacity of 10 people. It is about 4.5 feet deep the length of the pool and I would estimate it to be about 10 feet wide and about 30 feet long. The temperature was a little cool but certainly bearable. A great view as the pool is on the roof of the hotel. BREAKFAST A typical continental breakfast: toast, bagels, croissants, pastries, cereals, fresh fruit, juices, coffee, yogurt. Nothing extraordinary, but certainly enough to get your day started. PRICE: In my view, this hotel is overpriced. The standard price for our Junior Suite is $215. We took advantage of the Sweet Deals promotion offerred by Tourisme Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec where you pay for one night and the second night is half-price (http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/B2C/11/default.asp). Even with the deal, I felt the room was overpriced compared to what you can get in this price range in Montreal. While we would have had a smaller room elsewhere, the beds would have been much better. CONCLUSION Glad we tried it, but I won't stay here again -- unless we get a much cheaper deal (and my back is prepared for the horrible bed).

Plenty of area shops for everything one could desire. Easy access to the main highways into and out of Montreal which is also a plus.

As i was travelling from England, tripadvisor was my best bet for advice. After reading other reviews of this hotel I decided to book and let me tell you, believe the reviews! I often travel alone and if you're female you'll understand that sometimes the eating alone thing can attract the wrong sort of attention. The benefit of this hotel is you have your own kitchen so you at least have the choice of having some meals in your studio. The atmosphere is modern but relaxed, there is a small gym and beautiful roof terrace, also a laundry room and pool on the top floor. You have internet access in your room if you bring a laptop, I didn't but quickly discovered the room next to reception where you can use the internet and print for free. You just need to tell reception and they will let you in. There are busy times when there is a wait list but ask reception to call your room once it's free. The room: I had a deluxe king studio and it was huge! Everything you could need is there and of a really high standard. You can pay for movies or there are numerous tv channels, though watch out for some of the tv movies which will appear on your final bill - minimal amount but I was unaware of this. Within your first few days, go to St Catharine St Ouest (turn right out of hotel, its the main road running past The Bay department store) and head a few blocks to the left where you'll find a square with the tourist information centre and all the bus sightseeing tours. I took an open top double decker bus tour and it was so worth it, you get to see the old port, Notre Dame Basilica etc etc and you really get your bearings and see some fantastic architecture. I did this on my last day to kill some time before heading to the airport - do it sooner than I did! I found Montreal to be a really pleasant place full of polite, respectful people. You'll see quite a few homeless people and you'll probably get asked for money, but if you refuse you'll just get an almost apologetic ok, have a good day type response which surprised me.

He warned us that if we took longer than 15 minutes then the hotel wouldn't be responsible for the parking ticket. Hm.. We also told him that we would park the van ourselves since we had things we needed to clear out of the van. Instead of telling us that it's valet parking only, he told us the hotel parkade's full and we would have to park our van 3 blocks away in another parking lot, in the rain!

Oh well, valet service for $19/ day parking. A very good deal. When we arrived in the room, we found a wine cork and crumbs under the round table for 4.

On our last night, instead of spending it with our daughter, we went down to Upstairs jazz club on Rue MacKay with our son for the jam night. We were the first to arrive before the band, the first to put his name down to jam and yet, the drummer put all his friends up there, 2 songs each @ 20 minute/piece and ignored this young kid from out of town. The sad part was my son even sat and chatted with the band so they knew he was from out of town. He was told as late as midnight, 1/2 hr before the close of the jam that he would have a chance to go on. Well, he never got called.

We arrived late on a Sunday night and we were welcomed by very friendly front-desk staff. The property seems to me to be a reconverted office building. The re-conversion was done with very great care and good taste. Our room was more a large one-bedroom flat - with a fully equipped kitchen - than an hotel room. You feel that you have your own place in the second largest French-speaking town in the world! The attractions of the place are essentially three: 1. Location You are really at the hearth of downtown Montr\u00c3\u00a9al. Everything (and I mean everything) is at walking distance! 2. Service The hotel is modelled upon the self-catering apartment philosophy. But you have only the advantages of that (i.e. extremely ample rooms). Whatever you may need, the competent, professional and friendly staff is there to help you out. They do deserve full marks. 3. Prestige of the building The building is a very nice one at the hearth of the town. If you want to be perfectionist, the choice of the furniture in the roms could have been more tasteful. In spite of that, the overall result is outstanding. I particularly liked the gym and the pool at the top floor. The pool is to small to have a good swim, but the deckchairs in the terrace command a spectacular view of the skyscrapers of Montr\u00c3\u00a9al. Not to be missed! I would list only two (very minor) negative points: 1.The breakfast room tends to be overcrowded and the food there is not what you would expect in such a nice property. This said, it would be unfair to complain about that: continental breakfast is included in the room rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pretty unusual feature in Canada, where you are charged for every extra breath of fresh air! 2.We were granted a late check-out at 01.00 pm during our second stay, but the room-maid knocked our door ten minutes before the term.

They were always ready to help and ready to go above and beyond what was asked of them. I stayed in a family suite with 3 children and my wife, and we found the unit to be quite spacious, clean and tasteful. The kitchen was well supplied with basic utensils/pots/pans/dishes. Bathroom was similarly equipped and very clean. The beds and linens were of very good quality, the kind you would find in a more luxurious hotel. The HVAC system was also very good. No noisy corner/wall unit, and there was attention to detail apparent with the installation of air deflectors under the curtains.

It was a nice room, just not my kind of look and feel because it was not warm and homey (which can be important in a cold city like Montreal). The pool, as other reviewers have noted, is tiny.

No wonder its the #1 rated hotel in Montreal, not to mention the biggest bargain! On my last visit, I had booked a studio suite, as I usually do. I've only ever stayed in room 1006, however it was not available this time, and I was given room 819 instead. However when I walked into my room, I noticed that it was different. I then realized that I had been upgraded to a junior suite! It was HUGE (just under 700 square feet!). I could actually run around the room, it was that big! Beds are a little firm, but I had no problems sleeping. Bed linens were of suprisingly good quality, VERY soft and definitely not cheap, and better quality than that of pretty well anywhere I've ever stayed! My room had a sleeping alcove with a double bed and a TV, which was a nice touch, since I'm used to staying in studios. I only stayed 1 night, yet I did use the full kitchen,(cookware provided) to make my dinner that night, and the dishwasher is a great touch. Local calls (except for 800 numbers) and high speed internet (hard-wired) are free. Service at front desk was excellent, and very helpful. The free continental breakfast is a nice touch, and you can take it back to your room if you want to eat it in private. There is a little pool and exercise room on the roof level. I never expected so much for $132.00 CAD per night!

Old Montreal is also in walking distance (10min) but the subway system, cabs or buses could also take you there promptly.

After reading numerous negative reviews regarding the Hyatt, I started searching for an alternative. The first thing that jumped out at me was the number of glowing reviews for Le Square Phillips, which was conveniently located next to my conference. After seeing that it won a TripAdvisor award, I booked a deluxe studio. When I arrived at the hotel near sunset, the area looked a little questionable. Indeed, two streets over, there were homeless panhandlers, but if you stick to areas with lots of pedestrian traffic, it's fine. It's about a 25-minute walk down to the Vieux Port (Old Port), which is a fairly straight shot from the hotel. If you need directions or restaurant suggestions, just ask the superb staff; they'll be more than happy to help. Reception was friendly and helpful. If you don't speak French, it's not a problem; young Quebecois are fluently bilingual. When we opened the door to our room, I couldn't believe the sheer size of it. Most impressively (as my roommate is a serious clean freak), it was *spotless*. As in, no crumbs in the toaster, no crumbs in the silverware drawer, no water spots on the dishes! The room was quiet and very comfortable, and the full kitchen meant that we could save money by eating in-room, which we did in true Montreal style: fresh baguettes daily, French wine, French jams, brie and espresso courtesy of the grocery store located a few blocks away (about 20 minutes one way on foot). There is a small deli attached to the hotel, but it was always empty even at peak times, which made me hesitant to eat there. When I arrived at the Hyatt to register for my conference, it made me doubly glad that I'd chosen the Square Phillips. The Hyatt was outdated and under major construction, the rooms much more expensive, and very dark and cramped. The conference itself was very poorly managed by the Hyatt, but I was able to retreat to the Square Phillips for some much-needed rest and relaxation at the end of the day. I didn't take advantage of the pool or exercise facilities, but it was nice to have them available (the hotel also has a laundromat). The high-speed internet wasn't as much of a success; most of the time, I fought to get it to work, but it could have been my computer.

I was torn between Le Sq Ph and Hotel XIX. The goal was to find a highly-rated TripAdvisor hotel in a good location costing $200 max. We hit the jackpot!!! Le Sq Ph is all that and more. Prime location! It is one block from Catherine St and it's a fun, bustling few blocks away from Cresecent. Super Clean! The rooms are super clean...all areas of it. The kitchen area is fully equipped and well maintained. We ended up using the kitchen to make a great breakfast of leftovers from a fab (but very pricey) steak dinner at Queue de Cheval and the breakfast buffet, where there were no issues with our taking items to bring to our room. Fab Concierge! We interacted with 3 concierges and each of them were amazing. They each were genuinely nice and extremely helpful. Hotel XIX looks nice & cozy online and is in Old Montreal, but I don't think the location of St Sq Ph can be beat. Old Montreal is lovely and quaint, but being closer to the heart of downtown is much nicer since it is close to all the shops, bars, etc. If you are looking for a more low-key, vibe, then Hotel XIX might be the better pick. Regardless, Downtown to Old Montreal is within walking distance. (We parked the car and didn't move it; it's a great walkable city.) Jardin Nelson is a great outdoor dining experience. There's live music in the back and there are huge heaters over each table since it is now chilly. Finally, a must-do is the bar/restaurant at the top of Place Villa Marie. OMG. Best view ever!

(The countryside between the two cities this time of year was fantastic and we had the added bonus of a coach driver who turned into an entertaining and knowledgeable tour guide for some of the trip.)

I have to chime in and say that I agree with the masses. I was traveling with my wife, father, mother-in-law, and 3 1/2 year old daughter. We ended up with two rooms...but let me tell you about the two bedroom suite we had: Got this for about C$185 with a AAA/CAA discount. It included one bedroom with a King bed, another with a Queen (or was it Double?), a huge living room, dining room and full kitchen. The ceilings were very high, so it appeared even larger, and there are large windows - the view was primarily of office buildings, but it was nice to have all that light. The included breakfast is nice - lots of bagels (Montreal style), breads, fruit, juice, coffee, etc. There is a breakfast room in the hotel, but you are welcome to pile up a tray and take it to your room - that's what we did! Location is right near rue Sainte-Catherine, one of the primary shopping streets of Montreal - on the opposite end of Square Phillips is The Bay/La Baie - one of Canada's largest department store chains. Walking to the west on Ste-Catherine are numerous shopping centers and restaurants. (We did take out from Reuben's deli and Mr. Ma's Chinese and brought it back to the room - GREAT choice for a tired toddler!) Metro is two blocks away, and cabs are easy to get. Walking to the east on Ste-Catherine, it gets a little bit shadier - nothing dangerous, in my opinion, but many more strip clubs, etc. I didn't get to use the swimming pool, but there is a nice lap pool, exercise room, and deck up on the top of the building. Nice place to relax after sightseeing. Don't miss Trattoria Zia next door (there's an entrance in the lobby of the hotel)! Great Italian food, and really nice hosts who let us try all kinds of goodies while we were waiting for our food. Finally, the high speed internet in the room (free!) made it easy to keep in touch with the office. Just a couple of small negatives: 1. The lap pool was too deep for me to feel comfortable taking my daughter in...no steps or \"shallow end.\" 2. Although internet access was free, they charged C$0.60 to make a \"toll-free\" call.

Upon arriving at the hotel we were pleasantly greeted by the Concierge who immediately arranged to have the bags unloaded and car parked. Check in took less than 5 minutes and the front desk staff were VERY pleasant. Our luggage arrived no more than 15 seconds after we entered the room. We had a One Bedroom Suite on the sixth floor.

Plenty of towels, etc. Only complaint was that the water pressure wasn't very strong in the shower, otherwise perfect. -Living/dining room area was very nice and had comfortable seating and dining areas. Also a sofa bed. The TV stand allowed for the TV to be pulled out and swiveled for easy viewing in any part of the room. -The bedroom had a King size bed which was very firm and comfortable, LOTS of closet space. Also a desk and TV. The hotel is surprisingly quiet and in the rooms you almost never hear the outside world. The housecleaning staff are very detailed and even washed our dishes. The pool is small but very very nice and there is also a very comfortable sun deck which is also small but nice. The location is great as well.

The stay for three nights was absolutely the best hotel experience I have had for years. There was my wife and I along with our 16 year old son. The hotel shows its youthful age and it is soundly constructed to last. The cleanliness of the property is impeccable. We occupied a double suite which had two double beds. The suite was well over 600 sq feet in size and a ceiling that was in excess of 16\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It was located on the third floor to the hotels back and sound proofing was exceptional. Our room overlooked a large parking lot and if I had not looked out the window I would not have known it existed. The pool and sun deck were located on the top floor. The pool is far from Olympic size however on a hot, humid Montreal day it provides a more then reasonable place to cool off. The sun deck is spacious and offers at least 16 chair loungers for guest use. My complaint on the pool deck is that it does not provide direct access to the outside as all doors were locked. You are required to walk around the pool, through the weight room and onto the deck. The hotel service and staff was exceptional. It appeared they were happy to be there and serve the client needs. The continental breakfast rivals anything you will have elsewhere\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6including home. Fresh fruit, toast, bagels, cereal, muffins and juice x 3 along with coffee/tea. The service at the breakfast was impeccable with at least three servers for your needs. The area to eat was good and well setup however you do have the return to your room option. Just remember you have a fully equipped kitchen in you suite for reheating as well as toasting bread. The closest grocery store we could find was in Place Desjardins and it will meet and exceed all your needs. Easiest walk to the store is on Rene Levesque Blvd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c approx 5 city blocks. Location says it all\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6close to shops, metro and Rue Ste Catherine. Lots of good restaurants nearby which include Nickels and Reuben\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Ste Catherine.

There is private valet parking that you will pay a premium for (though it is secure inside the hotel). It may be cheaper to use the lot to the left of the front of the building as the hotel parking ran us $20 a day with taxes and tips to the valet. My wife was impressed when she accidentally left $30 in the car and found it there untouched the next day when the valet brought us the car. The breakfast is standard fare, nothing too remarkable, but you simply must get to the roof (which you can access from the stairs and one of the 3 elevators) where you will enjoy a great view from the terrace outside the pool area.

I booked 3 rooms for 3 nights each. Our entire group loved the hotel - it had helpful and friendly service, clean and spacious accommodations, helpful and knowledgable concierge...I can go on! I ordered a rollaway bed for an additional $15CAD/ night in our one room suite. It worked out perfectly for our family of 4. Even with the rollaway in our room with two queen beds, we still had plenty of room. The continental breakfast (included in the price of the room) was fresh and included a nice variey of pastries, muffins, and croissants, as well as fruits, cereal, oatmeal and several juices. One morning I decided to bring the food into our room. That worked nicely. Before we arrived in Montreal, I had called several times about possible tours. The concierge was very helpful - going as far as doing a bit of \"research \" on possible tours and had even called me back. Waving down a taxi was never a problem in front of the hotel. Shopping is extremely convenient. The Baie, one of the flagship department stores, is within one short block of the hotel. The entrance to the underground city/shopping is about 2-3 short blocks away. Distance to Vieux Montreal is about 10-15 mins walking - luckily it's mostly downhill going to Vieux Montreal. We normally took a cab back to the hotel in the evening from Vieux Montreal; cost is about $7.50CAD. I asked the front desk for restaurant recommendations and they gave suggestions which turned out to be excellent. We were hungry when we arrived and wanted something quick to eat. Terrye at the front desk suggested the Italian pizzeria a few hundred feet from the hotel. Food was delicious - very similar to the pizza in Rome! Other wonderful places to eat in Vieux Montreal are: Homard Fou (specializes in lobster dishes) and Le Sauvagine (French). Service always seemed to be slow wherever we ate, but I think it's because we're always so used to eating quickly and being rushed. Every place we went had friendly and attentive service, but the pace was slower than what we are normally used to in California - I mean this is as a good thing, to actually be able to relax and savor a delicious meal in a lovely setting. One other unexpected surprise is the Italian restaurant, Zia, next to the entrance of the hotel. They had some of the most delicious homemade pasta. The chef even prepared dishes to accommodate our request - didn't have to be on the menu. After a full day in Quebec City, we didn't feel like going far for dinner. That's what prompted us to try the restaurant. We're so glad we did! We found out that they deliver to the rooms in the hotel. All in all our experience with Le Square Phillips (and Montreal)was excellent.

I was sorely disappointed when I arrived to find out that the pool would be closed to be repainted starting Monday. I think that this should have been disclosed on their website. My 6 year daughter was really looking forward to using the pool Monday morning. The accomodation also included a continental breakfast buffet which included coffee, juice, breads, cereals, and fruit. Nothing fancy. A nice touch was that the breads had the Montreal style bagels which I love. The parking is expensive at $17.50 + taxes but this is on par with other downtown hotels. The only problem is that there is no self-parking, only valet parking. So wherever you're going, leave at least 10 minutes for the valet to get your car.

The hotel is in a great location, right across the street from a historic square and next to Ste. Catherine's street, a shoppers paradise. It is also only a short 10 minute walk to the Old City. The hotel is pretty big at to floors. Our room was the 2 bedroom suite and it was enormous. I live in NYC and I can tell you this room would sell for more then a million. The two bedrooms were huge, there were two TV's, plenty of closets, the windows stretched right up to the ceiling offering spectacular views, there was a complete kitchen that even had a dishwasher and the was a large table pre-set for two.

The amenities of the hotel include the pool, which is on the top floor offering great views of the skyline. Next to it is the exercising room, which was fully equiped and even had a TV.

All the glowing comments that we read are absolutely true. Perfect location, it is within a couple of blocks of the La Reine Elizabeth/central train station. Metro stop for one of the main subway lines is just a block or so away -- that's McGill. The Victoria Square metro stop is about two blocks away, downhill, and on a separate line. That covers wherever you want to go that's near a metro stop, including the botanical garden, olympic stadium, La Ronde amusement park, St. Denis area, etc. Place Jacques Cartier and Vieux Port aren't really near metro stations, but are walkable from hotel. We usually did cabs for these locations, about $7 to $8 CAD including tip, a bargain. Yes, the rooms are huge and very nice. Service is nice. Continental breakfast has no hot food, but good bagels, croissants, fruit salad, good coffee with real creamer, different juices, etc. Downtown, this is worth around $6 to $8 per person every day, so we were NOT complaining. Adjoining the hotel is a nice deli/convenience store with hot italian food (good), sandwiches to order (good), minor groceries and sundries of the type useful if you are in an apartment hotel like this (milk, butter, cold cuts, soft drinks, individual beers and wines, laundry supplies, etc.) Right next to the hotel, on the square, are several restaurants with terrace seating. A good moderately priced french restaurant, a mid level italian restaurant that also has pizza, an interesting noodle restaurant that we just didn't make it to, and a Second Cup (Montreal's Starbucks) just steps away, and sit outside if the weather's nice. Immediately across the street from the hotel is a bank with ATM located in an indoor vestibule. Right around the corner on St. Catherine, a two minute walk, you find a full-sized pharmacy that carries everything the little deli/convenience store doesn't have. Next to that is a Future store, which offers one hour photo processing from film, memory cards, whatever you've got. They also sell any type of battery or phone recharger that you may have forgot. Just past the Future store is a movie theatre. All along St. Catherine in either direction is just about any sort of retail shopping that you may be interested in. I noticed the hoochy-coochy places that a reviewer mentioned -- they are just typical downtown business man types of things, nothing overt and certainly not any kind of red light district from any stretch of the imagination! One half block away on St. Catherine is The Baie (Hudson Bay Company upscale dept. store). This is also a gateway to the McGill metro station, a shopping mall, and the underground city. At rack rate, but with week's stay discount, we loved this hotel and thought it to be a bargain at $161 CAD per night. We stayed one night at the La Reine Elizabeth for proximity to train station. It was beautiful and quite fancy, but at $199 CAD no breakfast, I'd choose Square Phillips again with absolutely no hesitation.

We needed a suite with a separate bedroom (with door) for us and comfortable sleeping accommodations (no air mattresses on the floor) for three 16-year-old girls. We had a moderate budget and despaired of finding anything in our price range in a large city such as Montreal. By a stroke of luck we found Trip Advisor (and we will never again plan a trip without it!) and through the reviews of Montreal hotels we found Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites. The reviews raved about the rooms, location, value for the price, free breakfast, cleanliness, staff friendliness, service, etc. Upon the advice, and after calling the hotel to speak directly with a representative (we had a lot of questions and he was completely helpful, courteous, and patient\u00e2\u20ac\u201das were ALL the desk clerks during our stay), we booked for July 19 through 24, 2005. We reserved what they call a family suite\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtwo sleeping areas (one a separate room with a door\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvery comfortable king bed, TV, huge closet and the other a double bed in a semi-private area of the main room---open to the main room on one side and walled on two sides with a frosted glass and wood panel for the third wall. There was also a sleeper sofa in the living room.) The suite was huge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe size of an apartment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith contemporary furnishings, large windows, high ceilings, some lovely architectural columns with lighting to enhance them, and a soothing color scheme. Beside the sleeping areas and living room there was a full kitchen with 6-seater table. The kitchen is beautifully clean and equipped with everything you would need to cook and serve if you wished to do so (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). Also has a full coffee/tea service with a thermal carafe coffee pot and fast heating electric teakettle. (The creamer is the powdered kind, but if you plan ahead, bring up some individual creams or a container of milk from breakfast and keep it in the fridge.). The bathroom is also enormous and seems to be fully set up for handicapped access. We had originally asked for a two-bedroom suite, but the reservation agent we called (the one mentioned above) suggested this as a more affordable alternative\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand it was perfect for us and fit better into our budget. The family suite was $242 Canadian per night (with our AAA discount) which netted down to about $212 USD. A stretch for our budget, but a great price for what we needed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand we discovered it was an enormous bargain for what we received! The housekeeping was perfect with only a small glitch in the beginning (only four towels for five people, and the coffee we used was not replaced the first day) but after we left a note, every other day was perfect. They even accommodated us on a very late room cleaning when my husband had an emergency at work that kept him on the computer and in the room most of the day. At his request, the housekeeping staff cleaned around him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they respected his need to work, whispering, and working very quietly. Ask for a view of the park\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere is a pretty square with trees and lights and jewelry artisans selling their wares. Be sure to check out the rooftop pool\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsmall but pretty and immaculate (also heated and glass enclosed) and the terrace\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcomfortable lounge chairs and a view of the square, a large gothic church, and some beautifully lit city buildings\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvery pretty and peaceful at night. (There is also a small but well-equipped fitness center near the pool area.) There is a bountiful free breakfast with an enormous selection of breads, muffins, croissants, cereals, fruits, and beverages in a very spacious and comfortable area on the 2nd floor. However, if you are counting carbs, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to pack your own protein sources! We drove to Montreal and when we arrived at the hotel we had the hotel park the car in their indoor garage\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand retrieved it only to drive home (parking is $16.50 a day\u00e2\u20ac\u201dCanadian Dollars\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou might find cheaper parking, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was worth the hassle). We purchased weekly Metro cards for $18 each, and so had unlimited access to the Metro and busses during our stay. There is a metro stop only a few blocks away (McGill) and you can take that three stops east to a major transfer point\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBerri-UQAM, to purchase the weekly tickets. The agent at the McGill stop allowed my husband to travel through at no charge since he did not sell the weeklies at McGill. The Metro is VERY easy to use and navigate\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclean and fast. The most we had to walk from a Metro stop to get to a destination point was perhaps 5 or 6 blocks. If you like to walk, much of what you will want to see is within walking distance, including Old Port (a 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 minute walk southeast). My teens were tired after our Old Port day, so we took the Metro back. My husband walked back, and he made it to the hotel before we did. The hotel is located in a major shopping area near McGill University. St Catherine Street is just north of the hotel and if you head west you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a lot of shops and restaurants, including entrances to at least two sections of the underground shopping malls (huge!) \u00e2\u20ac\u201dEaton Place is the biggest and is about four blocks west of the hotel on the north side of the street. Heading east on St. Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is not as good---gets a bit seedy. There is an abundance of reasonably priced food in the area\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom the burger chains, to great ethnic food (super Lebanese place next to the hotel and one in the food court of the underground shopping nearby). The hotel has a small eat in type of deli (but with tablecloths!) The food is reasonable, delicious, and huge portions. If you like great vegetarian food, there is a terrific buffet restaurant Le Commensal, on St. Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Street\u00e2\u20ac\u201dturn west onto St. Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and walk about 4 blocks. The restaurant is on the second floor (southwest corner). If you ask the concierge (they are also great--especially Alex!) he can give you the exact street. Le Commensal also has a location on Rue St. Denis in the Latin Quarter (take the Metro to Beri-UQAM and walk north a few blocks on St. Denis.) As we were with three teens we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do any night-life, but we passed many cafes and clubs playing great music into the night\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially in the Latin Quarter on Rue St. Dennis and on Crescent Street (about 10 blocks west of the hotel between St. Catharine St. and Ave. Masonneuve). We took the girls to a late dinner at the Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (their choice not ours!) on Crescent (10 pm on a Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlate for us but average dinner time for Montreal) and when we came out they got a real taste of a bustling Friday night club crowd\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwild! But safe\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe streets are packed with people and lit like day with club after club and caf\u00c3\u00a9 open to the air and spilling with revelers. A blast to just watch\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Other things to do\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe week we were there Montreal hosted three festivals\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Comedy Festival (you MUST see the street performances\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially the main events\u00e2\u20ac\u201damazing), the international fireworks competition (Wed and Sat nights at La Ronde amusement park\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthese fireworks were beyond description\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe best we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbeyond worldclass. Pay a bit extra with your La Ronde admission for reserved seating\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere is as much to watch at eye level with these as there is in the air.), and the world swimming/diving competitions. We missed those for lack of time, but saw two nights of the comedy festival and saw the fireworks (twice also\u00e2\u20ac\u201dWed at La Ronde and Sat from the city\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalso beautiful\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust not the same as seeing them close up). We also took a Gray Line sightseeing tour so we could take in as much of the city as possible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe did the six hour tour with four stops\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith three teens tired from a late night a La Ronde the day before it was too long for their tolerance. However there is a three-hour tour and that would probably have been a wiser choice. Our driver was Henri and he spoke non-stop in French and English for most of that time...his information was fascinating. We took a boat tour for an hour around the harbor, hoping for the same type of guide, but were very disappointed. The scenery was great and the harbor interesting but the guide spoke little and it became just a scenic cruise. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if all the tours are like that or if we were just unlucky. The boat company was Le Bauteau-Mouche. Some other things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 To save some $$, look for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Passport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd books at the information counters in the underground malls. There are lost of coupons in there. However we found that the La Ronde coupons were not honored on Fireworks days and that the coupons for the boat tour were not accepted since the hotel had made reservations for us. We were told that they would take them, but that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to ask the hotel for a refund on the reservations\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseemed a bit weird, so we just passed on the coupons. Like other cities, there seem to be homeless people everywhere in Montreal, and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s area of the park and St. Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s St. is no exception. People do beg and seem to be a bit more aggressive about it than they are in New York City, but there are so many people around that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel unsafe. It is a bit unsettling at first, but you do get used to it. Exchanging USD to Canadian is easy as there is a bank across the street from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey gave the best exchange rate. ($2 transaction fee). We reversed the process to exchange CD to USD the day we went home, but since it was a Sunday we had to use an exchange store. The rate is not as good, but not bad. There are exchange (Change) stores all over the city. Crossing the border on the Canadian side was easy and fast (on a Tuesday afternoon about 2 pm). Getting back into the USA on Sunday at noon was rough---a nearly two-hour wait at the border. It was a great trip\u00e2\u20ac\u201din great part because of a great hotel.

When we arrived all of us couldn't beleive how huge our room was. Just amazing! I think it was over 1,000 square feet. If you have a family, this is the place in Montreal for you to stretch out and not be stumbling over all the kids and their stuff. There's dining within a few paces as well as shopping and the Metro all within an easy walk. The value I thought was superb when you compare the cost to two regular rooms in this locale. We paid $249CN plus taxes (just under $200US) per night, saving us about $100US per night for two regular hotel rooms. You pay additional to park (most other hotels charge too).

We had a one bedroom suite, with a door to the bedroom One daughter slept on a pullout sofa in the living room, and the other slept on an aero bed which we travel with. This suite was indeed quite large, and the kitchen area was very handy for leftovers from meals. And the suite was sparkling clean, as others have written. The location was also excellent, with the following \"clarifications\" (but in no way intended as criticisms): first of all, while a great city to walk in large part, Montreal is still a large city, so a hotel in any area willl have its pluses and minuses (i.e. closer to some sites, further to others). The walk to the boarder of Old Montreal was about 15-20 minutes, and then it could take another several minutes to walk to certain sites there (i.e. Notre Dame, Old Port), but this was all very manageable. In Old Montreal, we particulalry enjoyed Museum of Arcehology, a very different and fascinating presentation, good for kids. The paid admission to Notre Dame ($4 adults, $2 kids) was worth it as the \"tour\" was interesting. You can also go during mass times for free (but no tour) and hear the organ. We are not Catholic but we found the tour interesting and the church beautiful. Jacques Cartier Place has enjoyable street performers and the old government buildings are impressive, especially at night. Having said all these postives, Old Montreal didn't quite take my breath away (but still a \"must go\"). Also, one way to get to Old Montreal is to walk through Chinatown, and do that, especially the pedestrian mall--very enjpyable and superb Chinese bakeries. Speaking of eating, there are several places to eat on the same block as the hotel-- a \"fast food\" Lebanese (Meditteranean) place which was very good (and inexpensive) and a bisro (Comptoir ??) which was excellent, and gave us the feel of Montreal-style eating. Locals go there and the price for dinner was a few dollars cheaper than in some pure tourist areas. More re. location--if you walk out of the hotel and make a right, you will quickly come to St. Catherine, a major street. If you turn right, you will be going in the direction of the Place D'Arts. However, we found that walk to the right to be somewhat unimpressive and and not particularly enjoyable. (But there is a dollar store right there if you need anything last minute, and a very extensive and reasonably priced \"souvenir\" store there too). But if you turn to your left, you can walk in a very enjoyable commercial/business/college (McGill) area with plenty of shops and eateries, and my wife and I did a lot of walking in that direction, including up the side streets. The vegetraian buffet place--Cassolet??--was excellent. There is also a neat bilingual bookstore (Indigo, with a cafe; superb cohoolate banana cake)) where we got a map, and we needed one. I am pretty good at acclimating to cities, but I found Montreal to be a little difficult to orient, perhaps because it is not a grid, streets are in French, etc. It took the length of our stay for me to get real good at it (so I'll be ready next time!). But the people are very nice with directions, and the cab drivers we also found to be very nice (when we had to take a cab). If driving from NY/Northway, stop at Quebec tourist center soon after the border to pick up their own guide books and maps) More on the hotel: the breakfast was very good, featuring real Montreal bagels (from Fairmount Bakery, which is a car ride away but we also went there to take some home, the bagels are very good, sweet). Also, the bread in Montreal is great, not only at the bakeries we found. The hotel buffet served store brought bread (cinnamon rasin, even white) which was better than the home made breads we have here in Albany (i.e. Panera's). I went to a supermarket to take several loaves home.The hotel has valet parking, but there is a public lot right next to it, for only $5/day on weekend, but $17/day or so on week days. And banks right across the street to exchange money and, when closed, places near by on Ste. Catherine St. In sum, we found this hotel to be truly excellent, the accommodations can't be beat for a family. P.S.: Enjoyed the Biodome, which you can reach by subway or cab; also, there are, regrettably, many homeless persons in all parts of Montreal so, if you wish, you can get change at the bank to use during your stay.", "Date": "June 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Potomac, MD", "Title": "\u201cA Terrific Family Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3517234", "Content": "My family spent a long weekend at Le Square Phillips Hotel.

The kitchen included a full-size fridge, stove, oven, microwave oven and dishwasher! A very nice living area lead to the bedroom which was separated by a frosted glass and wood wall. There are TV's in the living room and bedroom. The king-sized bed looked small in the bedroom! We estimate that the entire suite was likely close to 1000 sq. ft! The 12-13 foot ceilings and lots of windows made the place feel spacious. A continential breakfast was included and had great baked goods (try the bagels), coffee, fruit, cereal and very good juices (the grapefruit juice tasted fresh). The gym was a little small, but had an assortment of dumbells which ranged up to 60 lbs, which we found rare in most other hotels. The pool and patio area were nice too, though we didn't use them. The location can't be beat. Only steps away from the Bay department store, St. Catherine Street (the main street downtown) and the \"underground city\" (shopping galore). If you go down the street towards Rene Levesque Blvd and then turn left, there's an IGA grocery store about 4-5 blocks. The variety there is great and there are ready-to-heat meals which are quite good. Montreal in general is an awesome city -- so much variety and great deals (shopping is a must!), friendly people who switch easily between French and English, are helpful (people stopped to ask if we needed any directions or ideas on where to visit), and service in the hotel and stores care hard to beat. The residents are proud of their city and it's evident why. They're also however, generous in sharing their pride with visitors and helping one to really experience the city. As for food -- Try Reuben's for Montreal smoked meat. It's probably the best place around within walking distance. When you go west on St. Catherines, you'll see a Reuben's on the left side of the street -- it looks like it goes downstairs. That one is more of a deli by the looks of things. However, if you keep going for a couple more blocks, you'll see a Reuben's restaurant (there's smoked meat hanging in the window). Give it a try. Oh, and also St. Hubert chicken and ribs are always a treat. Wish we had the chain in BC. I'd highly recommend Montreal and the Square Phillips Hotel and Suites.

I had a one bedroomed suite which was enormous, both clean and nearly new it was almost too much space for one person. The gym & swimming pool were adequate if a little on the small side but the general level of service was very good. However, there were a couple of points which were not so good. The sound proofing between the rooms was very poor to the extent that I was repeatedly awoken by the next suite who kept rearranging their kitchen furniture on the stone tiles first thing in the morning. Imagine nails scraping on the blackboard and you get the picture. There was also a problem with the TV in the lounge not working which would normally not have been such a problem, except for the fact it was a Sunday when the maintenace man did not work either. I did ask reception what would happen if something serious went wrong on Sunday but alas recieved no reply. Also, there was no bar at the Hotel which I did not think I would miss, but I did. That last convivial drink with fellow guests can be a really nice way to end an evening and make new friends. Finally, the price I was quoted over the phone was not the price I was asked to pay upon leaving. The difference amounted to only $3.00 per night extra which in real terms is almost irrelavent when compared to the total bill for the stay, however, that is not how I do business and that is not the point.

I wasn't disappointed at all. It's everything that everyone has said that it is! Room quality - exceptional. Location - superb. Staff - very friendly. I will not hesitate to recommend this establishment to anyone, nor will I think twice before booking there again - soon! We stayed in a one bedroom, which in hindsight was probably too big for just two of us. I think next time we'll go with a simple studio, as it sounds as though the space there is more than ample. Needless to say, the one bedroom proved more than spacious. The location is second to none, in my opinion. It was a short walk to either the McGill or Square Victoria Metro stops. There was more shopping within a short walking distance of the hotel than one could imagine. And food - ah, yes, food. Of the nine days that I was in town, I had one bad meal, and that was at a \"tavern\" in Vieux-Montreal - I should have known better. Otherwise it was dining heaven. And there are incredible eating opportunities close to the hotel, including the great pizza restaurant between the hotel and Ste-Catherine.

It's located right in the heart of downtown, so many \"must see\" tourist things are right within walking distance. We had a two-bedroom suite and I can honestly say that it was bigger than my Brooklyn apartment, and my Brooklyn apartment is big compared to other NYC abodes. The bedrooms were large but there was only one bathroom, which made mornings a little bit slower than we would have liked. The kitchen was small but very usable with a four-burner electric stove with oven, a microwave, pots, pans and dishes, a small full size refrigerator, and the all-important dishwasher. The continental breakfast offered breads and bagels for toasting (Montreal bagels are not at all like NY bagels, but are really good in their own right), pastries and donuts, cereals, fresh fruit, juices, tea and coffee. Nothing fancy, but enough to get you going. The pool on the roof is very small and kids staying at the hotel dominated it the whole time we were there. But the outside deck around the pool was a lovely spot for evening coffee as the sun sets. The work out room is small but very functional with a bicycle, treadmill, elliptical, lat pull down that can be adjusted for other exercises, a rowing machine, free weights and an adjustable bench. The only complaint, and I hesitate to call it a complaint because it's so minor, is that there was only one trash can in the room, in the bathroom (if you don't count the teeny tiny trash bag in the kitchen, which can hold a tea bag and a paper cup and then it's full). For the money it was well worth it and I will most assuredly stay there again.

I had basically picked this hotel (with my fingers and toes crossed!) based on all the positive reviews I've read on tripadvisor. I really was a bit nervous about picking this hotel. First of all, I've never picked a hotel based only on on-line reviews especially one I've never heard of. Secondly, not one Montreal tour book I've looked at listed this hotel as a recommended one (actually, most of the books did not even have this hotel listed! - which normally is probably not a good thing). Anyways, once in a taxi in Montreal, I figured it was a good sign that when I gave the driver the hotel name he knew exactly which hotel I was referring to. The hotel is about 30 mins from the Trudeau Airport. The cab ride is a flat fee of CAD$31. You can charge it if you have not, at that point, exchanged for Canadian currency (although I will say I think the driver will be happier if you pay him in cash). When we pulled up to the hotel, I was definitely happy and relieved to see that the hotel looked very nice from out front. The lobby is not big like the Sheratons and Marriotts of the world, but it was very well kept. Check-in (and check-out) was taken care of efficiently. The front desk and concierge were very professional, friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We had booked a studio room with a king bed. I was amazed as to how big this room was! Do not let the term \"studio\" fool you. It's definitely not the usual size hotel room. For those of you who are familiar with studio apartments in New York City, this hotel room is bigger than some of those apartments. Everything looked brand new. I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel that looked this new and clean. The kitchen is stocked with dishes and utensils (including wine opener and can opener). There is a full size refrigerator which came in very handy for keeping cold drinks and leftovers. There is a full size stove with oven, dishwasher, toaster, microwave oven and coffee maker. The bathroom is very roomy and has very bright lights. The reason I specifically mentioned the bright lights is because the rest of the room is not very brightly lit. It has very modern lighting fixtures which is more for looks than practicality (which unfortunatley, I think is the trend for the 'boutique' hotels). I found that with the desk lamp and the two night table lamps on it wasn't too horrible. There is a tv, but unless you understand French, you won't get much use out of it. There are a couple of stations that have English speaking programs, but most are in French. Although, my husband thought it was entertaining to watch Bart Simpson (The Simpsons) speak French. The bed was very comfortable (nice and firm). I have to, have to agree with the other reviewers that the pillows are way too hard!! It was just better for me to not use it at all. The hotel offers free high speed internet access. If you forget to bring your network cable, you can pick one up right downstairs(the one we got was about CAD$8). There is a computer store adjacent to the hotel. Adajcent to the other side of the hotel is a little deli / grocery store where you can pickup drinks and assortment of munchies. The locale of the hotel is great. On the same block of the hotel is a coffee house (similiar to Starbucks), a pizza place -- not your usual pizza place -- they offer over 40 varieties, and a couple of other restaurants / bistros. The Metro is about two short blocks away. It's a very user-friendly subway system. Fares are CAD$2.50 one way, but you can also get daily passes or multiple days passes for discounted rates. We took the Metro to see an Expos game and to the Biodome. Old Montreal is about a 15 -20 minutes walk from the hotel. We took a taxi to the Casino which was about a 15 - 20 minutes drive. The cab fare was about CAD$12 each way. Rue St Catherine (where all the shops are) is about a block away. Unless you plan to go outside of Montreal you really don't need a car and note that the hotel charges CAD$16 per day for parking (valet). In our wandering, we had walked by some of the big name hotels (Marriott, Sheraton, Fairmont) and they don't seem to be as conveniently located. Another thing I found useful is that there is a phone in the lobby that is a direct line to the taxi company. We called and they were in front of the hotel in about 2 minutes!! I can probably go on a bit more about this hotel / trip, but this review may be too much already.
