The hotel reception is basic and is situated on the corner of a damp alley. Be warned when walking along there at night, very dangerous. I recommend not to travel alone as we had men block our path whilst walking and also offering us marujiarna and other delights. Our room was on the second floor with a very small lift and stair case to access it. Key cards were given but on one occasion the door did not lock and we had been out all day, luckily all of our valuable possesions were hidden. Our 'balcony' (a rail across a window) door would not lock and was missing a handle. The room was small which included four single beds and a bathroom. The shower was more like a dribble which made hair washing impossible! There were only two plug sockets available and being four women, we took hair straightners, dryers and phone/camera chargers which was not easy to use due to lack of an electricity supply. The bed sheets were not changed at all and the beds were made up once during our stay. There were what looked like blood stains on the sheets and pubic hair, luckily there were several towels in the bathroom shoved in the bday which we used to cover the sheets. Lastly, the worst aspect about the hotel is the very poor breakfast. There was no selection each day, just the same food each morning. There were crossaints, bread rolls and cornflakes which had to be served in a tea cup as there were no bowls. The orange juice was horrible and the yoghurt looked and smelt as if it was gone off and kept out of refrigeration. We ended up not even having breakfast there for the remainding two days and went to a lovely cafe down the road, certainly a relief from the hotel food. The staff are unfriendly and are impolite. We really recommened not staying here as it is situated in a dangerous area and is a very very poor hotel. Choose one of the higher rated and better star ones in a better area.

We chose the hotel because it offered cheap accommodation, but we should have realised it was cheap for a reason. The rooms were basic - ours had two single beds which were okay; the floor was not carpetted and the ceiling was high. There was a wardrobe which was adequate (although it had a pair of someone else's underpants on top!), and the bathroom/toilet was okay - apart from the ventilator which had months of accumulated dust attached to it. There was a small wall-mounted colour TV, but the sound had been tampered with so you could hardly hear what was being said. The view from the sliding door was onto a wall. There was a smallish desk, two chairs and a bedside cabinet between the two beds. It was basic but okay. The breakfast was included, but it wasn't worth going down for. The croissants available were not tasty at all and the coffee was awful. Rolls were available, but there was only jam and butter to put on them - no cheese or meat. The problem was the amount of noise from other hotel guests. The doors are heavy and have a heavy lock - there is simply no quiet way to lock and unlock the door. There were about 15 rooms on our corridor and the noise echoed up and down. On the first night (22nd September) our neighbours were a group of German teenagers who decided to party until about 2am. They shouted, laughed, dropped bottles onto the floor, and generally made the first night hell. In and out of each others' rooms, doors banging, more shouting and laughing. I had taken ear plugs but they were not enough. The noise became so bad that I had to walk down to the reception and ask the receptionist to do something about the noise - we simply couldn't sleep. To his credit, the receptionist said he was aware of the problem from the previous night, and within minutes he came and told them to keep quiet. And they kept quiet until about 5am when they all left, slamming the doors behind them, talking, laughing and shouting. Please be aware - ear plugs are not adequate. People visiting the hotel are well advised to take a small personal radio and headphones to drown out the noise - at least white noise would have been preferable to guests' noise. The hotel is about 1 minute's walk from the bottom of the Ramblas and 1 minute's walk from the Plaza Real. The location was superb. The hotel provides safety deposit boxes. It cost \u20ac2 per day. We paid \u20ac20 up front, and we were given \u20ac12 when we handed back the key. I would definitely recommend that guests should hire a safety deposit box. The reception area had information leaflets on stuff to do, and there was a tea/coffee vending machine available too. (No tea/coffee facilities in the bedrooms.) Would we stay there again? We would prefer not to, mainly because of the noise made by inconsiderate guests and also because we had paid for a breakfast that we certainly didn't enjoy.

It's a semi-continental self-service breakfast: coffee (instant, I believe), tea, orange juice (nope, not fresh), cerials, croissants, breadrolls, butter, jams and (fruit) yoghurt. That's an improvement compared to the situation in 2000 (when a bossy, only Spanish speaking, woman 'asked' \"\u00a1CAF\u00c9!\"). ROOMS: TINY, but you have your own bathroom and it usually includes a shower within a (small) bath. The balconees are so-called 'French balconees', meaning that nothing more than the two front legs of a chair fit on it. The room had an air-regulator (or something like that), but it did not work. For fresh air, the balconee-doors should be left open. With the noise (the hotel is situated between the Ramblas and Pla\u00e7a Reial) this is not an option at night unless you have ear-plugs... So yes, the NOISE: Isolation is what this hotel lacks of. And especially when students-on-a-school-excursion are staying in the hotel (as in our case). The doors have such heavy locks, that trying to gently lock your room is a 'mission impossible'. Rather unfortunate when arriving in the hotel after a nice night out (as did the students). We could - sometimes literally - hear people talk in the room next to ours. It's really difficult to walk in the corridors without making noise, especially when wearing high heels. Nothing I, nor the students could do anything about, but it's noisy... Since it's a one star hotel, the price is nice. This of course is also attractive for (high) schools that plan school excursions.

The room was very basic, but en-suite. It was very hot in the room, but it was clean.The breakfast was not worth waking up for; croissants, bread rolls, coffee and milk.....so we didn't bother, especially when you can get a nice cooked breakfast on La Rambla which is a 30 second walk away.I would reccommend this hotel if you want somewhere with a great location and are not too fussy about mod cons in your hotel!", "Date": "November 28, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Comercio Barcelona", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d283455-Reviews-Hotel_Comercio_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$104 - $127*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Escudellers, 15</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">C/ Nueva de Zurbano 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "283455", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/67/4a/674a4f843cfd382926b598652fc7b6bf6large.jpg"}}
