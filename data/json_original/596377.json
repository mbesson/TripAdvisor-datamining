When using Google maps to get to this location from New York State, it directs you to an adjacent hotel. Don't worry-- you'll see LSL once you're on Rue Labelle. LSL is conveniently located right near the Berri-UQAM stop on the metro, which made it easy to get all over Montreal. We liked the location because it was in a fun neighborhood-- it's in the Latin Quarter, adjacent to the Gay Village, a short walk to China Town and a longer (though very manageable, in our opinion) walk to Old Montreal. The rooms themselves were great-- clean, fresh and had a kitchenette. The shower head was actually taller than me (rare) and the bed was really comfortable. Our stay included breakfast, which was great and offered a solid variety of meal options (we're vegan and vegetarian and even we found something to eat!). The only downsides were that my coat fell on the floor and the heater tore/burned several holes in it (a flukey thing but something to watch out for-- I wouldn't be concerned about the safety of the heater, though, because my coat ended up under the the bottom part of the heater... just don't let that happen) and the woman at the front desk was not very friendly.

While it's not a luxury hotel in the heart of Vieux Montreal, if you're looking to spend about $115/night, I can't see doing better than this. The location is super-convenient - after we parked*, we didn't move the car until we left, and were able to walk or take the metro everywhere. The station is under a block from the hotel and is a major hub connecting 3 subway lines. While Labelle street itself is rather run-down, it's certainly safe, well-lit, and quiet. It was less than 10 minutes' walk to the old port. (*Yes, as other reviewers have noted, the parking garage is a tight squeeze, but if you don't have a giant SUV and are used to parking in old cities not designed for lots of cars, it's not that bad.) The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. They made solid recommendations and sent us to a great little jazz club on Saint Denis. The breakfast is huge - one of the few times I'm glad the rest of the world thinks Americans are fatsos who can't get enough potatoes. The room was definitely on the large size - I've lived in smaller apartments. It was really clean. The windows actually opened!! And there was a heart-shaped jacuzzi for two!

The rooms are okay, and certainly not luxurious in any way. They have a nice enough bathroom, a small television and coffee making facilities, and a kitchenette with sink etc (there was a warning on the kitchenette that there would be a fine of $25 if any unwashed dishes were left in room after checking out). The customer service was virtually non-existent, and the reception staff were generally unfriendly and made no attempt to show any interest in their customers. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel entrance is on a rather dodgy sidestreet, although there is not really much the hotel could do about this. It is more of a quiet road linking two main streets and it never really made my partner or I feel unsafe, but I can imagine solo females may feel nervous about walking along it, but the area seemed pretty safe. It is around a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel to Old Montreal and Chinatown, while the area the hotel is in is next to the University of Quebec/Montreal. St Catherines Street is a 30 second walk from the hotel and has a large number of shops, restaurants, bars etc. The Berri-UQAM metro station is also around a minute walk from the hotel, as is the bus station where the Airport 747 Express bus arrives/departs. Breakfast was included in the room price which we paid, and this was a standard hot buffet (sausage, eggs, beans, toast, cereal etc). My favourite bit of the hotel was the roof patio, a small area on the 9th floor where there were tables to sit out at, and good views of the city. This was good to sit with a drink at night before or after going out for a meal. There is also a small gym on the 9th floor but it was very dingy and the equipment looked cheap and tired. I would recommend this hotel if you are visiting Montreal on a tight budget, or are going to be spending very little time in the hotel.

The free wireless internet was also a plus. There were, however, two downfalls. First, the poor quality of the television reception and the television itself. But we were there to see the city and attend a concert, not watch TV so we weren't too disappointed. The other downfall is the parking; the underground lot has a very steep and narrow ramp making it quite worrisome if one were to meet another car exiting while you are entering or vice versa.

Negatives -Although the neighbourhood is good the street is run-down and pretty deserted with boarded up shops. Like a scene form a movie, actually. However, I never felt threatened and even my sister with the baby didn't feel suspicious. There were other families staying there walking around and we didn't hear of any situations.

The hotel was a real challenge trying to find the street it was located on. The street itself, right away sent off bad vibes as there was a lot of closed up shops and run down fixtures (not a place to be walking around in the middle of the night!). The underground parking was full when we arrived so my car had to sit in a small 6 spot lot that was outside next to the building. It's a good thing I have a small car and I am good at driving in reverse, as well as parallel parking or I would have been out of luck getting in that lot. The room my wife and I got was on the third floor. This hotel has two elevators, one is VERY large and the other is VERY small. So if you happen to have a cart full of luggage you are out of luck if you get the small elevator! Our first impression of the room was most definitely NOT what we saw on its website. The rooms are very dark and 'sad', and the walls kind of lead you to believe you are in a basement. After being in the room for a few minutes, you could sense a lingering scent...perhaps mold?...though I certainly hope it wasn't that. We had to go and get our room switched but they wanted to charge us extra for a 'better' room. We told them we would be leaving the next morning instead of staying all 3 nights to go to a different hotel. The staff then offered us the 'better' room at no extra charge in desperation to keep us there for the full 3 nights. The 'better' room seemed to have newer furniture but thats about it... and they tell you the beds are queen, but they are clearly double beds. The wireless internet is only available in half the building, but there is wired everywhere else (bring your own internet cable!). Though our new room was a little nicer than the last, the view out the window made up for it...run down alley way with small private parking for the backing lots as well as a mess of construction in the property next door. The rooms are not that quiet... I instinctively whispered while we were there because we could hear noises in the next room, people in the hallway opening and slamming doors, and of course, the construction happening outside. I didn't really get a good night's sleep as I woke up to a stuffed up nose and sneezing in the morning. This hotel is advertised as a NON-Smoking hotel and there are also signs in the building that say 'no smoking' but the hallway on our floor had a very strong smell of cigarette smoke which sent me into a sneezing fit on the elevator and gave my wife a headache. The breakfast was...OK... nothing too special, but it did have a free hot buffet. The eggs... i don't know if they were half cooked or what, but they certainly weren't your traditional scrambled eggs... The bakery selection they had looked good but a lot of it was dried out. The only fruits I saw offered was fruit salad which had that familiar taste that it came out of a can. No bacon though... I don't know any other hotel that doesn't serve bacon with the eggs at a buffet! Don't book the 2.5 star hotel through Hotwire in downtown Montreal or you might make the same mistake we did!

I rwill never underestimate free breakfast again. It saves not only money but site seeing time as well. I wouldn't understand this until we drove up to Quebec City and spent 30 dollars and an hour of time on breakfast every day. The alley is alittle sketchy however there are lighted parking lots that stradle either side of the hotel. We would cut across those instead of walking down the alley at night. I used the metro station which was at the end of the street with no problems. Supoer convienent. Overall this is a hip area with a mostly young crowd.

Wireless internet is not available outside the ground floor, however, if you ask the front desk for a cable, you can have a wired high-speed internet connection in your room. TV reception was a little fuzzy, but we didn't watch much. Staff is very friendly and helpful. It seemed that someone was always at the front desk. Parking is underground, unless you have an SUV like we did. You will then be asked to park outside the hotel in a lot for C$15/day. Our car was fine for the length of the trip. We also had breakfast free as part of our stay. It's actually a decent selection. Just don't expect gourmet chefs whipping you up omelettes. So the surroundings seem to be the thing that this place has going against it. The street doesn't look great, and there's a construction spot down the road. It's also a one-way street, and the only way to access the hotel is by making a right from Rue St Catherine or cutting across a parking lot. But if you're willing to look past this first impression, you'll find that Les Suites Labelle is in a great spot for a walking tourist. You're less than 5 minutes away from a big metro station (Berri/UQAM). You're even about a 20 minute walk from the Promenade and Vieux Montreal. Also, you're very close to a number of the most interesting streets downtown if you want to look around. Don't hesitate to walk or use the Metro -- it feels like the best way to get around.

I asked for an additional cot, but was told that our room was considered too small for it, so we were upgraded to a superior room. This room was huge, and the cot fit in easily.

Because of the temperatures, we spent more time in the room than we might have otherwise, preparing three meals there, and it was quite comfortable for the four of us.
