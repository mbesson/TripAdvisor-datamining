It is directly above a premises offering live gang bang sex shows. It is surrounded by other similar premises and sex shops. It looks more like the sort of place that charges by the hour. The curtains were falling off, some of the lights didn't work and the carpets were covered in suspicious stains. The photos on their website look like they are from another hotel. We arrived late at night and had to stay but we left the following morning dispite having paid for 4 nights. The staff were rude and unhelpful. My wife was so upset when we arrived that she was in tears and just wanted to return to the airport. There was loads of dodgy people walking on the streets and we didn't feel safe. The staff refused to refund us however the company we booked through have kindly offered us vouchers. There are proper hotels for the same price in a better location. I just wish I'd taken more pictures. You couldn't pay me to stay here. Stay well clear.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel in a good area\u201d", "Author": "missteeLondon", "ReviewID": "UR71063436", "Content": "I ignored the fact that this hotel is above a peep show and am glad that i did. The value can not be beaten. Close to a main train station and just 2 blocks away are Luis Vuitton, Burberry, Starbucks, etc. We stayed over a weekend and never heard a peep from downstairs, although we were on the 5th floor. It was min of 25C at night and there was no aircon, that was definitely a minus, but a fan was in the room. The internet did not work in the room as it should have but it might have worked on other floors. The room was abit dated, but then the price is right. Plenty of room in the bathroom for stuff, we normally stay at Hotel Ibis and there are no cupboards in their rooms. Great service, young girl on reception when we came in and was there when we checked out, very friendly and told us reception was 24 hours.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiesbaden", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "imf8819", "ReviewID": "UR27867561", "Content": "NOT a good place for a family to stay. The hotel description is extremely deceptive. It is located above an erotic store and across the street from two other. They don\u2019t take credit cards, cash only. I wanted to ask if they also charged by the hour I think it would have been more appropriate. The weather was warm so we had to leave the window open. The noise outside from about 2200-0400 was absolutely deplorable. The two loud explosions from either firework (I hope) or something was the icing on the cake for not getting a good night sleep. The rooms were spacious but the beds are long past their date of replacement as is the decor. Only thing missing was the 4\u201d shag carpet. The plumbing rattles and shows of cheap budget repairs. The walk up the stairs to seventh floor to the reception area was quite an experience. When the lift works, it is so slow that you are not sure if it works or not. I think it holds three people. Yes the shopping district is literally two blocks away, but I would not venture there after dark for fear of whom or what I would run into on the return trip to the hotel. Once there the area changes drastically. The access to the train is two hundred meters but I would not venture there with my family. The owner/ manager of the facility were not willing to release use from the reservation after I expressed that I would not be staying after the first night. As a matter of fact he and another lady never even welcomed me to the hotel as I came into the office area/ dining room. The receptionist is the only shinning light about the hotel. We left and paid twice the price not at another location not to have to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amherst, MA", "Title": "\u201cNo frills stay; be forewarned\u201d", "Author": "cybergrrl6", "ReviewID": "UR21141381", "Content": "My older father and girlfriend stayed here while I stayed with family friends. The location is great, just a few steps off of the Ku'damm, but it is pretty basic and the staff did not go out of its way to please us. For example, the room had 2 beds: a double and a single. After traveling all night and half the day, I wanted to take a quick nap in the room with them before heading off to a friend's house. The staff would not give them either an extra pillow or extra blanket (thinking, wrongly, that I was going to stay the night). They only take cash on check in - be aware! If you book for 5 nights, as my dad did, you have to pay it all up front. If you decide you want to leave earlier, they will not give you your money back. It's a pretty bare bones place, but the location was good. It would be a whole lot nicer if the owners were kinder.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cGood location but some problems\u201d", "Author": "butega", "ReviewID": "UR5962065", "Content": "We stayed at Amadeus 4 nights. It is central located, in a small street near the famous Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. The hotel is situated in a building of the 60s, the reception is on the 4th floor. Our appartment was in the 3rd floor. It had a little kitchen with refrigerator but without cutlery, plates, cooker...there was only the refrigerator! After our protests, a man at the reception gave us 2 plates, an electric cooker and some forks. The room was pretty good, there was radio, tv and a little little bath with bathtub. The breakfast at the reception was good: tea, coffee, juices, eggs.... Problems came paying: I had read before booking that it was possible to pay by credit card, and we had not much cash, because our trip was very long and we needed cash for the rest of the trip. At the reception were a russian couple: the woman said, they do not accept credit cards, because the credit card machine was broken (typical!)... I explained my situation and I said I would pay more if they had accepted my card...they added about 20 \u20ac for this \"exceptional service\"... But the credit card machine really won't accept my card (the woman inserted the card in the wrong direction!!), after many time, I had no other possibility than paying cash. This caused more difficulties to us for the rest of the trip. We stayed good there, but these difficulties with the acceptance of credit cards were very disagreeable.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern ireland", "Title": "\u201cSecond Impressions Count\u201d", "Author": "jamesandjane", "ReviewID": "UR5795580", "Content": "On arriving at the Hotel Amadeus we were a bit shocked as it was a small door leading to what looked like a block of flats rather than a hotel, and situated above an erotic store! However, the hotel reception was on the top floor (accessed by a lift) and the staff were friendly and helpful. One thing though, on our arrival we were asked to pay cash even though we had not been told to do so when booking. We insisted that we could not pay cash and so they had to accept a credit card payment for which there was no problem. The room itself was quite spacious and had everything we needed. The decor was worth a visit alone - it seemed to continue the theme of the store downstairs - all red velour and orange lighting! However it was very comfortable, new and clean. The bathroom had a good powerful shower in it and our room had a double and a single bed along with a fridge and tv. The room was only serviced once during our 5 night stay but I'm sure if requested they would do it more often. Our stay included breakfast which was a self-service style of cereal, boiled eggs, cold meat, cheeses, toast and bread rolls along with juices , teas and coffees. It provided us with a good start to the day, eating as much as we wanted, and all in a friendly , fresh and clean atmosphere. The hotel's location is in Adenauerplatz on the Kudamm with bus stop and underground both within a minute's walk. There are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby, but if you're planning to walk bring comfortable shoes! We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful (and multi-lingual), the room comfortable, and the location convenient. We felt we got value for money and enjoyed the character of this hotel over other bland chain hotels who offer little more for a higher price. Overall we'd reccommend Hotel Amadeus for a short but entertaining stay.", "Date": "September 13, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Amadeus am Kurfuerstendamm", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d623242-Reviews-Amadeus_am_Kurfuerstendamm-Berlin.html", "Price": "$55 - $130*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Sybel Strasse 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10629</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "623242", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2d/b5/aa/vierbettzimmer.jpg"}}
