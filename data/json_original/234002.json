{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Ramada Hotel Great One night stay at Ramada Hotel. At first not too happy due to reviews read. However, we arrived at the hotel before 8am. Not only did they check us in, but also upgraded us to a business room. What was great about the room is kettle, etc. Receptionist assisted with available tours. Hotel 3 blocks away from main entrance of main train station. Short walk and easy to find. Some reviewers complained about red light area....the only red light I saw was the traffic light!Buffet breakfast good.The only frustration was that all the channels on TV was German.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR524557523", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Terblaam"}, {"Content": "Nice and clean The hotel is quite conveniently located in the town center and has clean, modern and spacious rooms.

I made my complaints known but it was only when i highlighted that a staff member had lied about the other hotels rating, that the laptop was stolen from the comfort hotel so they had no internet access and that i had taken photos to post on this site that they gave an upgrade.This room was small but done to a high standard. We had no problems after this but as hotel star ratings are self classified, 1-2 star hotels advertise as 4 star. i am not generally fussy but the room in the comfort hotel was the worst i have seen and it is disgraceful that the ramada attempt to send customers there. since the superior room in the ramada is small, the standard must also be tiny.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR404863865", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pollyIreland"}, {"Content": "Nice cosy hotel Stayed here for 2 nights during the Christmas markets.

The room I was shown to first, was most unwelcoming, next to shabby and smelling badly. The receptionist eventually helped me into a business room against paying the upgrade. This was a smallish room with no hallway (on entering you stood right in front of the twin bed), a small closet, a small desk, a flat screen tv, one telephone (with fax) at the desk. It showed toward the street and had no direct sunshine. The view was interesting but given the still red-light-attached neighbourhood it was noisy at times at night. No cars, but noisy pedestrians.The bathroom had a window, which was a plus. But there was no bath tub, only a shower. The mini-bar was half empty on arrival. No amenities like bathrobe, slippers, sewing kit or shoe polish were in visible sight.Breakfast in the mornings was basic and service was next to indifferent. On Sunday morning tooth picks were left from the evening before on the bench, a stain from cigarettes (?) on one table cloth and the man who fries eggs for breakfast had not arrived until 8.30 (breakfast started at 7.00 on Sundays).The receptionists were kind but did not seem to be very knowledgeable.So, no convincing impressions regarding the basic room, quality of breakfast and service will let me choose another hotel in Frankfurt/Main for my next stay.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR106877905", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Zurich"}, {"Content": "Seen better jails While the staff was very friendly, the room itself was the worst I'd ever stayed in.
