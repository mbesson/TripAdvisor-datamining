The room itself was lacking: no coffeemaker (at these rates we should get a free Mr. Coffee every day!), 3 hangers and a wacky key system by which if you want to access the fridge, you need to turn off all the electricity in the room. The sole tiny table was stacked high with design magazines, as if to convince the guest of how trendy the place is.

Check-out took way too long (because housekeeping had to inventory the 100 or so mini-bar items.) I could live with all this, but the noise was inexcuseable. Ever sleep in a disco? Several nights a week (including weeknights), a discoteca inside the hotel blasted \"trance\" music from about 10 pm to well past 1:00 a.m. The hotel erected \"sound barriers\" to protect suffering guests, but they're paper-thin jokes. When the party broke up, drunken crowds lingered outside, yelling, fighting, revving motorcycles. To compound this insanity, every morning at 5:30 a.m., two guys set up an official looking table on the street just below our window and proceeded to laugh, scream and blast a radio until sunrise.

The breakfast, not included in the 300 dollars bill per night (!!!), has good items but not as various as you could expect.

Now, you can read from our previous travels that we have travelled a lot, bot in crappy places and in luxury hotels, and we know what we talk about: this is the worst luxury hotel we've been to. We are ok in straw huts if we have to, travelling in faraway places, but if we spend high rates for high quality service, we want to deal with professionals. The hotel doesn't even provide the guests with complimetary water, in a town where the tap water is not edible. We have never had a single word of excuse for the problems with the bed, and the bill -at the end - was wrong, charging us something like 100 dollars more (we had to quarrel and then they set it up).

The top terrace is a great place to lounge around or have a drink, it has very good service and nice, albeit simple cocktails. The bar is not yet top standard, it lacks many premium products that are staple in other important bars but this is not a biggie. My only big gripe was how mediocre the mexican food is at this hotel, its almost as if we weren't in Mexico. Given how good street food is in this city it is appalling to find a hotel that has such poor cuisine. The sushi at the terrace is good though. Another gripe is the extortionate prices the hotel charges for using their taxi company, they take advantage of the fact Mexico is not a very safe place by charging absurd premiums for safety.

We planned on using the hotel as a base, for the nights between cities when we needed to fly back to town for connecting flights, however our experience with this design hotel was a mixed one, so we never made it back. The Good: - Great looking hotel. - The area is fab. We ate the best tacos ever a few blocks away, it's leafy, green, super pleasant, very safe and easy to walk around. In fact it felt like East Berlin! - There is an awesome in-room safe which provided my husband lots of enjoyment- it's credit card activated! - The rooftop bar was great, we sank many a cerveza up here (until they ran out!? I guess it's a cocktail crowd) - Bed was beyond comfortable!! I had an amazing sleep. - Free wi fi- A delight after being disconnected for the previous week. - A week or so later we stayed at another hotel in this design chain, called La Putrification in Puebla- which was fab! (and i think in an ex canning factory- great location) The not-so great: - Whilst the room was lovely, probably overpriced for the suite we received (we expected a terrace or some kind of balcony), but our perspective was- whatever- It's our honeymoon! - After a night at the bar, we arrived back to our room to find a cleaner mopping up what smelt like fishy water (!!???) from our entrance corridor and inside our room!!! - We ordered breakfast delivered to our room for 6AM- it was over 30 minutes late (even after calling to check) and as a result we were late leaving for our flight. (having said that, it was delicious, expensive, but delicious- in particular the granola and the fresh juice) - Staff were aloof and unhelpful (an overriding sense of coolness pervuades!). There wasn't a particularly inviting vibe. - You probably wouldn't be using the rooftop jacuzzi - I wouldn't, anyways. It's smack bang in the bar area oddly placed between the two toilets... Perhaps during the day? - THEIR DRIVER RIPPED US OFF! On checkout we were billed for the fare back to the airport with a driver they'd booked, who was chatty and nice etc, but then when we arrived there was a moment of awkwardness as we grabbed our bags- he asked for the full amount - again! Rushing and confused, we PAID HIM - twice!!! Yes, our fault, but the expectations for such a fancy hotel are MUCH HIGHER than that, especially considering this is the clearly the normal procedure. Another issue we had (and ultimately our decision to switch to the W when we next went back to Mex City) is having booked a second night there via a booking agency, Agoda. Two hours after I made the booking, plans changed and I called the hotel direct to cancel. They said notify Agoda, which I did immediately - who claimed to not have received the email until a couple of days later. Of course this is not the hotels' fault per se, however Condesa DF charged me the full amount! I can't believe they wouldn't even make a note on our reservation that we were planning to change our dates.

We also loved the contemporary design of the hotel nestled into a charming old colonial shell. Although we encountered noise one evening from the popular nightlife scene there, the dreamy beds and bedding made for a good night sleep. The food we found to be delicious and the staff very sweet if occasionally 'confused' as one reviewer noted. This reminded me of a funny story of when I was in Italy and trying to change a train reservation...I was directed to an automated phone line for TrenItalia....\"but, but but\", I complained...\"It's in ITALIAN\". The person helping looked at me and said drolly...\"Yes, Madam, you are in Italy.\" It is a good reminder that English is NOT the first language in EVERY country and we found the staff to be sweet and very kind - so who cares about a little confusion. Although the hotel is obviously a popular hangout for chic Mexicans we found it to have a very friendly, 'family' feel to it - perhaps you get back how you treat people.

Condesa DF could so easily be what it claims to be with some basic (air conditioning that works in high summer...locks on doors that open...) maintenance, and then a major overhaul of the beautifully designed public spaces...the famous atrium shutters no longer close as they were designed to; some standing gaping open all night; visually discordant with the white shield theyre intended to throw up protecting rooms from the cacophony of the restaurant below); the recessed lights which once lit from below these sliding tracks and accented the atrium at night , long since smashed and non-functional. The cow hide on all upholstery gone WAY past shabby chic and now well settled into plain old shabby..... the list does tend to go on and on and this is only trip advisor.... so lets leave that as a hint of what lies on the surface... but looking beneath, what passes for 'service' is in even more dire need of a makeover: management could bear to remember there are guests downstairs from the never ending photo shoots of telenovella stars on the roof terrace which seem to interest them above all else. The front of house management and most staff barely contribute to any recognisable hospitality experience.....the exception being one extraordinarily kind & helpful bellboy who understood that waiting for 5 hours for our room (on my birthday....which was part of the point of booking a Condesa terrace suite for 3 days ... ) was neither cool nor anything close to the tradition of sincere and gracious mexican hospitality and he tried to help and (yikes!) apologise which assuaged the pain of what otherwise was a kafka-esque experience rolled out hour after hour with equal measures of disinterest and arrogance....finally getting access to our room at 6.00pm.....no offer of drinks on the roof terrace, nor a snack or lunch as the hours dragged on, as it became clear our long-booked suite's terrace was being re-surfaced by a team of sanders and varnishers.... nothing was offered to compensate..just mystified looks & sighs that we wouldn't accept their 'upgrade' to a dark gloomy 'suite' on the first floor with a.view of the valet parking. my simple question; \"why undertake fundamental maintenance like this when you have standing reservations in these very specific suites?\" was met with blank faces... even a modicum of shame or dismay would have helped.....but no. Condesa DF is a conumdrum; in principal she remains a delicate and in many ways beautifully judged destination; the magic of waking up in the middle of mexico city to a glass wall filled with only sky and jacaranda treetops is sublime... but those special gifts you have to find yourself, with only the vestigial assistance of the hotels original designer, and the sky and those trees... . so go there and treat it like an exceedingly pretty bijou vacation rental which has seen better days, with little expectation of hotel service and maybe then you'll enjoy... ?

It is a very young-feeling hotel, hip to the nines. There is nothing youth hostel-y about it, but it is a boutique hotel, very designy and cute and compact.

That said the noise levels were not as bad as I expected. The rooms are nice but a bit dark--with little overhead lighting. The toiletries are great and the shower was fantastic. The food is fantastic! I would heartily recommend eating dinner one night there (the black cod is outstanding) and fill up on the granola for breakfast (i wish i had that recipe--it is fantastic). The service is wonderful...everyone was just lovely and very eager to help. All in all, I am not sure if I would stay here again (because of the a/c problems, lighting) but I would recommend it since everyone seems to be talking /writing about it.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perpetually planning our next adventure", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, disappointing hotel\u201d", "Author": "PeckCheck", "ReviewID": "UR12276789", "Content": "Perhaps I'm being a little harsh, but when I pay $299 (US$) for a room, I do expect some basics, like the air-conditioning to be working.

With a king size bed, two end tables and a tiny bathroom, there isn't much room to move around let alone store your luggage, but overall, we found the room rather charming. The terrace is absolutely huge (almost the same size as the room itself) and there was a nice view of the street. It's true that there is no furniture, but sitting on the steps in the terrace is quite pleasant. The problem was that the A/C did not work. We called the front desk who first brought us up a portable fan, and when that didn't really cool the room down, we called again and the maintenance guy told us that the A/C was down in the entire building until the first week of Jan 2008. We actually left the hotel to go to a different one because of this reason. Pros: GREAT cool neighborhood, safe, easy walking distance to sitio and metro, nice building, happening bar scene.

But in the design balance between aesthetic and function, they completely skipped over the function part. This is an absolutely excellent place to eat with lots of friends or to party, but as a hotel it falls way short. We paid for one of their best classes of rooms (terrace suite). Room 03.08 is very small. The walls are very poorly constructed. At midnight we could hear the parties upstairs and downstairs as if they were right in front of us, including loud screaming and cheering. Again, great place to party, but not to sleep. They moved us to 03.04 the next day and it was quieter, but I think that's because the parties were less intense for the next couple nights. In both rooms, if there are normal level conversations anywhere in your hallway, you can clearly hear it. The terrace in both of our \"Terrace Suites\" had no table or chairs, not even something plastic. So the functionality is very limited. We probably would have sat out there if there were some chairs. The terrace for room 03.08 had a view of a big wall more or less. 03.04 was better with some trees and a wider street. When hotel employees rang the buzzer on rooms down the hall from us, we could hear it so loudly in our room that we assumed they were ringing us. We opened the door about 8 times over 3 days with nobody there. When taking a bath, the shower continuously dripped water in both rooms. The shower heads are set up directly above you in the middle of the tub, so the dripping is more annoying than it would be with a typical shower setup. That said, the bathrooms are pretty well designed with a spa-type feeling. The Malin & Goetz bath products were a nice touch, but rather than replacing the small bottles with full ones, the housekeeper continuously left them nearly empty. The elevator is tiny and can't fit more than 2 people with small luggage. Up to 4 could maybe squeeze in, but that's only if you can actually get the elevator. The employees use the tiny elevator to shuffle drinks and supplies from the club and restaurant up and down through the hotel, so the elevator is almost impossible to use. On the ground floor, there's a display showing you what floor the elevator is on, so you can see when the employees are holding the door open and you know to take the stairs. But the other floors don't have such a display, so after a while you just stop taking the elevator all together, rather than wait around for it to maybe arrive eventually. The top floor is an open-air club/lounge, which again, looks like a great place to hang out. I went up there in the morning and it was closed. It would be the perfect place to have a light breakfast or at least some coffee and juice in the morning while you looked out onto Mexico City. But the hotel is not really a hotel, it's a club. So rather than offer this nice service to the guests in the morning, they keep the top floor closed during the day and use it only for the club at night. They should open up this area for coffee and juice in the mornings. Overall, this is a nice place and in terms of the aesthetic, it looks really great and feels like a cool place to be. But there's not enough focus on the functional side of the hotel. If you're looking for a cool place to eat or party in Mexico City, this is a very good choice. But I'm not sure the hotel is worth it. There are only 2 or 3 design hotels in this class in Mexico City and all the articles discuss them all. I would try one of the other ones next time. Here are a couple Mexico City restaurant suggestions: We live in NYC and have plenty of fancy international food, so when in Mexico City we were more interested in authentic Mexican food. This little corner taco stand/lunch counter was absolutely excellent: El Farolito (19 Altata). They cook your food to order right in front of you and the place is filled with locals eating real Mexican food. You can eat until you're going to explode for about $10 each, including beer. You'll need to know a little bit of Spanish to get by, but they'll help you out if you at least try. For a little more upscale, but still completely traditional Mexican cuisine, try La Fonda el Refugio (Calle Liverpool 166). Don't expect fancy clean lines and contemporary design aesthetics. Just really great traditional Mexican cuisine with great service. After our meal they gave us a bowl of fresh fruit and sugar cane and proceeded to peel it all for us at the table while they explained what each exotic item was. They speak English and have a very detailed English menu.

In fact instead of holing up in your room you should join the fun at the various bars in this cool Mexico City nightspot. Noise issues seem to be a concern of other reviewers of this hotel because of the two restaurants and bars. I say: mellow out and join the natives. On this last visit to Condesa DF I brought a friend and requested a terrace \"suite\" (room 308 I believe) and was pleasantly surprised that the rooftop restaurant on the floor above us did not bother a bit. Did not need the earplugs which were provided. The only problem was our in-room safe didn't work properly, but that was quickly (within 10 minutes) replaced with a new safe. Everything was perfect!

Subtle details but done really well and they do make a difference to the experience.
