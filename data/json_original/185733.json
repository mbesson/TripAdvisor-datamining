First of all, it is conveniently located in the center of the city. One can easily walk to many great restaurants and main attractions from the hotel. Secondly, the hotel used to be an apartment complex, which was later converted into a hotel. Therefore, the rooms are spacious with large, from floor to ceiling, windows. Another feature which you will most certainly appreciate is the underground garage. But of course, the most important thing of all, is how the hotel's guests are treated. Without any doubt, the hotel personnel prides itself in delivering excellent service. And they sure do deliver! The staff is very pleasant and extremely helpful. The rooms and bathrooms are meticulously clean. Beds are very comfortable, and kitchenettes are modern. We had everything we needed and more. Our last stay fell on the early dates in October, 2011. The room was on the 15th floor with a spectacular view of Mount Royal. Our trip to Montreal that time was significant to my husband and I - we were celebrating our 5-year wedding anniversary. Somehow the manager of the hotel found that out, and arranged for a bottle of champagne and delicious treats along with a heartfelt congratulations note signed by her to be brought up into the room before our arrival. My husband and I were deeply moved by that gesture. As we learned afterwards, such approach is the hotel's common practice.I think they truly strive to make your stay memorable.

It was not particularly hot outside (temperature data on weather.com shows the temperature ranged from 14 to 27 degrees Celsius). It became apparent almost immediately that members of the hotel staff were incompetent and rude. We stayed at the hotel as part of a wedding group, and the staff was supposed to deliver gift bags to our rooms, which they didn't. At the groom's urging, we went downstairs to pick ours up from the front desk. The staffperson there inquired suspiciously as to whether we had just been in our rooms. When we said yes, she muttered that this didn't make sense because the staff had just tried to deliver the bags, so if we'd been in our rooms we should have received ours. Primarily what prompts this review, however, is the hotel's refusal to accept responsibility when it became clear that the maid had thrown out my orthodontic retainers -- which I left drying in the bathroom over the side of a glass. Replacing the retainers thanks to the maid's error will cost me over $700. But getting someone from the hotel to even return my calls, let alone do anything but patronize or BS me, was an ordeal. When I arrived home and began unpacking my things, I realized that the retainers had not been where I left them in the hotel bathroom (dangling over a glass). The maid had rinsed the glasses and turned them upside down, and apparently discarded what was resting on them. I immediately called the hotel and asked them to check if the maids had found my retainers. They transferred me to the voicemail of the \"Executive Housekeeper,\" who did not return my call until 5 days later. I called again the next day, and when the person at the desk answered in what sounded like French, I asked if it would be alright if I spoke English. He snippily said, \"Well I just spoke English, so yes.\" He told me the maids had found nothing, and that the only hotel employees who could tell me whether the hotel had insurance or any other way to compensate me would be out of the office for another 5 days. I was forwarded to the voicemail of one such alleged person, left a message, and waited 5 days, but she didn't call me back either. So after 5 days I called again and spoke with another \"manager\" who purported to know nothing about the hotel's insurance or whether the hotel could reimburse me and said he would need to consult the person whose return call I was still awaiting. Later that day, he called me to say the hotel has no insurance to cover my situation, but that he recommends I investigate whether I have my own insurance that might compensate me. For example, he told me, another hotel manager once had a houseguest whose personal insurance compensated her when a dog ate her shoes. Not helpful. When I asked him to confirm that the hotel has no insurance FOR WHEN EMPLOYEES DESTROY GUESTS' PROPERTY, he confirmed, and told me, irrelevantly, that the hotel's deductible for damage to its own common areas is so high that once upon a time, when a teenage guest opened a fire sprinkler and caused $14K damage to a stairwell, the tour group had to assess each teenager $100 to compensate the hotel. When I pointed out the story's irrelevance, he cut to the chase and tells me the hotel policy is to never cover valuables left in the room outside the safe. I explained that my wet retainer, left drying over a glass in the bathroom, is \"valuable\" to no one but me -- in that respect similar to a wet toothbrush -- and is not like money or electronics that belong in a safe. I also explained that in this case I'm not claiming something was stolen, but that a hotel employee destroyed something. And then he simply became ridiculous, treating me as though I were making a false claim or simply a fool. He asked whether I had inquired about the retainer before checking out. I re-explained my timeline and again noted the irrelevance of his question, as maids are never supposed to throw these things out. He then said, in ultimate double-speak, that he's \"sorry\" about what happened but actually doesn't believe the maid would have discarded the retainers \"because they're trained not to do that, and I'm \"making a serious accusation.\" (Apparently the maids at Hotel du Fort never make mistakes, and saying somebody mistook a retainer for garbage is a \"very serious accusation.\") I told him I'm not fabricating the story and offered to send him a copy of the orthodontic bill. I also explained that even the world's best maid might mistake a clear retainer for garbage. He again said he's \"sorry\" and knows how people \"freak out\" about orthodontia, but while he believes I lost the retainers, he doesn't believe they came to be lost in the way I claim. I tell him it's hardly an apology when the hotel doesn't take any responsibility. Then he resorted to asking if I checked my luggage carefully, and I suggested that instead of going around in circles like this he get back to me after he checks with his alleged manager (the one with the helpful story about the dog) re compensation. He later called to say that the hotel will not reimburse me for my stay because \"there is nothing we can do about it\" (of course there is - they can reimburse me for my stay!), but if I want to come back again, they'll be happy to upgrade me \"at the best rate ever.\" What a joke.

The bed was very comfortable, the room spacious, the bathroom spacious, a microwave and refridgerator in the room added convenience. We had in/out priviledges with our underground parking garage (at the other hotel, it was valet, and you had to plan approximately 15 min. ahead of time, as it was not necessarily parked on premise, plus tipping added to the already higher cost of parking). The staff was great! They were friendly and helpful with any questions. There were no extra costs for anything -- I rec'd a 2 page fax, needed to print out several pages of work, and needed a copy made -- all free of cost, all of which the staff took care of for me personally. No charge for use of the business center for anything if you used it (my thumb drive wasn't recognized for some reason, so staff printed out the work I needed). The location is great! Near restaurants, stores, post office, and Metro stops. This is definitely our \"new\" hotel when in Montreal. Every aspect was pleasant. Oh, the workout facility was great, too! I was sick when we got to Montreal, so I didn't use it, but my husband did, and I had looked at it hoping to use it -- balance balls, BOSU, yoga mats, weights, good cardio equipment, Not a full fitness center, but more than adequate to maintain/improve your fitness while you stay.

First off I will readily admit that the hotel is located close to the scruffier end of Rue Sainte Catherine Ouest near the Atwater Metro Station. However, the areas to the west and south of the hotel (not along Rue Sainte Catherine) are quiet and very nice. Everyone is quick to associate the hotel with Rue Sainte Catherine, but if you walk out of the hotel and instead of turning left towards Rue Sainte Catherine you turn right towards the residential neighborhoods close to the hotel you will find some beautiful homes along some very quiet streets. I especially liked the neighborhoods off of Rue Dorchester Ouest. Also, if you find the Atwater Metro Station not to your liking try the Georges-Vanier Metro Station which is about the same distance from the hotel.

It wasn't the Ritz, but it was more than roomy and comfortable with many amenities that we appreciated. The location is a little to the outside of downtown (but still downtown), and it was easy to reach buses and the subway lines to get us everywhere we wanted to go. We also did the walk to central downtown which took approximately 20 minutes at a leisurely pace. The Hotel included our buffet breakfasts all three mornings of our stay and they were very adequate - plenty of variety to suit all tastes. I must give a shout out to Sabrina at the front desk who exhaustively answered all our myriad questions about the transportation systems and venue locations. She certainly went above and beyond our expectations of front desk staff. Also, Mathieu was very helpful as were the rest of the staff. We discovered a little gem of a restaurant just on the corner from our hotel - a sports bar called 'La Station Des Sports'. Prices here were very reasonable and the portions huge. We traveled to Montreal on the train so did not have to deal with the parking issues as mentioned in previous reviews.

The Montreal Museum of Fine Art is a 10 - 15 minute walk to the end of Rue Du Fort and right at the top of the hill to Sherbrooke. Rue Sainte Catherine which is at the corner and intersects Rue Du Fort offers lots of shops and restaurants as well as a metro stop which is about four blocks from the hotel. The hotel and room were very clean despite the constant grime and sludge the city endures during the winter months. Staff are professional, polite and very helpful and can arrange taxis, help you with directions, arrange sightseeing, etc. I stayed in a 15th floor non-smoking standard room with queen bed. There is a work desk (internet connection for a fee), cozy seating area with table, large screen TV, very clean bathroom, good views and a hideaway kitchenette with a mini fridge and microwave. Because Montreal is an expensive city to visit, this feature helped a lot. Though the hotel serves breakfast in the Hotel du Fort complex for an extra fee, eating breakfast in the room was quick and easy especially since there is a nice clean grocery store on the corner of Sainte Catherine. The room is well appointed with a large mirrored closet with iron, ironing board and safe. Though I was staying there alone, the bathroom was adequately stocked with towels and washcloths and they all smelled fresh and clean like detergent - quite refreshing considering how most hotel linens smell. The bed was comfortable and the long entry way into the room with the closet and kitchenette in the front afford a lot of privacy. I had only two complaints. Noise the first morning from hammering and banging, though I am a late riser so most guests were probably not bothered. There was also random popping or banging noises through the night which I assumed came from the heater which was on the duration of my stay. That with the occasional repetetive door slamming of the neighbors made one day a bit hard to relax. The only other flaw I see with the accommodation is that the hair dryer cord is stapled to the back of the drawer housing the light up vanity mirror. This left little of the cord to reach outside the drawer so I had to bend at an odd angle to try to dry my hair which is both thick and long. This left me frustrated and heading out into the very cold temperatures with damp hair each day. Otherwise, this was a thoroughly pleasant stay and I would highly recommend Hotel Du Fort.

I'd skip the breakfast buffet and go to Tutti Fruitti instead - it's about three blocks away on St. Catherine.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGood, Comfortable Hotel With Some Issues\u201d", "Author": "intrepidtrav", "ReviewID": "UR46891514", "Content": "Stayed at Hotel du Fort Montreal for a one week vacation this past August. The hotel is located on Rue(Street) Fort right off St. Catherine, the main commercial street in the city. Please note that this section of St, Catherine is not the commercial downtown section with all the chic shops and restaurants - rather, the area where the hotel is located is a largely residential, quieter section of Montreal - not a bad thing as you will find many interesting shops and boutiques and reasonably priced restaurants here.The hotel is about 20 minutes walking distance from downtown; there are also three Metro stations within a three to four block radius of the Hotel du Fort (Atwater, Guy Concordia and Georges-Vanier) to get you anywhere in the city you want to go. The Georges-Vanier station is just two stops away from the Central train station for those arriving or leaving Montreal by train. As for the hotel itself, it is a medium-sized residential-style property with large, spacious and quite comfortable rooms with spectacular views of the city especially from the upper floors. The room type I stayed in was the King Signature which had a siiting area with a sofa and lounge chair.A wooden divider with a makeup table, lamp and hair dryer separated this living area from the sleeping area which contained the bed and a small chair. In addition, the room contains a large desk, armoire with a TV and dresser drawers, a large closet, a kitchenette with refrigerator, and a good-sized bathroom. The bathroom was well-appointed with such convieniences as seperate switches for the light and the fan, safety bars in the shower, a non-slip tub floor and a laundry line, features which are not always found in more expensive properties, at least not all in one room. That said, this bathroom had two items which I found rather disappoiting - a very powerful shower with a narrow water jet which was anything but comfortable (and non-adjustable). Also, instead of the usual bottles of toiletries, there were wall dispensers in the shower for shampoo, soap, etc. Perhaps the hotel is trying to be enviromentally freindly but I found this rather cheesy and motel-like for hotel of this caliber. One other observation regarding the room - the website indicates all the rooms have flatscreen TVs - this turns out not to be the case. When I asked the manager on duty about this he said that those TVs are only in the suites. This may be important to some, not so much to others, but I thought I should mention it. Now, to the issues I alluded to in the title of my review. These concern the breakfast and the business center. The breakfast buffet (no ala carte menu available) served in a very elegant room with large picture windows is described on the website as having hot and cold items - in truth, the only hot item every morning was scrambled eggs. The other items were of the continental variety - fruit, pastries, cold cuts juice, coffee. The breakfast was certainly not bad, but for the price $9.95 CAD I did expect a bit more. As to the business center, (located right off the breakfast room) please note that there is only one computer available fro everyone's use. During my stay, I usually had to wait longer than usual to use the computer; this experience culminated one night with several guests inckud- ing myself complaining about one guest hogging the computer for over an hour. To the hotel's everlasting credit, the front desk staff remedied this situation immediatel and removed the offender. Also to their credit, I recently received a letter fron the hotel manager apologiz- ing for my experience in this matter and told me that the computer use policy has since been revised to allow each guest 15 minutes use on said computer, and in addition I was offered a complimentary room upgrade for a future stay. I sincerely hope that this policy will be adher- ed to and respected by all the guests. What this would mean is how much of a priority the use of the business center is to you during your vacation. The front desk staff was very freindly and efficient in all other matters as well. They made me feel very welcome and made many recommendations for my sightseeing, restaurant and transportation needs while in Montreal. In regard to the latter, the concierge can furnish you with an Opus card for $5.00 which is good for unlimited trips on the city's subways and buses. You can refill the card yourself when the encoded value runs out. You must return the card at checkout or you will be charged the $5.00 on your bill. The housekeeping staff were also excellent except for an unknown housekeeper who (with good intentions I'm sure) left my room windows open on the two hottest days of my stay. This was not a big issue though and I let it pass. In summary, the Hotel du Fort is a very pleasant hotel to stay in. Centrally located in a quaint, quiet neighborhood, it has large comfortable rooms, a caring staff and reasonable rates. And if the above issue with the business center are indeed resolved, then the hotel will be even more inviting. P.S. For those of you looking for additional shopping and dining, there is a large shopping mall three blocks from the hotel. It is the Place Alexis-Nihon and contains a McDonalds (good for breakfast and sinfully delicious pastries - believe me on this!), a food court and shops for all your needs, especially the basic things you may need for your trip. It is located atop the Atwater Metro station and across the street from the Pepsi Forum (a huge sports-entertainment complex).", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradenton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Small Apartment - Great Location\u201d", "Author": "FloridaFunAdventurer", "ReviewID": "UR46393920", "Content": "Great time in Montreal.

They had food from around the world. 3 Chinese,1 Japanese,2Italian,1 Indian,1 Thai, 2 Sandwich shops, 1 Lebanese ( Samirs) is great. There were a few others that escape my mind.

The hotel has recently added scrambled eggs (and beans - didn't try those) to the breakfast bar which gives it more variety but it is still not an English/American breakfast. The only slight negative we had was the microwave smelled of popcorn. TV in the room has a fair selection of French/English language channels and a selection of movies.

The staff was very professional and we were even able to check in early. The front desk staff and concierge gave us a lot of great info about restaurants and must-see's in Montreal. On departure, they stored our luggage and called us a taxi ahead of time so we would not have to wait. The rooms are spacious and very clean with a small kitchentte and fridge.

We passed on this since our room had a mini-kitchen with microwave, sink, coffeemaker, and dishes and silverware. There is a well-stocked grocery store almost across the street. Also, there is a newstand and a breakfast/lunch place in the building that is not a part of the hotel. Location is great on the west side of town just off one of the main east/west streets (St. Catherine). Restaurants (bistros, Iranian, Japanese, etc.), groceries, post office, stores, a movie megaplex are all within easy walking distance (less than 2 blocks). There are a lot of colleges and technical schools in the area so there are lots of students thronging the streets. The retail is mixed (not the high end) but neighborhood is very safe to walk around in during the day or evening. Metro (green line) is about 3 blocks in either direction.
