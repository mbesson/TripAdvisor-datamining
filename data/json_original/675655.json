The place was nicely cleaned and had plenty of soap and towels for our use. The AC unit was relatively new and had a remote. It hummed quietly through the night (not awakening us with the fan turning off and on as in some other places). The large TV was not a flat screen, but worked well. Some cable stations were blocked, but we weren't there to watch. The location was excellent and near the beach. The fridge was cold when we got there, and we didn\u2019t try the microwave.

We got luck and got checked in at around 11am on a friday, when we first walked into the room my girlfriend said it smelled a little funny like mold, i said it is a hotel room they usually do smell funny. Later on just sitting around enjoying a drink after my family was asleep i noticed something crawling up the wall, got a closer look and it was a cock roach. After seeing this i went all through the room with a flash light looking for more. found some mold and someones food balled up in the refridge, also the smoke detector was ripped off the wall with wires hanging out. I got mad woke up my girlfriend said pack up we are not staying here with our 2 little boys one 1yrs old and the other 4yrs old. So i went to the offoce to tell someone about what i saw and when i did he smiled and laughed like i was messing around, and believe me i wasnt. I told him he better do something right now or i wanted my money back one way or another. So he gave me keys to another room and i went and looked at it and it smelled worse. I gave the keys to my girlfriend and said you better go over there cause by this point i was fuming. He showed her 3 more rooms before finally the last room smelled good like it had just been cleaned, maybe! After packing and carrying things to the new room i told the guy one more thing i find and we are out of here and i want our money back in full, he said ok. After this our room was ok but found mold in the bathroom on the ceiling about the tub. The whole stay there no one came in to clean, we had to put our garbage out on the the walk way for it to be taken and go around and find someone to ask for towels.

There is a box unit for the AC that is very loud, but it did keep the room cold. The bathroom is small and dated. A few of the lights burned out in the room. There is no way to get the room dark at night because there is a window above the door with no curtain and there are bright lights in the halls. Also the curtain itself didn't close all the way either. My single biggest complaint would have to be that there are no dead bolts on the door. I was really uncomfortable with this lack of security. We didn't have any trouble getting more towels from the front desk, but the owner was not there so maybe that is why. The towels were so small and threadbare that you needed two per person.

We spent the day at the beach (was only 1 block away - the only plus about the trip). After returning we settled into bed. After being startled awake by the fire engine passing by at 3:45 AM, I checked on the kids. I saw a bug crawling near my son's head, so I caught it. I didn't know what it was, so I got on the internet and looked at some pictures. It looked like a bed bug, so I pulled back the sheets and found MORE in the places that the health department website said to look. I took the ones that I caught down to the front desk, and the clerk told me I'd have to wait until the owner got in at 9:15am. I waited until he got there, and showed him what I had found. He accused me of bringing them in and trying to get a free night's stay. He also said his hotel had never had bugs before. This of course, did not make me happy. He offered to have his staff clean the room next door and let us move, but we had to immediately move everything out of that room so he could send an exterminator in. We moved everything out and waited for an hour for the cleaning crew to finish. As soon as we moved out, a man came in with large trash bags and a large white bottle with a hose and sprayer attached. He shut the curtains and locked the door, so I'm assuming he was attempting to kill the bugs.

The sink did not drain until I pulled cigarette butts and a bottle cap out of it. The first night I was there I realized most of the lightbulbs in the room were burned out, when I went to the desk at 9 pm to complain the door was locked and a sign gave an emergancy number. When I went back in the morning the front desk gave me several 40 watt bulbs to put in myself. I have never been so glad to leave a motel in my life.

IT WAS NOT WORTH IT! The room was DISGUSTING. Stains on sheets, pillowcases, and the threadbare rugs. The room was furnished with 2 beds and plastic lawn chairs as their \"plush indoor furnishings.\" Had to kill about 4 or 5 roaches, dirty towels, sink, toilet, and bath - GROSS. AC did not work, lights were dim, and there was a hole in the curtains letting anyone see right in. Confronted management- RUDE and UNHELPFUL...tried to blame us for the condition of the room 20 minutes after we checked in! Was supposed to spend a week at this hotel- it was so bad we checked out after ONE NIGHT. My wife and I thought we could put up with it...but it was too bad to stay there. Maid never came following morning, notified office of need for clean towels...AGAIN rude and unhelpful. That's when we decided to check out. The man at the front desk threatened us and refused to refund our money for our week's stay, and then began personally attacking my wife to me. A very low breed kind of individual. Other guests were also in office complaining, and at least two other couples were checking out. This is a \"rent by the hour\" type of place or at least should be...DEFINATELY not for couples, or families looking for a nice vacation! They had a college kid special posted- Let me tell you, I would not want my son or daughter in this kind of environment. It was close to everything, cheap, and available...HOWEVER, you could not PAY ME TO STAY THERE AGAIN. Please, do yourself a favor and stay ANYWHERE else in OCMD. You'll be saving yourself a lot of trouble and money in the long run!", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sea Cove Motel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d675655-Reviews-Sea_Cove_Motel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$57 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2701 N Baltimore Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "675655", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/95/a0/95a03707ac4bfa303f1958843d7994bb1large.jpg"}}
