Thankfully, the hotel upgraded us to a room with a jacuzzi tub, which we used often to defrost after wandering/getting lost in 20-degree Venice. As many others have noted, the hotel is in art deco style, and there are numerous thoughtful decorating details throughout. I'm not a huge fan of art deco, but there's no denying (and appreciating) this hotel's design. Location was great-- a bridge and short walk to San Marco square. We liked being a bit away from the ground zero of tourism in Venice. Breakfast was also great. Don't be shy about asking for a cappuccino (or two). My only complaint about the hotel was the mattress in the room. When booking, I'd ask for a room with a newer mattress. I'm giving this hotel four stars instead of five only because I'm opposed to grade inflation running rampant on TA, and I like to save a five rating for the truly exceptional. If I return to Venice, I would not hesitate to stay here again, and I would recommend it to friends. Beyond the hotel itself, our favorite restaurant was A Beccafico, where we ate twice. The owner (from Sicily, I believe) is very hands-on and engaged. Dinners started with a small pre-dinner cocktail and amuse bouche. For our second dinner, we needed to eat very early by Italian standards because of our flight departing at 6:00 am the next day. A Beccafico sat us very early (not sure the restaurant was even open), and the owner insisted on a comp'd dessert to end the meal (sorbet in a lemon-- fabulous). Vegetarians (like me) must be prepared to show a bit of flexibility in Venice-- it is a seafood town. The hotel desk will help you make reservations and has good recommendations. Being good tourists, we made our way to Harry's Bar. Overrated. 20 euro tiny martinis-- for a moment I thought I was in NYC (except the martinis would have been bigger). Shopping tips: Giuseppe Biasin, Salizada S. Polo (campo S. Polo) 2094 Venezia, had interesting hand-made etchings-- unique souvenirs that aren't masks! Il Prato, Calle delle Ostreghe, 2456/9 30124 Venezia, had great paper products. Serena Vianello had the best women's hats ever. Campo S. Aponal - San Polo 1226 - 30125 Venezia. (Sorry if I butchered these addresses.) FInally, it can be very expensive to get to the airport. We had to use a private water taxi followed by a van, given the hour our flight left and concern about freezing canals (I can't make that up). The 30-minute transfer, which commenced at 4:30 am, cost 150 euros. This is the only time I felt a bit ripped off in Venice. The hotel arranged this transfer-- I question if there really weren't less expensive options. Anyway, I believe there's a public water taxi to the airport-- just make sure your flight leaves at a reasonable hour so that the taxis are running. They were not at 4:30 am.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hatfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, friendly and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Never-Knowingly", "ReviewID": "UR127123635", "Content": "Ca' Pisani tries to be a little different and it works.

We returned home of an evening to find our bed turned down and 2 chocolates on the pillow, a lovely touch. Tea making facilities on each landin which was fine but milk portions need to be provided,(they did ask for suggestions on this new idea ) Breakfast was buffet style good selection and staff very friendly, concierge were very helpful especially helping us to find somewhere to eat, go for the smaller trattorias as they are cheaper, rather than restaurants, and be aware that a cover charge plus tax is added before you even eat, in most places. We found that if you just want a slice of pizza or a quick drink it is cheaper to stand either at the bar or at the outside window where it is also served and very popular otherwise you pay almost double to sit down. A word of warning if you do go new years eve, a lot of restaurants shut quite early for private parties so you need to book in advance or just eat early. Head to st Marks sq with a bottle of bubbly, very very busy and a fantastic fireworks display.

Since our last stay we have said we will return! Location is perfect in Dorsoduro, if you don't have to much luggage you can walk to from Piazzale Roma and take the cheap bus to/from the airport. Otherwise is the vapporetto to Accademia convenient. I love this spot because it is not so touristic as around the Marcus Square. You find shops and great restaurants such as Avogaria, Lineaombra and Il Gondolieri, just a few minutes waling from the hotel. First is looking like a humble place outside, but inside you get a very special experience. Beautiful and to the point well-decorated common areas and rooms. The rooms has a special funky style and it is very retro. I can't say that the art is typically for Venice, you could have the same style in whatever else city you visit around the Mediterranean. There are so many great features in the room, regarding lightning, air-condition, music and closet. Bathroom is one of the best bathroom I ever experience. Lovely and several amenities in a sparkling Italian tiles bathroom. Huge tub with jacuzzi function and separate shower with a brushy floor so you can't fall as well as good for your feet. I have stayed in both Deluxe room and Junior Suite and I can't really see any difference between these two room types, more than that the Junior Suite is a little bit more roomy. In the deluxe room you have complimentary soft minibar. Venice is an expensive city for hotel rooms but I think you however get a good value here. All floors have an art exhibition ongoing and make the stay a little bit more exciting. Staff at front desk are knowledgeable and service-minded. The hotel is perfect in all way! Ok, you can see it has been 10 years since the hotel opened and maybe they need to look into some updates - you can see that the floor is used and some marks in the bathroom but it is not at all bad or you can get the feeling of decadence. One thing that is very pointed to details is that they have well-maintenance green plants hanging outside all windows. Two things was a little bit annoying this stay. The bellboy was not special friendly, he couldn't find our room so we walked around with him in the corridor (how hard can this be - the hotel is so small). Finally I find my room by myself. (I didn't tip him and after that he was glowering at us at all time. I also find him sitting in the hotels corridor for a while and apparently speak private in a phone, he didn't moved his as so we could get through easier). So get a new bellboy! Breakfast is average and always included. However, I could prefer to have the opportunity to order eggs as I like it. They should work harder to fill up with the items. The breakfast on our check-out day was a catastrophe! Three persons working around, doing totally wrong things. We had to wait for coffee, no hot items this day (it was empty and not re-filled) and when another guest asked for more cherries he got the answer that he need to be patient. He didn't get the berries even if it was visible behind the bar desk. I have to let you know that the breakfast the other day (with other staff) was much better. I mentioned this upon check-out so I sincerely hope they will look into this.

We found the Ca' Pisani consistent with its self-image and its long-standing fine reputation. We chose the Ca' Pisani for our first trip to Venice in large part for two reasons. (1) Location with easy access both to St. Marks and to the museums and other sites along the Grand Canal. (2) The sliding doors in the junior suite which we confirmed in advance would enable us to fully divide the spacious room into two rooms, in case needed to accommodate different sleeping patterns. The location of the hotel turned out to be even better than we imagined, with its convenience to two vaporetto stops on different sides of the island; the vaporetto service, we found, was remarkably reliable and efficient (we quickly learned the value of the seven-day vaporetto passes, the value of having a hotel not adjacent to the water traffic noise, and the advantages of being away from the souvenir stands and crowded pedestrian traffic that confront even the fronts of several luxury hotels near St. Marks). The Ca' Pisani has spacious stairways and halls, tastefully furnished and decorated, with a stylish, welcoming atmosphere. The design matches the website photos, and you can judge in advance the degree to which the art deco style coheres with your personal aesthetic preferences. (I would therefore suggest disregarding that strange critique which challenges Ca' Pisani interior design; also, there was during our stay no front desk clutter and no sign of backpackers.) The Ca' Pisani does not have a cavernous plush lobby, which to some guests may be a shortcoming. Wi-fi is available at no extra charge. My wife and I had one dinner in the hotel restaurant and found it excellent in both food quality and service; we therefore found it curious to see the restaurant typically uncrowded, sometimes empty. On another night, we sat down to order dinner there and, when we suddenly realized we were running late for a concert, we asked the waiter to just put some rolls in a bag for us, so that we could eat at least something while walking. In a few minutes, he gave us, to our surprise, a bag of small hastily made sandwiches, which he was embarrassed to serve (and refused to charge us for), but which were excellent and for us, in our musical emergency, a godsend. As it turned out, the quality of the staff as a whole is a strength of the hotel equal to its location: welcoming, attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, as good or better than we have experienced at similarly rated European hotels--indeed, with the personality, humor, and irony that often are unfortunately absent in the front desk staff of luxury hotels (and without the stiffness or obsequiousness that ARE sometimes found in fine hotels). We received excellent help and advice on numerous details such as shopping (e.g, where to look for fine Italian chocolate) and transportation (e.g., train services and tickets to Padua; but be sure to buy your Scrovegni Chapel tickets well in advance). Our home is near New York City, and we are used to fine restaurants (as well as high restaurant prices). We were therefore delighted to find that the restaurant La Bitta, modest in appearance but with its superb food (and also modest prices) was a short, pleasant walk from the Ca' Pisani. On a less positive note: (1) We found the free-standing shower in our room rather shallow and felt sorry for the maids (who also provided excellent service), who would daily have to clean up the escaped water, along with the soggy towels we used to dry the floor around the shower. We were told later that we had been assigned to the one room in the hotel that was configured, as required by law, for wheelchair shower access. (2) Initially we occasionally found our room a few degrees warmer than we prefer. It turns out that the temperature is controlled at the front desk and we learned to verify each evening, as we returned past the front desk, the temperature setting we prefer (in mid-March, in our case, simply turning the heat entirely off for the night). (3) We requested a quiet room away from the wide, front pedestrian street. Our room was one flight up across a narrow walkway at the rear of the Accademia, but we did find that, when our windows more open, the occasional conversations of passersby were noticeable in the room even from that walkway. Perhaps in a busier season, Ca' Pisani guests may want to be even fussier than we were in the location of a quiet room. We were impressed and pleased with the Ca' Pisani and don't want to exaggerate these concerns, which are included here as a possible aid to readers and future guests.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gorizia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Design Hotel in the heart of Venice\u201d", "Author": "gi013", "ReviewID": "UR101598098", "Content": "C\u00c3\u00a0 Pisani is an elegant and cosy hotel located in one of the best part of Venice.

One being there was no small table by the side of the arm chair in the small seating area so I had to put my drink on the floor. The other thing was the bed was a little too soft and the headboard squeeked every time I turned over. The bed, I presume an art deco original was a little too short for me or maybe it was that I prefer a bed with no board at the foot end, I found I couldn't stretch out. The bed linen was the best I'd ever seen in a hotel, beautiful. The breakfast was very good with everything I could expect and presented well.

She was very helpful with any questions I had before we arrived so if you're going to stay there, I suggest you do the same. I would love to return to Venice again and would definitely stay at the Ca'Pisani again. And if you plan on taking a gondola ride, I recommend doing it at night.

The Bathrooms were spotless and modern complete with hairdryer. The location (across the bridge from all of the \"action\" in Venice, in Dorsoduro, ended up being blissfully perfect. Away from the maddening touristy crowds in a real neighborhood - very close to the amazing Peggy Guggenheim House/museum and easy to get anywhere walking. We heard the sound of accordion music, clicking of heels on the brick walkways, guitar strumming and church bells ringing. The front desk staff was more than accommodating with ur every need including setting up tours. The bar downstairs was a great place to start the evening- but not a place to have dinner. Breakfast buffet was also plentiful with delicious selection of breads, yogurt, cereals, fruit, fresh OJ, and hot eggs and meat with unending coffee. The only drawback (if you could say there is one) is that they do not have their own water \"dock\" because they are not directly on the water (which makes no difference btw).

This romantic feeling was certainly enhanced by the complimentary bottle of champagne that the staff provided on our first evening, which we drank while watching the sun set over Venice. (Yes, really, it was that romantic!) The whole hotel was fantastic; beautifully and stylishly decorated throughout, with friendly, helpful staff. It is very well placed to see all of Venice, with just a two or three minute walk from the Accademia Vaporetto stop. Our room had a large window that opened onto a view of the Venice skyline and that was fantastic enough, but we were also woken each morning by the melodious bells of the nearby Church of Santa Maria...a lovely way to wake up, I can assure you. After the days' sightseeing, we went up to the hotel roof garden to relax on the sun-loungers in the evening sun, serenaded by the church bells and looking out over the city rooftops. As part of Hotel Ca'Pisani, the downstairs La Riviera restaurant serves delicious lunches and a full choice at breakfast. One top tip is to buy a two day/three day/ whatever length of stay pass for the Vaporettoes, you will find it good value for money!

We said we knew it wasn't, the grill was simply hot. (The heating is centrally controlled, which makes sense in an old building with limited scope for air-conditioning).

Ever since it opened a few years ago, however, I've kept an eye on the Ca' Pisani which was the first \"design hotel\" in Venice, and situated in the Dorsoduro area (sestiere) near the Accademia. This trip, staying 8 days, I convinced my husband to take a chance and try the place. We loved it. We enjoyed staying in Dorsoduro and found the place just about perfect for our needs and our tastes. I find the \"opulence\" of everything Venetian gets a little heavy after a while--in a hotel room, at least. Furnishings are often gold embossed or trimmed velvet or damask, usually in dark blue or blood red. After just so much of that I begin to fear that the heavy drapes will fall on me. I like the clean, modern look found in design hotels. Ca' Pisani delivers on clean and design though the look is retro Art Deco rather than modern. That's more than ok with me since Art Nouveau and Art Deco are my real favorite design eras. This place pulls out all the stops on Art Deco. The public rooms and spacious hallways are filled with lovely pieces and some of the \"art\" is designs of art deco furnishings. No expense has been spared to make things look very authentic. Check the hotel pix on the Expedia site (which I think are the ones you get to when you click hotel pictures on this site) and you will see an example of a guest room door with its inlaid multii-colored wood designs. It's that kind of a place. This design theme carries over into the guest rooms. We opted for their standard double. It is not pictured on the Expedia site, being smaller than the rooms shown, but it certainly provided ample space for us and seemed larger than most Venice standard doubles in my experience. The furnishings in our room were also a bit darker and heavier than those shown in the Expedia pix, so if you crave light and airy this may not be the place for you. I'm going to try to attach pictures we took of our room and bathroom to provide some idea of what I'm trying to explain. The bedding was pleasantly modern, light weight, and comfortable. (I would love to have taken the crisp, cool, lineney sheets home with me) The mattresses were firm, very much to our liking. The bathrooms were spotless and kitted out in brownish marble with flecks of sparkles, and beautiful, streamlined art deco plumbing fixtures. Our room had a jacuzzi tub--and a window to let in some light. Actually our room could be very light and airy in spite of the heavy furniture when we opened the lovely--light weight--drapes over the two windows. One faced the mini-palaces on the other side of our street which cuts across the Dorsoduro from the Grand Canal to the wide Canale de Guidecca. The other, amazingly enough showed a view down that street to the Grand Canal where we could see the water traffic traversing it. So, it turns out that we did, after all, have a Grand Canal view, if a bit distant. The young folks at the front desk (I think the average age of the clients of the hotel tends to be younger than many other hotels in Venice) were very helpful, did all the standard things, like getting us dining reservations, arranging a water taxi to the airport, etc, but did so with what seemed to be real concern and interest. They provided excellent suggestions for dining when I had a couple of free spots on my dining card. In fact one of the places, L'Avogaria, tucked away in the Dorsoduro section but an easy walk, was among our top 3 dinners of our trip. The single exception to this cheerful service was the staff in the breakfast room who were helpful and efficient enough, but just a little glum. Breakfasts were buffet style, included in the reasonable rate, and quite ample, good and varied--sliced meat, fruits, cereals, pastries, yogurt, etc. The usual spread, but generously provided. The restaurant serves both in and outside and has snacks during the day and bar service though they do not serve full meals. We enjoyed the Dorsoduro area. It has a slower, less frenetic pace than San Marco, fewer hordes of tourists, almost no pigeons, and even the presence of real Venetians going about their daily lives. There was an elementary school just a little ways down the street from the hotel. The hotel is only a block or so from the Accademia vaporetto stop, so we were able to get easily to all but the most out of the way places. We booked through Booking.com which came out to be about 250 euros average per day for our 8 day stay from late May to early June, though the daily rates varied from 220 to 264 which may have been caused by different rates for days of the week as well as a change of month in the middle of our stay. Whatever, we felt the experience was certainly \"worth it\" and will certainly choose to stay at the Ca' Pisani the next time we're in Venice.

Lastly, in our shower, the odd 'designer' soap dispenser that had no soap in it. We had to call to get it filled with some strange powder. Perhaps this too has changed since... Awkward moment when my wife had to wait in her bathrobe while staff came in to refill the dispenser... These quirks added up to an experience that was a bit strange and off-putting, but I wouldn't expect everybody to have the same experience--perhaps bad luck on our end.

There is no view, our windows opened on the wall of the adjacent building; this is not a disadvantage in the winter when the sun raises late and guarantees a total silence during night; you may sleep there with open windows. Moreover, a canal view is nice, but it comes with the noise and smell of water traffic, which is a pity in a city without cars. Very well equipped bathroom : bubble bath and separate shower; no trace of the flodings mentioned in another ecent review : closing properly the shower door protects you froma private acqua alta. The reception staff is very knowledegeable and helpful, and advises you well on restaurants and shopping. The place has a small restaurant, with reasonably good food and a good selection of wines. The only weak point is the breakfast : service is minimalist, no fresh fruit juice as a standard proposition and the scrambled eggs are kept on a heating device and are overcooked.

The hotel is not brand new but is very clean, but what makes it wonderful and a trully worth stay, is the quality of the service! We received a 5* serivce from the minute we made our booking and got a written reply by the wonderful Franco. He and his team, the guys from the resturant Manieh and Alfredo who were endlesly patient with my very poor Italian! ensured we had a wonderful time. They gave us excellent recomendations every morning on activities, made reservations for us at great restaurants, I could go on forever. Upon our arrival, we had a complimentary bottle of Champagne chilled waiting for us as we had mentioned we were coming for our anniversary, we were trully touched by this gesture. Anyway, the hotel is located in a fabulous area of Venice, near loads of galerias and churches and perfectly close to public transport. There is twice a day a cleaning serivce and a turn down service at night, with delicious chocolates on the pillow and everything! I must confess I did wake up every morning to the chatter of people passing by and the church bells. I think this is very common everywhere in Venice due to the nature of their buildings, our room had extremely high ceilings and hence very large windows, that although double glazed due to the closeness and design of the streets do not isolante the noise entirely...but for us it was not really a problem. I am such a fuzzy person when it comes to the places I stay, I was very pleasently surprised by the Ca pisani and if I return to Venice I intend to pay them another visit.

Breakfast was reasonably good, not a vast selection but certainly enough, and all of very good quality. Probably better than you would expect from a hotel of this size. The location of the hotel is amazing. 10 minute walk to Saint Marks square, but in a slightly quieter area. La Rivista - the hotel's restaurant, is also amazing.

Zattare area is fantastic, we strolled along in the sun eating ice cream it was pure bliss! One word for your arrival into Venice... pay for a water taxi! We got a water bus and it took almost 2 hours! Nightmare or what... thought we would never get off it. We then would have had to transfer to another one to Zattare but decided to walk the 10 mins instead. We got a water taxi back and it was worth the 85 euros as we got back in under 20 minutes.

We decided to visit Venice in December because my husband was shy of keeping his gold travel medallion on our locally-based airline. Going to Venice gave him exactly the 50,000 --not one more or one less-- miles that he needed. I then began checking for a hotel. I thought the reviews for Ca' Pisani here on TripAdvisor were quite good, especially compared with the hotel's price. Also, we'd already taken 7 trips through LuxuryLink , through which we found the hotel listing, and had been pleased with all. Once again, we were not disappointed. First, the hotel is incredibly easy to reach. Just take the airport water bus --12 Euros pp versus 90 Euros per water taxi-- to the end of the line and walk about 2.5 blocks. Second, because it is close to the Accademia bridge, it is easy to reach almost anywhere in Venice by foot (and my husband is 79). Third, it is just enough off the beaten path that there are many good restaurants nearby that cater to the locals as well as serious tourists. Fourth, the rooms are quite nice -- not sheer luxury, but much more than acceptable. The bed was especially comfortable., and there were two TVs with cable . Fifth, the breakfast was more than standard -- warm eggs and bacon as well as the standard meats, fruits, cheeses and rolls; we ate twice in the restaurant -- the 2nd time was better than the first as we knew what to order; however, the first was quite acceptable. Sixth, and perhaps most important, the staff is incredibly helpful. There is someone on duty 24/7 -- something one does not always find in a boutique hotel. We also appreciated the free wifi -- although it did have the bad habit of timing out just as one was in the process of composing a complicated email. We also had a free daily paper. In fact, one thing we liked very much was that we were not constantly \"nickled and dimed.\" Everything was included -- and that included service. No hands held out for payment for delivering luggage or serving meals. How refreshing! My only complaint --and this shows how successful the hotel is overall-- is the light switches. I counted 28 in our room .. and I probably missed a few. FIguring out which switch governed which light took a bit of time. And it took us several minutes to figure out how the controls for wonderful whirlpool bath were operated --- it was only when we found the master switch behind the door that we could get it to work. I am sure we could have called the front desk to ask for directions --but given their emphasis on service, we would have had an in-person visit, and we weren't exactly dressed to receive visitors. As for other items, the rooms were spotless, the water was always hot (we had a junior suite, and the shower was so fantastic that we almost ignored the tub) , the robes --and towels- were deliciously soft, and the toiletries --including shower caps-- were refreshed daily. We would not hesitate to stay at Ca' Pisani again .. and would recommend it to our friends. PS: Mid-December is a wonderful time to visit Venice. The Venice tourist agency indicated that the week before, there were an estimated 42,000 rooms booked in the area; our week (December 10-16) there were fewer than 8,000. We walked right into the \"Behind the Scenes\" tour of the Doges' Palace --during tourist season, one is advised to book between 2 and 6 months ahead; we had no waits at restaurants; we had the churches and museums almost to ourselves (in fact, our Christmas card featured a picture of the nave of Fiari with not an individual in sight). Perhaps we were just lucky as we had no rain (and sun almost every day). The walk platforms were out but not yet in use, and our plastic boots went home unused.

Why was this a problem in a hotel of this quality, when it is possible to go to any inexpensive hotel in the U.S. and be completely confortable so that one may actually sleep well? This hotel had the potential to get a rating of \"excellent\" from me and my husband, except for these two crucial problems: the air-conditioning didn't work very well, and it was somewhat noisy. First, the unit is positioned so that the only cool air that blew into the room (f.y.i.: Room 27!), tended to slip through the door into the closet area (we had a \"superior double\"), instead of circulating in the sleeping area where our bed was (there was absolutely no vent or a/c in the bathroom, so you got this stuffy, steamroom effect if you kept the door closed when showering). When we asked the Manager, who was helpful in every other way, if there was a way to get the a/c down lower, he came into the room and proceeded to tell us that the reason why it seemed warm in there was due to the high humidity in the Venetian air (Hello? We've been living in Mississippi for the last 3 years, people, so I think we're familiar with humidity, and if your a/c works the way it should, you'll be cool, and even cold if you want to be, no matter how muggy and hot it is outside. It was only in the 80's in Venice when we were there anyway). He did offer to change our room, but insisted that the temperature was the same in every room in the hotel. (We later noticed it was cooler in the common areas of the hotel, however.) We did think that this might be the case, that all the rooms were about the same temp, since it is Europe...and since we had already unpacked, and we were absolutely exhausted from pulling the all-nighter, transatlantic flight anyway....we stayed where we were. The a/c unit also produced a light rattling sound, which sometimes would sound as though someone was typing on an old typewriter in an adjacent room (a typing ghost). In retrospect, we should have changed rooms, but I think by the time we figured out that was what we should do, it was almost time to leave. I think the hotel was great in every almost other way. The location was excellent, especially if you wanted to be close to the art museums and St. Mark's square. The breakfast was very nice, especially if you're American, and you enjoy scrambled eggs and sweet cakes, etc. in the morning. The style and the decor of the hotel was particularly remarkable, with an effort to expose some of the traditional features of the building, while decorating in the Futurist style. Our tub set-up left a lot to be desired, though. We had this large piece of immovable glass in the middle of the tub (like a shower door that had been slid into the middle of the track and could not be moved) and you had to climb around that and into the tub to shower. Between that & the very high sides of the tub, I'm not sure whether an elderly person could manage. I personally found it impossible not to get the floor soaked every day.

All requests were met with genuine enthusiasm and friendliness. The location is also ideal as it is in the quieter Dorsoduro just over the Accademia bridge. It's very easy to locate and the neighborhood is less packed with tourists but easily accessible to San Marco and the primary shopping streets.

Marble/limestone tile all around - just amazing. In the reception area, there are one or two computers with free Internet access. Also, the map which the hotel gives out is far superior to any of the other free tourist maps. Just ask the front desk. A few navigational things - we actually got lost walking around looking for the hotel so I'd like to share a few pointers. You can actually access the hotel from two vaporetto stops. If you're travelling through the Grand Canal, you'll need to stop at the \"Accademia\" stop. Once you get off the vaporetto, you should be facing the Gallerie dell'Accedemia with the Accedemia bridge behind you. If you walk to the LEFT of the Galleire dell'Accedemia, and continue along the street, you'll eventually hit Ca' Pisani. Alternatively, you can also get off at the \"Zattere\" stop (which is on the outside of the island) and walk to the right a bit, and then up Rue Antonio Foscarini (I think this is the name of the street that Ca Pisani is on). Some other things - the hotel is in the Dorsodouro area that the hotel is in is nice and quiet, and within walking distance of all major sights (~15 mins walk to Piazza San Marco - just follow the signs).

Love the hotel. Had a standard room- was small but adequate. Bathroom was amazing. Twice a day housekeeping a plus. Staff was lovely- very accommodating. Guys in the restaurant recommended great wines for me while using the computer in the lobby. As to Venice, thourougly enjoyed it. We had a 7 day Venice Card pass, but note that most people got on the water buses without paying. Enjoyed meals in Ai Gondolieri, Cipriani (very posh), and local tratterias- esp. one near the hotel called Zattere I think. Very low key. The gelato near the hotel on the boardwalk was great too. Enjoyed the Caffe Florian - had lunch there our last day- listening to the orchestra- wonderful. Also, we hit Harry's Bar twice- yes, the prices are very high but you know that before you order. After all, it's Harry's. And suggest order the Bellini No.1- it's a bigger version of the regular Bellini with vodka and only 1 euro more. Highly recommend the tour of the Jewish Ghetto, whatever your religion. Doge's Secret Tour was ok, though our guide was good. Had 4 tour books and maps, but got lost everywhere. If I went right, I should have gone left. Interestingly, my daughter had a great sense of direction in Venice. Found some of the shopkeepers rude, but ones in the highend stores- Gucci, Hogan and Chanel were great. Saved a huge amount on shoes in Gucci (If you go, ask for Elena). Also enjoyed finds in small out of the ways places, including two in Canareggio- one called Fantasy Glass had the best hand made jewelry at the best prices. Another, near the water boat stop for Murano (Fond. Nuevo?) run by a woman named Lizette was also a find. Also liked the paper shop near the Guggenheim museum- she had the best prices we found for paper goods. Murano is hokey and a tourist trap but still fun.

First of all, the hotel staff was always pleasnt, friendly, helpful and attentive to our needs. Their smiling faces and welcoming personalities were most appreciated after 12 hours of travel and more than 5,500 miles. The room, or small suite, that we had selected was very nice, clean and quite modern. Like any hotel in Europe, and especially Venice, it has it's quirks. The challenge for the careful traveler is to navigate the quirks and select properties with acceptable idiosyncracies while passing on those that have issues that might drive you to drink! In our case, while this hotel has some quirks, they were seen as almost charming, and never detracted from the experience of our visit. One \"quirk\" in the property was internet connectivity. If you are not an expert at configuring your computer to connect to a fixed IP address, either don't try to \"IM\" your friends from the Ca'Pisani. I'm well above average at making my laptop connect anywhere in the world, and it took me over an hour. The hotel has no lobby to speak of, so if you like to lounge in a lovely lobby, this is not the hotel for you. Ditto the restaurant which was the BIGGEST ripoff in all of our two year travels in Italy. That all being said, the rooms, baths, beds and other elements critical to a nice hotel visit are more than acceptable. The location, about 1000 feet from the Academy Bridge and in a nice neighborhood, is great. It's about a 15 minute walk to San Marco (St. Mark's), and there is much to see and do in the delightful walk. We traveled it many times in our three days at Ca'Pisani and always had fun.

One lady was extremely rude to me when I asked for tea and coffee at breakfast time telling me I must not bother her and someone else would come to take the order (my husband went to ask someone else in the end). The most ridiculous thing however was that we were not 'allowed' friends up to the room without ID. Told a credit card would be ok as ID, friends produced them next time and were told that actually they needed their passports!
