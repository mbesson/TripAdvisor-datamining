Checked in with Doug in AM.. very nice guy, friendly...great suggestions for shopping, entertainment, food. Room was comfy, clean, and Doug doted on us just enough to be helpful, yet not intrusive. Facility was really really well laid out, private, and beautiful setting. Hot tub was a gem... clean and relaxing... A more mature crowd than expected, but we were fine with that. We understood and followed all the rules. And understand Arizona laws... We would just like to offer 2 small wishes to ensure another stay at the property. 1. Pool had to be under 70 degrees. Unswimmable for us. Most public heated pools are kept at a minimum of 80 degrees. Vacation without a pool left us sitting longer in the hot tub. Not ideal for what we would have liked. Asked a few other guests their thoughts. Two agreed with us and said they would pay more per night for an 80 degree pool, while the other said he would rather have the lower price if that was the choice. Add us to the list of guests who would offer to pay more for pool heat, and although not scientific at all, may mean happier guests, and/or more of them. 2. Turning the heat off in the hot tub at 11:30pm... Again we understand the rules and laws and have no intent of breaking them. But to come home to a cold hot tub at Midnight or after the bar, when sitting in the tub would be a perfect end to an adult evening... seemed overboard protective to us. Again, if money or security are the issues, we would welcome security cams, and/or a security guard during busiest times or nights. Perhaps we are a bit idealistic, but our simple request is to punish those who break the rules, not everyone else who abides by them. Again... we truly love the property and want to return... Thank you to Doug for your dedication to us as your guests. We like the property enough to be honest, and enough to offer to pay more for the amenities we know cost more to offer. I would also add that a simple continental breakfast would offer social and nice extra perk, or even a Saturday eve happy hour social. But of all mentioned here, we could do without it just the same.

It was a beautiful weekend in October and the pool was never crowded as I thought it could possibly be as they offer day passes. It was never a \u201cscene\u201d, but a relaxing space to enjoy a clothing optional environment - which is why I chose to try it out. Simply put, I\u2019ll stay there again when I get back to Phoenix, I recommend it and hope you have a great time!!", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "IL", "Title": "\u201cSuch a relaxing place to stay\u201d", "Author": "JPSUDS143", "ReviewID": "UR19033200", "Content": "We stayed at the Arizona Royal Villa Resort for 2 weeks and I must say that it was well worth the price. The rooms are clean and the staff is very helpful. We got great advice on where to go shopping to save some money on food, since they offer some rooms that you can cook in. Makes it feel like home for those that like to stay in and cook rather than spend extra money everyday on eating out. Plus the staff made sure that we were comfortable and to ask if we needed anything. Had the Laptop with us for use on there Network and was really happy that we could plan a road trip online. I would stay here again no questions asked. The jacuzzi was great. They have a waterfall that takes all the tension away and the pool is chilled so that you can get some relief from the summer sun. The temps there in Aug were 103F -113F that was perfect for us.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cHotel Policy\u201d", "Author": "workandplay1", "ReviewID": "UR16433159", "Content": "For Memorial Day Weekend, I wanted to get away from home and decided to book a room at the Royal Villa. I went online and placed a reservation via their website. Nothing else happened, no follow up email or phone call, nothing. I thought that I had better follow up and call the hotel directly myself, but was told that they didn't have my reservation but do have rooms available so I proceeded to make a reservation. As I was giving the gentleman my information, he asked for my phone number. I gave it to him, he replied, \"do you live in Phoenix?\" I answered yes and he said that he could not allow me to stay there. I asked him why and all I was told is that the owners do not allow locals to stay at the hotel. But they do allow day passes to locals. I was totally confused and bewildered by this. I can understand that maybe in the past the hotel has had problems with locals, but give me a break. I will definately not recommend a place that can not even support its local gay community.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "scott60606", "ReviewID": "UR14634037", "Content": "Nice place, overall. I've never been to it before and have never been to the other property (before they bought this one). Was impressed. Better than I thought it would be. Room was clean and comfortable. I liked the fact it had a full kitchen (but no dishwasher). Since I dont wash dishes (especially when on vacation). I bought paper plates and plastic silverware from the grocery store which worked just fine. I liked the small area outside the room to sit down and relax. All rooms face the pool. Pool and hot tub were superb! Nice good looking guys hanging out by the pool. Mainly guys in their 30's and 40's. A couple guys a little older but mainly 30s-40's. All guests were pretty friendly. You can sun/swim nude by the pool which I took advantage of. Very nice! To the management: the only thing I would like to see different is MORE palm trees on the property. I only saw two. To vacationers like me from the North: Palm trees = relaxing vacations.
