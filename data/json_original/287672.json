{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not even half as good as seen on the website The stay in Hostal d'Uxelles was very disappoiting. First we didn't even find the location because there was no seperate entry. The Hostal is situated in a normal building what makes it hard to find it. In fact, it is only a large apartment that has been transformed into a hotel. Our room was small and dim and the washroom apparently had simply been integrated in it. The walls were very thin, the beds weren't comfortable at all and the breakfast that was supposed to be available didn't exist. Besides only one person could have a warm shower because the water gets cold very quickly. After all I can't recommend to stay in this location.

Staff pretended not to understand English OR French for the lights are broken in order to evade fixing our bedside and balcony lights. The balcony chairs were rusty and crumbling. The room was absolutely filthy - we lived out of our cases rather than use the wardrobe which was covered in a layer of grit and dust (as was the floor and the chairs. Our main problem though was the staff - as soon as they had our cash, they were ignorant, rude, and hostile.

It was on the second floor and not very silent: for example, you could hear the traffic and also the noise form the people coming out of the bar in same building. However, the worst noise seemed to come from the water pipes, I guess it was due to someone else in the hostal or building having a shower (early in the morning).The bed was horrible. It was very short (I am 1,91 tall) so my feet stuck out, although I am used to that when staying in Spanish hostels. However, the worst thing was that the bed was very soft, so it was difficult to find a good sleeping position. And the bed made a lot of noise when you tried to change your position. As I tried it a lot of times, the bed made a lot of noise and my wife got angry with me.I also found that the general standard was very low for a room costing more than EUR 95 for one night (double room, high season rate) (although I have the feeling that Barcelona is generally expensive when it comes to lodging).

We are fairly self sufficient and were not expecting luxury but did think there would be some charm to the place. On arriving on the airport bus at Placa Catalunya we walked the 10 minutes or so to the hotel. It was very quiet as the Grand Prix was on and it was a Sunday morning. Getting robbed by two men posing as police who suspected that the 'italian tourist' who approached us was a drug dealer, was a real upset. On checking our money after they had been through it we found 150euros missing. On arriving at the hotel, it was difficult to find as it was upstairs in a block. Reception were efficient enough but not very friendly and throughout our stay, most staff barely managed an 'ola'. When we asked about a police station to report our loss on arrival, shoulders were shrugged and we had to go to Tourist Information. Our room was very basic with the minute TV 8 feet in the air. We don't watch much TV so weren't too bothered but if you do like to watch, take a pair of binoculars. The room was very plain with a tiny bathroom and even tinier bath, although it did have quite a bit of character. However, on my having a bath that evening we found there was no hot water at all for a second bath/shower for my husband. Reception were totally unconcerned and said it would be fixed 'maybe tomorrow, maybe not'. They seemed to think it strange that we were even bothering to tell them about it. Water did actually run hot later that night, so it was ok in the end but the attitude rankled a bit. Traffic noise, funnily enough, was not a great problem although it is a very busy road traffic wise. We stayed six nights and generally it was ok but might be a problem for light sleepers. The road is quiet at night in terms of pedestrians about and this worried us given our encounter on arrival. The location was ok but not the best. For 75 euros plus tax per night, we think there must be better places to stay with more character and friendlier staff. A colleague recently stayed at the Jardi and said that was really nice. All in all, find somewhere else and look after your money. We are very careful always about pickpockets and bagsnatchers but when faced with two burly men on a quiet street, you don't feel able to object in case you are physically attacked. The telegraph is usually quite reliable for reviews (the Brouwer in Amsterdam was great) but we will be wary of them in the future.", "Date": "May 25, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR301063034", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ostrich"}, {"Content": "Above average 2 star hotel We spent 3 nights at the Hostal D'Uxelles from 14-17th March 2004.
